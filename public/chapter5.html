<h3>DETERMINING THE SENTENCE</h3>
<h5>Introductory Commentary</h5>
<p>For certain categories of offenses and offenders, the guidelines permit the court to imposeeither imprisonment or some other sanction or combination of sanctions. In determining the type of sentence to impose, the sentencing judge should consider the nature and seriousness ofthe conduct, the statutory purposes of sentencing, and the pertinent offender characteristics.</p>
<p>A sentence is within the guidelines if it complies with each applicable section of this chapter.</p>
<p>The court should impose a sentence sufficient, but not greater than necessary, to comply with the statutory purposes of sentencing. 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a).</p>

ACommentary to Sentencing TableApplication Notes:1. The Offense Level (1–43) forms the vertical axis of the Sentencing Table. The CriminalHistory Category (I–VI) forms the horizontal axis of the Table. The intersection of the Offense Level and Criminal History Category displays the Guideline Range in months ofimprisonment. “Life” means life imprisonment. For example, the guideline range applicable to a defendant with an Offense Level of 15 and a Criminal History Category of IIIis 24–30 months of imprisonment.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><p>In rare cases, a total offense level of less than 1 or more than 43 may result from application of the guidelines. A total offense level of less than 1 is to be treated as an offenselevel of 1. An offense level of more than 43 is to be treated as an offense level of 43.</p></li>
<li><p>The Criminal History Category is determined by the total criminal history points fromChapter Four, Part A, except as provided in §§4B1.1 (Career Offender) and 4B1.4 (ArmedCareer Criminal). The total criminal history points associated with each Criminal History Category are shown under each Criminal History Category in the Sentencing Table.</p></li>

<p>§5B1.1PART B ― PROBATIONIntroductory CommentaryThe Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984 makes probation a sentence in and ofitself. 18 U.S.C. § 3561. Probation may be used as an alternative to incarceration, providedthat the terms and conditions of probation can be fashioned so as to meet fully the statutorypurposes of sentencing, including promoting respect for law, providing just punishment for the offense, achieving general deterrence, and protecting the public from further crimes by the defendant.</p>

<p>Effective November 1, 1987.</p>
<p>§5B1.1. Imposition of a Term of Probation(a) Subject to the statutory restrictions in subsection (b) below, a sentence of probation is authorized if:(1) the applicable guideline range is in Zone A of the SentencingTable; or(2) the applicable guideline range is in Zone B of the SentencingTable and the court imposes a condition or combination of conditions requiring intermittent confinement, community confinement, or home detention as provided in subsection ©(3) of§5C1.1 (Imposition of a Term of Imprisonment).</p>
<p>(b) A sentence of probation may not be imposed in the event:(1) the offense of conviction is a Class A or B felony, 18 U.S.C.</p>
<p>§ 3561(a)(1);(2) the offense of conviction expressly precludes probation as a sentence, 18 U.S.C. § 3561(a)(2);(3) the defendant is sentenced at the same time to a sentence ofimprisonment for the same or a different offense, 18 U.S.C.</p>
<p>§ 3561(a)(3).</p>
<p>CommentaryApplication Notes:1. Except where prohibited by statute or by the guideline applicable to the offense in Chapter Two, the guidelines authorize, but do not require, a sentence of probation in the following circumstances:§5B1.2(A) Where the applicable guideline range is in Zone A of the Sentencing Table(i.e., the minimum term of imprisonment specified in the applicable guideline range is zero months). In such cases, a condition requiring a period of community confinement, home detention, or intermittent confinement may be imposedbut is not required.</p>
<p>(B) Where the applicable guideline range is in Zone B of the Sentencing Table(i.e., the minimum term of imprisonment specified in the applicable guideline range is at least one but not more than nine months). In such cases, the court may impose probation only if it imposes a condition or combination of conditions requiring a period of community confinement, home detention, or intermittentconfinement sufficient to satisfy the minimum term of imprisonment specified inthe guideline range. For example, where the offense level is 7 and the criminal history category is II, the guideline range from the Sentencing Table is 2–8 months. In such a case, the court may impose a sentence of probation only if it imposes a condition or conditions requiring at least two months of community confinement, homedetention, or intermittent confinement, or a combination of community confinement, home detention, and intermittent confinement totaling at least two months.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Where the applicable guideline range is in Zone C or D of the Sentencing Table (i.e., the minimum term of imprisonment specified in the applicable guideline range is ten monthsor more), the guidelines do not authorize a sentence of probation. See §5C1.1 (Impositionof a Term of Imprisonment).</li>
</ol>
<p>Background: This section provides for the imposition of a sentence of probation. The courtmay sentence a defendant to a term of probation in any case unless (1) prohibited by statute, or (2) where a term of imprisonment is required under §5C1.1 (Imposition of a Term of Imprisonment). Under 18 U.S.C. § 3561(a)(3), the imposition of a sentence of probation is prohibitedwhere the defendant is sentenced at the same time to a sentence of imprisonment for the sameor a different offense. Although this provision has effectively abolished the use of “split sentences” imposable pursuant to the former 18 U.S.C. § 3651, the drafters of the Sentencing Reform Act noted that the functional equivalent of the split sentence could be “achieved by a moredirect and logically consistent route” by providing that a defendant serve a term of imprisonment followed by a period of supervised release. (S. Rep. No. 225, 98th Cong., 1st Sess. 89(1983)). Section 5B1.1(a)(2) provides a transition between the circumstances under which a “straight” probationary term is authorized and those where probation is prohibited.</p>

<p>§5B1.2. Term of Probation(a) When probation is imposed, the term shall be:(1) at least one year but not more than five years if the offenselevel is 6 or greater;(2) no more than three years in any other case.</p>
<p>§5B1.3CommentaryBackground: This section governs the length of a term of probation. Subject to statutory restrictions, the guidelines provide that a term of probation may not exceed three years if the offense level is less than 6. If a defendant has an offense level of 6 or greater, the guidelinesprovide that a term of probation be at least one year but not more than five years. Althoughsome distinction in the length of a term of probation is warranted based on the circumstancesof the case, a term of probation may also be used to enforce conditions such as fine or restitutionpayments, or attendance in a program of treatment such as drug rehabilitation. Often, it maynot be possible to determine the amount of time required for the satisfaction of such paymentsor programs in advance. This issue has been resolved by setting forth two broad ranges for the duration of a term of probation depending upon the offense level. Within the guidelines setforth in this section, the determination of the length of a term of probation is within the discretion of the sentencing judge.</p>

<p>§5C1.1PART C ― IMPRISONMENT§5C1.1. Imposition of a Term of Imprisonment(a) A sentence conforms with the guidelines for imprisonment if it is within the minimum and maximum terms of the applicable guideline range.</p>
<p>(b) If the applicable guideline range is in Zone A of the Sentencing Table, a sentence of imprisonment is not required, unless the applicable guideline in Chapter Two expressly requires such a term.</p>
<p>© If the applicable guideline range is in Zone B of the Sentencing Table, the minimum term may be satisfied by—(1) a sentence of imprisonment; or(2) a sentence of imprisonment that includes a term of supervisedrelease with a condition that substitutes community confinement or home detention according to the schedule in subsection(e), provided that at least one month is satisfied by imprisonment; or(3) a sentence of probation that includes a condition or combination of conditions that substitute intermittent confinement, community confinement, or home detention for imprisonmentaccording to the schedule in subsection (e).</p>
<p>(d) If the applicable guideline range is in Zone C of the Sentencing Table, the minimum term may be satisfied by—(1) a sentence of imprisonment; or(2) a sentence of imprisonment that includes a term of supervisedrelease with a condition that substitutes community confinement or home detention according to the schedule in subsection(e), provided that at least one-half of the minimum term is satisfied by imprisonment.</p>
<p>(e) Schedule of Substitute Punishments:(1) One day of intermittent confinement in prison or jail for oneday of imprisonment (each 24 hours of confinement is creditedas one day of intermittent confinement, provided, however, that one day shall be credited for any calendar day during§5C1.1which the defendant is employed in the community and confined during all remaining hours);(2) One day of community confinement (residence in a communitytreatment center, halfway house, or similar residential facility)for one day of imprisonment;(3) One day of home detention for one day of imprisonment.</p>
<p>(f) If the applicable guideline range is in Zone D of the Sentencing Table, the minimum term shall be satisfied by a sentence of imprisonment.</p>
<p>CommentaryApplication Notes:1. Subsection (a) provides that a sentence conforms with the guidelines for imprisonment ifit is within the minimum and maximum terms of the applicable guideline range specifiedin the Sentencing Table in Part A of this Chapter. For example, if the defendant has anOffense Level of 20 and a Criminal History Category of I, the applicable guideline rangeis 33–41 months of imprisonment. Therefore, a sentence of imprisonment of at leastthirty-three months, but not more than forty-one months, is within the applicable guideline range.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><p>Subsection (b) provides that where the applicable guideline range is in Zone A of the Sentencing Table (i.e., the minimum term of imprisonment specified in the applicableguideline range is zero months), the court is not required to impose a sentence of imprisonment unless a sentence of imprisonment or its equivalent is specifically required bythe guideline applicable to the offense. Where imprisonment is not required, the court, for example, may impose a sentence of probation. In some cases, a fine appropriately maybe imposed as the sole sanction.</p></li>
<li><p>Subsection © provides that where the applicable guideline range is in Zone B of the Sentencing Table (i.e., the minimum term of imprisonment specified in the applicableguideline range is at least one but not more than nine months), the court has three options:(A) It may impose a sentence of imprisonment.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>(B) It may impose a sentence of probation provided that it includes a condition of probation requiring a period of intermittent confinement, community confinement, orhome detention, or combination of intermittent confinement, community confinement, and home detention, sufficient to satisfy the minimum period of imprisonment specified in the guideline range. For example, where the guideline range is 4–10 months, a sentence of probation with a condition requiring at least fourmonths of intermittent confinement, community confinement, or home detentionwould satisfy the minimum term of imprisonment specified in the guideline range.</p>
<p>© Or, it may impose a sentence of imprisonment that includes a term of supervisedrelease with a condition that requires community confinement or home detention.</p>
<p>In such case, at least one month must be satisfied by actual imprisonment and the remainder of the minimum term specified in the guideline range must be satisfied§5C1.1by community confinement or home detention. For example, where the guidelinerange is 4–10 months, a sentence of imprisonment of one month followed by a termof supervised release with a condition requiring three months of community confinement or home detention would satisfy the minimum term of imprisonment specified in the guideline range.</p>
<p>The preceding examples illustrate sentences that satisfy the minimum term of imprisonment required by the guideline range. The court, of course, may impose a sentence at a higher point within the applicable guideline range. For example, where the guidelinerange is 4–10 months, both a sentence of probation with a condition requiring six monthsof community confinement or home detention (under subsection ©(3)) and a sentence oftwo months imprisonment followed by a term of supervised release with a condition requiring four months of community confinement or home detention (under subsection ©(2)) would be within the guideline range.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Subsection (d) provides that where the applicable guideline range is in Zone C of the Sentencing Table (i.e., the minimum term specified in the applicable guideline range is ten or twelve months), the court has two options:(A) It may impose a sentence of imprisonment.</li>
</ol>
<p>(B) Or, it may impose a sentence of imprisonment that includes a term of supervisedrelease with a condition requiring community confinement or home detention. In such case, at least one-half of the minimum term specified in the guideline rangemust be satisfied by imprisonment, and the remainder of the minimum term specified in the guideline range must be satisfied by community confinement or homedetention. For example, where the guideline range is 10–16 months, a sentence offive months imprisonment followed by a term of supervised release with a conditionrequiring five months community confinement or home detention would satisfy the minimum term of imprisonment required by the guideline range.</p>
<p>The preceding example illustrates a sentence that satisfies the minimum term of imprisonment required by the guideline range. The court, of course, may impose a sentence ata higher point within the guideline range. For example, where the guideline range is 10–16 months, both a sentence of five months imprisonment followed by a term of supervised release with a condition requiring six months of community confinement or homedetention (under subsection (d)), and a sentence of ten months imprisonment followed bya term of supervised release with a condition requiring four months of community confinement or home detention (also under subsection (d)) would be within the guidelinerange.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li><p>Subsection (e) sets forth a schedule of imprisonment substitutes.</p></li>
<li><p>There may be cases in which a departure from the sentencing options authorized for Zone C of the Sentencing Table (under which at least half the minimum term must besatisfied by imprisonment) to the sentencing options authorized for Zone B of the Sentencing Table (under which all or most of the minimum term may be satisfied by intermittent confinement, community confinement, or home detention instead of imprisonment) is appropriate to accomplish a specific treatment purpose. Such a departure shouldbe considered only in cases where the court finds that (A) the defendant is an abuser ofnarcotics, other controlled substances, or alcohol, or suffers from a significant mentalillness, and (B) the defendant’s criminality is related to the treatment problem to be addressed.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>§5C1.2In determining whether such a departure is appropriate, the court should consider, among other things, (1) the likelihood that completion of the treatment program will successfully address the treatment problem, thereby reducing the risk to the public fromfurther crimes of the defendant, and (2) whether imposition of less imprisonment than required by Zone C will increase the risk to the public from further crimes of the defendant.</p>
<p>Examples: The following examples both assume the applicable guideline range is 12–18 months and the court departs in accordance with this application note. Under ZoneC rules, the defendant must be sentenced to at least six months imprisonment. (1) Thedefendant is a nonviolent drug offender in Criminal History Category I and probation is not prohibited by statute. The court departs downward to impose a sentence of probation, with twelve months of intermittent confinement, community confinement, or home detention and participation in a substance abuse treatment program as conditions of probation. (2) The defendant is convicted of a Class A or B felony, so probation is prohibitedby statute (see §5B1.1(b)). The court departs downward to impose a sentence of one monthimprisonment, with eleven months in community confinement or home detention andparticipation in a substance abuse treatment program as conditions of supervised release.</p>
<ol start="7">
<li><p>The use of substitutes for imprisonment as provided in subsections © and (d) is not recommended for most defendants with a criminal history category of III or above.</p></li>
<li><p>In a case in which community confinement in a residential treatment program is imposedto accomplish a specific treatment purpose, the court should consider the effectiveness ofthe residential treatment program.</p></li>
<li><p>Subsection (f) provides that, where the applicable guideline range is in Zone D of the Sentencing Table (i.e., the minimum term of imprisonment specified in the applicableguideline range is 15 months or more), the minimum term must be satisfied by a sentenceof imprisonment without the use of any of the imprisonment substitutes in subsection (e).</p></li>

<p>(b) In the case of a defendant (1) who meets the criteria set forth insubsection (a); and (2) for whom the statutorily required minimumsentence is at least five years, the offense level applicable fromChapters Two (Offense Conduct) and Three (Adjustments) shall benot less than level 17.</p>
<p>CommentaryApplication Notes:1. “More than 1 criminal history point, as determined under the sentencing guidelines,” as used in subsection (a)(1), means more than one criminal history point as determined under §4A1.1 (Criminal History Category) before application of subsection (b) of§4A1.3 (Departures Based on Inadequacy of Criminal History Category).</p>

</ol>
<p>§5C1.24. Consistent with §1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct), the term “defendant,” as used in subsection(a)(2), limits the accountability of the defendant to his own conduct and conduct that heaided or abetted, counseled, commanded, induced, procured, or willfully caused.</p>

<li><p>“Engaged in a continuing criminal enterprise,” as used in subsection (a)(4), is defined in 21 U.S.C. § 848©. As a practical matter, it should not be necessary to apply this prong of subsection (a)(4) because (i) this section does not apply to a conviction under21 U.S.C. § 848, and (ii) any defendant who “engaged in a continuing criminal enterprise”but is convicted of an offense to which this section applies will be an “organizer, leader, manager, or supervisor of others in the offense.”7.

<p>§5D1.1PART D ― SUPERVISED RELEASE§5D1.1. Imposition of a Term of Supervised Release(a) The court shall order a term of supervised release to follow imprisonment—(1) when required by statute (see 18 U.S.C. § 3583(a)); or(2) except as provided in subsection ©, when a sentence of imprisonment of more than one year is imposed.</p>
<p>(b) The court may order a term of supervised release to follow imprisonment in any other case. See 18 U.S.C. § 3583(a).</p>
<p>© The court ordinarily should not impose a term of supervised releasein a case in which supervised release is not required by statute andthe defendant is a deportable alien who likely will be deported afterimprisonment.</p>
<p>CommentaryApplication Notes:1. Application of Subsection (a).—Under subsection (a), the court is required to imposea term of supervised release to follow imprisonment when supervised release is requiredby statute or, except as provided in subsection ©, when a sentence of imprisonment ofmore than one year is imposed. The court may depart from this guideline and not imposea term of supervised release if supervised release is not required by statute and the courtdetermines, after considering the factors set forth in Note 3, that supervised release is not necessary.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><p>Application of Subsection (b).—Under subsection (b), the court may impose a term ofsupervised release to follow a term of imprisonment in any other case, after consideringthe factors set forth in Note 3.</p></li>
<li><p>Factors to Be Considered.—(A) Statutory Factors.—In determining whether to impose a term of supervised release, the court is required by statute to consider, among other factors:(i) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant;(ii) the need to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct, to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant, and to provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training, medical care, or other correctionaltreatment in the most effective manner;(iii) the need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities among defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of similar conduct; and§5D1.2(iv) the need to provide restitution to any victims of the offense.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>See 18 U.S.C. § 3583©.</p>
<p>(B) Criminal History.—The court should give particular consideration to the defendant’s criminal history (which is one aspect of the “history and characteristics of the defendant” in subparagraph (A)(i), above). In general, the more serious the defendant’s criminal history, the greater the need for supervised release.</p>
<p>© Substance Abuse.—In a case in which a defendant sentenced to imprisonment is an abuser of controlled substances or alcohol, it is highly recommended that a termof supervised release also be imposed. See §5H1.4 (Physical Condition, IncludingDrug or Alcohol Dependence or Abuse; Gambling Addiction).</p>
<p>(D) Domestic Violence.—If the defendant is convicted for the first time of a domesticviolence crime as defined in 18 U.S.C. § 3561(b), a term of supervised release is required by statute. See 18 U.S.C. § 3583(a). Such a defendant is also required bystatute to attend an approved rehabilitation program, if available within a 50-mileradius of the legal residence of the defendant. See 18 U.S.C. § 3583(d); §5D1.3(a)(3).</p>
<p>In any other case involving domestic violence or stalking in which the defendant is sentenced to imprisonment, it is highly recommended that a term of supervisedrelease also be imposed.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><p>Community Confinement or Home Detention Following Imprisonment.—A termof supervised release must be imposed if the court wishes to impose a “split sentence”under which the defendant serves a term of imprisonment followed by a period of community confinement or home detention pursuant to subsection ©(2) or (d)(2) of §5C1.1(Imposition of a Term of Imprisonment). In such a case, the period of community confinement or home detention is imposed as a condition of supervised release.</p></li>
<li><p>Application of Subsection ©.—In a case in which the defendant is a deportable alienspecified in subsection © and supervised release is not required by statute, the courtordinarily should not impose a term of supervised release. Unless such a defendant legally returns to the United States, supervised release is unnecessary. If such a defendantillegally returns to the United States, the need to afford adequate deterrence and protectthe public ordinarily is adequately served by a new prosecution. The court should, however, consider imposing a term of supervised release on such a defendant if the courtdetermines it would provide an added measure of deterrence and protection based on the facts and circumstances of a particular case.</p></li>

<p>§5D1.2. Term of Supervised Release(a) Except as provided in subsections (b) and ©, if a term of supervisedrelease is ordered, the length of the term shall be:§5D1.2(1) At least two years but not more than five years for a defendantconvicted of a Class A or B felony. See 18 U.S.C. § 3583(b)(1).</p>
<p>(2) At least one year but not more than three years for a defendantconvicted of a Class C or D felony. See 18 U.S.C. § 3583(b)(2).</p>

<p>(b) Notwithstanding subdivisions (a)(1) through (3), the length of the termof supervised release shall be not less than the minimum term of yearsspecified for the offense under subdivisions (a)(1) through (3) and maybe up to life, if the offense is—(1) any offense listed in 18 U.S.C. § 2332b(g)(5)(B), the commission ofwhich resulted in, or created a foreseeable risk of, death or seriousbodily injury to another person; or(2) a sex offense.</p>
<p>(Policy Statement) If the instant offense of conviction is a sex offense, however, the statutory maximum term of supervised release is recommended.</p>
<p>© The term of supervised release imposed shall be not less than any statutorily required term of supervised release.</p>
<p>CommentaryApplication Notes:1. Definitions.—For purposes of this guideline:“Sex offense” means (A) an offense, perpetrated against a minor, under (i) chapter 109Aof title 18, United States Code; (ii) chapter 110 of such title, not including a recordkeepingoffense; (iii) chapter 117 of such title, not including transmitting information about a minor or filing a factual statement about an alien individual; (iv) an offense under18 U.S.C. § 1201; or (v) an offense under 18 U.S.C. § 1591; or (B) an attempt or a conspiracy to commit any offense described in subdivisions (A)(i) through (v) of this note. Suchterm does not include an offense under 18 U.S.C. § 2250 (Failure to register).</p>
<p>“Minor” means (A) an individual who had not attained the age of 18 years; (B) an individual, whether fictitious or not, who a law enforcement officer represented to a participant (i) had not attained the age of 18 years; and (ii) could be provided for the purposesof engaging in sexually explicit conduct; or © an undercover law enforcement officer whorepresented to a participant that the officer had not attained the age of 18 years.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Safety Valve Cases.—A defendant who qualifies under §5C1.2 (Limitation on Applicability of Statutory Minimum Sentence in Certain Cases) is not subject to any statutoryminimum sentence of supervised release. See 18 U.S.C. § 3553(f). In such a case, the termof supervised release shall be determined under subsection (a).</li>
</ol>
<p>§5D1.23. Substantial Assistance Cases.—Upon motion of the Government, a defendant who hasprovided substantial assistance in the investigation or prosecution of another person whohas committed an offense may be sentenced to a term of supervised release that is lessthan any minimum required by statute or the guidelines. See 18 U.S.C. § 3553(e), §5K1.1(Substantial Assistance to Authorities).</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><p>Factors Considered.—The factors to be considered in determining the length of a termof supervised release are the same as the factors considered in determining whether toimpose such a term. See 18 U.S.C. § 3583©; Application Note 3 to §5D1.1 (Imposition ofa Term of Supervised Release). The court should ensure that the term imposed on the defendant is long enough to address the purposes of imposing supervised release on the defendant.</p></li>
<li><p>Early Termination and Extension.—The court has authority to terminate or extenda term of supervised release. See 18 U.S.C. § 3583(e)(1), (2). The court is encouraged toexercise this authority in appropriate cases. The prospect of exercising this authority is a factor the court may wish to consider in determining the length of a term of supervisedrelease. For example, the court may wish to consider early termination of supervisedrelease if the defendant is an abuser of narcotics, other controlled substances, or alcoholwho, while on supervised release, successfully completes a treatment program, therebyreducing the risk to the public from further crimes of the defendant.</p></li>
<li><p>Application of Subsection ©.—Subsection © specifies how a statutorily requiredminimum term of supervised release may affect the minimum term of supervised releaseprovided by the guidelines.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>For example, if subsection (a) provides a range of two years to five years, but the relevantstatute requires a minimum term of supervised release of three years and a maximumterm of life, the term of supervised release provided by the guidelines is restricted bysubsection © to three years to five years. Similarly, if subsection (a) provides a range oftwo years to five years, but the relevant statute requires a minimum term of supervisedrelease of five years and a maximum term of life, the term of supervised release providedby the guidelines is five years.</p>
<p>The following example illustrates the interaction of subsections (a) and © when subsection (b) is also involved. In this example, subsection (a) provides a range of two years tofive years; the relevant statute requires a minimum term of supervised release of fiveyears and a maximum term of life; and the offense is a sex offense under subsection (b).</p>
<p>The effect of subsection (b) is to raise the maximum term of supervised release from fiveyears (as provided by subsection (a)) to life, yielding a range of two years to life. The termof supervised release provided by the guidelines is then restricted by subsection © to fiveyears to life. In this example, a term of supervised release of more than five years wouldbe a guideline sentence. In addition, subsection (b) contains a policy statement recommending that the maximum — a life term of supervised release — be imposed.</p>
<p>Background: This section specifies the length of a term of supervised release that is to beimposed. Subsection © applies to statutes, such as the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986, thatrequire imposition of a specific minimum term of supervised release.</p>

<p>§5E1.1PART E ― RESTITUTION, FINES, ASSESSMENTS, FORFEITURES§5E1.1. Restitution(a) In the case of an identifiable victim, the court shall—(1) enter a restitution order for the full amount of the victim’s loss, if such order is authorized under 18 U.S.C. § 1593, § 2248, § 2259, § 2264, § 2327, § 3663, or § 3663A, or 21 U.S.C.</p>
<p>§ 853(q); or(2) impose a term of probation or supervised release with a condition requiring restitution for the full amount of the victim’sloss, if the offense is not an offense for which restitution is authorized under 18 U.S.C. § 3663(a)(1) but otherwise meets the criteria for an order of restitution under that section.</p>
<p>(b) Provided, that the provisions of subsection (a) do not apply—(1) when full restitution has been made; or(2) in the case of a restitution order under 18 U.S.C. § 3663; a restitution order under 18 U.S.C. § 3663A that pertains to an offense against property described in 18 U.S.C.</p>
<p>§ 3663A©(1)(A)(ii); or a condition of restitution imposed pursuant to subsection (a)(2) above, to the extent the court finds, from facts on the record, that (A) the number of identifiablevictims is so large as to make restitution impracticable; or(B) determining complex issues of fact related to the cause oramount of the victim’s losses would complicate or prolong the sentencing process to a degree that the need to provide restitution to any victim is outweighed by the burden on the sentencing process.</p>
<p>© If a defendant is ordered to make restitution to an identifiable victim and to pay a fine, the court shall order that any money paid bythe defendant shall first be applied to satisfy the order of restitution.</p>
<p>(d) In a case where there is no identifiable victim and the defendantwas convicted under 21 U.S.C. § 841, § 848(a), § 849, § 856, § 861, or § 863, the court, taking into consideration the amount of publicharm caused by the offense and other relevant factors, shall orderan amount of community restitution not to exceed the fine imposedunder §5E1.2.</p>
<p>§5E1.1(e) A restitution order may direct the defendant to make a single, lumpsum payment, partial payments at specified intervals, in-kind payments, or a combination of payments at specified intervals and inkind payments. See 18 U.S.C. § 3664(f)(3)(A). An in-kind paymentmay be in the form of (1) return of property; (2) replacement of property; or (3) if the victim agrees, services rendered to the victim or toa person or organization other than the victim. See 18 U.S.C.</p>
<p>§ 3664(f)(4).</p>
<p>(f) A restitution order may direct the defendant to make nominal periodic payments if the court finds from facts on the record that the economic circumstances of the defendant do not allow the paymentof any amount of a restitution order and do not allow for the payment of the full amount of a restitution order in the foreseeable future under any reasonable schedule of payments.</p>
<p>(g) Special Instruction(1) This guideline applies only to a defendant convicted of an offense committed on or after November 1, 1997. Notwithstanding the provisions of §1B1.11 (Use of Guidelines Manual in Effect on Date of Sentencing), use the former §5E1.1 (set forth inAppendix C, amendment 571) in lieu of this guideline in anyother case.</p>
<p>CommentaryApplication Note:1. The court shall not order community restitution under subsection (d) if it appears likelythat such an award would interfere with a forfeiture under Chapter 46 or 96 of Title 18, United States Code, or under the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. § 801 et seq.).</p>
<p>See 18 U.S.C. § 3663©(4).</p>
<p>Furthermore, a penalty assessment under 18 U.S.C. § 3013 or a fine under SubchapterC of Chapter 227 of Title 18, United States Code, shall take precedence over an order ofcommunity restitution under subsection (d). See 18 U.S.C. § 3663©(5).</p>
<p>Background: Section 3553(a)(7) of Title 18, United States Code, requires the court, “in determining the particular sentence to be imposed,” to consider “the need to provide restitution toany victims of the offense.” Orders of restitution are authorized under 18 U.S.C. §§ 1593, 2248, 2259, 2264, 2327, 3663, and 3663A, and 21 U.S.C. § 853(q). For offenses for which an order ofrestitution is not authorized, restitution may be imposed as a condition of probation or supervised release.</p>
<p>Subsection (d) implements the instruction to the Commission in section 205 of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996. This provision directs the Commission todevelop guidelines for community restitution in connection with certain drug offenses wherethere is no identifiable victim but the offense causes “public harm.”§5E1.2To the extent that any of the above-noted statutory provisions conflict with the provisionsof this guideline, the applicable statutory provision shall control.</p>

<p>§5E1.2. Fines for Individual Defendants(a) The court shall impose a fine in all cases, except where the defendant establishes that he is unable to pay and is not likely to becomeable to pay any fine.</p>
<p>(b) The applicable fine guideline range is that specified in subsection© below. If, however, the guideline for the offense in Chapter Twoprovides a specific rule for imposing a fine, that rule takes precedence over subsection © of this section.</p>

<p>§5E1.2(4) Subsection ©(2), limiting the maximum fine, does not apply ifthe defendant is convicted under a statute authorizing (A) a maximum fine greater than $500,000, or (B) a fine for each dayof violation. In such cases, the court may impose a fine up tothe maximum authorized by the statute.</p>
<p>(d) In determining the amount of the fine, the court shall consider:(1) the need for the combined sentence to reflect the seriousness ofthe offense (including the harm or loss to the victim and the gain to the defendant), to promote respect for the law, to provide just punishment and to afford adequate deterrence;(2) any evidence presented as to the defendant’s ability to pay the fine (including the ability to pay over a period of time) in lightof his earning capacity and financial resources;(3) the burden that the fine places on the defendant and his dependents relative to alternative punishments;(4) any restitution or reparation that the defendant has made oris obligated to make;(5) any collateral consequences of conviction, including civil obligations arising from the defendant’s conduct;(6) whether the defendant previously has been fined for a similaroffense;(7) the expected costs to the government of any term of probation, or term of imprisonment and term of supervised release imposed; and(8) any other pertinent equitable considerations.</p>
<p>The amount of the fine should always be sufficient to ensure thatthe fine, taken together with other sanctions imposed, is punitive.</p>
<p>(e) If the defendant establishes that (1) he is not able and, even with the use of a reasonable installment schedule, is not likely to becomeable to pay all or part of the fine required by the preceding provisions, or (2) imposition of a fine would unduly burden the defendant’s dependents, the court may impose a lesser fine or waive the fine. In these circumstances, the court shall consider alternativesanctions in lieu of all or a portion of the fine, and must still imposea total combined sanction that is punitive. Although any additional§5E1.2sanction not proscribed by the guidelines is permissible, communityservice is the generally preferable alternative in such instances.</p>
<p>(f) If the defendant establishes that payment of the fine in a lump sumwould have an unduly severe impact on him or his dependents, the court should establish an installment schedule for payment of the fine. The length of the installment schedule generally should not exceed twelve months, and shall not exceed the maximum term ofprobation authorized for the offense. The defendant should be required to pay a substantial installment at the time of sentencing. Ifthe court authorizes a defendant sentenced to probation or supervised release to pay a fine on an installment schedule, the courtshall require as a condition of probation or supervised release thatthe defendant pay the fine according to the schedule. The court alsomay impose a condition prohibiting the defendant from incurringnew credit charges or opening additional lines of credit unless he is in compliance with the payment schedule.</p>
<p>(g) If the defendant knowingly fails to pay a delinquent fine, the courtshall resentence him in accordance with 18 U.S.C. § 3614.</p>
<p>(h) Special Instruction(1) For offenses committed prior to November 1, 2015, use the applicable fine guideline range that was set forth in the versionof §5E1.2© that was in effect on November 1, 2014, ratherthan the applicable fine guideline range set forth in subsection© above.</p>
<p>CommentaryApplication Notes:1. A fine may be the sole sanction if the guidelines do not require a term of imprisonment.</p>
<p>If, however, the fine is not paid in full at the time of sentencing, it is recommended thatthe court sentence the defendant to a term of probation, with payment of the fine as a condition of probation. If a fine is imposed in addition to a term of imprisonment, it is recommended that the court impose a term of supervised release following imprisonmentas a means of enforcing payment of the fine.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><p>In general, the maximum fine permitted by law as to each count of conviction is $250,000for a felony or for any misdemeanor resulting in death; $100,000 for a Class A misdemeanor; and $5,000 for any other offense. 18 U.S.C. § 3571(b)(3)–(7). However, higher orlower limits may apply when specified by statute. 18 U.S.C. § 3571(b)(1), (e). As an alternative maximum, the court may fine the defendant up to the greater of twice the grossgain or twice the gross loss. 18 U.S.C. § 3571(b)(2), (d).</p></li>
<li><p>The determination of the fine guideline range may be dispensed with entirely upon a court determination of present and future inability to pay any fine. The inability of a defendant to post bail bond (having otherwise been determined eligible for release) and§5E1.2the fact that a defendant is represented by (or was determined eligible for) assigned counsel are significant indicators of present inability to pay any fine. In conjunction with otherfactors, they may also indicate that the defendant is not likely to become able to pay anyfine.</p></li>
<li><p>The Commission envisions that for most defendants, the maximum of the guideline finerange from subsection © will be at least twice the amount of gain or loss resulting fromthe offense. Where, however, two times either the amount of gain to the defendant or the amount of loss caused by the offense exceeds the maximum of the fine guideline, an upward departure from the fine guideline may be warranted.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Moreover, where a sentence within the applicable fine guideline range would not be sufficient to ensure both the disgorgement of any gain from the offense that otherwise wouldnot be disgorged (e.g., by restitution or forfeiture) and an adequate punitive fine, an upward departure from the fine guideline range may be warranted.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Subsection ©(4) applies to statutes that contain special provisions permitting largerfines; the guidelines do not limit maximum fines in such cases. These statutes include, among others: 21 U.S.C. §§ 841(b) and 960(b), which authorize fines up to $8 million inoffenses involving the manufacture, distribution, or importation of certain controlled substances; 21 U.S.C. § 848(a), which authorizes fines up to $4 million in offenses involvingthe manufacture or distribution of controlled substances by a continuing criminal enterprise; 18 U.S.C. § 1956(a), which authorizes a fine equal to the greater of $500,000 or twotimes the value of the monetary instruments or funds involved in offenses involvingmoney laundering of financial instruments; 18 U.S.C. § 1957(b)(2), which authorizes a fine equal to two times the amount of any criminally derived property involved in a money laundering transaction; 33 U.S.C. § 1319©, which authorizes a fine of up to$50,000 per day for violations of the Water Pollution Control Act; 42 U.S.C. § 6928(d), which authorizes a fine of up to $50,000 per day for violations of the Resource Conservation Act; and 52 U.S.C. § 30109(d)(1)(D), which authorizes, for violations of the FederalElection Campaign Act under 52 U.S.C. § 30122, a fine up to the greater of $50,000 or1,000 percent of the amount of the violation, and which requires, in the case of such a violation, a minimum fine of not less than 300 percent of the amount of the violation.</li>
</ol>
<p>There may be cases in which the defendant has entered into a conciliation agreementwith the Federal Election Commission under section 309 of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 in order to correct or prevent a violation of such Act by the defendant.</p>
<p>The existence of a conciliation agreement between the defendant and Federal ElectionCommission, and the extent of compliance with that conciliation agreement, may be appropriate factors in determining at what point within the applicable fine guideline rangeto sentence the defendant, unless the defendant began negotiations toward a conciliationagreement after becoming aware of a criminal investigation.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>The existence of income or assets that the defendant failed to disclose may justify a largerfine than that which otherwise would be warranted under this section. The court maybase its conclusion as to this factor on information revealing significant unexplained expenditures by the defendant or unexplained possession of assets that do not comport with the defendant’s reported income. If the court concludes that the defendant willfully misrepresented all or part of his income or assets, it may increase the offense level and resulting sentence in accordance with Chapter Three, Part C (Obstruction and Related Adjustments).</li>
</ol>
<p>§5E1.37. In considering subsection (d)(7), the court may be guided by reports published by the Bureau of Prisons and the Administrative Office of the United States Courts concerningaverage costs.</p>

<p>CommentaryApplication Notes:1. This guideline applies only if the defendant is an individual. See §8E1.1 for special assessments applicable to organizations.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>The following special assessments are provided by statute (18 U.S.C. § 3013):FOR OFFENSES COMMITTED BY INDIVIDUALS ON OR AFTER APRIL 24, 1996:(A) $100, if convicted of a felony;(B) $25, if convicted of a Class A misdemeanor;© $10, if convicted of a Class B misdemeanor;(D) $5, if convicted of a Class C misdemeanor or an infraction.</li>

<p>§5E1.4. ForfeitureForfeiture is to be imposed upon a convicted defendant as provided bystatute.</p>
<p>CommentaryBackground: Forfeiture provisions exist in various statutes. For example, 18 U.S.C. § 3554requires the court imposing a sentence under 18 U.S.C. § 1962 (proscribing the use of the proceeds of racketeering activities in the operation of an enterprise engaged in interstate commerce) or Titles II and III of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of1970 (proscribing the manufacture and distribution of controlled substances) to order the forfeiture of property in accordance with 18 U.S.C. § 1963 and 21 U.S.C. § 853, respectively. Thoseprovisions require the automatic forfeiture of certain property upon conviction of their respective underlying offenses.</p>
<p>In addition, the provisions of 18 U.S.C. §§ 3681–3682 authorizes the court, in certaincircumstances, to order the forfeiture of a violent criminal’s proceeds from the depiction of his crime in a book, movie, or other medium. Those sections authorize the deposit of proceeds inan escrow account in the Crime Victims Fund of the United States Treasury. The money is toremain available in the account for five years to satisfy claims brought against the defendantby the victim(s) of his offenses. At the end of the five-year period, the court may require thatany proceeds remaining in the account be released from escrow and paid into the Fund.</p>

<ol start="2">
<li>Community confinement generally should not be imposed for a period in excess ofsix months. A longer period may be imposed to accomplish the objectives of a specificrehabilitative program, such as drug rehabilitation.

<p>§5F1.2. Home DetentionHome detention may be imposed as a condition of probation or supervised release, but only as a substitute for imprisonment.</p>
<p>CommentaryApplication Notes:1. “Home detention” means a program of confinement and supervision that restricts the defendant to his place of residence continuously, except for authorized absences, enforcedby appropriate means of surveillance by the probation office. When an order of homedetention is imposed, the defendant is required to be in his place of residence at all timesexcept for approved absences for gainful employment, community service, religious services, medical care, educational or training programs, and such other times as may bespecifically authorized. Electronic monitoring is an appropriate means of surveillanceand ordinarily should be used in connection with home detention. However, alternativemeans of surveillance may be used so long as they are as effective as electronic monitoring.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>The court may impose other conditions of probation or supervised release appropriate toeffectuate home detention. If the court concludes that the amenities available in the residence of a defendant would cause home detention not to be sufficiently punitive, the court may limit the amenities available.</li>
</ol>
<p>§5F1.43. The defendant’s place of residence, for purposes of home detention, need not be the placewhere the defendant previously resided. It may be any place of residence, so long as the owner of the residence (and any other person(s) from whom consent is necessary) agreesto any conditions that may be imposed by the court, e.g., conditions that a monitoringsystem be installed, that there will be no “call forwarding” or “call waiting” services, orthat there will be no cordless telephones or answering machines.</p>
<p>Background: The Commission has concluded that the surveillance necessary for effective useof home detention ordinarily requires electronic monitoring. However, in some cases home detention may effectively be enforced without electronic monitoring, e.g., when the defendant is physically incapacitated, or where some other effective means of surveillance is available. Accordingly, the Commission has not required that electronic monitoring be a necessary condition for home detention. Nevertheless, before ordering home detention without electronic monitoring, the court should be confident that an alternative form of surveillance will be equallyeffective.</p>
<p>In the usual case, the Commission assumes that a condition requiring that the defendantseek and maintain gainful employment will be imposed when home detention is ordered.</p>

<p>§5F1.4. Order of Notice to VictimsThe court may order the defendant to pay the cost of giving notice tovictims pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3555. This cost may be set off againstany fine imposed if the court determines that the imposition of both sanctions would be excessive.</p>
<p>§5F1.5CommentaryBackground: In cases where a defendant has been convicted of an offense involving fraud or“other intentionally deceptive practices,” the court may order the defendant to “give reasonablenotice and explanation of the conviction, in such form as the court may approve” to the victimsof the offense. 18 U.S.C. § 3555. The court may order the notice to be given by mail, by advertising in specific areas or through specific media, or by other appropriate means. In determining whether a notice is appropriate, the court must consider the generally applicable sentencing factors listed in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a) and the cost involved in giving the notice as it relatesto the loss caused by the crime. The court may not require the defendant to pay more than $20,000 to give notice.</p>
<p>If an order of notice to victims is under consideration, the court must notify the government and the defendant. 18 U.S.C. § 3553(d). Upon motion of either party, or on its own motion, the court must: (1) permit the parties to submit affidavits and memoranda relevant tothe imposition of such an order; (2) provide counsel for both parties the opportunity to addressorally, in open court, the appropriateness of such an order; and (3) if it issues such an order, state its reasons for doing so. The court may also order any additional procedures that will not unduly complicate or prolong the sentencing process.</p>

<p>§5F1.5. Occupational Restrictions(a) The court may impose a condition of probation or supervised releaseprohibiting the defendant from engaging in a specified occupation, business, or profession, or limiting the terms on which the defendant may do so, only if it determines that:(1) a reasonably direct relationship existed between the defendant’s occupation, business, or profession and the conduct relevant to the offense of conviction; and(2) imposition of such a restriction is reasonably necessary to protect the public because there is reason to believe that, absentsuch restriction, the defendant will continue to engage in unlawful conduct similar to that for which the defendant was convicted.</p>
<p>(b) If the court decides to impose a condition of probation or supervisedrelease restricting a defendant’s engagement in a specified occupation, business, or profession, the court shall impose the condition for the minimum time and to the minimum extent necessary to protectthe public.</p>
<p>§5F1.6CommentaryBackground: The Comprehensive Crime Control Act authorizes the imposition of occupational restrictions as a condition of probation, 18 U.S.C. § 3563(b)(5), or supervised release, 18 U.S.C. § 3583(d). Pursuant to § 3563(b)(5), a court may require a defendant to:[R]efrain, in the case of an individual, from engaging in a specified occupation, business, or profession bearing a reasonably direct relationship to the conduct constituting the offense, or engage in such a specified occupation, business, or professiononly to a stated degree or under stated circumstances.</p>
<p>Section 3583(d) incorporates this section by reference. The Senate Judiciary CommitteeReport on the Comprehensive Crime Control Act explains that the provision was “intended tobe used to preclude the continuation or repetition of illegal activities while avoiding a bar fromemployment that exceeds that needed to achieve that result.” S. Rep. No. 225, 98th Cong., 1stSess. 96–97. The condition “should only be used as reasonably necessary to protect the public.</p>
<p>It should not be used as a means of punishing the convicted person.” Id. at 96. Section 5F1.5accordingly limits the use of the condition and, if imposed, limits its scope, to the minimumreasonably necessary to protect the public.</p>
<p>The appellate review provisions permit a defendant to challenge the imposition of a probation condition under 18 U.S.C. § 3563(b)(5) if the sentence includes a more limiting conditionof probation or supervised release than the maximum established in the guideline. See 18U.S.C. § 3742(a)(3). The government may appeal if the sentence includes a less limiting condition of probation than the minimum established in the guideline. See 18 U.S.C. § 3742(b)(3).</p>

<p>§5F1.6. Denial of Federal Benefits to Drug Traffickers and PossessorsThe court, pursuant to 21 U.S.C. § 862, may deny the eligibility for certain Federal benefits of any individual convicted of distribution or possession of a controlled substance.</p>
<p>CommentaryApplication Note:1. “Federal benefit” is defined in 21 U.S.C. § 862(d) to mean “any grant, contract, loan, professional license, or commercial license provided by an agency of the United States orby appropriated funds of the United States” but “does not include any retirement, welfare, Social Security, health, disability, veterans benefit, public housing, or other similarbenefit, or any other benefit for which payments or services are required for eligibility.”Background: Subsections (a) and (b) of 21 U.S.C. § 862 provide that an individual convictedof a state or federal drug trafficking or possession offense may be denied certain federal benefits. Except for an individual convicted of a third or subsequent drug distribution offense, the period of benefit ineligibility, within the applicable maximum term set forth in 21 U.S.C.</p>
<p>§ 862(a)(1) (for distribution offenses) and (b)(1)(for possession offenses), is at the discretion ofthe court.

<p>§ 4046 participate in a shock incarceration program.</p>
<p>CommentaryBackground: Section 4046 of title 18, United States Code, provides—“(a) the Bureau of Prisons may place in a shock incarceration program any person whois sentenced to a term of more than 12, but not more than 30 months, if such personconsents to that placement.</p>
<p>(b) For such initial portion of the term of imprisonment as the Bureau of Prisons maydetermine, not to exceed six months, an inmate in the shock incarceration programshall be required to—(1) adhere to a highly regimented schedule that provides the strict discipline, physical training, hard labor, drill, and ceremony characteristic of militarybasic training; and(2) participate in appropriate job training and educational programs (includingliteracy programs) and drug, alcohol, and other counseling programs.</p>
<p>§5F1.8© An inmate who in the judgment of the Director of the Bureau of Prisons has successfully completed the required period of shock incarceration shall remain in the custody of the Bureau for such period (not to exceed the remainder of the prisonterm otherwise required by law to be served by that inmate), and under such conditions, as the Bureau deems appropriate. 18 U.S.C. § 4046.”The Bureau of Prisons has issued an operations memorandum (174-90 (5390), November 20, 1990) that outlines eligibility criteria and procedures for the implementation of this program (which the Bureau of Prisons has titled “intensive confinement program”). Underthese procedures, the Bureau will not place a defendant in an intensive confinement programunless the sentencing court has approved, either at the time of sentencing or upon consultationafter the Bureau has determined that the defendant is otherwise eligible. In return for the successful completion of the “intensive confinement” portion of the program, the defendant is eligible to serve the remainder of his term of imprisonment in a graduated release programcomprised of community corrections center and home confinement phases.</p>

<p>§5G1.1PART G ― IMPLEMENTING THE TOTAL SENTENCE OFIMPRISONMENT§5G1.1. Sentencing on a Single Count of Conviction(a) Where the statutorily authorized maximum sentence is less than the minimum of the applicable guideline range, the statutorily authorized maximum sentence shall be the guideline sentence.</p>
<p>(b) Where a statutorily required minimum sentence is greater than the maximum of the applicable guideline range, the statutorily requiredminimum sentence shall be the guideline sentence.</p>
<p>© In any other case, the sentence may be imposed at any point withinthe applicable guideline range, provided that the sentence—(1) is not greater than the statutorily authorized maximum sentence, and(2) is not less than any statutorily required minimum sentence.</p>
<p>CommentaryThis section describes how the statutorily authorized maximum sentence, or a statutorilyrequired minimum sentence, may affect the determination of a sentence under the guidelines.</p>
<p>For example, if the applicable guideline range is 51–63 months and the maximum sentenceauthorized by statute for the offense of conviction is 48 months, the sentence required by the guidelines under subsection (a) is 48 months; a sentence of less than 48 months would be a guideline departure. If the applicable guideline range is 41–51 months and there is a statutorily required minimum sentence of 60 months, the sentence required by the guidelines undersubsection (b) is 60 months; a sentence of more than 60 months would be a guideline departure.</p>
<p>If the applicable guideline range is 51–63 months and the maximum sentence authorized bystatute for the offense of conviction is 60 months, the guideline range is restricted to51–60 months under subsection ©.</p>

<p>§5G1.2. Sentencing on Multiple Counts of Conviction(a) Except as provided in subsection (e), the sentence to be imposed ona count for which the statute (1) specifies a term of imprisonmentto be imposed; and (2) requires that such term of imprisonment beimposed to run consecutively to any other term of imprisonment, shall be determined by that statute and imposed independently.</p>
<p>§5G1.2(b) For all counts not covered by subsection (a), the court shall determine the total punishment and shall impose that total punishmenton each such count, except to the extent otherwise required by law.</p>
<p>© If the sentence imposed on the count carrying the highest statutorymaximum is adequate to achieve the total punishment, then the sentences on all counts shall run concurrently, except to the extentotherwise required by law.</p>
<p>(d) If the sentence imposed on the count carrying the highest statutorymaximum is less than the total punishment, then the sentence imposed on one or more of the other counts shall run consecutively, but only to the extent necessary to produce a combined sentenceequal to the total punishment. In all other respects, sentences on allcounts shall run concurrently, except to the extent otherwise required by law.</p>
<p>(e) In a case in which subsection © of §4B1.1 (Career Offender) applies, to the extent possible, the total punishment is to be apportionedamong the counts of conviction, except that (1) the sentence to beimposed on a count requiring a minimum term of imprisonmentshall be at least the minimum required by statute; and (2) the sentence to be imposed on the 18 U.S.C. § 924© or § 929(a) count shallbe imposed to run consecutively to any other count.</p>
<p>CommentaryApplication Notes:1. In General.—This section specifies the procedure for determining the specific sentenceto be formally imposed on each count in a multiple-count case. The combined length ofthe sentences (“total punishment”) is determined by the court after determining the adjusted combined offense level and the Criminal History Category and determining the defendant’s guideline range on the Sentencing Table in Chapter Five, Part A (SentencingTable).</p>
<p>Note that the defendant’s guideline range on the Sentencing Table may be affected orrestricted by a statutorily authorized maximum sentence or a statutorily required minimum sentence not only in a single-count case, see §5G1.1 (Sentencing on a Single Countof Conviction), but also in a multiple-count case. See Note 3, below.</p>
<p>Except as otherwise required by subsection (e) or any other law, the total punishment is to be imposed on each count and the sentences on all counts are to be imposed to runconcurrently to the extent allowed by the statutory maximum sentence of imprisonmentfor each count of conviction.</p>
<p>This section applies to multiple counts of conviction (A) contained in the same indictmentor information, or (B) contained in different indictments or informations for which sentences are to be imposed at the same time or in a consolidated proceeding.</p>
<p>§5G1.2Usually, at least one of the counts will have a statutory maximum adequate to permitimposition of the total punishment as the sentence on that count. The sentence on eachof the other counts will then be set at the lesser of the total punishment and the applicable statutory maximum, and be made to run concurrently with all or part of the longestsentence. If no count carries an adequate statutory maximum, consecutive sentences areto be imposed to the extent necessary to achieve the total punishment.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Mandatory Minimum and Mandatory Consecutive Terms of Imprisonment (NotCovered by Subsection (e)).—(A) In General.—Subsection (a) applies if a statute (i) specifies a term of imprisonmentto be imposed; and (ii) requires that such term of imprisonment be imposed to runconsecutively to any other term of imprisonment. See, e.g., 18 U.S.C. § 924© (requiring mandatory minimum terms of imprisonment, based on the conduct involved, and also requiring the sentence imposed to run consecutively to any otherterm of imprisonment) and 18 U.S.C. § 1028A (requiring a mandatory term of imprisonment of either two or five years, based on the conduct involved, and also requiring, except in the circumstances described in subdivision (B), the sentence imposed to run consecutively to any other term of imprisonment). Except for certaincareer offender situations in which subsection © of §4B1.1 (Career Offender) applies, the term of years to be imposed consecutively is the minimum required by the statute of conviction and is independent of the guideline sentence on any othercount. See, e.g., the Commentary to §§2K2.4 (Use of Firearm, Armor-Piercing Ammunition, or Explosive During or in Relation to Certain Crimes) and 3D1.1 (Procedure for Determining Offense Level on Multiple Counts) regarding the determination of the offense levels for related counts when a conviction under 18 U.S.C.</li>
</ol>
<p>§ 924© is involved. Subsection (a) also applies in certain other instances in whichan independently determined and consecutive sentence is required. See, e.g., Application Note 3 of the Commentary to §2J1.6 (Failure to Appear by Defendant), relating to failure to appear for service of sentence.</p>
<p>(B) Multiple Convictions Under 18 U.S.C. § 1028A.—Section 1028A of title 18, United States Code, generally requires that the mandatory term of imprisonmentfor a violation of such section be imposed consecutively to any other term of imprisonment. However, 18 U.S.C. § 1028A(b)(4) permits the court, in its discretion, toimpose the mandatory term of imprisonment on a defendant for a violation of suchsection “concurrently, in whole or in part, only with another term of imprisonmentthat is imposed by the court at the same time on that person for an additional violation of this section, provided that such discretion shall be exercised in accordancewith any applicable guidelines and policy statements issued by the SentencingCommission . . .”.</p>
<p>In determining whether multiple counts of 18 U.S.C. § 1028A should run concurrently with, or consecutively to, each other, the court should consider the followingnon-exhaustive list of factors:(i) The nature and seriousness of the underlying offenses. For example, the courtshould consider the appropriateness of imposing consecutive, or partially consecutive, terms of imprisonment for multiple counts of 18 U.S.C. § 1028A in a case in which an underlying offense for one of the 18 U.S.C. § 1028A offensesis a crime of violence or an offense enumerated in 18 U.S.C. § 2332b(g)(5)(B).</p>
<p>(ii) Whether the underlying offenses are groupable under §3D1.2 (Groups ofClosely Related Counts). Generally, multiple counts of 18 U.S.C. § 1028A§5G1.2should run concurrently with one another in cases in which the underlyingoffenses are groupable under §3D1.2.</p>
<p>(iii) Whether the purposes of sentencing set forth in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(2) arebetter achieved by imposing a concurrent or a consecutive sentence for multiple counts of 18 U.S.C. § 1028A.</p>
<p>© Imposition of Supervised Release.—In the case of a consecutive term of imprisonment imposed under subsection (a), any term of supervised release imposed is torun concurrently with any other term of supervised release imposed. See 18 U.S.C.</p>
<p>§ 3624(e).</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Application of Subsection (b).—(A) In General.—Subsection (b) provides that, for all counts not covered by subsection(a), the court shall determine the total punishment (i.e., the combined length of the sentences to be imposed) and shall impose that total punishment on each suchcount, except to the extent otherwise required by law (such as where a statutorilyrequired minimum sentence or a statutorily authorized maximum sentence otherwise requires).</li>
</ol>
<p>(B) Effect on Guidelines Range of Mandatory Minimum or Statutory Maximum.—The defendant’s guideline range on the Sentencing Table may be affectedor restricted by a statutorily authorized maximum sentence or a statutorily required minimum sentence not only in a single-count case, see §5G1.1, but also in a multiple-count case.</p>
<p>In particular, where a statutorily required minimum sentence on any count is greater than the maximum of the applicable guideline range, the statutorily required minimum sentence on that count shall be the guideline sentence on allcounts. See §5G1.1(b). Similarly, where a statutorily required minimum sentenceon any count is greater than the minimum of the applicable guideline range, the guideline range for all counts is restricted by that statutorily required minimumsentence. See §5G1.1©(2) and accompanying Commentary.</p>
<p>However, where a statutorily authorized maximum sentence on a particular countis less than the minimum of the applicable guideline range, the sentence imposedon that count shall not be greater than the statutorily authorized maximum sentence on that count. See §5G1.1(a).</p>
<p>© Examples.—The following examples illustrate how subsection (b) applies, and howthe restrictions in subparagraph (B) operate, when a statutorily required minimumsentence is involved.</p>
<p>Defendant A and Defendant B are each convicted of the same four counts. Counts 1, 3, and 4 have statutory maximums of 10 years, 20 years, and 2 years, respectively.</p>
<p>Count 2 has a statutory maximum of 30 years and a mandatory minimum of10 years.</p>
<p>For Defendant A, the court determines that the final offense level is 19 and the defendant is in Criminal History Category I, which yields a guideline range on the Sentencing Table of 30 to 37 months. Because of the 10-year mandatory minimumon Count 2, however, Defendant A’s guideline sentence is 120 months. See subparagraph (B), above. After considering that guideline sentence, the court determines§5G1.2that the appropriate “total punishment” to be imposed on Defendant A is 120 months. Therefore, subsection (b) requires that the total punishment of120 months be imposed on each of Counts 1, 2, and 3. The sentence imposed onCount 4 is limited to 24 months, because a statutory maximum of 2 years appliesto that particular count.</p>
<p>For Defendant B, in contrast, the court determines that the final offense level is 30and the defendant is in Criminal History Category II, which yields a guidelinerange on the Sentencing Table of 108 to 135 months. Because of the 10-year mandatory minimum on Count 2, however, Defendant B’s guideline range is restrictedto 120 to 135 months. See subparagraph (B), above. After considering that restrictedguideline range, the court determines that the appropriate “total punishment” tobe imposed on Defendant B is 130 months. Therefore, subsection (b) requires thatthe total punishment of 130 months be imposed on each of Counts 2 and 3. Thesentences imposed on Counts 1 and 4 are limited to 120 months (10 years) and24 months (2 years), respectively, because of the applicable statutory maximums.</p>
<p>(D) Special Rule on Resentencing.—In a case in which (i) the defendant’s guidelinerange on the Sentencing Table was affected or restricted by a statutorily requiredminimum sentence (as described in subparagraph (B)), (ii) the court is resentencingthe defendant, and (iii) the statutorily required minimum sentence no longer applies, the defendant’s guideline range for purposes of the remaining counts shall beredetermined without regard to the previous effect or restriction of the statutorilyrequired minimum sentence.</p>

<li>Career Offenders Covered under Subsection (e).—(A) Imposing Sentence.—The sentence imposed for a conviction under 18 U.S.C.</li>
</ol>
<p>§ 924© or § 929(a) shall, under that statute, consist of a minimum term of imprisonment imposed to run consecutively to the sentence on any other count. Subsection(e) requires that the total punishment determined under §4B1.1© be apportionedamong all the counts of conviction. In most cases this can be achieved by imposingthe statutory minimum term of imprisonment on the 18 U.S.C. § 924© or § 929(a)count, subtracting that minimum term of imprisonment from the total punishmentdetermined under §4B1.1©, and then imposing the balance of the total punishmenton the other counts of conviction. In some cases covered by subsection (e), a consecutive term of imprisonment longer than the minimum required by 18 U.S.C.</p>
<p>§ 924© or § 929(a) will be necessary in order both to achieve the total punishmentdetermined by the court and to comply with the applicable statutory requirements.</p>
<p>(B) Examples.—The following examples illustrate the application of subsection (e) ina multiple count situation:(i) The defendant is convicted of one count of violating 18 U.S.C. § 924© for possessing a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking offense (5 year mandatory minimum), and one count of violating 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)© (20 yearstatutory maximum). Applying §4B1.1©, the court determines that a sentence of 300 months is appropriate (applicable guideline range of 262–327).</p>
<p>The court then imposes a sentence of 60 months on the 18 U.S.C. § 924©count, subtracts that 60 months from the total punishment of 300 months andimposes the remainder of 240 months on the 21 U.S.C. § 841 count. As required by statute, the sentence on the 18 U.S.C. § 924© count is imposed torun consecutively.</p>
<p>§5G1.3(ii) The defendant is convicted of one count of 18 U.S.C. § 924© (5 year mandatory minimum), and one count of violating 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)© (20 yearstatutory maximum). Applying §4B1.1©, the court determines that a sentence of 327 months is appropriate (applicable guideline range of 262–327).</p>
<p>The court then imposes a sentence of 240 months on the 21 U.S.C. § 841 countand a sentence of 87 months on the 18 U.S.C. § 924© count to run consecutively to the sentence on the 21 U.S.C. § 841 count.</p>
<p>(iii) The defendant is convicted of two counts of 18 U.S.C. § 924© (5 year mandatory minimum on first count, 25 year mandatory minimum on second count)and one count of violating 18 U.S.C. § 113(a)(3) (10 year statutory maximum).</p>
<p>Applying §4B1.1©, the court determines that a sentence of 460 months is appropriate (applicable guideline range of 460–485 months). The court then imposes (I) a sentence of 60 months on the first 18 U.S.C. § 924© count; (II) a sentence of 300 months on the second 18 U.S.C. § 924© count; and (III) a sentence of 100 months on the 18 U.S.C. § 113(a)(3) count. The sentence oneach count is imposed to run consecutively to the other counts.</p>

Cases in which only part of the prioroffense is relevant conduct to the instant offense are covered under subsection (d).</li>
</ol>
<p>(B) Inapplicability of Subsection (b).—Subsection (b) does not apply in cases inwhich the prior offense was not relevant conduct to the instant offense under§1B1.3(a)(1), (a)(2), or (a)(3) (e.g., the prior offense is a prior conviction for whichthe defendant received an increase under §2L1.2 (Unlawfully Entering or Remaining in the United States), or the prior offense was a crime of violence for which the defendant received an increased base offense level under §2K2.1 (Unlawful Receipt, Possession, or Transportation of Firearms or Ammunition; Prohibited TransactionsInvolving Firearms or Ammunition)).</p>
<p>© Imposition of Sentence.—If subsection (b) applies, and the court adjusts the sentence for a period of time already served, the court should note on the Judgment ina Criminal Case Order (i) the applicable subsection (e.g., §5G1.3(b)); (ii) the amountof time by which the sentence is being adjusted; (iii) the undischarged term of imprisonment for which the adjustment is being given; and (iv) that the sentence imposed is a sentence reduction pursuant to §5G1.3(b) for a period of imprisonmentthat will not be credited by the Bureau of Prisons.</p>
<p>(D) Example.—The following is an example in which subsection (b) applies and an adjustment to the sentence is appropriate:The defendant is convicted of a federal offense charging the sale of 90 grams ofcocaine. Under §1B1.3, the defendant is held accountable for the sale of an additional 25 grams of cocaine, an offense for which the defendant has been convicted§5G1.3and sentenced in state court. The defendant received a nine-month sentence of imprisonment for the state offense and has served six months on that sentence at the time of sentencing on the instant federal offense. The guideline range applicable tothe defendant is 12–18 months (Chapter Two offense level of level 16 for sale of115 grams of cocaine; 3 level reduction for acceptance of responsibility; final offenselevel of level 13; Criminal History Category I). The court determines that a sentenceof 13 months provides the appropriate total punishment. Because the defendanthas already served six months on the related state charge as of the date of sentencing on the instant federal offense, a sentence of seven months, imposed to run concurrently with the three months remaining on the defendant’s state sentence, achieves this result.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><p>Application of Subsection ©.—Subsection © applies to cases in which the federal court anticipates that, after the federal sentence is imposed, the defendant will be sentenced in state court and serve a state sentence before being transferred to federal custody for federal imprisonment. In such a case, where the other offense is relevant conductto the instant offense of conviction under the provisions of subsections (a)(1), (a)(2), or(a)(3) of §1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct), the sentence for the instant offense shall be imposedto run concurrently to the anticipated term of imprisonment.</p></li>
<li><p>Application of Subsection (d).—(A) In General.—Under subsection (d), the court may impose a sentence concurrently, partially concurrently, or consecutively to the undischarged term of imprisonment.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>In order to achieve a reasonable incremental punishment for the instant offenseand avoid unwarranted disparity, the court should consider the following:(i) the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. § 3584 (referencing 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a));(ii) the type (e.g., determinate, indeterminate/parolable) and length of the priorundischarged sentence;(iii) the time served on the undischarged sentence and the time likely to be servedbefore release;(iv) the fact that the prior undischarged sentence may have been imposed in statecourt rather than federal court, or at a different time before the same or different federal court; and(v) any other circumstance relevant to the determination of an appropriate sentence for the instant offense.</p>
<p>(B) Partially Concurrent Sentence.—In some cases under subsection (d), a partiallyconcurrent sentence may achieve most appropriately the desired result. To imposea partially concurrent sentence, the court may provide in the Judgment in a Criminal Case Order that the sentence for the instant offense shall commence on the earlier of (i) when the defendant is released from the prior undischarged sentence;or (ii) on a specified date. This order provides for a fully consecutive sentence if the defendant is released on the undischarged term of imprisonment on or before the date specified in the order, and a partially concurrent sentence if the defendant is not released on the undischarged term of imprisonment by that date.</p>
<p>© Undischarged Terms of Imprisonment Resulting from Revocations of Probation, Parole or Supervised Release.—Subsection (d) applies in cases in whichthe defendant was on federal or state probation, parole, or supervised release at the §5G1.3time of the instant offense and has had such probation, parole, or supervised releaserevoked. Consistent with the policy set forth in Application Note 4 and subsection(f) of §7B1.3 (Revocation of Probation or Supervised Release), the Commission recommends that the sentence for the instant offense be imposed consecutively to the sentence imposed for the revocation.</p>
<p>(D) Complex Situations.—Occasionally, the court may be faced with a complex casein which a defendant may be subject to multiple undischarged terms of imprisonment that seemingly call for the application of different rules. In such a case, the court may exercise its discretion in accordance with subsection (d) to fashion a sentence of appropriate length and structure it to run in any appropriate manner toachieve a reasonable punishment for the instant offense.</p>
<p>(E) Downward Departure.—Unlike subsection (b), subsection (d) does not authorizean adjustment of the sentence for the instant offense for a period of imprisonmentalready served on the undischarged term of imprisonment. However, in an extraordinary case involving an undischarged term of imprisonment under subsection (d), it may be appropriate for the court to downwardly depart. This may occur, for example, in a case in which the defendant has served a very substantial period ofimprisonment on an undischarged term of imprisonment that resulted from conductonly partially within the relevant conduct for the instant offense. In such a case, a downward departure may be warranted to ensure that the combined punishmentis not increased unduly by the fortuity and timing of separate prosecutions andsentencings. Nevertheless, it is intended that a departure pursuant to this application note result in a sentence that ensures a reasonable incremental punishmentfor the instant offense of conviction.</p>
<p>To avoid confusion with the Bureau of Prisons’ exclusive authority provided under18 U.S.C. § 3585(b) to grant credit for time served under certain circumstances, the Commission recommends that any downward departure under this application notebe clearly stated on the Judgment in a Criminal Case Order as a downward departure pursuant to §5G1.3(d), rather than as a credit for time served.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Downward Departure Provision.—In the case of a discharged term of imprisonment, a downward departure is not prohibited if the defendant (A) has completed serving a term of imprisonment; and (B) subsection (b) would have provided an adjustment hadthat completed term of imprisonment been undischarged at the time of sentencing for the instant offense. See §5K2.23 (Discharged Terms of Imprisonment).</li>
</ol>
<p>Background: Federal courts generally “have discretion to select whether the sentences theyimpose will run concurrently or consecutively with respect to other sentences that they impose, or that have been imposed in other proceedings, including state proceedings.” See Setser v.</p>
<p>United States, 132 S. Ct. 1463, 1468 (2012); 18 U.S.C. § 3584(a). Federal courts also generallyhave discretion to order that the sentences they impose will run concurrently with or consecutively to other state sentences that are anticipated but not yet imposed. See Setser, 132 S. Ct.</p>
<p>at 1468. Exercise of that discretion, however, is predicated on the court’s consideration of the factors listed in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a), including any applicable guidelines or policy statementsissued by the Sentencing Commission.</p>

<p>Ch. 5 Pt. HPART H ― SPECIFIC OFFENDER CHARACTERISTICSIntroductory CommentaryThis Part addresses the relevance of certain specific offender characteristics in sentencing. The Sentencing Reform Act (the “Act”) contains several provisions regarding specific offender characteristics:First, the Act directs the Commission to ensure that the guidelines and policy statements“are entirely neutral” as to five characteristics – race, sex, national origin, creed, andsocioeconomic status. See 28 U.S.C. § 994(d).</p>
<p>Second, the Act directs the Commission to consider whether eleven specific offender characteristics, “among others”, have any relevance to the nature, extent, place of service, orother aspects of an appropriate sentence, and to take them into account in the guidelinesand policy statements only to the extent that they do have relevance. See 28 U.S.C.</p>
<p>§ 994(d).</p>
<p>Third, the Act directs the Commission to ensure that the guidelines and policy statements, in recommending a term of imprisonment or length of a term of imprisonment, reflect the “general inappropriateness” of considering five of those characteristics – education; vocational skills; employment record; family ties and responsibilities; and community ties. See 28 U.S.C. § 994(e).</p>
<p>Fourth, the Act also directs the sentencing court, in determining the particular sentenceto be imposed, to consider, among other factors, “the history and characteristics of the defendant”. See 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(1).</p>
<p>Specific offender characteristics are taken into account in the guidelines in several ways.</p>
<p>One important specific offender characteristic is the defendant’s criminal history, see 28 U.S.C.</p>
<p>§ 994(d)(10), which is taken into account in the guidelines in Chapter Four (Criminal Historyand Criminal Livelihood). See §5H1.8 (Criminal History). Another specific offender characteristic in the guidelines is the degree of dependence upon criminal history for a livelihood, see 28 U.S.C. § 994(d)(11), which is taken into account in Chapter Four, Part B (Career Offenders and Criminal Livelihood). See §5H1.9 (Dependence upon Criminal Activity for a Livelihood). Other specific offender characteristics are accounted for elsewhere in this manual.</p>
<p>See, e.g., §§2C1.1(a)(1) and 2C1.2(a)(1) (providing alternative base offense levels if the defendant was a public official); 3B1.3 (Abuse of Position of Trust or Use of Special Skill); and 3E1.1(Acceptance of Responsibility).</p>
<p>The Supreme Court has emphasized that the advisory guideline system should “continueto move sentencing in Congress’ preferred direction, helping to avoid excessive sentencing disparities while maintaining flexibility sufficient to individualize sentences where necessary.”See United States v. Booker, 543 U.S. 220, 264–65 (2005). Although the court must consider“the history and characteristics of the defendant” among other factors, see 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a), in order to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities the court should not give them excessiveweight. Generally, the most appropriate use of specific offender characteristics is to considerthem not as a reason for a sentence outside the applicable guideline range but for other reasons, such as in determining the sentence within the applicable guideline range, the type ofsentence (e.g., probation or imprisonment) within the sentencing options available for the applicable Zone on the Sentencing Table, and various other aspects of an appropriate sentence.</p>
<p>To avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities among defendants with similar records who havebeen found guilty of similar conduct, see 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(6), 28 U.S.C. § 991(b)(1)(B), the Ch. 5 Pt. Hguideline range, which reflects the defendant’s criminal conduct and the defendant’s criminal history, should continue to be “the starting point and the initial benchmark.” Gall v. UnitedStates, 552 U.S. 38, 49 (2007).</p>
<p>Accordingly, the purpose of this Part is to provide sentencing courts with a frameworkfor addressing specific offender characteristics in a reasonably consistent manner. Using sucha framework in a uniform manner will help “secure nationwide consistency,” see Gall v. UnitedStates, 552 U.S. 38, 49 (2007), “avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities,” see 28 U.S.C.</p>
<p>§ 991(b)(1)(B), 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(6), “provide certainty and fairness,” see 28 U.S.C.</p>
<p>§ 991(b)(1)(B), and “promote respect for the law,” see 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(2)(A).</p>
<p>This Part allocates specific offender characteristics into three general categories.</p>
<p>In the first category are specific offender characteristics the consideration of which Congress has prohibited (e.g., §5H1.10 (Race, Sex, National Origin, Creed, Religion, and SocioEconomic Status)) or that the Commission has determined should be prohibited.</p>
<p>In the second category are specific offender characteristics that Congress directed the Commission to take into account in the guidelines only to the extent that they have relevanceto sentencing. See 28 U.S.C. § 994(d). For some of these, the policy statements indicate thatthese characteristics may be relevant in determining whether a sentence outside the applicable guideline range is warranted (e.g., age; mental and emotional condition; physical condition). These characteristics may warrant a sentence outside the applicable guideline range ifthe characteristic, individually or in combination with other such characteristics, is present toan unusual degree and distinguishes the case from the typical cases covered by the guidelines.</p>
<p>These specific offender characteristics also may be considered for other reasons, such as indetermining the sentence within the applicable guideline range, the type of sentence (e.g., probation or imprisonment) within the sentencing options available for the applicable Zone on the Sentencing Table, and various other aspects of an appropriate sentence.</p>
<p>In the third category are specific offender characteristics that Congress directed the Commission to ensure are reflected in the guidelines and policy statements as generally inappropriate in recommending a term of imprisonment or length of a term of imprisonment.</p>
<p>See 28 U.S.C. § 994(e). The policy statements indicate that these characteristics are not ordinarily relevant to the determination of whether a sentence should be outside the applicableguideline range. Unless expressly stated, this does not mean that the Commission views suchcircumstances as necessarily inappropriate to the determination of the sentence within the applicable guideline range, the type of sentence (e.g., probation or imprisonment) within the sentencing options available for the applicable Zone on the Sentencing Table, or various otheraspects of an appropriate sentence (e.g., the appropriate conditions of probation or supervisedrelease). Furthermore, although these circumstances are not ordinarily relevant to the determination of whether a sentence should be outside the applicable guideline range, they may berelevant to this determination in exceptional cases. They also may be relevant if a combinationof such circumstances makes the case an exceptional one, but only if each such circumstanceis identified as an affirmative ground for departure and is present in the case to a substantialdegree. See §5K2.0 (Grounds for Departure).</p>
<p>As with the other provisions in this manual, these policy statements “are evolutionary innature”. See Chapter One, Part A, Subpart 2 (Continuing Evolution and Role of the Guidelines); 28 U.S.C. § 994(o). The Commission expects, and the Sentencing Reform Act contemplates, that continuing research, experience, and analysis will result in modifications and revisions.</p>
<p>The nature, extent, and significance of specific offender characteristics can involve a range of considerations. The Commission will continue to provide information to the courts on§5H1.2the relevance of specific offender characteristics in sentencing, as the Sentencing Reform Actcontemplates. See, e.g., 28 U.S.C. § 995(a)(12)(A) (the Commission serves as a “clearinghouseand information center” on federal sentencing). Among other things, this may include information on the use of specific offender characteristics, individually and in combination, in determining the sentence to be imposed (including, where available, information on rates of use, criteria for use, and reasons for use); the relationship, if any, between specific offender characteristics and (A) the “forbidden factors” specified in 28 U.S.C. § 994(d) and (B) the “discouraged factors” specified in 28 U.S.C. § 994(e); and the relationship, if any, between specific offender characteristics and the statutory purposes of sentencing.</p>

Age may be a reason to depart downward in a case in whichthe defendant is elderly and infirm and where a form of punishment suchas home confinement might be equally efficient as and less costly than incarceration.

<p>§5H1.2. Education and Vocational Skills (Policy Statement)Education and vocational skills are not ordinarily relevant in determining whether a departure is warranted, but the extent to which a defendant may have misused special training or education to facilitate criminal activity is an express guideline factor.

<p>Education and vocational skills may be relevant in determining the conditions of probation or supervised release for rehabilitative purposes, for public protection by restricting activities that allow for the utilization ofa certain skill, or in determining the appropriate type of community service.</p>

<p>§5H1.4. Physical Condition, Including Drug or Alcohol Dependence or Abuse;Gambling Addiction (Policy Statement)Physical condition or appearance, including physique, may be relevantin determining whether a departure is warranted, if the condition or appearance, individually or in combination with other offender characteristics, is present to an unusual degree and distinguishes the case fromthe typical cases covered by the guidelines. An extraordinary physicalimpairment may be a reason to depart downward; e.g., in the case of a seriously infirm defendant, home detention may be as efficient as, andless costly than, imprisonment.</p>
<p>Drug or alcohol dependence or abuse ordinarily is not a reason for a downward departure. Substance abuse is highly correlated to an increased propensity to commit crime. Due to this increased risk, it is highly recommended that a defendant who is incarcerated also be sentenced to supervised release with a requirement that the defendant participate in an appropriate substance abuse program (see §5D1.3(d)(4)). If§5H1.6participation in a substance abuse program is required, the length of supervised release should take into account the length of time necessaryfor the probation office to judge the success of the program.</p>
<p>In certain cases a downward departure may be appropriate to accomplish a specific treatment purpose. See §5C1.1, Application Note 6.</p>
<p>In a case in which a defendant who is a substance abuser is sentenced toprobation, it is strongly recommended that the conditions of probationcontain a requirement that the defendant participate in an appropriatesubstance abuse program (see §5B1.3(d)(4)).</p>
<p>Addiction to gambling is not a reason for a downward departure.</p>

<p>In sentencing a defendant convicted of an offense involving a minor victim under section 1201, an offense under section 1591, or an offense under chapter 71, 109A, 110, or 117, of title 18, United States Code, familyties and responsibilities and community ties are not relevant in determining whether a sentence should be below the applicable guidelinerange.</p>
<p>§5H1.6Family responsibilities that are complied with may be relevant to the determination of the amount of restitution or fine.</p>
<p>CommentaryApplication Note:1. Circumstances to Consider.—(A) In General.—In determining whether a departure is warranted under this policystatement, the court shall consider the following non-exhaustive list of circumstances:(i) The seriousness of the offense.</p>
<p>(ii) The involvement in the offense, if any, of members of the defendant’s family.</p>
<p>(iii) The danger, if any, to members of the defendant’s family as a result of the offense.</p>
<p>(B) Departures Based on Loss of Caretaking or Financial Support.—A departure under this policy statement based on the loss of caretaking or financial supportof the defendant’s family requires, in addition to the court’s consideration of the non-exhaustive list of circumstances in subdivision (A), the presence of the following circumstances:(i) The defendant’s service of a sentence within the applicable guideline rangewill cause a substantial, direct, and specific loss of essential caretaking, oressential financial support, to the defendant’s family.</p>
<p>(ii) The loss of caretaking or financial support substantially exceeds the harm ordinarily incident to incarceration for a similarly situated defendant. For example, the fact that the defendant’s family might incur some degree of financial hardship or suffer to some extent from the absence of a parent throughincarceration is not in itself sufficient as a basis for departure because suchhardship or suffering is of a sort ordinarily incident to incarceration.</p>
<p>(iii) The loss of caretaking or financial support is one for which no effective remedial or ameliorative programs reasonably are available, making the defendant’s caretaking or financial support irreplaceable to the defendant’s family.</p>
<p>(iv) The departure effectively will address the loss of caretaking or financial support.</p>

<p>Effective November 1, 1987. Amended effective June 15, 1988 (amendment 55).</p>
<p>§5J1.1. Relief from Disability Pertaining to Convicted Persons Prohibited fromHolding Certain Positions (Policy Statement)A collateral consequence of conviction of certain crimes described in29 U.S.C. §§ 504 and 1111 is the prohibition of convicted persons fromservice and employment with labor unions, employer associations, employee pension and welfare benefit plans, and as labor relations consultants in the private sector. A convicted person’s prohibited service or employment in such capacities without having been granted one of the following three statutory procedures of administrative or judicial relief is subject to criminal prosecution. First, a disqualified person whose citizenship rights have been fully restored to him or her in the jurisdictionof conviction, following the revocation of such rights as a result of the disqualifying conviction, is relieved of the disability. Second, a disqualified person convicted after October 12, 1984, may petition the sentencingcourt to reduce the statutory length of disability (thirteen years afterdate of sentencing or release from imprisonment, whichever is later) toa lesser period (not less than three years after date of conviction or release from imprisonment, whichever is later). Third, a disqualified person may petition either the United States Parole Commission or a United States District Court judge to exempt his or her service or employment in a particular prohibited capacity pursuant to the proceduresset forth in 29 U.S.C. §§ 504(a)(B) and 1111(a)(B). In the case of a personconvicted of a disqualifying crime committed before November 1, 1987, the United States Parole Commission will continue to process such exemption applications.</p>
<p>In the case of a person convicted of a disqualifying crime committed onor after November 1, 1987, however, a petition for exemption from disability must be directed to a United States District Court. If the petitionerwas convicted of a disqualifying federal offense, the petition is directedto the sentencing judge. If the petitioner was convicted of a disqualifyingstate or local offense, the petition is directed to the United States DistrictCourt for the district in which the offense was committed. In such cases, relief shall not be given to aid rehabilitation, but may be granted onlyfollowing a clear demonstration by the convicted person that he or shehas been rehabilitated since commission of the disqualifying crime andcan therefore be trusted not to endanger the organization in the positionfor which he or she seeks relief from disability.</p>

Under circumstances set forth in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(e) and 28 U.S.C. § 994(n), as amended, substantial assistance in the investigation or prosecution of another person who has committed an offense may justify a sentence below a statutorily required minimum sentence.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><p>The sentencing reduction for assistance to authorities shall be considered independentlyof any reduction for acceptance of responsibility. Substantial assistance is directed to the investigation and prosecution of criminal activities by persons other than the defendant, while acceptance of responsibility is directed to the defendant’s affirmative recognitionof responsibility for his own conduct.</p></li>
<li><p>Substantial weight should be given to the government’s evaluation of the extent of the defendant’s assistance, particularly where the extent and value of the assistance are difficult to ascertain.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>§5K2.0Background: A defendant’s assistance to authorities in the investigation of criminal activitieshas been recognized in practice and by statute as a mitigating sentencing factor. The nature, extent, and significance of assistance can involve a broad spectrum of conduct that must beevaluated by the court on an individual basis. Latitude is, therefore, afforded the sentencingjudge to reduce a sentence based upon variable relevant factors, including those listed above.</p>
<p>The sentencing judge must, however, state the reasons for reducing a sentence under this section. 18 U.S.C. § 3553©. The court may elect to provide its reasons to the defendant in camera and in writing under seal for the safety of the defendant or to avoid disclosure of an ongoinginvestigation.</p>

<p>§5K2.0. Grounds for Departure (Policy Statement)(a) UPWARD DEPARTURES IN GENERAL AND DOWNWARD DEPARTURES INCRIMINAL CASES OTHER THAN CHILD CRIMES AND SEXUAL OFFENSES.—(1) IN GENERAL.—The sentencing court may depart from the applicable guideline range if—(A) in the case of offenses other than child crimes and sexualoffenses, the court finds, pursuant to 18 U.S.C.</p>
<p>§ 3553(b)(1), that there exists an aggravating or mitigating circumstance; or§5K2.0(B) in the case of child crimes and sexual offenses, the courtfinds, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3553(b)(2)(A)(i), that thereexists an aggravating circumstance, of a kind, or to a degree, not adequately taken into consideration by the Sentencing Commission in formulating the guidelines that, in order to advance the objectives set forth in18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(2), should result in a sentence differentfrom that described.</p>
<p>(2) DEPARTURES BASED ON CIRCUMSTANCES OF A KIND NOT ADEQUATELY TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION.—(A) IDENTIFIED CIRCUMSTANCES.—This subpart (Chapter Five, Part K, Subpart 2 (Other Grounds for Departure)) identifies some of the circumstances that the Commission mayhave not adequately taken into consideration in determining the applicable guideline range (e.g., as a specific offense characteristic or other adjustment). If any such circumstance is present in the case and has not adequatelybeen taken into consideration in determining the applicable guideline range, a departure consistent with 18 U.S.C.</p>
<p>§ 3553(b) and the provisions of this subpart may be warranted.</p>
<p>(B) UNIDENTIFIED CIRCUMSTANCES.—A departure may be warranted in the exceptional case in which there is present a circumstance that the Commission has not identified inthe guidelines but that nevertheless is relevant to determining the appropriate sentence.</p>
<p>(3) DEPARTURES BASED ON CIRCUMSTANCES PRESENT TO A DEGREENOT ADEQUATELY TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION.—A departuremay be warranted in an exceptional case, even though the circumstance that forms the basis for the departure is taken intoconsideration in determining the guideline range, if the courtdetermines that such circumstance is present in the offense toa degree substantially in excess of, or substantially below, thatwhich ordinarily is involved in that kind of offense.</p>
<p>(4) DEPARTURES BASED ON NOT ORDINARILY RELEVANT OFFENDERCHARACTERISTICS AND OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES.—An offendercharacteristic or other circumstance identified in Chapter Five, Part H (Offender Characteristics) or elsewhere in the guidelines as not ordinarily relevant in determining whether a departure is warranted may be relevant to this determination§5K2.0only if such offender characteristic or other circumstance is present to an exceptional degree.</p>
<p>(b) DOWNWARD DEPARTURES IN CHILD CRIMES AND SEXUAL OFFENSES.—Under 18 U.S.C. § 3553(b)(2)(A)(ii), the sentencing court may impose a sentence below the range established by the applicable guidelines only if the court finds that there exists a mitigating circumstance of a kind, or to a degree, that—(1) has been affirmatively and specifically identified as a permissible ground of downward departure in the sentencing guidelines or policy statements issued under section 994(a) of title 28, United States Code, taking account of any amendmentsto such sentencing guidelines or policy statements by act ofCongress;(2) has not adequately been taken into consideration by the Sentencing Commission in formulating the guidelines; and(3) should result in a sentence different from that described.</p>
<p>The grounds enumerated in this Part K of Chapter Five are the solegrounds that have been affirmatively and specifically identified asa permissible ground of downward departure in these sentencingguidelines and policy statements. Thus, notwithstanding any otherreference to authority to depart downward elsewhere in this Sentencing Manual, a ground of downward departure has not been affirmatively and specifically identified as a permissible ground ofdownward departure within the meaning of section 3553(b)(2) unless it is expressly enumerated in this Part K as a ground uponwhich a downward departure may be granted.</p>
<p>© LIMITATION ON DEPARTURES BASED ON MULTIPLE CIRCUMSTANCES.—The court may depart from the applicable guideline range based ona combination of two or more offender characteristics or other circumstances, none of which independently is sufficient to provide a basis for departure, only if—(1) such offender characteristics or other circumstances, taken together, make the case an exceptional one; and(2) each such offender characteristic or other circumstance is—(A) present to a substantial degree; and§5K2.0(B) identified in the guidelines as a permissible ground for departure, even if such offender characteristic or other circumstance is not ordinarily relevant to a determination ofwhether a departure is warranted.</p>
<p>(d) PROHIBITED DEPARTURES.—Notwithstanding subsections (a) and (b)of this policy statement, or any other provision in the guidelines, the court may not depart from the applicable guideline range based onany of the following circumstances:(1) Any circumstance specifically prohibited as a ground for departure in §§5H1.10 (Race, Sex, National Origin, Creed, Religion, and Socio-Economic Status), 5H1.12 (Lack of Guidance as a Youth and Similar Circumstances), the last sentence of 5H1.4(Physical Condition, Including Drug or Alcohol Dependence orAbuse; Gambling Addiction), and the last sentence of 5K2.12(Coercion and Duress).</p>
<p>(2) The defendant’s acceptance of responsibility for the offense, which may be taken into account only under §3E1.1 (Acceptance of Responsibility).</p>
<p>(3) The defendant’s aggravating or mitigating role in the offense, which may be taken into account only under §3B1.1 (Aggravating Role) or §3B1.2 (Mitigating Role), respectively.</p>
<p>(4) The defendant’s decision, in and of itself, to plead guilty to the offense or to enter a plea agreement with respect to the offense(i.e., a departure may not be based merely on the fact that the defendant decided to plead guilty or to enter into a plea agreement, but a departure may be based on justifiable, non-prohibited reasons as part of a sentence that is recommended, oragreed to, in the plea agreement and accepted by the court.</p>
<p>See §6B1.2 (Standards for Acceptance of Plea Agreement).</p>
<p>(5) The defendant’s fulfillment of restitution obligations only tothe extent required by law including the guidelines (i.e., a departure may not be based on unexceptional efforts to remedythe harm caused by the offense).</p>
<p>(6) Any other circumstance specifically prohibited as a ground for departure in the guidelines.</p>
<p>(e) REQUIREMENT OF SPECIFIC WRITTEN REASONS FOR DEPARTURE.—Ifthe court departs from the applicable guideline range, it shall state, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3553©, its specific reasons for departure inopen court at the time of sentencing and, with limited exception in§5K2.0the case of statements received in camera, shall state those reasonswith specificity in the statement of reasons form.</p>
<p>CommentaryApplication Notes:1. Definitions.—For purposes of this policy statement:“Circumstance” includes, as appropriate, an offender characteristic or any other offensefactor.</p>
<p>“Depart”, “departure”, “downward departure”, and “upward departure” have the meaning given those terms in Application Note 1 of the Commentary to §1B1.1 (Application Instructions).</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Scope of this Policy Statement.—(A) Departures Covered by this Policy Statement.—This policy statement coversdepartures from the applicable guideline range based on offense characteristics oroffender characteristics of a kind, or to a degree, not adequately taken into consideration in determining that range. See 18 U.S.C. § 3553(b).</li>
</ol>
<p>Subsection (a) of this policy statement applies to upward departures in all casescovered by the guidelines and to downward departures in all such cases except for downward departures in child crimes and sexual offenses.</p>
<p>Subsection (b) of this policy statement applies only to downward departures in childcrimes and sexual offenses.</p>
<p>(B) Departures Covered by Other Guidelines.—This policy statement does not cover the following departures, which are addressed elsewhere in the guidelines:(i) departures based on the defendant’s criminal history (see Chapter Four (Criminal History and Criminal Livelihood), particularly §4A1.3 (Departures Based onInadequacy of Criminal History Category)); (ii) departures based on the defendant’ssubstantial assistance to the authorities (see §5K1.1 (Substantial Assistance to Authorities)); and (iii) departures based on early disposition programs (see §5K3.1(Early Disposition Programs)).</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Kinds and Expected Frequency of Departures under Subsection (a).—As setforth in subsection (a), there generally are two kinds of departures from the guidelinesbased on offense characteristics and/or offender characteristics: (A) departures based oncircumstances of a kind not adequately taken into consideration in the guidelines; and(B) departures based on circumstances that are present to a degree not adequately takeninto consideration in the guidelines.</li>
</ol>
<p>(A) Departures Based on Circumstances of a Kind Not Adequately Taken intoAccount in Guidelines.—Subsection (a)(2) authorizes the court to depart if thereexists an aggravating or a mitigating circumstance in a case under 18 U.S.C.</p>
<p>§ 3553(b)(1), or an aggravating circumstance in a case under 18 U.S.C.</p>
<p>§ 3553(b)(2)(A)(i), of a kind not adequately taken into consideration in the guidelines.</p>
<p>(i) Identified Circumstances.—This subpart (Chapter Five, Part K, Subpart 2) identifies several circumstances that the Commission may have not §5K2.0adequately taken into consideration in setting the offense level for certaincases. Offense guidelines in Chapter Two (Offense Conduct) and adjustmentsin Chapter Three (Adjustments) sometimes identify circumstances the Commission may have not adequately taken into consideration in setting the offense level for offenses covered by those guidelines. If the offense guideline inChapter Two or an adjustment in Chapter Three does not adequately takethat circumstance into consideration in setting the offense level for the offense, and only to the extent not adequately taken into consideration, a departure based on that circumstance may be warranted.</p>
<p>(ii) Unidentified Circumstances.—A case may involve circumstances, in addition to those identified by the guidelines, that have not adequately been takeninto consideration by the Commission, and the presence of any such circumstance may warrant departure from the guidelines in that case. However, inasmuch as the Commission has continued to monitor and refine the guidelinessince their inception to take into consideration relevant circumstances in sentencing, it is expected that departures based on such unidentified circumstances will occur rarely and only in exceptional cases.</p>
<p>(B) Departures Based on Circumstances Present to a Degree Not AdequatelyTaken into Consideration in Guidelines.—(i) In General.—Subsection (a)(3) authorizes the court to depart if there existsan aggravating or a mitigating circumstance in a case under 18 U.S.C.</p>
<p>§ 3553(b)(1), or an aggravating circumstance in a case under 18 U.S.C.</p>
<p>§ 3553(b)(2)(A)(i), to a degree not adequately taken into consideration in the guidelines. However, inasmuch as the Commission has continued to monitorand refine the guidelines since their inception to determine the most appropriate weight to be accorded the mitigating and aggravating circumstancesspecified in the guidelines, it is expected that departures based on the weightaccorded to any such circumstance will occur rarely and only in exceptionalcases.</p>
<p>(ii) Examples.—As set forth in subsection (a)(3), if the applicable offense guideline and adjustments take into consideration a circumstance identified in this subpart, departure is warranted only if the circumstance is present to a degreesubstantially in excess of that which ordinarily is involved in the offense. Accordingly, a departure pursuant to §5K2.7 for the disruption of a governmental function would have to be substantial to warrant departure from the guidelines when the applicable offense guideline is bribery or obstruction of justice.</p>
<p>When the guideline covering the mailing of injurious articles is applicable, however, and the offense caused disruption of a governmental function, departure from the applicable guideline range more readily would be appropriate. Similarly, physical injury would not warrant departure from the guidelines when the robbery offense guideline is applicable because the robberyguideline includes a specific adjustment based on the extent of any injury.</p>
<p>However, because the robbery guideline does not deal with injury to more than one victim, departure may be warranted if several persons were injured.</p>
<p>© Departures Based on Circumstances Identified as Not Ordinarily Relevant.—Because certain circumstances are specified in the guidelines as not ordinarily relevant to sentencing (see, e.g., Chapter Five, Part H (Specific OffenderCharacteristics)), a departure based on any one of such circumstances should occuronly in exceptional cases, and only if the circumstance is present in the case to an§5K2.0exceptional degree. If two or more of such circumstances each is present in the caseto a substantial degree, however, and taken together make the case an exceptionalone, the court may consider whether a departure would be warranted pursuant tosubsection ©. Departures based on a combination of not ordinarily relevant circumstances that are present to a substantial degree should occur extremely rarelyand only in exceptional cases.</p>
<p>In addition, as required by subsection (e), each circumstance forming the basis for a departure described in this subdivision shall be stated with specificity in the statement of reasons form.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Downward Departures in Child Crimes and Sexual Offenses.—(A) Definition.—For purposes of this policy statement, the term “child crimes andsexual offenses” means offenses under any of the following: 18 U.S.C. § 1201(involving a minor victim), 18 U.S.C. § 1591, or chapter 71, 109A, 110, or 117 oftitle 18, United States Code.</li>
</ol>
<p>(B) Standard for Departure.—(i) Requirement of Affirmative and Specific Identification of DepartureGround.—The standard for a downward departure in child crimes and sexualoffenses differs from the standard for other departures under this policy statement in that it includes a requirement, set forth in 18 U.S.C.</p>
<p>§ 3553(b)(2)(A)(ii)(I) and subsection (b)(1) of this guideline, that any mitigating circumstance that forms the basis for such a downward departure be affirmatively and specifically identified as a ground for downward departure inthis part (i.e., Chapter Five, Part K).</p>
<p>(ii) Application of Subsection (b)(2).—The commentary in Application Note 3of this policy statement, except for the commentary in ApplicationNote 3(A)(ii) relating to unidentified circumstances, shall apply to the court’sdetermination of whether a case meets the requirement, set forth in subsection 18 U.S.C. § 3553(b)(2)(A)(ii)(II) and subsection (b)(2) of this policy statement, that the mitigating circumstance forming the basis for a downward departure in child crimes and sexual offenses be of kind, or to a degree, not adequately taken into consideration by the Commission.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Departures Based on Plea Agreements.—Subsection (d)(4) prohibits a downward departure based only on the defendant’s decision, in and of itself, to plead guilty to the offense or to enter a plea agreement with respect to the offense. Even though a departuremay not be based merely on the fact that the defendant agreed to plead guilty or enter a plea agreement, a departure may be based on justifiable, non-prohibited reasons for departure as part of a sentence that is recommended, or agreed to, in the plea agreementand accepted by the court. See §6B1.2 (Standards for Acceptance of Plea Agreements). In cases in which the court departs based on such reasons as set forth in the plea agreement, the court must state the reasons for departure with specificity in the statement of reasonsform, as required by subsection (e).</li>
</ol>
<p>Background: This policy statement sets forth the standards for departing from the applicableguideline range based on offense and offender characteristics of a kind, or to a degree, not adequately considered by the Commission. Circumstances the Commission has determined arenot ordinarily relevant to determining whether a departure is warranted or are prohibited asbases for departure are addressed in Chapter Five, Part H (Offender Characteristics) and in§5K2.0this policy statement. Other departures, such as those based on the defendant’s criminal history, the defendant’s substantial assistance to authorities, and early disposition programs, areaddressed elsewhere in the guidelines.</p>
<p>As acknowledged by Congress in the Sentencing Reform Act and by the Commissionwhen the first set of guidelines was promulgated, “it is difficult to prescribe a single set ofguidelines that encompasses the vast range of human conduct potentially relevant to a sentencing decision.” (See Chapter One, Part A). Departures, therefore, perform an integral function in the sentencing guideline system. Departures permit courts to impose an appropriatesentence in the exceptional case in which mechanical application of the guidelines would failto achieve the statutory purposes and goals of sentencing. Departures also help maintain “sufficient flexibility to permit individualized sentences when warranted by mitigating or aggravating factors not taken into account in the establishment of general sentencing practices.”28 U.S.C. § 991(b)(1)(B). By monitoring when courts depart from the guidelines and by analyzing their stated reasons for doing so, along with appellate cases reviewing these departures, the Commission can further refine the guidelines to specify more precisely when departuresshould and should not be permitted.</p>
<p>As reaffirmed in the Prosecutorial Remedies and Other Tools to end the Exploitation ofChildren Today Act of 2003 (the “PROTECT Act”, Public Law 108–21), circumstances warranting departure should be rare. Departures were never intended to permit sentencing courts tosubstitute their policy judgments for those of Congress and the Sentencing Commission. Departure in such circumstances would produce unwarranted sentencing disparity, which the Sentencing Reform Act was designed to avoid.</p>
<p>In order for appellate courts to fulfill their statutory duties under 18 U.S.C. § 3742 andfor the Commission to fulfill its ongoing responsibility to refine the guidelines in light of information it receives on departures, it is essential that sentencing courts state with specificitythe reasons for departure, as required by the PROTECT Act.</p>
<p>This policy statement, including its commentary, was substantially revised, effective October 27, 2003, in response to directives contained in the PROTECT Act, particularly the directive in section 401(m) of that Act to—“(1) review the grounds of downward departure that are authorized bythe sentencing guidelines, policy statements, and official commentary of the Sentencing Commission; and(2) promulgate, pursuant to section 994 of title 28, United States Code—(A) appropriate amendments to the sentencing guidelines, policystatements, and official commentary to ensure that the incidence ofdownward departures is substantially reduced;(B) a policy statement authorizing a departure pursuant to an earlydisposition program; and© any other conforming amendments to the sentencing guidelines, policy statements, and official commentary of the Sentencing Commission necessitated by the Act, including a revision of . . . section 5K2.0”.</p>
<p>The substantial revision of this policy statement in response to the PROTECT Act wasintended to refine the standards applicable to departures while giving due regard for concepts, such as the “heartland”, that have evolved in departure jurisprudence over time.</p>
<p>Section 401(b)(1) of the PROTECT Act directly amended this policy statement to addsubsection (b), effective April 30, 2003.</p>

<p>§5K2.1. Death (Policy Statement)If death resulted, the court may increase the sentence above the authorized guideline range.</p>
<p>Loss of life does not automatically suggest a sentence at or near the statutory maximum. The sentencing judge must give consideration to matters that would normally distinguish among levels of homicide, such asthe defendant’s state of mind and the degree of planning or preparation.</p>
<p>Other appropriate factors are whether multiple deaths resulted, and the means by which life was taken. The extent of the increase should dependon the dangerousness of the defendant’s conduct, the extent to whichdeath or serious injury was intended or knowingly risked, and the extentto which the offense level for the offense of conviction, as determined bythe other Chapter Two guidelines, already reflects the risk of personalinjury. For example, a substantial increase may be appropriate if the death was intended or knowingly risked or if the underlying offense wasone for which base offense levels do not reflect an allowance for the riskof personal injury, such as fraud.</p>
<h6>Historical Note</h6>
<p>Effective November 1, 1987.</p>
<p>§5K2.2. Physical Injury (Policy Statement)If significant physical injury resulted, the court may increase the sentence above the authorized guideline range. The extent of the increaseordinarily should depend on the extent of the injury, the degree to whichit may prove permanent, and the extent to which the injury was intendedor knowingly risked. When the victim suffers a major, permanent disability and when such injury was intentionally inflicted, a substantial departure may be appropriate. If the injury is less serious or if the defendant (though criminally negligent) did not knowingly create the risk ofharm, a less substantial departure would be indicated. In general, the same considerations apply as in §5K2.1.</p>

<p>Effective November 1, 1987.</p>
<p>§5K2.5§5K2.3. Extreme Psychological Injury (Policy Statement)If a victim or victims suffered psychological injury much more seriousthan that normally resulting from commission of the offense, the courtmay increase the sentence above the authorized guideline range. The extent of the increase ordinarily should depend on the severity of the psychological injury and the extent to which the injury was intended orknowingly risked.</p>
<p>Normally, psychological injury would be sufficiently severe to warrantapplication of this adjustment only when there is a substantial impairment of the intellectual, psychological, emotional, or behavioral functioning of a victim, when the impairment is likely to be of an extended orcontinuous duration, and when the impairment manifests itself by physical or psychological symptoms or by changes in behavior patterns. Thecourt should consider the extent to which such harm was likely, giventhe nature of the defendant’s conduct.</p>

<p>§5K2.4. Abduction or Unlawful Restraint (Policy Statement)If a person was abducted, taken hostage, or unlawfully restrained to facilitate commission of the offense or to facilitate the escape from the scene of the crime, the court may increase the sentence above the authorized guideline range.</p>
<h6>Historical Note</h6>
<p>Effective November 1, 1987.</p>
<p>§5K2.5. Property Damage or Loss (Policy Statement)If the offense caused property damage or loss not taken into accountwithin the guidelines, the court may increase the sentence above the authorized guideline range. The extent of the increase ordinarily shoulddepend on the extent to which the harm was intended or knowinglyrisked and on the extent to which the harm to property is more seriousthan other harm caused or risked by the conduct relevant to the offenseof conviction.</p>

<p>Effective November 1, 1987.</p>
<p>§5K2.6. Weapons and Dangerous Instrumentalities (Policy Statement)If a weapon or dangerous instrumentality was used or possessed in the commission of the offense the court may increase the sentence above the authorized guideline range. The extent of the increase ordinarily shoulddepend on the dangerousness of the weapon, the manner in which it wasused, and the extent to which its use endangered others. The dischargeof a firearm might warrant a substantial sentence increase.</p>
<h6>Historical Note</h6>
<p>Effective November 1, 1987.</p>
<p>§5K2.7. Disruption of Governmental Function (Policy Statement)If the defendant’s conduct resulted in a significant disruption of a governmental function, the court may increase the sentence above the authorized guideline range to reflect the nature and extent of the disruption and the importance of the governmental function affected. Departure from the guidelines ordinarily would not be justified when the offense of conviction is an offense such as bribery or obstruction of justice;in such cases interference with a governmental function is inherent inthe offense, and unless the circumstances are unusual the guidelines willreflect the appropriate punishment for such interference.</p>
<h6>Historical Note</h6>
<p>Effective November 1, 1987.</p>
<p>§5K2.8. Extreme Conduct (Policy Statement)If the defendant’s conduct was unusually heinous, cruel, brutal, or degrading to the victim, the court may increase the sentence above the guideline range to reflect the nature of the conduct. Examples of extremeconduct include torture of a victim, gratuitous infliction of injury, or prolonging of pain or humiliation.</p>

<p>Effective November 1, 1987.</p>
<p>§5K2.10§5K2.9. Criminal Purpose (Policy Statement)If the defendant committed the offense in order to facilitate or concealthe commission of another offense, the court may increase the sentenceabove the guideline range to reflect the actual seriousness of the defendant’s conduct.</p>
<h6>Historical Note</h6>
<p>Effective November 1, 1987.</p>
<p>§5K2.10. Victim’s Conduct (Policy Statement)If the victim’s wrongful conduct contributed significantly to provokingthe offense behavior, the court may reduce the sentence below the guideline range to reflect the nature and circumstances of the offense. In deciding whether a sentence reduction is warranted, and the extent of suchreduction, the court should consider the following:(1) The size and strength of the victim, or other relevant physical characteristics, in comparison with those of the defendant.</p>
<p>(2) The persistence of the victim’s conduct and any efforts by the defendant to prevent confrontation.</p>
<p>(3) The danger reasonably perceived by the defendant, including the victim’s reputation for violence.</p>
<p>(4) The danger actually presented to the defendant by the victim.</p>
<p>(5) Any other relevant conduct by the victim that substantially contributed to the danger presented.</p>
<p>(6) The proportionality and reasonableness of the defendant’s responseto the victim’s provocation.</p>
<p>Victim misconduct ordinarily would not be sufficient to warrant application of this provision in the context of offenses under Chapter Two, PartA, Subpart 3 (Criminal Sexual Abuse). In addition, this provision usuallywould not be relevant in the context of non-violent offenses. There may, however, be unusual circumstances in which substantial victim misconduct would warrant a reduced penalty in the case of a non-violent offense. For example, an extended course of provocation and harassmentmight lead a defendant to steal or destroy property in retaliation.</p>
<p>§5K2.12###### Historical Note</p>
<p>Effective November 1, 1987. Amended effective October 27, 2003 (amendment 651).</p>
<p>§5K2.11. Lesser Harms (Policy Statement)Sometimes, a defendant may commit a crime in order to avoid a perceived greater harm. In such instances, a reduced sentence may be appropriate, provided that the circumstances significantly diminish society’s interest in punishing the conduct, for example, in the case of a mercy killing. Where the interest in punishment or deterrence is not reduced, a reduction in sentence is not warranted. For example, providingdefense secrets to a hostile power should receive no lesser punishmentsimply because the defendant believed that the government’s policieswere misdirected.</p>
<p>In other instances, conduct may not cause or threaten the harm or evilsought to be prevented by the law proscribing the offense at issue. Forexample, where a war veteran possessed a machine gun or grenade as a trophy, or a school teacher possessed controlled substances for display ina drug education program, a reduced sentence might be warranted.</p>
<h6>Historical Note</h6>
<p>Effective November 1, 1987.</p>
<p>§5K2.12. Coercion and Duress (Policy Statement)If the defendant committed the offense because of serious coercion, blackmail or duress, under circumstances not amounting to a completedefense, the court may depart downward. The extent of the decrease ordinarily should depend on the reasonableness of the defendant’s actions, on the proportionality of the defendant’s actions to the seriousness ofcoercion, blackmail, or duress involved, and on the extent to which the conduct would have been less harmful under the circumstances as the defendant believed them to be. Ordinarily coercion will be sufficientlyserious to warrant departure only when it involves a threat of physicalinjury, substantial damage to property or similar injury resulting fromthe unlawful action of a third party or from a natural emergency. Notwithstanding this policy statement, personal financial difficulties andeconomic pressures upon a trade or business do not warrant a downwarddeparture.</p>
<h6>Historical Note</h6>
<p>Effective November 1, 1987. Amended effective October 27, 2003 (amendment 651); November 1, 2004(amendment 674).</p>
<p>§5K2.14§5K2.13. Diminished Capacity (Policy Statement)A downward departure may be warranted if (1) the defendant committedthe offense while suffering from a significantly reduced mental capacity;and (2) the significantly reduced mental capacity contributed substantially to the commission of the offense. Similarly, if a departure is warranted under this policy statement, the extent of the departure shouldreflect the extent to which the reduced mental capacity contributed tothe commission of the offense.</p>
<p>However, the court may not depart below the applicable guideline rangeif (1) the significantly reduced mental capacity was caused by the voluntary use of drugs or other intoxicants; (2) the facts and circumstances ofthe defendant’s offense indicate a need to protect the public because the offense involved actual violence or a serious threat of violence; (3) the defendant’s criminal history indicates a need to incarcerate the defendant to protect the public; or (4) the defendant has been convicted of anoffense under chapter 71, 109A, 110, or 117, of title 18, United StatesCode.</p>
