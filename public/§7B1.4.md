Commentary

Application Notes:

1. The criminal history category to be used in determining the applicable range of imprisonment in the Revocation Table is the category determined at the time the defendantoriginally was sentenced to the term of supervision. The criminal history category is not to be recalculated because the ranges set forth in the Revocation Table have been designed to take into account that the defendant violated supervision. In the rare case inwhich no criminal history category was determined when the defendant originally wassentenced to the term of supervision being revoked, the court shall determine the criminal history category that would have been applicable at the time the defendant originallywas sentenced to the term of supervision. (See the criminal history provisions of§§4A1.1–4B1.4.)

2. Departure from the applicable range of imprisonment in the Revocation Table may bewarranted when the court departed from the applicable range for reasons set forth in§4A1.3 (Departures Based on Inadequacy of Criminal History Category) in originally imposing the sentence that resulted in supervision. Additionally, an upward departure maybe warranted when a defendant, subsequent to the federal sentence resulting in supervision, has been sentenced for an offense that is not the basis of the violation proceeding.

3. In the case of a Grade C violation that is associated with a high risk of new feloniousconduct (e.g., a defendant, under supervision for conviction of criminal sexual abuse, violates the condition that the defendant not associate with children by loitering near a schoolyard), an upward departure may be warranted.

4. Where the original sentence was the result of a downward departure (e.g., as a rewardfor substantial assistance), or a charge reduction that resulted in a sentence below the guideline range applicable to the defendant’s underlying conduct, an upward departuremay be warranted.

5. Upon a finding that a defendant violated a condition of probation or supervised releaseby being in possession of a controlled substance or firearm or by refusing to comply with a condition requiring drug testing, the court is required to revoke probation or supervisedrelease and impose a sentence that includes a term of imprisonment. 18 U.S.C.

§§ 3565(b), 3583(g).

6. In the case of a defendant who fails a drug test, the court shall consider whether the availability of appropriate substance abuse programs, or a defendant’s current or pastparticipation in such programs, warrants an exception from the requirement of mandatory revocation and imprisonment under 18 U.S.C. §§ 3565(b) and 3583(g). 18 U.S.C.

§§ 3563(a), 3583(d).

§7B1.5§7B1.5. No Credit for Time Under Supervision (Policy Statement)(a) Upon revocation of probation, no credit shall be given (toward anysentence of imprisonment imposed) for any portion of the term ofprobation served prior to revocation.

(b) Upon revocation of supervised release, no credit shall be given (toward any term of imprisonment ordered) for time previously servedon post-release supervision.

(c) Provided, that in the case of a person serving a period of supervisedrelease on a foreign sentence under the provisions of 18 U.S.C.

§ 4106A, credit shall be given for time on supervision prior to revocation, except that no credit shall be given for any time in escape orabsconder status.

CommentaryApplication Note:1. Subsection (c) implements 18 U.S.C. § 4106A(b)(1)(C), which provides that the combinedperiods of imprisonment and supervised release in transfer treaty cases shall not exceedthe term of imprisonment imposed by the foreign court.

Background: This section provides that time served on probation or supervised release is not to be credited in the determination of any term of imprisonment imposed upon revocation.

Other aspects of the defendant’s conduct, such as compliance with supervision conditions andadjustment while under supervision, appropriately may be considered by the court in the determination of the sentence to be imposed within the applicable revocation range.
