<h3>§4A1.1</h3>
<h3>CRIMINAL HISTORY AND CRIMINAL LIVELIHOOD</h3>
<h3>PART A ― CRIMINAL HISTORY</h3>
<h5>Introductory Commentary</h5>
<p>The Comprehensive Crime Control Act sets forth four purposes of sentencing. (See18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(2).) A defendant’s record of past criminal conduct is directly relevant tothose purposes. A defendant with a record of prior criminal behavior is more culpable than a first offender and thus deserving of greater punishment. General deterrence of criminal conduct dictates that a clear message be sent to society that repeated criminal behavior will aggravate the need for punishment with each recurrence. To protect the public from furthercrimes of the particular defendant, the likelihood of recidivism and future criminal behaviormust be considered. Repeated criminal behavior is an indicator of a limited likelihood of successful rehabilitation.</p>
<p>The specific factors included in §4A1.1 and §4A1.3 are consistent with the extant empirical research assessing correlates of recidivism and patterns of career criminal behavior. Whileempirical research has shown that other factors are correlated highly with the likelihood ofrecidivism, e.g., age and drug abuse, for policy reasons they were not included here at this time. The Commission has made no definitive judgment as to the reliability of the existingdata. However, the Commission will review additional data insofar as they become availablein the future.</p>

<p>§4A1.1. Criminal History CategoryThe total points from subsections (a) through (e) determine the criminal history category in the Sentencing Table in Chapter Five, Part A.</p>
<p>(a) Add 3 points for each prior sentence of imprisonment exceeding oneyear and one month.</p>
<p>(b) Add 2 points for each prior sentence of imprisonment of at leastsixty days not counted in (a).</p>
<p>© Add 1 point for each prior sentence not counted in (a) or (b), up to a total of 4 points for this subsection.</p>
<p>§4A1.1(d) Add 2 points if the defendant committed the instant offense whileunder any criminal justice sentence, including probation, parole, supervised release, imprisonment, work release, or escape status.</p>
<p>(e) Add 1 point for each prior sentence resulting from a conviction of a crime of violence that did not receive any points under (a), (b), or ©above because such sentence was treated as a single sentence, up toa total of 3 points for this subsection.</p>
<p>CommentaryThe total criminal history points from §4A1.1 determine the criminal history category(I–VI) in the Sentencing Table in Chapter Five, Part A. The definitions and instructions in§4A1.2 govern the computation of the criminal history points. Therefore, §§4A1.1 and 4A1.2must be read together. The following notes highlight the interaction of §§4A1.1 and 4A1.2.</p>
<p>Application Notes:1. §4A1.1(a). Three points are added for each prior sentence of imprisonment exceeding oneyear and one month. There is no limit to the number of points that may be counted underthis subsection. The term “prior sentence” is defined at §4A1.2(a). The term “sentenceof imprisonment” is defined at §4A1.2(b). Where a prior sentence of imprisonment resulted from a revocation of probation, parole, or a similar form of release, see §4A1.2(k).</p>
<p>Certain prior sentences are not counted or are counted only under certain conditions:A sentence imposed more than fifteen years prior to the defendant’s commencementof the instant offense is not counted unless the defendant’s incarceration extendedinto this fifteen-year period. See §4A1.2(e).</p>
<p>A sentence imposed for an offense committed prior to the defendant’s eighteenthbirthday is counted under this subsection only if it resulted from an adult conviction. See §4A1.2(d).</p>
<p>A sentence for a foreign conviction, a conviction that has been expunged, or an invalid conviction is not counted. See §4A1.2(h) and (j) and the Commentary to§4A1.2.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>§4A1.1(b). Two points are added for each prior sentence of imprisonment of at least sixtydays not counted in §4A1.1(a). There is no limit to the number of points that may becounted under this subsection. The term “prior sentence” is defined at §4A1.2(a). Theterm “sentence of imprisonment” is defined at §4A1.2(b). Where a prior sentence ofimprisonment resulted from a revocation of probation, parole, or a similar form of release, see §4A1.2(k).</li>
</ol>
<p>Certain prior sentences are not counted or are counted only under certain conditions:A sentence imposed more than ten years prior to the defendant’s commencement ofthe instant offense is not counted. See §4A1.2(e).</p>
<p>§4A1.1An adult or juvenile sentence imposed for an offense committed prior to the defendant’s eighteenth birthday is counted only if confinement resulting from such sentence extended into the five-year period preceding the defendant’s commencementof the instant offense. See §4A1.2(d).</p>
<p>Sentences for certain specified non-felony offenses are never counted. See§4A1.2©(2).</p>
<p>A sentence for a foreign conviction or a tribal court conviction, an expunged conviction, or an invalid conviction is not counted. See §4A1.2(h), (i), (j), and the Commentary to §4A1.2.</p>
<p>A military sentence is counted only if imposed by a general or special court-martial.</p>
<p>See §4A1.2(g).</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>§4A1.1©. One point is added for each prior sentence not counted under §4A1.1(a) or (b).</li>
</ol>
<p>A maximum of four points may be counted under this subsection. The term “prior sentence” is defined at §4A1.2(a).</p>
<p>Certain prior sentences are not counted or are counted only under certain conditions:A sentence imposed more than ten years prior to the defendant’s commencement ofthe instant offense is not counted. See §4A1.2(e).</p>
<p>An adult or juvenile sentence imposed for an offense committed prior to the defendant’s eighteenth birthday is counted only if imposed within five years of the defendant’s commencement of the current offense. See §4A1.2(d).</p>
<p>Sentences for certain specified non-felony offenses are counted only if they meetcertain requirements. See §4A1.2©(1).</p>
<p>Sentences for certain specified non-felony offenses are never counted. See§4A1.2©(2).</p>
<p>A diversionary disposition is counted only where there is a finding or admission ofguilt in a judicial proceeding. See §4A1.2(f).</p>
<p>A sentence for a foreign conviction, a tribal court conviction, an expunged conviction, or an invalid conviction, is not counted. See §4A1.2(h), (i), (j), and the Commentary to §4A1.2.</p>
<p>A military sentence is counted only if imposed by a general or special court-martial.</p>
<p>See §4A1.2(g).</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><p>§4A1.1(d). Two points are added if the defendant committed any part of the instant offense (i.e., any relevant conduct) while under any criminal justice sentence, includingprobation, parole, supervised release, imprisonment, work release, or escape status. Failure to report for service of a sentence of imprisonment is to be treated as an escape fromsuch sentence. See §4A1.2(n). For the purposes of this subsection, a “criminal justicesentence” means a sentence countable under §4A1.2 (Definitions and Instructions for Computing Criminal History) having a custodial or supervisory component, although active supervision is not required for this subsection to apply. For example, a term of unsupervised probation would be included; but a sentence to pay a fine, by itself, would not be included. A defendant who commits the instant offense while a violation warrant from§4A1.1a prior sentence is outstanding (e.g., a probation, parole, or supervised release violationwarrant) shall be deemed to be under a criminal justice sentence for the purposes of this provision if that sentence is otherwise countable, even if that sentence would have expired absent such warrant. See §4A1.2(m).</p></li>
<li><p>§4A1.1(e). In a case in which the defendant received two or more prior sentences as a result of convictions for crimes of violence that are treated as a single sentence(see §4A1.2(a)(2)), one point is added under §4A1.1(e) for each such sentence that did not result in any additional points under §4A1.1(a), (b), or ©. A total of up to 3 points maybe added under §4A1.1(e). For purposes of this guideline, “crime of violence” has the meaning given that term in §4B1.2(a). See §4A1.2§.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>For example, a defendant’s criminal history includes two robbery convictions for offensescommitted on different occasions. The sentences for these offenses were imposed on the same day and are treated as a single prior sentence. See §4A1.2(a)(2). If the defendantreceived a five-year sentence of imprisonment for one robbery and a four-year sentenceof imprisonment for the other robbery (consecutively or concurrently), a total of 3 pointsis added under §4A1.1(a). An additional point is added under §4A1.1(e) because the second sentence did not result in any additional point(s) (under §4A1.1(a), (b), or ©). In contrast, if the defendant received a one-year sentence of imprisonment for one robberyand a nine-month consecutive sentence of imprisonment for the other robbery, a total of3 points also is added under §4A1.1(a) (a one-year sentence of imprisonment and a consecutive nine-month sentence of imprisonment are treated as a combined one-year-ninemonth sentence of imprisonment). But no additional point is added under §4A1.1(e) because the sentence for the second robbery already resulted in an additional point under§4A1.1(a). Without the second sentence, the defendant would only have received twopoints under §4A1.1(b) for the one-year sentence of imprisonment.</p>
<p>Background: Prior convictions may represent convictions in the federal system, fifty statesystems, the District of Columbia, territories, and foreign, tribal, and military courts. Thereare jurisdictional variations in offense definitions, sentencing structures, and manner of sentence pronouncement. To minimize problems with imperfect measures of past crime seriousness, criminal history categories are based on the maximum term imposed in previous sentences rather than on other measures, such as whether the conviction was designated a felonyor misdemeanor. In recognition of the imperfection of this measure however, §4A1.3 authorizesthe court to depart from the otherwise applicable criminal history category in certain circumstances.</p>
<p>Subsections (a), (b), and © of §4A1.1 distinguish confinement sentences longer than oneyear and one month, shorter confinement sentences of at least sixty days, and all other sentences, such as confinement sentences of less than sixty days, probation, fines, and residencyin a halfway house.</p>
<p>Section 4A1.1(d) adds two points if the defendant was under a criminal justice sentenceduring any part of the instant offense.</p>

<p>§4A1.2§4A1.2. Definitions and Instructions for Computing Criminal History(a) PRIOR SENTENCE(1) The term “prior sentence” means any sentence previously imposed upon adjudication of guilt, whether by guilty plea, trial, or plea of nolo contendere, for conduct not part of the instantoffense.</p>
<p>(2) If the defendant has multiple prior sentences, determinewhether those sentences are counted separately or treated asa single sentence. Prior sentences always are counted separately if the sentences were imposed for offenses that were separated by an intervening arrest (i.e., the defendant is arrestedfor the first offense prior to committing the second offense). Ifthere is no intervening arrest, prior sentences are counted separately unless (A) the sentences resulted from offenses contained in the same charging instrument; or (B) the sentenceswere imposed on the same day. Treat any prior sentence covered by (A) or (B) as a single sentence. See also §4A1.1(e).</p>
<p>For purposes of applying §4A1.1(a), (b), and ©, if prior sentences are treated as a single sentence, use the longest sentence of imprisonment if concurrent sentences were imposed.</p>
<p>If consecutive sentences were imposed, use the aggregate sentence of imprisonment.</p>
<p>(3) A conviction for which the imposition or execution of sentencewas totally suspended or stayed shall be counted as a prior sentence under §4A1.1©.</p>
<p>(4) Where a defendant has been convicted of an offense, but not yet sentenced, such conviction shall be counted as if it constituted a prior sentence under §4A1.1© if a sentence resultingfrom that conviction otherwise would be countable. In the caseof a conviction for an offense set forth in §4A1.2©(1), apply this provision only where the sentence for such offense would becountable regardless of type or length.</p>
<p>“Convicted of an offense,” for the purposes of this provision, means that the guilt of the defendant has been established, whether by guilty plea, trial, or plea of nolo contendere.</p>
<p>§4A1.2(b) SENTENCE OF IMPRISONMENT DEFINED(1) The term “sentence of imprisonment” means a sentence of incarceration and refers to the maximum sentence imposed.</p>
<p>(2) If part of a sentence of imprisonment was suspended, “sentenceof imprisonment” refers only to the portion that was not suspended.</p>
<p>© SENTENCES COUNTED AND EXCLUDEDSentences for all felony offenses are counted. Sentences for misdemeanor and petty offenses are counted, except as follows:(1) Sentences for the following prior offenses and offenses similarto them, by whatever name they are known, are counted onlyif (A) the sentence was a term of probation of more than oneyear or a term of imprisonment of at least thirty days, or (B)the prior offense was similar to an instant offense:Careless or reckless drivingContempt of courtDisorderly conduct or disturbing the peaceDriving without a license or with a revoked or suspendedlicenseFalse information to a police officerGamblingHindering or failure to obey a police officerInsufficient funds checkLeaving the scene of an accidentNon-supportProstitutionResisting arrestTrespassing.</p>
<p>(2) Sentences for the following prior offenses and offenses similarto them, by whatever name they are known, are never counted:Fish and game violationsHitchhikingJuvenile status offenses and truancyLocal ordinance violations (except those violations thatare also violations under state criminal law)LoiteringMinor traffic infractions (e.g., speeding)Public intoxicationVagrancy.</p>
<p>§4A1.2(d) OFFENSES COMMITTED PRIOR TO AGE EIGHTEEN(1) If the defendant was convicted as an adult and received a sentence of imprisonment exceeding one year and one month, add3 points under §4A1.1(a) for each such sentence.</p>
<p>(2) In any other case, (A) add 2 points under §4A1.1(b) for each adult or juvenilesentence to confinement of at least sixty days if the defendant was released from such confinement within fiveyears of his commencement of the instant offense;(B) add 1 point under §4A1.1© for each adult or juvenile sentence imposed within five years of the defendant’s commencement of the instant offense not covered in (A).</p>
<p>(e) APPLICABLE TIME PERIOD(1) Any prior sentence of imprisonment exceeding one year andone month that was imposed within fifteen years of the defendant’s commencement of the instant offense is counted. Alsocount any prior sentence of imprisonment exceeding one yearand one month, whenever imposed, that resulted in the defendant being incarcerated during any part of such fifteen-year period.</p>
<p>(2) Any other prior sentence that was imposed within ten years ofthe defendant’s commencement of the instant offense is counted.</p>
<p>(3) Any prior sentence not within the time periods specified aboveis not counted.</p>
<p>(4) The applicable time period for certain sentences resulting fromoffenses committed prior to age eighteen is governed by§4A1.2(d)(2).</p>
<p>(f) DIVERSIONARY DISPOSITIONSDiversion from the judicial process without a finding of guilt(e.g., deferred prosecution) is not counted. A diversionary disposition resulting from a finding or admission of guilt, or a plea of nolocontendere, in a judicial proceeding is counted as a sentence under§4A1.1© even if a conviction is not formally entered, except thatdiversion from juvenile court is not counted.</p>
<p>§4A1.2(g) MILITARY SENTENCESSentences resulting from military offenses are counted if imposedby a general or special court-martial. Sentences imposed by a summary court-martial or Article 15 proceeding are not counted.</p>
<p>(h) FOREIGN SENTENCESSentences resulting from foreign convictions are not counted, butmay be considered under §4A1.3 (Adequacy of Criminal HistoryCategory).</p>
<p>(i) TRIBAL COURT SENTENCESSentences resulting from tribal court convictions are not counted, but may be considered under §4A1.3 (Adequacy of Criminal HistoryCategory).</p>
<p>(j) EXPUNGED CONVICTIONSSentences for expunged convictions are not counted, but may be considered under §4A1.3 (Adequacy of Criminal History Category).</p>
<p>(k) REVOCATIONS OF PROBATION, PAROLE, MANDATORY RELEASE, OR SUPERVISED RELEASE(1) In the case of a prior revocation of probation, parole, supervisedrelease, special parole, or mandatory release, add the originalterm of imprisonment to any term of imprisonment imposedupon revocation. The resulting total is used to compute the criminal history points for §4A1.1(a), (b), or ©, as applicable.</p>
<p>(2) Revocation of probation, parole, supervised release, special parole, or mandatory release may affect the time period underwhich certain sentences are counted as provided in§4A1.2(d)(2) and (e). For the purposes of determining the applicable time period, use the following: (A) in the case of anadult term of imprisonment totaling more than one year andone month, the date of last release from incarceration on suchsentence (see §4A1.2(e)(1)); (B) in the case of any other confinement sentence for an offense committed prior to the defendant’s eighteenth birthday, the date of the defendant’s last release from confinement on such sentence (see §4A1.2(d)(2)(A));and © in any other case, the date of the original sentence(see §4A1.2(d)(2)(B) and (e)(2)).</p>
<p>§4A1.2(l) SENTENCES ON APPEALPrior sentences under appeal are counted except as expressly provided below. In the case of a prior sentence, the execution of whichhas been stayed pending appeal, §4A1.1(a), (b), ©, (d), and (e) shallapply as if the execution of such sentence had not been stayed.</p>
<p>(m) EFFECT OF A VIOLATION WARRANTFor the purposes of §4A1.1(d), a defendant who commits the instantoffense while a violation warrant from a prior sentence is outstanding (e.g., a probation, parole, or supervised release violation warrant) shall be deemed to be under a criminal justice sentence if thatsentence is otherwise countable, even if that sentence would haveexpired absent such warrant.</p>
<p>(n) FAILURE TO REPORT FOR SERVICE OF SENTENCE OF IMPRISONMENTFor the purposes of §4A1.1(d), failure to report for service of a sentence of imprisonment shall be treated as an escape from such sentence.</p>
<p>(o) FELONY OFFENSEFor the purposes of §4A1.2©, a “felony offense” means any federal, state, or local offense punishable by death or a term of imprisonment exceeding one year, regardless of the actual sentence imposed.</p>
<p>§ CRIME OF VIOLENCE DEFINEDFor the purposes of §4A1.1(e), the definition of “crime of violence” is that set forth in §4B1.2(a).</p>
<p>CommentaryApplication Notes:1. Prior Sentence.—“Prior sentence” means a sentence imposed prior to sentencing onthe instant offense, other than a sentence for conduct that is part of the instant offense.</p>
<p>See §4A1.2(a). A sentence imposed after the defendant’s commencement of the instantoffense, but prior to sentencing on the instant offense, is a prior sentence if it was for conduct other than conduct that was part of the instant offense. Conduct that is part ofthe instant offense means conduct that is relevant conduct to the instant offense underthe provisions of §1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct).</p>
<p>Under §4A1.2(a)(4), a conviction for which the defendant has not yet been sentenced is treated as if it were a prior sentence under §4A1.1© if a sentence resulting from suchconviction otherwise would have been counted. In the case of an offense set forth in§4A1.2©(1) (which lists certain misdemeanor and petty offenses), a conviction for whichthe defendant has not yet been sentenced is treated as if it were a prior sentence under§4A1.2§4A1.2(a)(4) only where the offense is similar to the instant offense (because sentencesfor other offenses set forth in §4A1.2©(1) are counted only if they are of a specified typeand length).</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><p>Sentence of Imprisonment.—To qualify as a sentence of imprisonment, the defendantmust have actually served a period of imprisonment on such sentence (or, if the defendantescaped, would have served time). See §4A1.2(a)(3) and (b)(2). For the purposes of applying §4A1.1(a), (b), or ©, the length of a sentence of imprisonment is the stated maximum(e.g., in the case of a determinate sentence of five years, the stated maximum is five years;in the case of an indeterminate sentence of one to five years, the stated maximum is fiveyears; in the case of an indeterminate sentence for a term not to exceed five years, the stated maximum is five years; in the case of an indeterminate sentence for a term not toexceed the defendant’s twenty-first birthday, the stated maximum is the amount of timein pre-trial detention plus the amount of time between the date of sentence and the defendant’s twenty-first birthday). That is, criminal history points are based on the sentence pronounced, not the length of time actually served. See §4A1.2(b)(1) and (2). A sentence of probation is to be treated as a sentence under §4A1.1© unless a condition ofprobation requiring imprisonment of at least sixty days was imposed.</p></li>
<li><p>Application of “Single Sentence” Rule (Subsection (a)(2)).—(A) Predicate Offenses.—In some cases, multiple prior sentences are treated as a single sentence for purposes of calculating the criminal history score under §4A1.1(a), (b), and ©. However, for purposes of determining predicate offenses, a prior sentence included in the single sentence should be treated as if it received criminal history points, if it independently would have received criminal history points.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Therefore, an individual prior sentence may serve as a predicate under the careeroffender guideline (see §4B1.2©) or other guidelines with predicate offenses, if itindependently would have received criminal history points. However, because predicate offenses may be used only if they are counted “separately” from each other(see §4B1.2©), no more than one prior sentence in a given single sentence may beused as a predicate offense.</p>
<p>For example, a defendant’s criminal history includes one robbery conviction andone theft conviction. The sentences for these offenses were imposed on the sameday, eight years ago, and are treated as a single sentence under §4A1.2(a)(2). If the defendant received a one-year sentence of imprisonment for the robbery and a twoyear sentence of imprisonment for the theft, to be served concurrently, a total of3 points is added under §4A1.1(a). Because this particular robbery met the definition of a felony crime of violence and independently would have received 2 criminal history points under §4A1.1(b), it may serve as a predicate under the career offenderguideline.</p>
<p>Note, however, that if the sentences in the example above were imposed thirteenyears ago, the robbery independently would have received no criminal historypoints under §4A1.1(b), because it was not imposed within ten years of the defendant’s commencement of the instant offense. See §4A1.2(e)(2). Accordingly, it maynot serve as a predicate under the career offender guideline.</p>
<p>(B) Upward Departure Provision.—Treating multiple prior sentences as a singlesentence may result in a criminal history score that underrepresents the seriousness of the defendant’s criminal history and the danger that the defendant presentsto the public. In such a case, an upward departure may be warranted. For example, if a defendant was convicted of a number of serious non-violent offenses committed§4A1.2on different occasions, and the resulting sentences were treated as a single sentencebecause either the sentences resulted from offenses contained in the same charginginstrument or the defendant was sentenced for these offenses on the same day, the assignment of a single set of points may not adequately reflect the seriousness ofthe defendant’s criminal history or the frequency with which the defendant hascommitted crimes.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><p>Sentences Imposed in the Alternative.—A sentence which specifies a fine or othernon-incarcerative disposition as an alternative to a term of imprisonment (e.g., $1,000fine or ninety days’ imprisonment) is treated as a non-imprisonment sentence.</p></li>
<li><p>Sentences for Driving While Intoxicated or Under the Influence.—Convictionsfor driving while intoxicated or under the influence (and similar offenses by whatevername they are known) are always counted, without regard to how the offense is classified.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Paragraphs (1) and (2) of §4A1.2© do not apply.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>Reversed, Vacated, or Invalidated Convictions.—Sentences resulting from convictions that (A) have been reversed or vacated because of errors of law or because of subsequently discovered evidence exonerating the defendant, or (B) have been ruled constitutionally invalid in a prior case are not to be counted. With respect to the current sentencing proceeding, this guideline and commentary do not confer upon the defendant anyright to attack collaterally a prior conviction or sentence beyond any such rights otherwise recognized in law (e.g., 21 U.S.C. § 851 expressly provides that a defendant maycollaterally attack certain prior convictions).</li>
</ol>
<p>Nonetheless, the criminal conduct underlying any conviction that is not counted in the criminal history score may be considered pursuant to §4A1.3 (Adequacy of Criminal History Category).</p>
<ol start="7">
<li>Offenses Committed Prior to Age Eighteen.—Section 4A1.2(d) covers offenses committed prior to age eighteen. Attempting to count every juvenile adjudication would havethe potential for creating large disparities due to the differential availability of records.</li>
</ol>
<p>Therefore, for offenses committed prior to age eighteen, only those that resulted in adultsentences of imprisonment exceeding one year and one month, or resulted in impositionof an adult or juvenile sentence or release from confinement on that sentence within fiveyears of the defendant’s commencement of the instant offense are counted. To avoid disparities from jurisdiction to jurisdiction in the age at which a defendant is considered a “juvenile,” this provision applies to all offenses committed prior to age eighteen.</p>
<ol start="8">
<li><p>Applicable Time Period.—Section 4A1.2(d)(2) and (e) establishes the time periodwithin which prior sentences are counted. As used in §4A1.2(d)(2) and (e), the term “commencement of the instant offense” includes any relevant conduct. See §1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct). If the court finds that a sentence imposed outside this time period is evidence of similar, or serious dissimilar, criminal conduct, the court may consider this information in determining whether an upward departure is warranted under §4A1.3 (Adequacy of Criminal History Category).</p></li>
<li><p>Diversionary Dispositions.—Section 4A1.2(f) requires counting prior adult diversionary dispositions if they involved a judicial determination of guilt or an admission of guiltin open court. This reflects a policy that defendants who receive the benefit of a rehabilitative sentence and continue to commit crimes should not be treated with further leniency.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>§4A1.210. Convictions Set Aside or Defendant Pardoned.—A number of jurisdictions havevarious procedures pursuant to which previous convictions may be set aside or the defendant may be pardoned for reasons unrelated to innocence or errors of law, e.g., in orderto restore civil rights or to remove the stigma associated with a criminal conviction. Sentences resulting from such convictions are to be counted. However, expunged convictionsare not counted. §4A1.2(j).</p>
<ol start="11">
<li>Revocations to be Considered.—Section 4A1.2(k) covers revocations of probation andother conditional sentences where the original term of imprisonment imposed, if any, didnot exceed one year and one month. Rather than count the original sentence and the resentence after revocation as separate sentences, the sentence given upon revocationshould be added to the original sentence of imprisonment, if any, and the total should becounted as if it were one sentence. By this approach, no more than three points will beassessed for a single conviction, even if probation or conditional release was subsequentlyrevoked. If the sentence originally imposed, the sentence imposed upon revocation, or the total of both sentences exceeded one year and one month, the maximum three pointswould be assigned. If, however, at the time of revocation another sentence was imposedfor a new criminal conviction, that conviction would be computed separately from the sentence imposed for the revocation.</li>
</ol>
<p>Where a revocation applies to multiple sentences, and such sentences are counted separately under §4A1.2(a)(2), add the term of imprisonment imposed upon revocation to the sentence that will result in the greatest increase in criminal history points. Example: Adefendant was serving two probationary sentences, each counted separately under§4A1.2(a)(2); probation was revoked on both sentences as a result of the same violationconduct; and the defendant was sentenced to a total of 45 days of imprisonment. If onesentence had been a “straight” probationary sentence and the other had been a probationary sentence that had required service of 15 days of imprisonment, the revocationterm of imprisonment (45 days) would be added to the probationary sentence that hadthe 15-day term of imprisonment. This would result in a total of 2 criminal history pointsunder §4A1.1(b) (for the combined 60-day term of imprisonment) and 1 criminal historypoint under §4A1.1© (for the other probationary sentence).</p>
<ol start="12">
<li>Application of Subsection ©.—(A) In General.—In determining whether an unlisted offense is similar to an offenselisted in subsection ©(1) or ©(2), the court should use a common sense approachthat includes consideration of relevant factors such as (i) a comparison of punishments imposed for the listed and unlisted offenses; (ii) the perceived seriousness ofthe offense as indicated by the level of punishment; (iii) the elements of the offense;(iv) the level of culpability involved; and (v) the degree to which the commission ofthe offense indicates a likelihood of recurring criminal conduct.</li>
</ol>
<p>(B) Local Ordinance Violations.—A number of local jurisdictions have enacted ordinances covering certain offenses (e.g., larceny and assault misdemeanors) that arealso violations of state criminal law. This enables a local court (e.g., a municipalcourt) to exercise jurisdiction over such offenses. Such offenses are excluded fromthe definition of local ordinance violations in §4A1.2©(2) and, therefore, sentencesfor such offenses are to be treated as if the defendant had been convicted understate law.</p>
<p>© Insufficient Funds Check.—“Insufficient funds check,” as used in§4A1.2©(1), does not include any conviction establishing that the defendant useda false name or non-existent account.</p>
<p>§4A1.3Background: Prior sentences, not otherwise excluded, are to be counted in the criminal history score, including uncounseled misdemeanor sentences where imprisonment was not imposed.</p>

<p>§4A1.3. Departures Based on Inadequacy of Criminal History Category(Policy Statement)(a) UPWARD DEPARTURES.—(1) STANDARD FOR UPWARD DEPARTURE.—If reliable informationindicates that the defendant’s criminal history category substantially under-represents the seriousness of the defendant’scriminal history or the likelihood that the defendant will commit other crimes, an upward departure may be warranted.</p>
<p>(2) TYPES OF INFORMATION FORMING THE BASIS FOR UPWARD DEPARTURE.—The information described in subsection (a) may include information concerning the following:(A) Prior sentence(s) not used in computing the criminal history category (e.g., sentences for foreign and tribal offenses).</p>
<p>(B) Prior sentence(s) of substantially more than one year imposed as a result of independent crimes committed on different occasions.</p>
<p>© Prior similar misconduct established by a civil adjudication or by a failure to comply with an administrative order.</p>
<p>(D) Whether the defendant was pending trial or sentencing onanother charge at the time of the instant offense.</p>
<p>(E) Prior similar adult criminal conduct not resulting in a criminal conviction.</p>
<p>(3) PROHIBITION.—A prior arrest record itself shall not be considered for purposes of an upward departure under this policystatement.</p>
<p>§4A1.3(4) DETERMINATION OF EXTENT OF UPWARD DEPARTURE.—(A) IN GENERAL.—Except as provided in subdivision (B), the court shall determine the extent of a departure under this subsection by using, as a reference, the criminal historycategory applicable to defendants whose criminal historyor likelihood to recidivate most closely resembles that ofthe defendant’s.</p>
<p>(B) UPWARD DEPARTURES FROM CATEGORY VI.—In a case inwhich the court determines that the extent and nature ofthe defendant’s criminal history, taken together, are sufficient to warrant an upward departure from CriminalHistory Category VI, the court should structure the departure by moving incrementally down the sentencing tableto the next higher offense level in Criminal History Category VI until it finds a guideline range appropriate to the case.</p>
<p>(b) DOWNWARD DEPARTURES.—(1) STANDARD FOR DOWNWARD DEPARTURE.—If reliable information indicates that the defendant’s criminal history categorysubstantially over-represents the seriousness of the defendant’s criminal history or the likelihood that the defendant willcommit other crimes, a downward departure may be warranted.</p>
<p>(2) PROHIBITIONS.—(A) CRIMINAL HISTORY CATEGORY I.—A departure below the lower limit of the applicable guideline range for CriminalHistory Category I is prohibited.</p>
<p>(B) ARMED CAREER CRIMINAL AND REPEAT AND DANGEROUS SEXOFFENDER.—A downward departure under this subsectionis prohibited for (i) an armed career criminal within the meaning of §4B1.4 (Armed Career Criminal); and (ii) a repeat and dangerous sex offender against minors withinthe meaning of §4B1.5 (Repeat and Dangerous Sex Offender Against Minors).</p>
<p>(3) LIMITATIONS.—(A) LIMITATION ON EXTENT OF DOWNWARD DEPARTURE FOR CAREER OFFENDER.—The extent of a downward departure§4A1.3under this subsection for a career offender within the meaning of §4B1.1 (Career Offender) may not exceed onecriminal history category.</p>
<p>(B) LIMITATION ON APPLICABILITY OF §5C1.2 IN EVENT OFDOWNWARD DEPARTURE TO CATEGORY I.—A defendantwhose criminal history category is Category I after receiptof a downward departure under this subsection does not meet the criterion of subsection (a)(1) of §5C1.2 (Limitation on Applicability of Statutory Maximum Sentences inCertain Cases) if, before receipt of the downward departure, the defendant had more than one criminal historypoint under §4A1.1 (Criminal History Category).</p>
<p>© WRITTEN SPECIFICATION OF BASIS FOR DEPARTURE.—In departingfrom the otherwise applicable criminal history category under this policy statement, the court shall specify in writing the following:(1) In the case of an upward departure, the specific reasons whythe applicable criminal history category substantially underrepresents the seriousness of the defendant’s criminal historyor the likelihood that the defendant will commit other crimes.</p>
<p>(2) In the case of a downward departure, the specific reasons whythe applicable criminal history category substantially over-represents the seriousness of the defendant’s criminal history orthe likelihood that the defendant will commit other crimes.</p>
<p>CommentaryApplication Notes:1. Definitions.—For purposes of this policy statement, the terms “depart”, “departure”, “downward departure”, and “upward departure” have the meaning given thoseterms in Application Note 1 of the Commentary to §1B1.1 (Application Instructions).</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Upward Departures.—(A) Examples.—An upward departure from the defendant’s criminal history categorymay be warranted based on any of the following circumstances:(i) A previous foreign sentence for a serious offense.</li>
</ol>
<p>(ii) Receipt of a prior consolidated sentence of ten years for a series of seriousassaults.</p>
<p>(iii) A similar instance of large scale fraudulent misconduct established by an adjudication in a Securities and Exchange Commission enforcement proceeding.</p>
<p>(iv) Commission of the instant offense while on bail or pretrial release for anotherserious offense.</p>
<p>§4A1.3(B) Upward Departures from Criminal History Category VI.—In the case of anegregious, serious criminal record in which even the guideline range for CriminalHistory Category VI is not adequate to reflect the seriousness of the defendant’scriminal history, a departure above the guideline range for a defendant with Criminal History Category VI may be warranted. In determining whether an upwarddeparture from Criminal History Category VI is warranted, the court should consider that the nature of the prior offenses rather than simply their number is oftenmore indicative of the seriousness of the defendant’s criminal record. For example, a defendant with five prior sentences for very large-scale fraud offenses may have15 criminal history points, within the range of points typical for Criminal HistoryCategory VI, yet have a substantially more serious criminal history overall becauseof the nature of the prior offenses.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Downward Departures.—A downward departure from the defendant’s criminal history category may be warranted if, for example, the defendant had two minor misdemeanor convictions close to ten years prior to the instant offense and no other evidenceof prior criminal behavior in the intervening period. A departure below the lower limit ofthe applicable guideline range for Criminal History Category I is prohibited under subsection (b)(2)(B), due to the fact that the lower limit of the guideline range for CriminalHistory Category I is set for a first offender with the lowest risk of recidivism.</li>
</ol>
<p>Background: This policy statement recognizes that the criminal history score is unlikely totake into account all the variations in the seriousness of criminal history that may occur. Forexample, a defendant with an extensive record of serious, assaultive conduct who had receivedwhat might now be considered extremely lenient treatment in the past might have the samecriminal history category as a defendant who had a record of less serious conduct. Yet, the firstdefendant’s criminal history clearly may be more serious. This may be particularly true in the case of younger defendants (e.g., defendants in their early twenties or younger) who are morelikely to have received repeated lenient treatment, yet who may actually pose a greater risk ofserious recidivism than older defendants. This policy statement authorizes the considerationof a departure from the guidelines in the limited circumstances where reliable informationindicates that the criminal history category does not adequately reflect the seriousness of the defendant’s criminal history or likelihood of recidivism, and provides guidance for the consideration of such departures.</p>

<p>§4B1.1PART B ― CAREER OFFENDERS AND CRIMINAL LIVELIHOOD§4B1.1.

<p>CommentaryApplication Notes:1. Definitions.—“Crime of violence,” “controlled substance offense,” and “two priorfelony convictions” are defined in §4B1.2.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>“Offense Statutory Maximum”.—“Offense Statutory Maximum,” for the purposesof this guideline, refers to the maximum term of imprisonment authorized for the offenseof conviction that is a crime of violence or controlled substance offense, including anyincrease in that maximum term under a sentencing enhancement provision that appliesbecause of the defendant’s prior criminal record (such sentencing enhancement provisions are contained, for example, in 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(A), (B), ©, and (D)). For example, in a case in which the statutory maximum term of imprisonment under 21 U.S.C.</li>
</ol>
<p>§ 841(b)(1)© is increased from twenty years to thirty years because the defendant hasone or more qualifying prior drug convictions, the “Offense Statutory Maximum” for thatdefendant for the purposes of this guideline is thirty years and not twenty years. If morethan one count of conviction is of a crime of violence or controlled substance offense, usethe maximum authorized term of imprisonment for the count that has the greatest offense statutory maximum.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Application of Subsection ©.—(A) In General.—Subsection © applies in any case in which the defendant (i) wasconvicted of violating 18 U.S.C. § 924© or § 929(a); and (ii) as a result of that conviction (alone or in addition to another offense of conviction), is determined to be a career offender under §4B1.1(a).</li>
</ol>
<p>(B) Subsection ©(2).—To determine the greater guideline range under subsection©(2), the court shall use the guideline range with the highest minimum term ofimprisonment.</p>
<p>§4B1.1© “Otherwise Applicable Guideline Range”.—For purposes of subsection©(2)(A), “otherwise applicable guideline range” for the count(s) of conviction otherthan the 18 U.S.C. § 924© or 18 U.S.C. § 929(a) count(s) is determined as follows:(i) If the count(s) of conviction other than the 18 U.S.C. § 924© or 18 U.S.C.</p>
<p>§ 929(a) count(s) does not qualify the defendant as a career offender, the otherwise applicable guideline range for that count(s) is the guideline range determined using: (I) the Chapter Two and Three offense level for that count(s);and (II) the appropriate criminal history category determined under §§4A1.1(Criminal History Category) and 4A1.2 (Definitions and Instructions for Computing Criminal History).</p>
<p>(ii) If the count(s) of conviction other than the 18 U.S.C. § 924© or 18 U.S.C.</p>
<p>§ 929(a) count(s) qualifies the defendant as a career offender, the otherwiseapplicable guideline range for that count(s) is the guideline range determinedfor that count(s) under §4B1.1(a) and (b).</p>
<p>(D) Imposition of Consecutive Term of Imprisonment.—In a case involving multiple counts, the sentence shall be imposed according to the rules in subsection (e)of §5G1.2 (Sentencing on Multiple Counts of Conviction).</p>
<p>(E) Example.—The following example illustrates the application of subsection ©(2) ina multiple count situation:The defendant is convicted of one count of violating 18 U.S.C. § 924© for possessinga firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking offense (5 year mandatory minimum), and one count of violating 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(B) (5 year mandatory minimum, 40 year statutory maximum). Applying subsection ©(2)(A), the court determinesthat the drug count (without regard to the 18 U.S.C. § 924© count) qualifies the defendant as a career offender under §4B1.1(a). Under §4B1.1(a), the otherwise applicable guideline range for the drug count is 188–235 months (using offenselevel 34 (because the statutory maximum for the drug count is 40 years), minus3 levels for acceptance of responsibility, and criminal history category VI). Thecourt adds 60 months (the minimum required by 18 U.S.C. § 924©) to the minimum and the maximum of that range, resulting in a guideline range of 248–295months. Applying subsection ©(2)(B), the court then determines the career offender guideline range from the table in subsection ©(3) is 262–327 months. Therange with the greatest minimum, 262–327 months, is used to impose the sentencein accordance with §5G1.2(e).</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Departure Provision for State Misdemeanors.—In a case in which one or both ofthe defendant’s “two prior felony convictions” is based on an offense that was classifiedas a misdemeanor at the time of sentencing for the instant federal offense, application ofthe career offender guideline may result in a guideline range that substantiallyoverrepresents the seriousness of the defendant’s criminal history or substantially overstates the seriousness of the instant offense. In such a case, a downward departure maybe warranted without regard to the limitation in §4A1.3(b)(3)(A).</li>
</ol>
<p>Background: Section 994(h) of Title 28, United States Code, mandates that the Commissionassure that certain “career” offenders receive a sentence of imprisonment “at or near the maximum term authorized.” Section 4B1.1 implements this directive, with the definition of a career offender tracking in large part the criteria set forth in 28 U.S.C. § 994(h). However, inaccord with its general guideline promulgation authority under 28 U.S.C. § 994(a)–(f), and its§4B1.2amendment authority under 28 U.S.C. § 994(o) and §, the Commission has modified this definition in several respects to focus more precisely on the class of recidivist offenders for whoma lengthy term of imprisonment is appropriate and to avoid “unwarranted sentencing disparities among defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of similar criminal conduct . . . .” 28 U.S.C. § 991(b)(1)(B). The Commission’s refinement of this definition overtime is consistent with Congress’s choice of a directive to the Commission rather than a mandatory minimum sentencing statute (“The [Senate Judiciary] Committee believes that such a directive to the Commission will be more effective; the guidelines development process canassure consistent and rational implementation for the Committee’s view that substantialprison terms should be imposed on repeat violent offenders and repeat drug traffickers.”S. Rep. No. 225, 98th Cong., 1st Sess. 175 (1983)).</p>
<p>Subsection © provides rules for determining the sentence for career offenders who havebeen convicted of 18 U.S.C. § 924© or § 929(a). The Career Offender Table in subsection ©(3)provides a sentence at or near the statutory maximum for these offenders by using guidelineranges that correspond to criminal history category VI and offense level 37 (assuming §3E.1.1(Acceptance of Responsibility) does not apply), offense level 35 (assuming a 2-level reductionunder §3E.1.1 applies), and offense level 34 (assuming a 3-level reduction under §3E1.1 applies).</p>

<p>§4B1.2. Definitions of Terms Used in Section 4B1.1(a) The term “crime of violence” means any offense under federal orstate law, punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding oneyear, that—(1) has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use ofphysical force against the person of another, or(2) is murder, voluntary manslaughter, kidnapping, aggravatedassault, a forcible sex offense, robbery, arson, extortion, or the use or unlawful possession of a firearm described in 26 U.S.C.</p>
<p>§ 5845(a) or explosive material as defined in 18 U.S.C. § 841©.</p>
<p>(b) The term “controlled substance offense” means an offense under federal or state law, punishable by imprisonment for a term exceedingone year, that prohibits the manufacture, import, export, distribution, or dispensing of a controlled substance (or a counterfeit substance) or the possession of a controlled substance (or a counterfeitsubstance) with intent to manufacture, import, export, distribute, or dispense.</p>
<p>§4B1.2© The term “two prior felony convictions” means (1) the defendantcommitted the instant offense of conviction subsequent to sustaining at least two felony convictions of either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense (i.e., two felony convictions of a crimeof violence, two felony convictions of a controlled substance offense, or one felony conviction of a crime of violence and one felony conviction of a controlled substance offense), and (2) the sentences for atleast two of the aforementioned felony convictions are counted separately under the provisions of §4A1.1(a), (b), or ©. The date that a defendant sustained a conviction shall be the date that the guilt ofthe defendant has been established, whether by guilty plea, trial, orplea of nolo contendere.</p>
<p>CommentaryApplication Notes:1. Definitions.—For purposes of this guideline—“Crime of violence” and “controlled substance offense” include the offenses of aidingand abetting, conspiring, and attempting to commit such offenses.</p>
<p>“Forcible sex offense” includes where consent to the conduct is not given or is not legallyvalid, such as where consent to the conduct is involuntary, incompetent, or coerced. Theoffenses of sexual abuse of a minor and statutory rape are included only if the sexualabuse of a minor or statutory rape was (A) an offense described in 18 U.S.C. § 2241© or(B) an offense under state law that would have been an offense under section 2241© ifthe offense had occurred within the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States.</p>
<p>“Extortion” is obtaining something of value from another by the wrongful use of(A) force, (B) fear of physical injury, or © threat of physical injury.</p>
<p>Unlawfully possessing a listed chemical with intent to manufacture a controlled substance (21 U.S.C. § 841©(1)) is a “controlled substance offense.”Unlawfully possessing a prohibited flask or equipment with intent to manufacture a controlled substance (21 U.S.C. § 843(a)(6)) is a “controlled substance offense.”Maintaining any place for the purpose of facilitating a drug offense (21 U.S.C. § 856) is a “controlled substance offense” if the offense of conviction established that the underlyingoffense (the offense facilitated) was a “controlled substance offense.”Using a communications facility in committing, causing, or facilitating a drug offense(21 U.S.C. § 843(b)) is a “controlled substance offense” if the offense of conviction established that the underlying offense (the offense committed, caused, or facilitated) was a “controlled substance offense.”A violation of 18 U.S.C. § 924© or § 929(a) is a “crime of violence” or a “controlled substance offense” if the offense of conviction established that the underlying offense was a “crime of violence” or a “controlled substance offense”. (Note that in the case of a prior§4B1.318 U.S.C. § 924© or § 929(a) conviction, if the defendant also was convicted of the underlying offense, the sentences for the two prior convictions will be treated as a singlesentence under §4A1.2 (Definitions and Instructions for Computing Criminal History).)“Prior felony conviction” means a prior adult federal or state conviction for an offensepunishable by death or imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, regardless ofwhether such offense is specifically designated as a felony and regardless of the actualsentence imposed. A conviction for an offense committed at age eighteen or older is anadult conviction. A conviction for an offense committed prior to age eighteen is an adultconviction if it is classified as an adult conviction under the laws of the jurisdiction inwhich the defendant was convicted (e.g., a federal conviction for an offense committedprior to the defendant’s eighteenth birthday is an adult conviction if the defendant wasexpressly proceeded against as an adult).</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><p>Offense of Conviction as Focus of Inquiry.—Section 4B1.1 (Career Offender) expressly provides that the instant and prior offenses must be crimes of violence or controlled substance offenses of which the defendant was convicted. Therefore, in determining whether an offense is a crime of violence or controlled substance for the purposes of§4B1.1 (Career Offender), the offense of conviction (i.e., the conduct of which the defendant was convicted) is the focus of inquiry.</p></li>
<li><p>Applicability of §4A1.2.—The provisions of §4A1.2 (Definitions and Instructions for Computing Criminal History) are applicable to the counting of convictions under §4B1.1.</p></li>
<li><p>Upward Departure for Burglary Involving Violence.—There may be cases in whicha burglary involves violence, but does not qualify as a “crime of violence” as defined in§4B1.2(a) and, as a result, the defendant does not receive a higher offense level or higherCriminal History Category that would have applied if the burglary qualified as a “crimeof violence.” In such a case, an upward departure may be appropriate.</p></li>

<p>CommentaryApplication Notes:1. “Pattern of criminal conduct” means planned criminal acts occurring over a substantial period of time. Such acts may involve a single course of conduct or independent offenses.</p>
<p>§4B1.42. “Engaged in as a livelihood” means that (A) the defendant derived income from the pattern of criminal conduct that in any twelve-month period exceeded 2,000 times the then existing hourly minimum wage under federal law; and (B) the totality of circumstances shows that such criminal conduct was the defendant’s primary occupation in thattwelve-month period (e.g., the defendant engaged in criminal conduct rather than regular, legitimate employment; or the defendant’s legitimate employment was merely a frontfor the defendant’s criminal conduct).</p>
<p>Background: Section 4B1.3 implements 28 U.S.C. § 994(i)(2), which directs the Commissionto ensure that the guidelines specify a “substantial term of imprisonment” for a defendant whocommitted an offense as part of a pattern of criminal conduct from which the defendant deriveda substantial portion of the defendant’s income.</p>

<p>§4B1.4. Armed Career Criminal(a) A defendant who is subject to an enhanced sentence under the provisions of 18 U.S.C. § 924(e) is an armed career criminal.</p>

<p>© The criminal history category for an armed career criminal is the greatest of:(1) the criminal history category from Chapter Four, Part A (Criminal History), or §4B1.1 (Career Offender) if applicable; or§4B1.4(2) Category VI, if the defendant used or possessed the firearm orammunition in connection with either a crime of violence, asdefined in §4B1.2(a), or a controlled substance offense, as defined in §4B1.2(b), or if the firearm possessed by the defendantwas of a type described in 26 U.S.C. § 5845(a); or(3) Category IV.</p>
<p>CommentaryApplication Notes:1. This guideline applies in the case of a defendant subject to an enhanced sentence under18 U.S.C. § 924(e). Under 18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(1), a defendant is subject to an enhancedsentence if the instant offense of conviction is a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g) and the defendant has at least three prior convictions for a “violent felony” or “serious drug offense,” or both, committed on occasions different from one another. The terms “violentfelony” and “serious drug offense” are defined in 18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(2). It is to be notedthat the definitions of “violent felony” and “serious drug offense” in 18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(2)are not identical to the definitions of “crime of violence” and “controlled substance offense” used in §4B1.1 (Career Offender), nor are the time periods for the counting of priorsentences under §4A1.2 (Definitions and Instructions for Computing Criminal History)applicable to the determination of whether a defendant is subject to an enhanced sentence under 18 U.S.C. § 924(e).</p>
<p>It is also to be noted that the procedural steps relative to the imposition of an enhancedsentence under 18 U.S.C. § 924(e) are not set forth by statute and may vary to someextent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Application of §4B1.4 in Cases Involving Convictions Under 18 U.S.C. § 844(h), § 924©, or § 929(a).—If a sentence under this guideline is imposed in conjunction with a sentence for a conviction under 18 U.S.C. § 844(h), § 924©, or § 929(a), do not applyeither subsection (b)(3)(A) or ©(2). A sentence under 18 U.S.C. § 844(h), § 924©, or§ 929(a) accounts for the conduct covered by subsections (b)(3)(A) and ©(2) because ofthe relatedness of the conduct covered by these subsections to the conduct that forms the basis for the conviction under 18 U.S.C. § 844(h), § 924©, or § 929(a).</li>
</ol>
<p>In a few cases, the rule provided in the preceding paragraph may result in a guidelinerange that, when combined with the mandatory consecutive sentence under 18 U.S.C.</p>
<p>§ 844(h), § 924©, or § 929(a), produces a total maximum penalty that is less than the maximum of the guideline range that would have resulted had there not been a count ofconviction under 18 U.S.C. § 844(h), § 924©, or § 929(a) (i.e., the guideline range thatwould have resulted if subsections (b)(3)(A) and ©(2) had been applied). In such a case, an upward departure may be warranted so that the conviction under 18 U.S.C. § 844(h), § 924©, or § 929(a) does not result in a decrease in the total punishment. An upwarddeparture under this paragraph shall not exceed the maximum of the guideline rangethat would have resulted had there not been a count of conviction under 18 U.S.C.</p>
<p>§ 844(h), § 924©, or § 929(a).</p>

In some cases, the criminal history categorymay not adequately reflect the defendant’s criminal history; see §4A1.3 (Adequacy of CriminalHistory Category).</p>
