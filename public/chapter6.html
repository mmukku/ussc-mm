<p>PART A ― SENTENCING PROCEDURESIntroductory CommentaryThis Part addresses sentencing procedures that are applicable in all cases, includingthose in which guilty or nolo contendere pleas are entered with or without a plea agreementbetween the parties, and convictions based upon judicial findings or verdicts. It sets forth the procedures for establishing the facts upon which the sentence will be based. Reliable fact-finding is essential to procedural due process and to the accuracy and uniformity of sentencing.</p>

<p>Effective November 1, 1987.</p>
<p>§6A1.1. Presentence Report (Policy Statement)(a) The probation officer must conduct a presentence investigation andsubmit a report to the court before it imposes sentence unless—(1) 18 U.S.C. § 3593© or another statute requires otherwise; or(2) the court finds that the information in the record enables it tomeaningfully exercise its sentencing authority under 18 U.S.C.</p>
<p>§ 3553, and the court explains its finding on the record.</p>
<p>Rule 32©(1)(A), Fed. R. Crim. P.</p>
<p>(b) The defendant may not waive preparation of the presentence report.</p>
<p>CommentaryA thorough presentence investigation ordinarily is essential in determining the facts relevant to sentencing. Rule 32©(1)(A) permits the judge to dispense with a presentence reportin certain limited circumstances, as when a specific statute requires or when the court finds§6A1.3sufficient information in the record to enable it to exercise its statutory sentencing authoritymeaningfully and explains its finding on the record.</p>

<p>§6A1.2. Disclosure of Presentence Report; Issues in Dispute (Policy Statement)(a) The probation officer must give the presentence report to the defendant, the defendant’s attorney, and an attorney for the government at least 35 days before sentencing unless the defendant waivesthis minimum period. Rule 32(e)(2), Fed. R. Crim. P.</p>
<p>(b) Within 14 days after receiving the presentence report, the partiesmust state in writing any objections, including objections to material information, sentencing guideline ranges, and policy statements contained in or omitted from the report. An objecting partymust provide a copy of its objections to the opposing party and tothe probation officer. After receiving objections, the probation officer may meet with the parties to discuss the objections. The probation officer may then investigate further and revise the presentence report accordingly. Rule 32(f), Fed. R. Crim. P.</p>
<p>© At least 7 days before sentencing, the probation officer must submitto the court and to the parties the presentence report and an addendum containing any unresolved objections, the grounds for those objections, and the probation officer’s comments on them. Rule 32(g), Fed. R. Crim. P.</p>
<p>CommentaryBackground: In order to focus the issues prior to sentencing, the parties are required to respond in writing to the presentence report and to identify any issues in dispute. See Rule 32(f), Fed. R. Crim. P.</p>

<p>§6A1.3. Resolution of Disputed Factors (Policy Statement)(a) When any factor important to the sentencing determination is reasonably in dispute, the parties shall be given an adequate opportunity to present information to the court regarding that factor. In §6A1.3resolving any dispute concerning a factor important to the sentencing determination, the court may consider relevant informationwithout regard to its admissibility under the rules of evidence applicable at trial, provided that the information has sufficient indicia of reliability to support its probable accuracy.</p>
<p>(b) The court shall resolve disputed sentencing factors at a sentencinghearing in accordance with Rule 32(i), Fed. R. Crim. P.</p>
<p>CommentaryAlthough lengthy sentencing hearings seldom should be necessary, disputes about sentencing factors must be resolved with care. When a dispute exists about any factor importantto the sentencing determination, the court must ensure that the parties have an adequateopportunity to present relevant information. Written statements of counsel or affidavits of witnesses may be adequate under many circumstances. See, e.g., United States v. Ibanez, 924 F.2d427 (2d Cir. 1991). An evidentiary hearing may sometimes be the only reliable way to resolvedisputed issues. See, e.g., United States v. Jimenez Martinez, 83 F.3d 488, 494–95 (1st Cir.</p>

<p>In determining the relevant facts, sentencing judges are not restricted to informationthat would be admissible at trial. See 18 U.S.C. § 3661; see also United States v. Watts, 519 U.S.</p>
<p>148, 154 (1997) (holding that lower evidentiary standard at sentencing permits sentencingcourt’s consideration of acquitted conduct); Witte v. United States, 515 U.S. 389, 399–401(1995) (noting that sentencing courts have traditionally considered wide range of informationwithout the procedural protections of a criminal trial, including information concerning criminal conduct that may be the subject of a subsequent prosecution); Nichols v. United States, 511 U.S. 738, 747–48 (1994) (noting that district courts have traditionally considered defendant’s prior criminal conduct even when the conduct did not result in a conviction). Any information may be considered, so long as it has sufficient indicia of reliability to support its probable accuracy. Watts, 519 U.S. at 157; Nichols, 511 U.S. at 748; United States v. Zuleta-Alvarez, 922 F.2d 33 (1st Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 500 U.S. 927 (1991); United States v. Beaulieu, 893 F.2d 1177 (10th Cir.), cert. denied, 497 U.S. 1038 (1990). Reliable hearsay evidence maybe considered. United States v. Petty, 982 F.2d 1365 (9th Cir. 1993), cert. denied, 510 U.S. 1040(1994); United States v. Sciarrino, 884 F.2d 95 (3d Cir.), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 997 (1989). Outof-court declarations by an unidentified informant may be considered where there is good causefor the non-disclosure of the informant’s identity and there is sufficient corroboration by othermeans. United States v. Rogers, 1 F.3d 341 (5th Cir. 1993); see also United States v. Young, 981 F.2d 180 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 508 U.S. 980 (1993); United States v. Fatico, 579 F.2d 707, 713 (2d Cir. 1978), cert. denied, 444 U.S. 1073 (1980). Unreliable allegations shall not be considered. United States v. Ortiz, 993 F.2d 204 (10th Cir. 1993).</p>
<p>The Commission believes that use of a preponderance of the evidence standard is appropriate to meet due process requirements and policy concerns in resolving disputes regardingapplication of the guidelines to the facts of a case.</p>

<p>§6B1.1PART B ― PLEA AGREEMENTSIntroductory CommentaryPolicy statements governing the acceptance of plea agreements under Rule 11©, Fed. R.</p>
<p>Crim. P., are intended to ensure that plea negotiation practices: (1) promote the statutory purposes of sentencing prescribed in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a); and (2) do not perpetuate unwarrantedsentencing disparity.</p>
<p>These policy statements make clear that sentencing is a judicial function and that the appropriate sentence in a guilty plea case is to be determined by the judge. The policy statements also ensure that the basis for any judicial decision to depart from the guidelines will beexplained on the record.</p>
<h6>Historical Note</h6>
<p>Effective November 1, 1987. Amended effective November 1, 2004 (amendment 674).</p>
<p>§6B1.1. Plea Agreement Procedure (Policy Statement)(a) The parties must disclose the plea agreement in open court whenthe plea is offered, unless the court for good cause allows the partiesto disclose the plea agreement in camera. Rule 11©(2), Fed. R.</p>
<p>Crim. P.</p>
<p>(b) To the extent the plea agreement is of the type specified in Rule11©(1)(B), the court must advise the defendant that the defendanthas no right to withdraw the plea if the court does not follow the recommendation or request. Rule 11©(3)(B), Fed. R. Crim. P.</p>
<p>© To the extent the plea agreement is of the type specified inRule 11©(1)(A) or ©, the court may accept the agreement, rejectit, or defer a decision until the court has reviewed the presentencereport. Rule 11©(3)(A), Fed. R. Crim. P.</p>
<p>CommentaryThis provision parallels the procedural requirements of Rule 11©, Fed. R. Crim. P. Plea agreements must be fully disclosed and a defendant whose plea agreement includes a nonbinding recommendation must be advised that the court’s refusal to accept the sentencing recommendation will not entitle the defendant to withdraw the plea.</p>
<p>Section 6B1.1© deals with the timing of the court’s decision regarding whether to acceptor reject the plea agreement. Rule 11©(3)(A) gives the court discretion to accept or reject the plea agreement immediately or defer a decision pending consideration of the presentence report. Given that a presentence report normally will be prepared, the Commission recommendsthat the court defer acceptance of the plea agreement until the court has reviewed the presentence report.</p>

<p>Effective November 1, 1987. Amended effective November 1, 2004 (amendment 674).</p>
<p>§6B1.2. Standards for Acceptance of Plea Agreements (Policy Statement)(a) In the case of a plea agreement that includes the dismissal of anycharges or an agreement not to pursue potential charges(Rule 11©(1)(A)), the court may accept the agreement if the courtdetermines, for reasons stated on the record, that the remainingcharges adequately reflect the seriousness of the actual offense behavior and that accepting the agreement will not undermine the statutory purposes of sentencing or the sentencing guidelines.</p>
<p>However, a plea agreement that includes the dismissal of a chargeor a plea agreement not to pursue a potential charge shall not preclude the conduct underlying such charge from being considered under the provisions of §1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct) in connection with the count(s) of which the defendant is convicted.</p>
<p>(b) In the case of a plea agreement that includes a nonbinding recommendation (Rule 11©(1)(B)), the court may accept the recommendation if the court is satisfied either that:(1) the recommended sentence is within the applicable guidelinerange; or(2) (A) the recommended sentence is outside the applicable guideline range for justifiable reasons; and (B) those reasons are setforth with specificity in the statement of reasons form.</p>
<p>© In the case of a plea agreement that includes a specific sentence(Rule 11©(1)©), the court may accept the agreement if the courtis satisfied either that:(1) the agreed sentence is within the applicable guideline range;or(2) (A) the agreed sentence is outside the applicable guidelinerange for justifiable reasons; and (B) those reasons are set forthwith specificity in the statement of reasons form.</p>
<p>§6B1.2CommentaryThe court may accept an agreement calling for dismissal of charges or an agreement not to pursue potential charges if the remaining charges reflect the seriousness of the actual offense behavior. This requirement does not authorize judges to intrude upon the charging discretion of the prosecutor. If the government’s motion to dismiss charges or statement that potential charges will not be pursued is not contingent on the disposition of the remainingcharges, the judge should defer to the government’s position except under extraordinary circumstances. Rule 48(a), Fed. R. Crim. P. However, when the dismissal of charges or agreementnot to pursue potential charges is contingent on acceptance of a plea agreement, the court’sauthority to adjudicate guilt and impose sentence is implicated, and the court is to determinewhether or not dismissal of charges will undermine the sentencing guidelines.</p>
<p>Similarly, the court should accept a recommended sentence or a plea agreement requiring imposition of a specific sentence only if the court is satisfied either that such sentence is an appropriate sentence within the applicable guideline range or, if not, that the sentence is outside the applicable guideline range for justifiable reasons and those reasons are set forthwith specificity in the statement of reasons form. See 18 U.S.C. § 3553©. As set forth in subsection (d) of §5K2.0 (Grounds for Departure), however, the court may not depart below the applicable guideline range merely because of the defendant’s decision to plead guilty to the offense or to enter a plea agreement with respect to the offense.</p>
<p>A defendant who enters a plea of guilty in a timely manner will enhance the likelihoodof his receiving a reduction in offense level under §3E1.1 (Acceptance of Responsibility). Further reduction in offense level (or sentence) due to a plea agreement will tend to underminethe sentencing guidelines.</p>
<p>The second paragraph of subsection (a) provides that a plea agreement that includes the dismissal of a charge, or a plea agreement not to pursue a potential charge, shall not preventthe conduct underlying that charge from being considered under the provisions of §1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct) in connection with the count(s) of which the defendant is convicted. This paragraph prevents a plea agreement from restricting consideration of conduct that is within the scope of §1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct) in respect to the count(s) of which the defendant is convicted; it does not in any way expand or modify the scope of §1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct). Section5K2.21 (Dismissed and Uncharged Conduct) addresses the use, as a basis for upward departure, of conduct underlying a charge dismissed as part of a plea agreement in the case, orunderlying a potential charge not pursued in the case as part of a plea agreement.</p>
<p>The Commission encourages the prosecuting attorney prior to the entry of a plea of guiltyor nolo contendere under Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure to disclose to the defendant the facts and circumstances of the offense and offender characteristics, then knownto the prosecuting attorney, that are relevant to the application of the sentencing guidelines.</p>
<p>This recommendation, however, shall not be construed to confer upon the defendant any rightnot otherwise recognized in law.</p>

<p>§6B1.4. Stipulations (Policy Statement)(a) A plea agreement may be accompanied by a written stipulation offacts relevant to sentencing. Except to the extent that a party maybe privileged not to disclose certain information, stipulations shall:(1) set forth the relevant facts and circumstances of the actual offense conduct and offender characteristics;(2) not contain misleading facts; and(3) set forth with meaningful specificity the reasons why the sentencing range resulting from the proposed agreement is appropriate.</p>
<p>(b) To the extent that the parties disagree about any facts relevant tosentencing, the stipulation shall identify the facts that are in dispute.</p>
<p>§6B1.4© A district court may, by local rule, identify categories of cases for which the parties are authorized to make the required stipulationorally, on the record, at the time the plea agreement is offered.</p>
<p>(d) The court is not bound by the stipulation, but may with the aid ofthe presentence report, determine the facts relevant to sentencing.</p>
<p>CommentaryThis provision requires that when a plea agreement includes a stipulation of fact, the stipulation must fully and accurately disclose all factors relevant to the determination of sentence. This provision does not obligate the parties to reach agreement on issues that remainin dispute or to present the court with an appearance of agreement in areas where agreementdoes not exist. Rather, the overriding principle is full disclosure of the circumstances of the actual offense and the agreement of the parties. The stipulation should identify all areas ofagreement, disagreement and uncertainty that may be relevant to the determination of sentence. Similarly, it is not appropriate for the parties to stipulate to misleading or non-existentfacts, even when both parties are willing to assume the existence of such “facts” for purposesof the litigation. Rather, the parties should fully disclose the actual facts and then explain tothe court the reasons why the disposition of the case should differ from that which such factsordinarily would require under the guidelines.</p>
<p>Because of the importance of the stipulations and the potential complexity of the factorsthat can affect the determination of sentences, stipulations ordinarily should be in writing.</p>
<p>However, exceptions to this practice may be allowed by local rule. The Commission intends topay particular attention to this aspect of the plea agreement procedure as experience underthe guidelines develops. See Commentary to §6A1.2 (Disclosure of Presentence Report; Issuesin Dispute).</p>
<p>Section 6B1.4(d) makes clear that the court is not obliged to accept the stipulation of the parties. Even though stipulations are expected to be accurate and complete, the court cannot rely exclusively upon stipulations in ascertaining the factors relevant to the determination ofsentence. Rather, in determining the factual basis for the sentence, the court will consider the stipulation, together with the results of the presentence investigation, and any other relevantinformation.</p>
