In sentencing, the court should consider all relevant offense and offender\r\ncharacteristics. For purposes of assessing offense conduct, the relevant conduct\r\nand circumstances of the offense of conviction are as follows:\r\na. conduct directed toward preparation for or commission of the offense of\r\nconviction, and efforts to avoid detection and responsibility for the\r\noffense of conviction;\r\nb. conduct indicating that the offense of conviction was to some degree part\r\nof a broader purpose, scheme, or plan;\r\nc. conduct that is relevant to the state of mind or motive of the defendant in\r\ncommitting the crime;\r\nd. conduct that is relevant to the defendant’s involvement in crime as a\r\nlivelihood.\r\nThe first three criteria are derived from two sources, Rule 8(a) of the\r\nFederal Rules of Criminal Procedure, governing joinder of similar or related\r\n\r\noffenses, and Rule 404(b) of the Federal Rules of Evidence, permitting admission\r\nof evidence of other crimes to establish motive, intent, plan, and common\r\nscheme. These rules provide standards that govern consideration at trial of\r\ncrimes \"of the same or similar character,\" and utilize concepts and terminology\r\nfamiliar to judges, prosecutors, and defenders. The governing standard should\r\nbe liberally construed in favor of considering information generally appropriate\r\nto sentencing. When other crimes are inadmissible under the Rule 404(b)\r\nstandard, such crimes may not be \"relevant to the offense of conviction\" under\r\nthe criteria that determine this question for purposes of Chapter Two; such crimes\r\nwould, however, be considered in determining the relevant offender\r\ncharacteristics to the extent authorized by Chapter Three (Adjustments), and\r\nChapter Four (Criminal History and Criminal Livelihood) and Chapter Five,\r\nPart H (Specific Offender Characteristics). This construction is consistent with\r\nthe existing rule that \"[n]o limitation shall be placed on the information\r\nconcerning the background, character, and conduct of a person convicted of an\r\noffense . . . for the purpose of imposing an appropriate sentence,\" 18 U.S.C.\r\n§ 3577, so long as the information \"has sufficient indicia of reliability to support\r\nits probable accuracy.\" United States v. Marshall, 519 F. Supp. 751 (D. Wis.\r\n1981), aff’d, 719 F.2d 887 (7th Cir. 1983).\r\nThe last of these criteria is intended to ensure that a judge may consider\r\nat sentencing, information that, although not specifically within other criteria of\r\nrelevance, indicates that the defendant engages in crime for a living. Inclusion\r\nof this information in sentencing considerations is consistent with 28 U.S.C. §\r\n994(d)(11).\".\r\nA replacement guideline with accompanying commentary is inserted as §1B1.3 (Relevant\r\nConduct (Factors that Determine the Guideline Range)).","Reason":"Reason for Amendment: The purpose of this amendment is to clarify the guideline.

Determining the Offense Level\r\nIn determining the offense level:\r\n(a) determine the base offense level from Chapter Two;\r\n(b) make any applicable adjustments for specific offense\r\ncharacteristics from Chapter Two in the order listed;\r\n(c) make any applicable adjustments from Chapter Three;\r\n(d) make any applicable adjustments from Chapter Four, Part B\r\n(Career Offenders and Criminal Livelihood).\r\nCommentary\r\n\r\nApplication Notes:\r\n1. A particular guideline (in the base offense level or in a specific offense\r\ncharacteristic) may expressly direct that a particular factor be applied only if the\r\ndefendant was convicted of a particular statute. E.g., in §2K2.3, a base offense\r\nlevel of 12 is used \"if convicted under 26 U.S.C. § 5861.\" Unless such an express\r\ndirection is included, conviction under the statute is not required. Thus, use of\r\na statutory reference to describe a particular set of circumstances does not require\r\na conviction under the referenced statute. Examples of this usage are found in\r\n§2K1.3(b)(4) (\"if the defendant was a person prohibited from receiving\r\nexplosives under 18 U.S.C. § 842(i), or if the defendant knowingly distributed\r\nexplosives to a person prohibited from receiving explosives under 18 U.S.C. §\r\n842(i), increase by 10 levels\"); and §2A3.4(b)(2) (\"if the abusive contact was\r\naccomplished as defined in 18 U.S.C. § 2242, increase by 4 levels\"). In such\r\ncases, the particular circumstances described are to be evaluated under the\r\n\"relevant conduct\" standard of §1B1.3.\r\n2. Once the appropriate base offense level is determined, all specific offense\r\ncharacteristics are to be applied in the order listed.\r\n3. The offense level adjustments from more than one specific offense characteristic\r\nwithin an offense guideline are cumulative (added together) unless the guideline\r\nspecifies that only the greater (or greatest) is to be used.

E.g., in\r\n§2A2.2(b)(3), pertaining to degree of bodily injury, the subsection that best\r\ndescribes the level of bodily injury is used; the adjustments from different\r\ndegrees of bodily injury (subsections (A), (B) and (C)) are not added together).\r\n4.

In cases of partially completed\r\nconduct, the loss is to be determined in accordance with the provisions of §2X1.1\r\n(Attempt, Solicitation, or Conspiracy Not Covered by a Specific Guideline). E.g., in the\r\ncase of the theft of a government check or money order, loss refers to the loss that would\r\nhave occurred if the check or money order had been cashed.

Particular care must be taken in applying subsection (d) because there are cases\r\nin which the jury’s verdict does not establish which offense(s) was the object of\r\nthe conspiracy. In such cases, subsection (d) should only be applied with respect\r\nto an object offense alleged in the conspiracy count if the court, were it sitting as\r\na trier of fact, would convict the defendant of conspiring to commit that object\r\noffense. Note, however, if the object offenses specified in the conspiracy count\r\nwould be grouped together under §3D1.2(d) (e.g., a conspiracy to steal three\r\ngovernment checks) it is not necessary to engage in the foregoing analysis,\r\nbecause §1B1.3(a)(2) governs consideration of the defendant’s conduct.\".","Reason":"Reason for Amendment: The purpose of this amendment is to add a guideline subsection\r\n(subsection (d)) expressly providing that a conviction of conspiracy to commit more than one\r\noffense is treated for guideline purposes as if the defendant had been convicted of a separate\r\nconspiracy count for each offense that the defendant conspired to commit. The current\r\ninstruction in Application Note 9 of §3D1.2 is inadequate. For consistency, material now\r\ncontained at §1B1.2(a) concerning stipulations to having committed additional offenses is\r\nmoved to a new subsection (subsection (c)).\r\nAdditional commentary (Application Note 5) is provided to address cases in which the jury’s\r\n\r\nverdict does not specify how many or which offenses were the object of the conspiracy of\r\nwhich the defendant was convicted. Compare United States v. Johnson, 713 F.2d 633, 645-46\r\n(11th Cir. 1983) (conviction stands if there is sufficient proof with respect to any one of the\r\nobjectives) cert. denied sub nom. Wilkins v. United States, 465 U.S. 1081 (1984) with United\r\nStates v. Tarnopol, 561 F.2d 466 (3d Cir. 1977) (failure of proof with respect to any one of the\r\nobjectives renders the conspiracy conviction invalid). In order to maintain consistency with\r\nother §1B1.2(a) determinations, this decision should be governed by a reasonable doubt\r\nstandard. A higher standard of proof should govern the creation of what is, in effect, a new\r\ncount of conviction for the purposes of Chapter Three, Part D (Multiple Counts). Because the\r\nguidelines do not explicitly establish standards of proof, the proposed new application note calls\r\nupon the court to determine which offense(s) was the object of the conspiracy as if it were\r\n\"sitting as a trier of fact.\" The foregoing determination is not required, however, in the case of\r\noffenses that are grouped together under §3D1.2(d) (e.g., fraud and theft) because §1B1.3(a)(2)\r\ngoverns consideration of the defendant’s conduct.","EffectiveDate":"Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1989."},{"Id":76,"Title":"Amendment 76","Text":"Section 1B1.3 is amended in subsection (a)(3) by deleting \"or risk of harm\"\r\nimmediately following \"all harm\", and by deleting \"if the harm or risk was caused intentionally,\r\nrecklessly or by criminal negligence, and all harm or risk\" and inserting in lieu thereof \"and all\r\nharm\".\r\nSection 1B1.3(a) is amended by deleting:\r\n\"(4) the defendant’s state of mind, intent, motive and purpose in committing the\r\noffense; and\",\r\nby renumbering subsection (a)(5) as (a)(4), and by inserting \"and\" at the end of subsection\r\n(a)(3) immediately following the semicolon.\r\nThe Commentary to §1B1.3 captioned \"Background\" is amended by deleting:\r\n\" Subsection (a)(4) requires consideration of the defendant’s ‘state of mind, intent,\r\nmotive or purpose in committing the offense.’ The defendant’s state of mind is an\r\nelement of the offense that may constitute a specific offense characteristic.

Defendant A, one of ten off-loaders hired by Defendant B, was convicted of\r\nimportation of marihuana, as a result of his assistance in off-loading a boat containing\r\na one-ton shipment of marihuana. Regardless of the number of bales of marihuana that\r\nhe actually unloaded, and notwithstanding any claim on his part that he was neither\r\naware of, nor could reasonably foresee, that the boat contained this quantity of\r\nmarihuana, Defendant A is held accountable for the entire one-ton quantity of marihuana\r\non the boat because he aided and abetted the unloading, and hence the importation, of the\r\nentire shipment.\r\nb. Defendant C, the getaway driver in an armed bank robbery in which $15,000 is\r\ntaken and a teller is injured, is convicted of the substantive count of bank robbery.\r\nDefendant C is accountable for the money taken because he aided and abetted the taking\r\nof the money. He is accountable for the injury inflicted because he participated in\r\nconcerted criminal conduct that he could reasonably foresee might result in the infliction\r\nof injury.\r\nc. Defendant D pays Defendant E a small amount to forge an endorsement on an\r\n$800 stolen government check. Unknown to Defendant E, Defendant D then uses that\r\ncheck as a down payment in a scheme to fraudulently obtain $15,000 worth of\r\nmerchandise. Defendant E is convicted of forging the $800 check. Defendant E is not\r\naccountable for the $15,000 because the fraudulent scheme to obtain $15,000 was\r\nbeyond the scope of, and not reasonably foreseeable in connection with, the criminal\r\nactivity he jointly undertook with Defendant D.\r\nd. Defendants F and G, working together, design and execute a scheme to sell\r\nfraudulent stocks by telephone. Defendant F fraudulently obtains $20,000. Defendant\r\n\r\nG fraudulently obtains $35,000.

In contrast, the fraud and theft guidelines generally provide a 2-level\r\nincrease in cases of repeated instances under the second prong of the \"more than minimal\r\nplanning\" definition.\r\nUnlike the theft and fraud guidelines, it is arguable that the value of any bribe that was part of\r\nthe same course of conduct or a common scheme or plan as the offense of conviction, but not\r\nincluded in the count of conviction, is excluded from consideration. This is because\r\n§1B1.3(a)(2), which authorizes consideration of conduct not expressly included in the offense\r\nof conviction but part of the same course of conduct or common scheme or plan, applies only\r\nto offenses grouped under §3D1.2(d). Thus, if the defendant pleads to one count of a bribery\r\noffense involving one $10,000 bribe in satisfaction of a 15 count indictment involving an\r\nadditional $80,000 in separate bribes that were part of the same course of conduct, the current\r\nbribery guideline, unlike the theft and fraud guidelines, would not take into account the\r\nadditional $80,000, and there would be no increase for repeated instances.\r\nThe current guideline may also create various anomalies because the multiple count rule (which\r\napplies only where the offenses are not grouped under §3D1.2(b)) increases the offense level\r\ndifferently than the monetary table. For example, an elected public official who takes three\r\nunrelated $200 bribes has an offense level of 21; the same defendant who took two unrelated\r\n$500,000 bribes would have an offense level of 20.","Reason":"Reason for Amendment: The purpose of this amendment is to address the above noted issues.\r\nA specific offense characteristic is added to provide a 2-level increase where the offense\r\ninvolved more than one bribe or gratuity. In addition, such offenses will be grouped under\r\n§3D1.2(d) which allows for aggregation of the amount of the bribes from the same course of\r\nconduct or common scheme or plan under §1B1.3(a)(2) (as in theft and fraud offenses).","EffectiveDate":"Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1989."},{"Id":122,"Title":"Amendment 122","Text":"The Commentary to §2C1.1 captioned \"Background\" is amended in the eighth\r\nparagraph by deleting \"extortions, conspiracies, and attempts\" and inserting in lieu thereof\r\n\"extortion, or attempted extortion,\".","Reason":"Reason for Amendment: The purpose of this amendment is to correct a technical error.

Section 845b provides\r\na minimum mandatory period of imprisonment of one year.

The definition of ‘firearm’ used in this section is that set forth in 18 U.S.C.\r\n§ 921(a)(3) (if the defendant is convicted under 18 U.S.C. § 922) and 26 U.S.C.\r\n§ 5845(a) (if the defendant is convicted under 26 U.S.C. § 5861).

Under 18 U.S.C. § 921(a)(3),\r\nthe term ‘firearm’ means (A) any weapon (including a starter gun) which will or\r\nis designed to or may readily be converted to expel a projectile by the action of\r\n\r\nan explosive; (B) the frame or receiver of any such weapon; (C) any firearm\r\nmuffler or firearm silencer; or (D) any destructive device.

Subsection (c)(1) refers to any situation in which the defendant possessed a\r\nfirearm to facilitate another offense that he committed or attempted.\r\nBackground: 26 U.S.C. § 5861 prohibits the unlicensed receipt, possession,\r\ntransportation, or manufacture of certain firearms, such as machine guns, silencers, rifles\r\nand shotguns with shortened barrels, and destructive devices. As with §2K2.1, there is\r\nconsiderable variation in the conduct included under this statutory provision and some\r\nviolations may be relatively technical.\r\n§2K2.3. Prohibited Transactions in or Shipment of Firearms and Other Weapons\r\n(a) Base Offense Level:\r\n(1) 12, if convicted under 26 U.S.C. § 5861; or\r\n(2) 6, otherwise.\r\n(b) Specific Offense Characteristics\r\n(1) If the number of firearms unlawfully dealt in exceeded 5,\r\nincrease as follows:\r\nNumber of Firearms Increase in Level\r\n(A) 6 - 10 add 1\r\n(B) 11 - 20 add 2\r\n(C) 21 - 50 add 3\r\n(D) 51 - 100 add 4\r\n(E) 101 - 200 add 5\r\n(F) more than 200 add 6\r\n(2) If any of the following applies, use the greatest:\r\n(A) If the defendant knew or had reason to believe\r\nthat a purchaser was a person prohibited by\r\nfederal law from owning the firearm, increase by\r\n2 levels.\r\n\r\n(B) If the defendant knew or had reason to believe\r\nthat a purchaser resided in another state in which\r\nhe was prohibited from owning the firearm,\r\nincrease by 1 level.\r\n(C) If the defendant knew or had reason to believe\r\nthat a firearm was stolen or had an altered or\r\nobliterated serial number, increase by 1 level.\r\n(c) Cross Reference\r\n(1) If the defendant provided the firearm to another for the\r\npurpose of committing another offense, or knowing that\r\nhe planned to use it in committing another offense, apply\r\n§2X1.1 (Attempt or Conspiracy) in respect to such other\r\noffense, if the resulting offense level is higher.\r\nCommentary\r\nStatutory Provisions: 18 U.S.C. § 922 (a)(1), (a)(5), (b)(2), (b)(3), (d), (i), (j), (k), (l);\r\n26 U.S.C. § 5861(a).\r\nBackground: This section applies to a variety of offenses involving prohibited\r\ntransactions in or transportation of firearms and certain other weapons.\".\r\nA replacement guideline with accompanying commentary is inserted as §2K2.2 (Unlawful\r\nTrafficking and Other Prohibited Transactions Involving Firearms).\r\nChapter Two, Part K, Subpart 2 is amended by inserting an additional guideline with\r\naccompanying commentary as §2K2.3 (Receiving, Transporting, Shipping or Transferring a\r\nFirearm or Ammunition With Intent to Commit Another Offense, or With Knowledge that It\r\nWill Be Used in Committing Another Offense).","Reason":"Reason for Amendment: This amendment addresses a number of diverse substantive and\r\ntechnical issues, as well as the creation of several new offenses, and increased statutory\r\nmaximum penalties for certain other offenses. Because there exist a large number of\r\noverlapping statutory provisions, the three basic guidelines, §2K2.1 (Possession by a prohibited\r\nperson), §2K2.2 (Possession of certain types of weapons), and §2K2.3 (Unlawful trafficking)\r\nare not closely tied to the actual conduct. The amendment addresses this issue by consolidating\r\nthe current three guidelines into two guidelines: (1) unlawful possession, receipt, or\r\ntransportation, and (2) unlawful trafficking; and by more carefully drawing the distinctions\r\nbetween the base offense levels provided. The third guideline in this amendment is a new\r\nguideline to address transfer of a weapon with intent or knowledge that it will be used to\r\ncommit another offense (formerly covered in a cross reference) and a new offense added by the\r\nAnti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 (Section 6211)(Interstate travel to acquire a firearm for a criminal\r\npurpose).\r\nThe base offense level for conduct covered by the current §2K2.1 is increased in the\r\n\r\namendment from 9 to 12. The statutorily authorized maximum sentence for the conduct\r\ncovered under §2K2.1 was increased from five to ten years by the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of\r\n1988 (Section 6462). Note, however, that the most aggravated conduct under §2K2.1\r\n(possession of a weapon during commission of another offense) is handled by the cross-\r\nreference at subsection (c) and is based upon the offense level for an attempt to commit the\r\nunderlying offense. See Background Commentary to current §2K2.1. The offense level for\r\nunlawful possession of a machine gun, sawed off shotgun, or destructive device is increased\r\nfrom 12 to 16. In addition, the amendment raises the enhancement for stolen weapons or\r\nobliterated serial numbers from 1 to 2 levels to better reflect the seriousness of this conduct.\r\nThe numbers currently used in the table for the distribution of multiple weapons in §2K2.2 are\r\namended to increase the offense level more rapidly for sale of multiple weapons.","EffectiveDate":"Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1989."},{"Id":190,"Title":"Amendment 190","Text":"Section 2K2.4 is amended by deleting \"penalties are those\" and inserting in lieu\r\nthereof \"term of imprisonment is that\".\r\nThe Commentary to §2K2.4 captioned \"Application Notes\" is amended by inserting the\r\nfollowing additional note:\r\n\"3.

The Statutory Mission\r\nThe Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984 foresees guidelines that will\r\nfurther the basic purposes of criminal punishment, i.e., deterring crime, incapacitating\r\nthe offender, providing just punishment, and rehabilitating the offender. It delegates to\r\nthe Commission broad authority to review and rationalize the federal sentencing process.\r\nThe statute contains many detailed instructions as to how this determination\r\nshould be made, but the most important of them instructs the Commission to create\r\nAmendment 305 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003\r\n\r\ncategories of offense behavior and offender characteristics. An offense behavior\r\ncategory might consist, for example, of ‘bank robbery/committed with a gun/$2500\r\ntaken.’ An offender characteristic category might be ‘offender with one prior conviction\r\nwho was not sentenced to imprisonment.’ The Commission is required to prescribe\r\nguideline ranges that specify an appropriate sentence for each class of convicted persons,\r\nto be determined by coordinating the offense behavior categories with the offender\r\ncharacteristic categories. The statute contemplates the guidelines will establish a range\r\nof sentences for every coordination of categories. Where the guidelines call for\r\nimprisonment, the range must be narrow: the maximum imprisonment cannot exceed the\r\nminimum by more than the greater of 25 percent or six months. 28 U.S.C. § 994(b)(2).\r\nThe sentencing judge must select a sentence from within the guideline range. If,\r\nhowever, a particular case presents atypical features, the Act allows the judge to depart\r\nfrom the guidelines and sentence outside the range. In that case, the judge must specify\r\nreasons for departure. 18 U.S.C. § 3553(b). If the court sentences within the guideline\r\nrange, an appellate court may review the sentence to see if the guideline was correctly\r\n\r\napplied. If the judge departs from the guideline range, an appellate court may review the\r\nreasonableness of the departure. 18 U.S.C. § 3742. The Act requires the offender to\r\nserve virtually all of any prison sentence imposed, for it abolishes parole and\r\nsubstantially restructures good behavior adjustments.\r\nThe law requires the Commission to send its initial guidelines to Congress by\r\nApril 13, 1987, and under the present statute they take effect automatically on\r\nNovember 1, 1987. Pub. L. No. 98-473, § 235, reprinted at 18 U.S.C. § 3551. The\r\nCommission may submit guideline amendments each year to Congress between the\r\nbeginning of a regular session and May 1. The amendments will take effect\r\nautomatically 180 days after submission unless a law is enacted to the contrary.\r\n28 U.S.C. § 994(p).\r\nThe Commission, with the aid of its legal and research staff, considerable public\r\ntestimony, and written commentary, has developed an initial set of guidelines which it\r\nnow transmits to Congress. The Commission emphasizes, however, that it views the\r\nguideline-writing process as evolutionary. It expects, and the governing statute\r\nanticipates, that continuing research, experience, and analysis will result in modifications\r\nand revisions to the guidelines by submission of amendments to Congress. To this end,\r\nthe Commission is established as a permanent agency to monitor sentencing practices in\r\nthe federal courts throughout the nation.\r\n3. The Basic Approach (Policy Statement)\r\nTo understand these guidelines and the rationale that underlies them, one must\r\nbegin with the three objectives that Congress, in enacting the new sentencing law, sought\r\nto achieve. Its basic objective was to enhance the ability of the criminal justice system\r\nto reduce crime through an effective, fair sentencing system. To achieve this objective,\r\nCongress first sought honesty in sentencing. It sought to avoid the confusion and\r\nimplicit deception that arises out of the present sentencing system which requires a judge\r\nto impose an indeterminate sentence that is automatically reduced in most cases by ‘good\r\ntime’ credits. In addition, the parole commission is permitted to determine how much\r\nof the remainder of any prison sentence an offender actually will serve. This usually\r\nresults in a substantial reduction in the effective length of the sentence imposed, with\r\ndefendants often serving only about one-third of the sentence handed down by the court.\r\nSecond, Congress sought uniformity in sentencing by narrowing the wide\r\ndisparity in sentences imposed by different federal courts for similar criminal conduct\r\nby similar offenders. Third, Congress sought proportionality in sentencing through a\r\nsystem that imposes appropriately different sentences for criminal conduct of different\r\nseverity.\r\nHonesty is easy to achieve: The abolition of parole makes the sentence imposed\r\nby the court the sentence the offender will serve. There is a tension, however, between\r\nthe mandate of uniformity (treat similar cases alike) and the mandate of proportionality\r\n(treat different cases differently) which, like the historical tension between law and\r\nequity, makes it difficult to achieve both goals simultaneously. Perfect uniformity --\r\nsentencing every offender to five years -- destroys proportionality. Having only a few\r\nsimple categories of crimes would make the guidelines uniform and easy to administer,\r\nbut might lump together offenses that are different in important respects. For example,\r\n\r\na single category for robbery that lumps together armed and unarmed robberies, robberies\r\nwith and without injuries, robberies of a few dollars and robberies of millions, is far too\r\nbroad.\r\nAt the same time, a sentencing system tailored to fit every conceivable wrinkle\r\nof each case can become unworkable and seriously compromise the certainty of\r\npunishment and its deterrent effect. A bank robber with (or without) a gun, which the\r\nrobber kept hidden (or brandished), might have frightened (or merely warned), injured\r\nseriously (or less seriously), tied up (or simply pushed) a guard, a teller or a customer,\r\nat night (or at noon), for a bad (or arguably less bad) motive, in an effort to obtain money\r\nfor other crimes (or for other purposes), in the company of a few (or many) other robbers,\r\nfor the first (or fourth) time that day, while sober (or under the influence of drugs or\r\nalcohol), and so forth.\r\nThe list of potentially relevant features of criminal behavior is long; the fact that\r\nthey can occur in multiple combinations means that the list of possible permutations of\r\nfactors is virtually endless. The appropriate relationships among these different factors\r\nare exceedingly difficult to establish, for they are often context specific. Sentencing\r\ncourts do not treat the occurrence of a simple bruise identically in all cases, irrespective\r\nof whether that bruise occurred in the context of a bank robbery or in the context of a\r\nbreach of peace. This is so, in part, because the risk that such a harm will occur differs\r\ndepending on the underlying offense with which it is connected (and therefore may\r\nalready be counted, to a different degree, in the punishment for the underlying offense);\r\nand also because, in part, the relationship between punishment and multiple harms is not\r\nsimply additive. The relation varies, depending on how much other harm has occurred.\r\n(Thus, one cannot easily assign points for each kind of harm and simply add them up,\r\nirrespective of context and total amounts.)\r\nThe larger the number of subcategories, the greater the complexity that is created\r\nand the less workable the system. Moreover, the subcategories themselves, sometimes\r\ntoo broad and sometimes too narrow, will apply and interact in unforeseen ways to\r\nunforeseen situations, thus failing to cure the unfairness of a simple, broad category\r\nsystem. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, probation officers and courts, in applying\r\na complex system of subcategories, would have to make a host of decisions about\r\nwhether the underlying facts are sufficient to bring the case within a particular\r\nsubcategory. The greater the number of decisions required and the greater their\r\ncomplexity, the greater the risk that different judges will apply the guidelines differently\r\nto situations that, in fact, are similar, thereby reintroducing the very disparity that the\r\nguidelines were designed to eliminate.\r\nIn view of the arguments, it is tempting to retreat to the simple, broad-category\r\napproach and to grant judges the discretion to select the proper point along a broad\r\nsentencing range. Obviously, however, granting such broad discretion risks\r\ncorrespondingly broad disparity in sentencing, for different courts may exercise their\r\ndiscretionary powers in different ways. That is to say, such an approach risks a return\r\nto the wide disparity that Congress established the Commission to limit.\r\nIn the end, there is no completely satisfying solution to this practical stalemate.\r\nThe Commission has had to simply balance the comparative virtues and vices of broad,\r\nsimple categorization and detailed, complex subcategorization, and within the constraints\r\n\r\nestablished by that balance, minimize the discretionary powers of the sentencing court.\r\nAny ultimate system will, to a degree, enjoy the benefits and suffer from the drawbacks\r\nof each approach.\r\nA philosophical problem arose when the Commission attempted to reconcile the\r\ndiffering perceptions of the purposes of criminal punishment. Most observers of the\r\ncriminal law agree that the ultimate aim of the law itself, and of punishment in particular,\r\nis the control of crime. Beyond this point, however, the consensus seems to break down.\r\nSome argue that appropriate punishment should be defined primarily on the basis of the\r\nmoral principle of ‘just deserts.’ Under this principle, punishment should be scaled to\r\nthe offender’s culpability and the resulting harms. Thus, if a defendant is less culpable,\r\nthe defendant deserves less punishment. Others argue that punishment should be\r\nimposed primarily on the basis of practical ‘crime control’ considerations. Defendants\r\nsentenced under this scheme should receive the punishment that most effectively lessens\r\nthe likelihood of future crime, either by deterring others or incapacitating the defendant.\r\nAdherents of these points of view have urged the Commission to choose between\r\nthem, to accord one primacy over the other. Such a choice would be profoundly difficult.\r\nThe relevant literature is vast, the arguments deep, and each point of view has much to\r\nbe said in its favor. A clear-cut Commission decision in favor of one of these approaches\r\nwould diminish the chance that the guidelines would find the widespread acceptance they\r\nneed for effective implementation. As a practical matter, in most sentencing decisions\r\nboth philosophies may prove consistent with the same result.\r\nFor now, the Commission has sought to solve both the practical and philosophical\r\nproblems of developing a coherent sentencing system by taking an empirical approach\r\nthat uses data estimating the existing sentencing system as a starting point. It has\r\nanalyzed data drawn from 10,000 presentence investigations, crimes as distinguished in\r\nsubstantive criminal statutes, the United States Parole Commission’s guidelines and\r\nresulting statistics, and data from other relevant sources, in order to determine which\r\ndistinctions are important in present practice. After examination, the Commission has\r\naccepted, modified, or rationalized the more important of these distinctions.\r\nThis empirical approach has helped the Commission resolve its practical problem\r\nby defining a list of relevant distinctions that, although of considerable length, is short\r\nenough to create a manageable set of guidelines. Existing categories are relatively broad\r\nand omit many distinctions that some may believe important, yet they include most of\r\nthe major distinctions that statutes and presentence data suggest make a significant\r\ndifference in sentencing decisions. Important distinctions that are ignored in existing\r\npractice probably occur rarely. A sentencing judge may take this unusual case into\r\naccount by departing from the guidelines.\r\nThe Commission’s empirical approach has also helped resolve its philosophical\r\ndilemma. Those who adhere to a just deserts philosophy may concede that the lack of\r\nmoral consensus might make it difficult to say exactly what punishment is deserved for\r\na particular crime, specified in minute detail. Likewise, those who subscribe to a\r\nphilosophy of crime control may acknowledge that the lack of sufficient, readily\r\navailable data might make it difficult to say exactly what punishment will best prevent\r\nthat crime. Both groups might therefore recognize the wisdom of looking to those\r\ndistinctions that judges and legislators have, in fact, made over the course of time. These\r\n\r\nestablished distinctions are ones that the community believes, or has found over time, to\r\nbe important from either a moral or crime-control perspective.\r\nThe Commission has not simply copied estimates of existing practice as revealed\r\nby the data (even though establishing offense values on this basis would help eliminate\r\ndisparity, for the data represent averages). Rather, it has departed from the data at\r\ndifferent points for various important reasons. Congressional statutes, for example, may\r\nsuggest or require departure, as in the case of the new drug law that imposes increased\r\nand mandatory minimum sentences. In addition, the data may reveal inconsistencies in\r\ntreatment, such as punishing economic crime less severely than other apparently\r\nequivalent behavior.\r\nDespite these policy-oriented departures from present practice, the guidelines\r\nrepresent an approach that begins with, and builds upon, empirical data. The guidelines\r\nwill not please those who wish the Commission to adopt a single philosophical theory\r\nand then work deductively to establish a simple and perfect set of categorizations and\r\ndistinctions. The guidelines may prove acceptable, however, to those who seek more\r\nmodest, incremental improvements in the status quo, who believe the best is often the\r\nenemy of the good, and who recognize that these initial guidelines are but the first step\r\nin an evolutionary process. After spending considerable time and resources exploring\r\nalternative approaches, the Commission has developed these guidelines as a practical\r\neffort toward the achievement of a more honest, uniform, equitable, and therefore\r\neffective, sentencing system.\r\n4. The Guidelines’ Resolution of Major Issues (Policy Statement)\r\nThe guideline-writing process has required the Commission to resolve a host of\r\nimportant policy questions, typically involving rather evenly balanced sets of competing\r\nconsiderations. As an aid to understanding the guidelines, this introduction will briefly\r\ndiscuss several of those issues. Commentary in the guidelines explains others.\r\n(a) Real Offense vs. Charge Offense Sentencing.\r\nOne of the most important questions for the Commission to decide was whether\r\nto base sentences upon the actual conduct in which the defendant engaged regardless of\r\nthe charges for which he was indicted or convicted (‘real offense’ sentencing), or upon\r\nthe conduct that constitutes the elements of the offense with which the defendant was\r\ncharged and of which he was convicted (‘charge offense’ sentencing). A bank robber,\r\nfor example, might have used a gun, frightened bystanders, taken $50,000, injured a\r\nteller, refused to stop when ordered, and raced away damaging property during escape.\r\nA pure real offense system would sentence on the basis of all identifiable conduct. A\r\npure charge offense system would overlook some of the harms that did not constitute\r\nstatutory elements of the offenses of which the defendant was convicted.\r\nThe Commission initially sought to develop a real offense system. After all, the\r\npresent sentencing system is, in a sense, a real offense system. The sentencing court (and\r\nthe parole commission) take account of the conduct in which the defendant actually\r\nengaged, as determined in a presentence report, at the sentencing hearing, or before a\r\nparole commission hearing officer. The Commission’s initial efforts in this direction,\r\ncarried out in the spring and early summer of 1986, proved unproductive mostly for\r\n\r\npractical reasons. To make such a system work, even to formalize and rationalize the\r\nstatus quo, would have required the Commission to decide precisely which harms to take\r\ninto account, how to add them up, and what kinds of procedures the courts should use to\r\ndetermine the presence or absence of disputed factual elements. The Commission found\r\nno practical way to combine and account for the large number of diverse harms arising\r\nin different circumstances; nor did it find a practical way to reconcile the need for a fair\r\nadjudicatory procedure with the need for a speedy sentencing process, given the potential\r\nexistence of hosts of adjudicated ‘real harm’ facts in many typical cases. The effort\r\nproposed as a solution to these problems required the use of, for example, quadratic roots\r\nand other mathematical operations that the Commission considered too complex to be\r\nworkable, and, in the Commission’s view, risked return to wide disparity in practice.\r\nThe Commission therefore abandoned the effort to devise a ‘pure’ real offense\r\nsystem and instead experimented with a ‘modified real offense system,’ which it\r\npublished for public comment in a September 1986 preliminary draft.\r\nThis version also foundered in several major respects on the rock of practicality.\r\nIt was highly complex and its mechanical rules for adding harms (e.g., bodily injury\r\nadded the same punishment irrespective of context) threatened to work considerable\r\nunfairness. Ultimately, the Commission decided that it could not find a practical or fair\r\nand efficient way to implement either a pure or modified real offense system of the sort\r\nit originally wanted, and it abandoned that approach.\r\nThe Commission, in its January 1987 Revised Draft and the present guidelines,\r\nhas moved closer to a ‘charge offense’ system. The system is not, however, pure; it has\r\na number of real elements. For one thing, the hundreds of overlapping and duplicative\r\nstatutory provisions that make up the federal criminal law have forced the Commission\r\nto write guidelines that are descriptive of generic conduct rather than tracking purely\r\nstatutory language. For another, the guidelines, both through specific offense\r\ncharacteristics and adjustments, take account of a number of important, commonly\r\noccurring real offense elements such as role in the offense, the presence of a gun, or the\r\namount of money actually taken.\r\nFinally, it is important not to overstate the difference in practice between a real\r\nand a charge offense system. The federal criminal system, in practice, deals mostly with\r\ndrug offenses, bank robberies and white collar crimes (such as fraud, embezzlement, and\r\nbribery). For the most part, the conduct that an indictment charges approximates the real\r\nand relevant conduct in which the offender actually engaged.\r\nThe Commission recognizes its system will not completely cure the problems of\r\na real offense system. It may still be necessary, for example, for a court to determine\r\nsome particular real facts that will make a difference to the sentence. Yet, the\r\nCommission believes that the instances of controversial facts will be far fewer; indeed,\r\nthere will be few enough so that the court system will be able to devise fair procedures\r\nfor their determination. See United States v. Fatico, 579 F.2d 707 (2d Cir. 1978)\r\n(permitting introduction of hearsay evidence at sentencing hearing under certain\r\nconditions), on remand, 458 F. Supp. 388 (E.D.N.Y. 1978), aff’d, 603 F.2d 1053 (2d Cir.\r\n1979) (holding that the government need not prove facts at sentencing hearing beyond\r\na reasonable doubt), cert. denied, 444 U.S. 1073 (1980).\r\n\r\nThe Commission also recognizes that a charge offense system has drawbacks of\r\nits own. One of the most important is its potential to turn over to the prosecutor the\r\npower to determine the sentence by increasing or decreasing the number (or content) of\r\nthe counts in an indictment. Of course, the defendant’s actual conduct (that which the\r\nprosecutor can prove in court) imposes a natural limit upon the prosecutor’s ability to\r\nincrease a defendant’s sentence. Moreover, the Commission has written its rules for the\r\ntreatment of multicount convictions with an eye toward eliminating unfair treatment that\r\nmight flow from count manipulation. For example, the guidelines treat a three-count\r\nindictment, each count of which charges sale of 100 grams of heroin, or theft of $10,000,\r\nthe same as a single-count indictment charging sale of 300 grams of heroin or theft of\r\n$30,000. Further, a sentencing court may control any inappropriate manipulation of the\r\nindictment through use of its power to depart from the specific guideline sentence.\r\nFinally, the Commission will closely monitor problems arising out of count manipulation\r\nand will make appropriate adjustments should they become necessary.\r\n(b) Departures.\r\nThe new sentencing statute permits a court to depart from a guideline-specified\r\nsentence only when it finds ‘an aggravating or mitigating circumstance of a kind, or to\r\na degree, not adequately taken into consideration by the Sentencing Commission . . .’.\r\n18 U.S.C. § 3553(b). Thus, in principle, the Commission, by specifying that it had\r\nadequately considered a particular factor, could prevent a court from using it as grounds\r\nfor departure. In this initial set of guidelines, however, the Commission does not so limit\r\nthe courts’ departure powers. The Commission intends the sentencing courts to treat\r\neach guideline as carving out a ‘heartland,’ a set of typical cases embodying the conduct\r\nthat each guideline describes. When a court finds an atypical case, one to which a\r\nparticular guideline linguistically applies but where conduct significantly differs from the\r\nnorm, the court may consider whether a departure is warranted. Section 5H1.10 (Race,\r\nSex, National Origin, Creed, Religion, Socio-Economic Status), the third sentence of\r\n§5H1.4, and the last sentence of §5K2.12, list a few factors that the court cannot take into\r\naccount as grounds for departure. With those specific exceptions, however, the\r\nCommission does not intend to limit the kinds of factors (whether or not mentioned\r\nanywhere else in the guidelines) that could constitute grounds for departure in an unusual\r\ncase.\r\nThe Commission has adopted this departure policy for two basic reasons. First\r\nis the difficulty of foreseeing and capturing a single set of guidelines that encompasses\r\nthe vast range of human conduct potentially relevant to a sentencing decision. The\r\nCommission also recognizes that in the initial set of guidelines it need not do so. The\r\nCommission is a permanent body, empowered by law to write and rewrite guidelines,\r\nwith progressive changes, over many years. By monitoring when courts depart from the\r\nguidelines and by analyzing their stated reasons for doing so, the Commission, over time,\r\nwill be able to create more accurate guidelines that specify precisely where departures\r\nshould and should not be permitted.\r\nSecond, the Commission believes that despite the courts’ legal freedom to depart\r\nfrom the guidelines, they will not do so very often. This is because the guidelines,\r\noffense by offense, seek to take account of those factors that the Commission’s\r\nsentencing data indicate make a significant difference in sentencing at the present time.\r\nThus, for example, where the presence of actual physical injury currently makes an\r\n\r\nimportant difference in final sentences, as in the case of robbery, assault, or arson, the\r\nguidelines specifically instruct the judge to use this factor to augment the sentence.\r\nWhere the guidelines do not specify an augmentation or diminution, this is generally\r\nbecause the sentencing data do not permit the Commission, at this time, to conclude that\r\nthe factor is empirically important in relation to the particular offense. Of course, a\r\nfactor (say physical injury) may nonetheless sometimes occur in connection with a crime\r\n(such as fraud) where it does not often occur. If, however, as the data indicate, such\r\noccurrences are rare, they are precisely the type of events that the court’s departure\r\npowers were designed to cover -- unusual cases outside the range of the more typical\r\noffenses for which the guidelines were designed. Of course, the Commission recognizes\r\nthat even its collection and analysis of 10,000 presentence reports are an imperfect source\r\nof data sentencing estimates. Rather than rely heavily at this time upon impressionistic\r\naccounts, however, the Commission believes it wiser to wait and collect additional data\r\nfrom our continuing monitoring process that may demonstrate how the guidelines work\r\nin practice before further modification.\r\nIt is important to note that the guidelines refer to two different kinds of departure.\r\nThe first kind involves instances in which the guidelines provide specific\r\nguidance for departure, by analogy or by other numerical or non-numerical suggestions.\r\nFor example, the commentary to §2G1.1 (Transportation for Prostitution), recommends\r\na downward adjustment of eight levels where commercial purpose was not involved. The\r\nCommission intends such suggestions as policy guidance for the courts. The\r\nCommission expects that most departures will reflect the suggestions, and that the courts\r\nof appeals may prove more likely to find departures ‘unreasonable’ where they fall\r\noutside suggested levels.\r\nA second kind of departure will remain unguided. It may rest upon grounds\r\nreferred to in Chapter 5, Part K (Departures), or on grounds not mentioned in the\r\nguidelines. While Chapter 5, Part K lists factors that the Commission believes may\r\nconstitute grounds for departure, those suggested grounds are not exhaustive. The\r\nCommission recognizes that there may be other grounds for departure that are not\r\nmentioned; it also believes there may be cases in which a departure outside suggested\r\nlevels is warranted. In its view, however, such cases will be highly unusual.\r\n(c) Plea Agreements.\r\nNearly ninety percent of all federal criminal cases involve guilty pleas, and many\r\nof these cases involve some form of plea agreement. Some commentators on early\r\nCommission guideline drafts have urged the Commission not to attempt any major\r\nreforms of the agreement process, on the grounds that any set of guidelines that threatens\r\nto radically change present practice also threatens to make the federal system\r\nunmanageable. Others, starting with the same facts, have argued that guidelines which\r\nfail to control and limit plea agreements would leave untouched a ‘loophole’ large\r\nenough to undo the good that sentencing guidelines may bring. Still other commentators\r\nmake both sets of arguments.\r\nThe Commission has decided that these initial guidelines will not, in general,\r\nmake significant changes in current plea agreement practices. The court will accept or\r\nreject any such agreements primarily in accordance with the rules set forth in\r\n\r\nFed.R.Crim.P. 11(e). The Commission will collect data on the courts’ plea practices and\r\nwill analyze this information to determine when and why the courts accept or reject plea\r\nagreements. In light of this information and analysis, the Commission will seek to\r\nfurther regulate the plea agreement process as appropriate.\r\nThe Commission nonetheless expects the initial set of guidelines to have a\r\npositive, rationalizing impact upon plea agreements for two reasons. First, the guidelines\r\ncreate a clear, definite expectation in respect to the sentence that a court will impose if\r\na trial takes place. Insofar as a prosecutor and defense attorney seek to agree about a\r\nlikely sentence or range of sentences, they will no longer work in the dark. This fact\r\nalone should help to reduce irrationality in respect to actual sentencing outcomes.\r\nSecond, the guidelines create a norm to which judges will likely refer when they decide\r\nwhether, under Rule 11(e), to accept or to reject a plea agreement or recommendation.\r\nSince they will have before them the norm, the relevant factors (as disclosed in the plea\r\nagreement), and the reason for the agreement, they will find it easier than at present to\r\ndetermine whether there is sufficient reason to accept a plea agreement that departs from\r\nthe norm.\r\n(d) Probation and Split Sentences.\r\nThe statute provides that the guidelines are to ‘reflect the general appropriateness\r\nof imposing a sentence other than imprisonment in cases in which the defendant is a first\r\noffender who has not been convicted of a crime of violence or an otherwise serious\r\noffense . . .’ 28 U.S.C. § 994(j). Under present sentencing practice, courts sentence to\r\nprobation an inappropriately high percentage of offenders guilty of certain economic\r\ncrimes, such as theft, tax evasion, antitrust offenses, insider trading, fraud, and\r\nembezzlement, that in the Commission’s view are ‘serious.’ If the guidelines were to\r\npermit courts to impose probation instead of prison in many or all such cases, the present\r\nsentences would continue to be ineffective.\r\nThe Commission’s solution to this problem has been to write guidelines that\r\nclassify as ‘serious’ (and therefore subject to mandatory prison sentences) many offenses\r\nfor which probation is now frequently given. At the same time, the guidelines will\r\npermit the sentencing court to impose short prison terms in many such cases. The\r\nCommission’s view is that the definite prospect of prison, though the term is short, will\r\nact as a significant deterrent to many of these crimes, particularly when compared with\r\nthe status quo where probation, not prison, is the norm.\r\nMore specifically, the guidelines work as follows in respect to a first offender.\r\nFor offense levels one through six, the sentencing court may elect to sentence the\r\noffender to probation (with or without confinement conditions) or to a prison term. For\r\noffense levels seven through ten, the court may substitute probation for a prison term, but\r\nthe probation must include confinement conditions (community confinement, intermittent\r\nconfinement, or home detention). For offense levels eleven and twelve, the court must\r\nimpose at least one half the minimum confinement sentence in the form of prison\r\nconfinement, the remainder to be served on supervised release with a condition of\r\ncommunity confinement or home detention. The Commission, of course, has not dealt\r\nwith the single acts of aberrant behavior that still may justify probation at higher offense\r\nlevels through departures.\r\n\r\n(e) Multi-Count Convictions.\r\nThe Commission, like other sentencing commissions, has found it particularly\r\ndifficult to develop rules for sentencing defendants convicted of multiple violations of\r\nlaw, each of which makes up a separate count in an indictment. The reason it is difficult\r\nis that when a defendant engages in conduct that causes several harms, each additional\r\nharm, even if it increases the extent to which punishment is warranted, does not\r\nnecessarily warrant a proportionate increase in punishment. A defendant who assaults\r\nothers during a fight, for example, may warrant more punishment if he injures ten people\r\nthan if he injures one, but his conduct does not necessarily warrant ten times the\r\npunishment. If it did, many of the simplest offenses, for reasons that are often fortuitous,\r\nwould lead to life sentences of imprisonment--sentences that neither ‘just deserts’ nor\r\n‘crime control’ theories of punishment would find justified.\r\nSeveral individual guidelines provide special instructions for increasing\r\npunishment when the conduct that is the subject of that count involves multiple\r\noccurrences or has caused several harms. The guidelines also provide general rules for\r\naggravating punishment in light of multiple harms charged separately in separate counts.\r\nThese rules may produce occasional anomalies, but normally they will permit an\r\nappropriate degree of aggravation of punishment when multiple offenses that are the\r\nsubjects of separate counts take place.\r\nThese rules are set out in Chapter Three, Part D. They essentially provide: (1)\r\nWhen the conduct involves fungible items, e.g., separate drug transactions or thefts of\r\nmoney, the amounts are added and the guidelines apply to the total amount. (2) When\r\nnonfungible harms are involved, the offense level for the most serious count is increased\r\n(according to a somewhat diminishing scale) to reflect the existence of other counts of\r\nconviction.\r\nThe rules have been written in order to minimize the possibility that an arbitrary\r\ncasting of a single transaction into several counts will produce a longer sentence. In\r\naddition, the sentencing court will have adequate power to prevent such a result through\r\ndepartures where necessary to produce a mitigated sentence.\r\n(f) Regulatory Offenses.\r\nRegulatory statutes, though primarily civil in nature, sometimes contain criminal\r\nprovisions in respect to particularly harmful activity. Such criminal provisions often\r\ndescribe not only substantive offenses, but also more technical, administratively-related\r\noffenses such as failure to keep accurate records or to provide requested information.\r\nThese criminal statutes pose two problems. First, which criminal regulatory provisions\r\nshould the Commission initially consider, and second, how should it treat technical or\r\nadministratively-related criminal violations?\r\nIn respect to the first problem, the Commission found that it cannot\r\ncomprehensively treat all regulatory violations in the initial set of guidelines. There are\r\nhundreds of such provisions scattered throughout the United States Code. To find all\r\npotential violations would involve examination of each individual federal regulation.\r\nBecause of this practical difficulty, the Commission has sought to determine, with the\r\nassistance of the Department of Justice and several regulatory agencies, which criminal\r\n\r\nregulatory offenses are particularly important in light of the need for enforcement of the\r\ngeneral regulatory scheme. The Commission has sought to treat these offenses in these\r\ninitial guidelines. It will address the less common regulatory offenses in the future.\r\nIn respect to the second problem, the Commission has developed a system for\r\ntreating technical recordkeeping and reporting offenses, dividing them into four\r\ncategories.\r\nFirst, in the simplest of cases, the offender may have failed to fill out a form\r\nintentionally, but without knowledge or intent that substantive harm would likely follow.\r\nHe might fail, for example, to keep an accurate record of toxic substance transport, but\r\nthat failure may not lead, nor be likely to lead, to the release or improper treatment of any\r\ntoxic substance. Second, the same failure may be accompanied by a significant\r\nlikelihood that substantive harm will occur; it may make a release of a toxic substance\r\nmore likely. Third, the same failure may have led to substantive harm. Fourth, the\r\nfailure may represent an effort to conceal a substantive harm that has occurred.\r\nThe structure of a typical guideline for a regulatory offense is as follows:\r\n(1) The guideline provides a low base offense level (6) aimed at the first type of\r\nrecordkeeping or reporting offense. It gives the court the legal authority to\r\nimpose a punishment ranging from probation up to six months of imprisonment.\r\n(2) Specific offense characteristics designed to reflect substantive offenses that do\r\noccur (in respect to some regulatory offenses), or that are likely to occur, increase\r\nthe offense level.\r\n(3) A specific offense characteristic also provides that a recordkeeping or reporting\r\noffense that conceals a substantive offense will be treated like the substantive\r\noffense.\r\nThe Commission views this structure as an initial effort. It may revise its\r\napproach in light of further experience and analysis of regulatory crimes.\r\n(g) Sentencing Ranges.\r\nIn determining the appropriate sentencing ranges for each offense, the\r\nCommission began by estimating the average sentences now being served within each\r\ncategory. It also examined the sentence specified in congressional statutes, in the parole\r\nguidelines, and in other relevant, analogous sources. The Commission’s forthcoming\r\ndetailed report will contain a comparison between estimates of existing sentencing\r\npractices and sentences under the guidelines.\r\nWhile the Commission has not considered itself bound by existing sentencing\r\npractice, it has not tried to develop an entirely new system of sentencing on the basis of\r\ntheory alone. Guideline sentences in many instances will approximate existing practice,\r\nbut adherence to the guidelines will help to eliminate wide disparity. For example, where\r\na high percentage of persons now receive probation, a guideline may include one or more\r\nspecific offense characteristics in an effort to distinguish those types of defendants who\r\nnow receive probation from those who receive more severe sentences. In some instances,\r\n\r\nshort sentences of incarceration for all offenders in a category have been substituted for\r\na current sentencing practice of very wide variability in which some defendants receive\r\nprobation while others receive several years in prison for the same offense. Moreover,\r\ninasmuch as those who currently plead guilty often receive lesser sentences, the\r\nguidelines also permit the court to impose lesser sentences on those defendants who\r\naccept responsibility and those who cooperate with the government.\r\nThe Commission has also examined its sentencing ranges in light of their likely\r\nimpact upon prison population. Specific legislation, such as the new drug law and the\r\ncareer offender provisions of the sentencing law, require the Commission to promulgate\r\nrules that will lead to substantial prison population increases. These increases will occur\r\nirrespective of any guidelines. The guidelines themselves, insofar as they reflect policy\r\ndecisions made by the Commission (rather than legislated mandatory minimum, or career\r\noffender, sentences), will lead to an increase in prison population that computer models,\r\nproduced by the Commission and the Bureau of Prisons, estimate at approximately\r\n10 percent, over a period of ten years.\r\n(h) The Sentencing Table.\r\nThe Commission has established a sentencing table. For technical and practical\r\nreasons it has 43 levels. Each row in the table contains levels that overlap with the levels\r\nin the preceding and succeeding rows. By overlapping the levels, the table should\r\ndiscourage unnecessary litigation. Both prosecutor and defendant will realize that the\r\ndifference between one level and another will not necessarily make a difference in the\r\nsentence that the judge imposes. Thus, little purpose will be served in protracted\r\nlitigation trying to determine, for example, whether $10,000 or $11,000 was obtained as\r\na result of a fraud. At the same time, the rows work to increase a sentence\r\nproportionately. A change of 6 levels roughly doubles the sentence irrespective of the\r\nlevel at which one starts. The Commission, aware of the legal requirement that the\r\nmaximum of any range cannot exceed the minimum by more than the greater of\r\n25 percent or six months, also wishes to permit courts the greatest possible range for\r\nexercising discretion. The table overlaps offense levels meaningfully, works\r\nproportionately, and at the same time preserves the maximum degree of allowable\r\ndiscretion for the judge within each level.\r\nSimilarly, many of the individual guidelines refer to tables that correlate amounts\r\nof money with offense levels. These tables often have many, rather than a few levels.\r\nAgain, the reason is to minimize the likelihood of unnecessary litigation. If a money\r\ntable were to make only a few distinctions, each distinction would become more\r\nimportant and litigation as to which category an offender fell within would become more\r\nlikely. Where a table has many smaller monetary distinctions, it minimizes the\r\nlikelihood of litigation, for the importance of the precise amount of money involved is\r\nconsiderably less.\r\n5. A Concluding Note\r\nThe Commission emphasizes that its approach in this initial set of guidelines is\r\none of caution. It has examined the many hundreds of criminal statutes in the United\r\nStates Code. It has begun with those that are the basis for a significant number of\r\nprosecutions. It has sought to place them in a rational order. It has developed additional\r\n\r\ndistinctions relevant to the application of these provisions, and it has applied sentencing\r\nranges to each resulting category. In doing so, it has relied upon estimates of existing\r\nsentencing practices as revealed by its own statistical analyses, based on summary reports\r\nof some 40,000 convictions, a sample of 10,000 augmented presentence reports, the\r\nparole guidelines and policy judgments.\r\nThe Commission recognizes that some will criticize this approach as overly\r\ncautious, as representing too little a departure from existing practice. Yet, it will cure\r\nwide disparity. The Commission is a permanent body that can amend the guidelines each\r\nyear. Although the data available to it, like all data, are imperfect, experience with these\r\nguidelines will lead to additional information and provide a firm empirical basis for\r\nrevision.\r\nFinally, the guidelines will apply to approximately 90 percent of all cases in the\r\nfederal courts. Because of time constraints and the nonexistence of statistical\r\ninformation, some offenses that occur infrequently are not considered in this initial set\r\nof guidelines. They will, however, be addressed in the near future. Their exclusion from\r\nthis initial submission does not reflect any judgment about their seriousness. The\r\nCommission has also deferred promulgation of guidelines pertaining to fines, probation\r\nand other sanctions for organizational defendants, with the exception of antitrust\r\nviolations. The Commission also expects to address this area in the near future.\".\r\nReplacement subparts are inserted as Subparts 2 (The Statutory Mission), 3 (The Basic\r\nApproach (Policy Statement)), 4 (The Guidelines’ Resolution of Major Issues (Policy\r\nStatement)), and 5 (A Concluding Note).","Reason":"Reason for Amendment: This amendment updates this part to reflect the implementation of\r\nguideline sentencing on November 1, 1987, and makes various clarifying and editorial changes\r\nto enhance the usefulness of this part both as a historical overview and as an introduction to the\r\nstructure and operation of the guidelines.

For additional\r\nstatutory provision(s), see Appendix A (Statutory Index).\r\nApplication Notes:\r\n1. The definition of ‘firearm’ used in this section is that set forth in 18 U.S.C.\r\n§ 921(a)(3) (if the defendant is convicted under 18 U.S.C. § 922) and 26 U.S.C.\r\n§ 5845(a) (if the defendant is convicted under 26 U.S.C. § 5861). These\r\ndefinitions are somewhat broader than that used in Application Note 1(e) of the\r\nCommentary to §1B1.1 (Application Instructions). Under 18 U.S.C. § 921(a)(3),\r\nthe term ‘firearm’ means (A) any weapon (including a starter gun) which will or\r\nis designed to or may readily be converted to expel a projectile by the action of\r\nan explosive; (B) the frame or receiver of any such weapon; (C) any firearm\r\nmuffler or firearm silencer; or (D) any destructive device. Under 26 U.S.C. §\r\n5845(a), the term ‘firearm’ includes a shotgun, or a weapon made from a shotgun,\r\nwith a barrel or barrels of less than 18 inches in length; a weapon made from a\r\nshotgun or rifle with an overall length of less than 26 inches; a rifle, or weapon\r\nmade from a rifle, with a barrel or barrels less than 16 inches in length; a machine\r\ngun; a muffler or silencer for a firearm; a destructive device; and certain other\r\nlarge bore weapons.\r\n2. Under §2K2.1(b)(1), intended lawful use, as determined by the surrounding\r\ncircumstances, provides a decrease in the offense level. Relevant circumstances\r\ninclude, among others, the number and type of firearms (sawed-off shotguns, for\r\nexample, have few legitimate uses) and ammunition, the location and\r\ncircumstances of possession, the nature of the defendant’s criminal history (e.g.,\r\nwhether involving firearms), and the extent to which possession was restricted by\r\nlocal law.\r\nBackground: Under pre-guidelines practice, there was substantial sentencing variation\r\nfor these crimes. From the Commission’s investigations, it appeared that the variation\r\nAmendment 374 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003\r\n\r\nwas attributable primarily to the wide variety of circumstances under which these\r\noffenses occur. Apart from the nature of the defendant’s criminal history, his actual or\r\nintended use of the firearm was probably the most important factor in determining the\r\nsentence.\r\nStatistics showed that pre-guidelines sentences averaged two to three months\r\nlower if the firearm involved was a rifle or an unaltered shotgun. This may reflect the\r\nfact that these weapons tend to be more suitable than others for recreational activities.\r\nHowever, some rifles or shotguns may be possessed for criminal purposes, while some\r\nhandguns may be suitable primarily for recreation. Therefore, the guideline is not based\r\nupon the type of firearm. Intended lawful use, as determined by the surrounding\r\ncircumstances, is a mitigating factor.\r\nAvailable pre-guidelines data were not sufficient to determine the effect a stolen\r\nfirearm had on the average sentence. However, reviews of pre-guidelines cases\r\nsuggested that this factor tended to result in more severe sentences. Independent studies\r\nshow that stolen firearms are used disproportionately in the commission of crimes.\r\nThe firearm statutes often are used as a device to enable the federal court to\r\nexercise jurisdiction over offenses that otherwise could be prosecuted only under state\r\nlaw. For example, a convicted felon may be prosecuted for possessing a firearm if he\r\nused the firearm to rob a gasoline station. In pre-guidelines practice, such prosecutions\r\nresulted in high sentences because of the true nature of the underlying conduct. The\r\ncross reference at §2K2.1(c)(2) deals with such cases.\r\n§2K2.2. Unlawful Trafficking and Other Prohibited Transactions Involving\r\nFirearms\r\n(a) Base Offense Level:\r\n(1) 18, if the defendant is convicted under 18 U.S.C.\r\n§ 922(o) or 26 U.S.C. § 5861;\r\n(2) 6, otherwise.\r\n(b) Specific Offense Characteristics\r\n(1) If the offense involved distribution of a firearm, or\r\npossession with intent to distribute, and the number of\r\nfirearms unlawfully distributed, or to be distributed,\r\nexceeded two, increase as follows:\r\nNumber of Firearms Increase in Level\r\n(A) 3 - 4 add 1\r\n(B) 5 - 7 add 2\r\n(C) 8 - 12 add 3\r\n(D) 13 - 24 add 4\r\n(E) 25 - 49 add 5\r\n\r\n(F) 50 or more add 6.\r\n(2) If any of the firearms was stolen or had an altered or\r\nobliterated serial number, increase by 2 levels.\r\n(3) If more than one of the following applies, use the greater:\r\n(A) If the defendant is convicted under 18 U.S.C.\r\n§ 922(d), increase by 6 levels; or\r\n(B) If the defendant is convicted under 18 U.S.C.\r\n§ 922(b)(1) or (b)(2), increase by 1 level.\r\n(c) Cross Reference\r\n(1) If the defendant, at the time of the offense, had been\r\nconvicted in any court of a crime punishable by\r\nimprisonment for a term exceeding one year, apply\r\n§2K2.1 (Unlawful Receipt, Possession, or Transportation\r\nof Firearms or Ammunition) if the resulting offense level\r\nis greater than that determined above.\r\nCommentary\r\nStatutory Provisions: 18 U.S.C. § 922(a)(1), (a)(2), (a)(5), (b), (c), (d), (e), (f), (i), (j),\r\n(k), (l), (m), (o); 26 U.S.C. § 5861(a), (e), (f), (g), (j), and (l).

If\r\nparticipation in a substance abuse program is required, the length of supervised release\r\nshould take into account the length of time necessary for the supervisory body to judge\r\nthe success of the program.\r\nSimilarly, where a defendant who is a substance abuser is sentenced to probation, it is\r\nstrongly recommended that the conditions of probation contain a requirement that the\r\ndefendant participate in an appropriate substance abuse program (see recommended\r\ncondition (23) at §5B1.4 (Recommended Conditions of Probation and Supervised\r\nRelease)).\".\r\nSection 5H1.5 is amended by deleting:\r\n\"Employment record is not ordinarily relevant in determining whether a sentence should\r\nbe outside the guidelines or where within the guidelines a sentence should fall.\r\nEmployment record may be relevant in determining the type of sentence to be imposed\r\nwhen the guidelines provide for sentencing options.

In the case of a partially completed offense (e.g., an offense involving an\r\nattempted theft of $800,000 and a completed theft of $30,000), the offense level\r\nis to be determined in accordance with §2X1.1 (Attempt, Solicitation, or\r\nConspiracy) whether the conviction is for the substantive offense, the inchoate\r\noffense (attempt, solicitation, or conspiracy), or both. See Application Note 4 in\r\nthe Commentary to §2X1.1. Note, however, that Application Note 4 is not\r\napplicable where the offense level is determined under §2X1.1(c)(1).\r\n7. For the purposes of subsection (a)(2), offense conduct associated with a sentence\r\nthat was imposed prior to the acts or omissions constituting the instant federal\r\noffense (the offense of conviction) is not considered as part of the same course\r\nof conduct or common scheme or plan as the offense of conviction.\r\n\r\nExamples: (1) The defendant was convicted for the sale of cocaine and sentenced\r\nto state prison. Immediately upon release from prison, he again sold cocaine to\r\nthe same person, using the same accomplices and modus operandi. The instant\r\nfederal offense (the offense of conviction) charges this latter sale. In this\r\nexample, the offense conduct relevant to the state prison sentence is considered\r\nas prior criminal history, not as part of the same course of conduct or common\r\nscheme or plan as the offense of conviction. The prior state prison sentence is\r\ncounted under Chapter Four (Criminal History and Criminal Livelihood). (2) The\r\ndefendant engaged in two cocaine sales constituting part of the same course of\r\nconduct or common scheme or plan. Subsequently, he is arrested by state\r\nauthorities for the first sale and by federal authorities for the second sale. He is\r\nconvicted in state court for the first sale and sentenced to imprisonment; he is\r\nthen convicted in federal court for the second sale. In this case, the cocaine sales\r\nare not separated by an intervening sentence. Therefore, under subsection (a)(2),\r\nthe cocaine sale associated with the state conviction is considered as relevant\r\nconduct to the instant federal offense. The state prison sentence for that sale is\r\nnot counted as a prior sentence; see §4A1.2(a)(1).\r\nNote, however, in certain cases, offense conduct associated with a previously\r\nimposed sentence may be expressly charged in the offense of conviction.

In keeping with the Commission’s\r\npolicy on attempts, if a probable or intended loss that the defendant was\r\nattempting to inflict can be determined, that figure would be used if it was larger\r\nAmendment 393 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003\r\n\r\nthan the actual loss. For example, if the fraud consisted of attempting to sell\r\n$40,000 in worthless securities, or representing that a forged check for $40,000\r\nwas genuine, the ‘loss’ would be treated as $40,000 for purposes of this\r\nguideline.\r\n8. The amount of loss need not be precise. The court is not expected to identify\r\neach victim and the loss he suffered to arrive at an exact figure. The court need\r\nonly make a reasonable estimate of the range of loss, given the available\r\ninformation. The estimate may be based on the approximate number of victims\r\nand an estimate of the average loss to each victim, or on more general factors,\r\nsuch as the nature and duration of the fraud and the revenues generated by similar\r\noperations. Estimates based upon aggregate ‘market loss’ (e.g., the aggregate\r\ndecline in market value of a stock resulting from disclosure of information that\r\nwas wrongfully withheld or misrepresented) are especially appropriate for\r\nsecurities cases.

In a few instances, the total dollar loss that results from the offense may overstate\r\nits seriousness.

Examples would include\r\nunderstating debts to a limited degree in order to obtain a substantial loan which\r\nthe defendant genuinely expected to repay; attempting to negotiate an instrument\r\nthat was so obviously fraudulent that no one would seriously consider honoring\r\nit; and making a misrepresentation in a securities offering that enabled the\r\nsecurities to be sold at inflated prices, but where the value of the securities\r\nsubsequently declined in substantial part for other reasons. In such instances, a\r\ndownward departure may be warranted.\";\r\nby renumbering Note 9 as Note 10; by inserting the following as Notes 7, 8 and 9:\r\n\"7. Valuation of loss is discussed in the Commentary to §2B1.1 (Larceny,\r\nEmbezzlement, and Other Forms of Theft). Consistent with the provisions of\r\n§2X1.1 (Attempt, Solicitation or Conspiracy), if an intended loss that the\r\ndefendant was attempting to inflict can be determined, this figure will be used if\r\nit is greater than the actual loss. Frequently, loss in a fraud case will be the same\r\nas in a theft case. For example, if the fraud consisted of selling or attempting to\r\nsell $40,000 in worthless securities, or representing that a forged check for\r\n$40,000 was genuine, the loss would be $40,000.\r\nThere are, however, instances where additional factors are to be considered in\r\ndetermining the loss or intended loss:\r\n(a) Fraud Involving Misrepresentation of the Value of an Item or Product\r\nSubstitution\r\nA fraud may involve the misrepresentation of the value of an item that\r\ndoes have some value (in contrast to an item that is worthless). Where,\r\nfor example, a defendant fraudulently represents that stock is worth\r\n\r\n$40,000 and the stock is worth only $10,000, the loss is the amount by\r\nwhich the stock was overvalued (i.e., $30,000). In a case involving a\r\nmisrepresentation concerning the quality of a consumer product, the loss\r\nis the difference between the amount paid by the victim for the product\r\nand the amount for which the victim could resell the product received.\r\n(b) Fraudulent Loan Application and Contract Procurement Cases\r\nIn fraudulent loan application cases and contract procurement cases where\r\nthe defendant’s capabilities are fraudulently represented, the loss is the\r\nactual loss to the victim (or if the loss has not yet come about, the\r\nexpected loss). For example, if a defendant fraudulently obtains a loan\r\nby misrepresenting the value of his assets, the loss is the amount of the\r\nloan not repaid at the time the offense is discovered, reduced by the\r\namount the lending institution has recovered, or can expect to recover,\r\nfrom any assets pledged to secure the loan.\r\nIn some cases, the loss determined above may significantly understate or\r\noverstate the seriousness of the defendant’s conduct. For example, where\r\nthe defendant substantially understated his debts to obtain a loan, which\r\nhe nevertheless repaid, the loss determined above (zero loss) will tend not\r\nto reflect adequately the risk of loss created by the defendant’s conduct.\r\nConversely, a defendant may understate his debts to a limited degree to\r\nobtain a loan (e.g., to expand a grain export business), which he genuinely\r\nexpected to repay and for which he would have qualified at a higher\r\ninterest rate had he made truthful disclosure, but he is unable to repay the\r\nloan because of some unforeseen event (e.g., an embargo imposed on\r\ngrain exports) which would have caused a default in any event. In such\r\na case, the loss determined above may overstate the seriousness of the\r\ndefendant’s conduct.\r\n(c) Consequential Damages in Procurement Fraud and Product Substitution\r\nCases\r\nIn contrast to other types of cases, loss in a procurement fraud or product\r\nsubstitution case includes not only direct damages, but also consequential\r\ndamages that were reasonably foreseeable. For example, in a case\r\ninvolving a defense product substitution offense, the loss includes the\r\ngovernment’s reasonably foreseeable costs of making substitute\r\ntransactions and handling or disposing of the product delivered or\r\nretrofitting the product so that it can be used for its intended purpose, plus\r\nthe government’s reasonably foreseeable cost of rectifying the actual or\r\npotential disruption to government operations caused by the product\r\nsubstitution. Similarly, in the case of fraud affecting a defense contract\r\naward, loss includes the reasonably foreseeable administrative cost to the\r\ngovernment and other participants of repeating or correcting the\r\nprocurement action affected, plus any increased cost to procure the\r\nproduct or service involved that was reasonably foreseeable. Inclusion of\r\nreasonably foreseeable consequential damages directly in the calculation\r\nAmendment 393 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003\r\n\r\nof loss in procurement fraud and product substitution cases reflects that\r\nsuch damages frequently are substantial in such cases.\r\n(d) Diversion of Government Program Benefits\r\nIn a case involving diversion of government program benefits, loss is the\r\nvalue of the benefits diverted from intended recipients or uses.\r\n(e) Davis-Bacon Act Cases\r\nIn a case involving a Davis-Bacon Act violation (a violation of 40 U.S.C.\r\n§ 276a, criminally prosecuted under 18 U.S.C. § 1001), the loss is the\r\ndifference between the legally required and actual wages paid.\r\n8. For the purposes of subsection (b)(1), the loss need not be determined with\r\nprecision. The court need only make a reasonable estimate of the loss, given the\r\navailable information. This estimate, for example, may be based on the\r\napproximate number of victims and an estimate of the average loss to each\r\nvictim, or on more general factors, such as the nature and duration of the fraud\r\nand the revenues generated by similar operations. The offender’s gain from\r\ncommitting the fraud is an alternative estimate that ordinarily will underestimate\r\nthe loss.\r\n9. In the case of a partially completed offense (e.g., an offense involving a\r\ncompleted fraud that is part of a larger, attempted fraud), the offense level is to\r\nbe determined in accordance with the provisions of §2X1.1 (Attempt,\r\nSolicitation, or Conspiracy) whether the conviction is for the substantive offense,\r\nthe inchoate offense (attempt, solicitation, or conspiracy), or both; see\r\nApplication Note 4 in the Commentary to §2X1.1.\";\r\nand in the renumbered Note 10 (formerly Note 9) by deleting:\r\n\"Dollar loss often does not fully capture the harmfulness and seriousness of the conduct.\r\nIn such instances, an upward departure may be warranted.\",\r\nand inserting in lieu thereof:\r\n\"In cases in which the loss determined under subsection (b)(1) does not fully capture the\r\nharmfulness and seriousness of the conduct, an upward departure may be warranted.\";\r\nby deleting subdivision (f) as follows:\r\n\"(f) completion of the offense was prevented, or the offense was interrupted before\r\nit caused serious harm.\";\r\nby deleting the semicolon at the end of subdivision (e) and inserting in lieu thereof a period; and\r\nby inserting the following additional paragraph at the end:\r\n\r\n\"In a few instances, the loss determined under subsection (b)(1) may overstate the\r\nseriousness of the offense.

more marihuana plants, an equivalency of one plant to\r\none kilogram of marihuana is derived from the statutory penalty provisions of 21 U.S.C.\r\n§ 841(b)(1)(A), (B), and (D). In cases involving fewer than fifty plants, the statute is\r\nsilent as to the equivalency. For cases involving fewer than fifty plants, the Commission\r\nhas adopted an equivalency of 100 grams per plant, or the actual weight of the usable\r\nmarihuana, whichever is greater. The decision to treat each plant as equal to 100 grams\r\nis premised on the fact that the average yield from a mature marihuana plant equals 100\r\ngrams of marihuana. In controlled substance offenses, an attempt is assigned the same\r\noffense level as the object of the attempt (see §2D1.4). Consequently, the Commission\r\nadopted the policy that, in the case of fewer than fifty marihuana plants, each plant is to\r\nbe treated as the equivalent of an attempt to produce 100 grams of marihuana, except\r\nwhere the actual weight of the usable marihuana is greater.\".","Reason":"Reason for Amendment: This amendment substitutes a single conversion for Schedule III\r\nsubstances (1 gm of a Schedule III substance = 2 gms of marihuana) that will simplify\r\napplication of the guidelines as well as address currently unlisted Schedule III substances.\r\nBecause the equivalencies for Schedule III substances are not statutorily based, nor are the\r\npharmacological equivalencies as clear as with Schedule I or II Substances, a generic listing\r\nwas deemed appropriate. For the same reasons, the amendment provides a single conversion\r\nAmendment 396 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003\r\n\r\nfor Schedule IV substances (1 gm of a Schedule IV substance = 0.125 gm of marihuana) and\r\nSchedule V substances (1 gm of a Schedule V substance = 0.0125 gm of marihuana). The\r\namendment also adds a conversion for anabolic steroids consistent with their treatment in the\r\nDrug Quantity Table. In addition, the amendment adds footnotes to the Drug Equivalency\r\nTables for Schedule I or II depressants and Schedule III, IV, and V substances to remove an\r\nambiguity in guideline application by expressly limiting the combined equivalent weight of\r\nsuch substances to the marihuana amount consistent with the highest offense level for such\r\nsubstances provided in the Drug Quantity Table. See United States v. Gurgliolo, 894 F.2d 56\r\n(3d Cir. 1990).

In setting the fine for an organization, the court should consider whether the\r\norganization encouraged or took steps to prevent the violation, whether high-level\r\nmanagement was aware of the violation, and whether the organization previously\r\nengaged in antitrust violations.\",\r\nand inserting in lieu thereof:\r\n\"3. The fine for an organization is determined by applying Chapter Eight (Sentencing\r\nof Organizations). In selecting a fine for an organization within the guideline fine\r\nrange, the court should consider both the gain to the organization from the\r\nAmendment 422 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003\r\n\r\noffense and the loss caused by the organization. It is estimated that the average\r\ngain from price-fixing is 10 percent of the selling price. The loss from price-\r\nfixing exceeds the gain because, among other things, injury is inflicted upon\r\nconsumers who are unable or for other reasons do not buy the product at the\r\nhigher prices. Because the loss from price-fixing exceeds the gain, subsection\r\n(d)(1) provides that 20 percent of the volume of affected commerce is to be used\r\nin lieu of the pecuniary loss under §8C2.4(a)(3). The purpose for specifying a\r\npercent of the volume of commerce is to avoid the time and expense that would\r\nbe required for the court to determine the actual gain or loss. In cases in which\r\nthe actual monopoly overcharge appears to be either substantially more or\r\nsubstantially less than 10 percent, this factor should be considered in setting the\r\nfine within the guideline fine range.\".\r\nThe Commentary to §2R1.1 captioned \"Background\" is amended by deleting the last paragraph\r\nas follows:\r\n\" Substantial fines are an essential part of the sanction. It is estimated that the\r\naverage additional profit attributable to price fixing is 10 percent of the selling price. The\r\nCommission has specified that a fine from two to five times that amount be imposed on\r\norganizational defendants as a deterrent because of the difficulty in identifying violators.\r\nAdditional monetary penalties can be provided through private treble damage actions.\r\nA lower fine is specified for individuals. The Commission believes that most antitrust\r\ndefendants have the resources and earning capacity to pay these fines, at least over time.\r\nThe statutory maximum fine is $250,000 for individuals and $1,000,000 for\r\norganizations, but is increased when there are convictions on multiple counts.\",\r\nand inserting in lieu thereof:\r\n\" Substantial fines are an essential part of the sentence. For an individual, the\r\nguideline fine range is from one to five percent of the volume of commerce, but not less\r\nthan $20,000. For an organization, the guideline fine range is determined under Chapter\r\nEight (Sentencing of Organizations), but pursuant to subsection (d)(2), the minimum\r\nmultiplier is at least 0.75. This multiplier, which requires a minimum fine of 15 percent\r\nof the volume of commerce for the least serious case, was selected to provide an effective\r\ndeterrent to antitrust offenses. At the same time, this minimum multiplier maintains\r\nincentives for desired organizational behavior. Because the Department of Justice has\r\na well-established amnesty program for organizations that self-report antitrust offenses,\r\nno lower minimum multiplier is needed as an incentive for self-reporting. A minimum\r\nmultiplier of at least 0.75 ensures that fines imposed in antitrust cases will exceed the\r\naverage monopoly overcharge.\r\nThe Commission believes that most antitrust defendants have the resources and earning\r\ncapacity to pay the fines called for by this guideline, at least over time on an installment\r\nbasis. The statutory maximum fine is $350,000 for individuals and $10,000,000 for\r\norganizations, but is increased when there are convictions on multiple counts.\".\r\nSection 2S1.1 is amended by inserting the following additional subsection:\r\n\"(c) Special Instruction for Fines - Organizations\r\n\r\n(1) In lieu of the applicable amount from the table in subsection (d) of\r\n§8C2.4 (Base Fine), use:\r\n(A) the greater of $250,000 or 100 percent of the value of the funds\r\nif subsections (a)(1) and (b)(1) are used to determine the offense\r\nlevel; or\r\n(B) the greater of $200,000 or 70 percent of the value of the funds if\r\nsubsections (a)(2) and (b)(1) are used to determine the offense\r\nlevel; or\r\n(C) the greater of $200,000 or 70 percent of the value of the funds if\r\nsubsection (a)(1) but not (b)(1) is used to determine the offense\r\nlevel; or\r\n(D) the greater of $150,000 or 50 percent of the value of the funds if\r\nsubsection (a)(2) but not (b)(1) is used to determine the offense\r\nlevel.\".\r\nSection 2S1.2 is amended by inserting the following additional subsection:\r\n\"(c) Special Instruction for Fines - Organizations\r\n(1) In lieu of the applicable amount from the table in subsection (d) of\r\n§8C2.4 (Base Fine), use:\r\n(A) the greater of $175,000 or 60 percent of the value of the funds if\r\nsubsection (b)(1)(A) is used to determine the offense level; or\r\n(B) the greater of $150,000 or 50 percent of the value of the funds if\r\nsubsection (b)(1)(B) is used to determine the offense level.\".\r\nSection 2S1.3 is amended by inserting the following additional subsection:\r\n\"(c) Special Instruction for Fines - Organizations\r\n(1) In lieu of the applicable amount from the table in subsection (d) of\r\n§8C2.4 (Base Fine), use:\r\n(A) the greater of $125,000 or 30 percent of the value of the funds if\r\nsubsections (a)(1) and (b)(1) are used to determine the offense\r\nlevel; or\r\n(B) the greater of $50,000 or 20 percent of the value of the funds if\r\nsubsection (a)(1) but not (b)(1) are used to determine the offense\r\nlevel.\".\r\nAmendment 422 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003\r\n\r\nSection 2S1.4 is amended by inserting the following additional subsection:\r\n\"(c) Special Instruction for Fines - Organizations\r\n(1) In lieu of the applicable amount from the table in subsection (d) of\r\n§8C2.4 (Base Fine), use:\r\n(A) the greater of $50,000 or 20 percent of the value of the funds if\r\nsubsection (b)(1) or (b)(2) is used to determine the offense level;\r\nor\r\n(B) the greater of $15,000 or 10 percent of the value of the funds,\r\notherwise.\".","Reason":"Reason for Amendment: This amendment adds guidelines and policy statements to address\r\nthe sentencing of organizational defendants.","EffectiveDate":"Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1991."},{"Id":421,"Title":"Amendment 421","Text":"Section 1B1.10(c) is amended by deleting:\r\n\"(c) Provided, however, that a reduction in a defendant’s term of imprisonment --\r\n(1) is not authorized unless the maximum of the guideline range applicable\r\nto the defendant (from Chapter Five, Part A) has been lowered by at least\r\nsix months; and\r\n(2) may, in no event, exceed the number of months by which the maximum\r\nof the guideline range applicable to the defendant (from Chapter Five,\r\nPart A) has been lowered.\",\r\nand inserting in lieu thereof:\r\n\"(c) Provided, that a reduction in a defendant’s term of imprisonment may, in no\r\nevent, exceed the number of months by which the maximum of the guideline\r\nrange applicable to the defendant (from Chapter Five, Part A) has been lowered.\".\r\nSection 1B1.10(d) is amended by deleting \"and 341\" and inserting in lieu thereof \"341, 379, and\r\n380\".\r\nThe Commentary to §1B1.10 captioned \"Background\" is amended in the fourth paragraph by\r\ndeleting:\r\n\"The requirement in subsection (c)(1) that the maximum of the guideline range be\r\nlowered by at least six months for a reduction to be considered\",\r\nand inserting in lieu thereof:\r\n\r\n\"The Commission has not included in this policy statement amendments that generally\r\nreduce the maximum of the guideline range by less than six months.

In such case, the adjustments in Chapter Three, Parts A\r\n(Victim-Related Adjustments), B (Role in the Offense), and E (Acceptance of\r\nResponsibility) are also to be determined in respect to that other offense\r\nguideline. For example, a defendant convicted of possession of a firearm by a\r\nfelon, to which §2K2.1 (Unlawful Receipt, Possession, or Transportation of\r\nFirearms or Ammunition; Prohibited Transactions Involving Firearms or\r\nAmmunition) applies, is found to have used that firearm in the commission of a\r\nrobbery.

The adjustments in Chapter Three, Parts A, B and E are to be\r\napplied as if the offense of conviction had directly referenced the robbery\r\nguideline.\r\n3. A reference to another guideline may direct that such reference is to be used only\r\nif it results in a greater offense level. In such cases, the greater offense level\r\nmeans the greater final offense level (i.e., the greater offense level taking into\r\naccount both the Chapter Two offense level and any applicable Chapter Three\r\nadjustments). Although the offense guideline that results in the greater offense\r\nlevel under Chapter Two will most frequently result in the greater final offense\r\nlevel, this will not always be the case. If, for example, a role or abuse of trust\r\nadjustment applies to the cross-referenced offense guideline, but not to the\r\nguideline initially applied, the greater Chapter Two offense level may not\r\nnecessarily result in a greater final offense level.\r\n4.

To determine which of the alternative base offense levels\r\n(e.g., §2H1.1(a)(1) or (a)(2)) results in the greater offense level, apply Chapter Three,\r\nParts A, B, C, and D to each alternative base offense level. Use whichever results in the\r\ngreater offense level. Example: The defendant is convicted of one count of conspiracy\r\nto violate civil rights that included two level 12 underlying offenses (of a type not\r\ngrouped together under Chapter Three, Part D). No adjustment from Chapter Three,\r\nParts A, B, or C applies. The base offense level from §2H1.1(a)(1) is 15. The offense\r\nlevel for each underlying offense from §2H1.1(a)(2) is 14 (2 + 12). Under Chapter\r\nThree, Part D (Multiple Counts), the two level 14 underlying offenses result in a\r\ncombined offense level of 16. This offense level is greater than the alternative base\r\noffense level of 15 under §2H1.1(a)(1). Therefore, the case is treated as if there were two\r\ncounts, one for each underlying offense, with a base offense level under §2H1.1(a)(2) of\r\n14 for each underlying offense.\".\r\nThe Commentary to §2H1.1 captioned \"Application Notes\" is amended in the first sentence of\r\nthe second paragraph of Note 1 (formerly the first paragraph) by deleting \"contained in the\r\nparticular guideline in Chapter Two) for any underlying criminal conduct\" and inserting in lieu\r\nthereof \"and cross references) from the offense guideline in Chapter Two that most closely\r\ncorresponds to the underlying offense\"; in the last sentence of the second paragraph of Note 1\r\n(formerly the first paragraph) by deleting \"an offense\" and \"that offense\" and inserting in lieu\r\nthereof \"arson\" in each instance.","Reason":"Reason for Amendment: This amendment clarifies the operation of this guideline.","EffectiveDate":"Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1991."},{"Id":429,"Title":"Amendment 429","Text":"The Commentary to §2J1.7 captioned \"Background\" is amended by deleting the\r\nfirst paragraph as follows:\r\n\"An enhancement under 18 U.S.C. § 3147 may be imposed only upon application of the\r\ngovernment; it cannot be imposed on the court’s own motion.

Conduct ‘for which the defendant would be otherwise accountable,’ as used in\r\nsubsection (a)(1), includes conduct that the defendant counseled, commanded,\r\ninduced, procured, or willfully caused. (Cf. 18 U.S.C. § 2.) In the case of\r\ncriminal activity undertaken in concert with others, whether or not charged as a\r\nconspiracy, the conduct for which the defendant ‘would be otherwise\r\naccountable’ also includes conduct of others in furtherance of the execution of\r\nthe jointly-undertaken criminal activity that was reasonably foreseeable by the\r\ndefendant. Because a count may be broadly worded and include the conduct of\r\nmany participants over a substantial period of time, the scope of the jointly-\r\nundertaken criminal activity, and hence relevant conduct, is not necessarily the\r\nsame for every participant. Where it is established that the conduct was neither\r\nwithin the scope of the defendant’s agreement, nor was reasonably foreseeable\r\nin connection with the criminal activity the defendant agreed to jointly undertake,\r\nsuch conduct is not included in establishing the defendant’s offense level under\r\nthis guideline.\r\nIn the case of solicitation, misprision, or accessory after the fact, the conduct for which\r\nthe defendant ‘would be otherwise accountable’ includes all conduct relevant to\r\ndetermining the offense level for the underlying offense that was known, or reasonably\r\nshould have been known, by the defendant.\r\nIllustrations of Conduct for Which the Defendant is Accountable\r\na. Defendant A, one of ten off-loaders hired by Defendant B, was convicted\r\nof importation of marihuana, as a result of his assistance in off-loading a boat\r\ncontaining a one-ton shipment of marihuana. Regardless of the number of bales\r\nof marihuana that he actually unloaded, and notwithstanding any claim on his\r\npart that he was neither aware of, nor could reasonably foresee, that the boat\r\ncontained this quantity of marihuana, Defendant A is held accountable for the\r\nentire one-ton quantity of marihuana on the boat because he aided and abetted the\r\nunloading, and hence the importation, of the entire shipment.\r\nb. Defendant C, the getaway driver in an armed bank robbery in which\r\n$15,000 is taken and a teller is injured, is convicted of the substantive count of\r\nbank robbery. Defendant C is accountable for the money taken because he aided\r\nand abetted the taking of the money. He is accountable for the injury inflicted\r\nbecause he participated in concerted criminal conduct that he could reasonably\r\nforesee might result in the infliction of injury.\r\n\r\nc. Defendant D pays Defendant E a small amount to forge an endorsement\r\non an $800 stolen government check. Unknown to Defendant E, Defendant D\r\nthen uses that check as a down payment in a scheme to fraudulently obtain\r\n$15,000 worth of merchandise. Defendant E is convicted of forging the $800\r\ncheck. Defendant E is not accountable for the $15,000 because the fraudulent\r\nscheme to obtain $15,000 was beyond the scope of, and not reasonably\r\nforeseeable in connection with, the criminal activity he jointly undertook with\r\nDefendant D.\r\nd. Defendants F and G, working together, design and execute a scheme to\r\nsell fraudulent stocks by telephone. Defendant F fraudulently obtains $20,000.\r\nDefendant G fraudulently obtains $35,000. Each is convicted of mail fraud.\r\nEach defendant is accountable for the entire amount ($55,000) because each\r\naided and abetted the other in the fraudulent conduct. Alternatively, because\r\nDefendants F and G engaged in concerted criminal activity, each is accountable\r\nfor the entire $55,000 loss because the conduct of each was in furtherance of the\r\njointly undertaken criminal activity and was reasonably foreseeable.\r\ne. Defendants H and I engaged in an ongoing marihuana importation\r\nconspiracy in which Defendant J was hired only to help off-load a single\r\nshipment. Defendants H, I, and J are included in a single count charging\r\nconspiracy to import marihuana. For the purposes of determining the offense\r\nlevel under this guideline, Defendant J is accountable for the entire single\r\nshipment of marihuana he conspired to help import and any acts or omissions in\r\nfurtherance of the importation that were reasonably foreseeable. He is not\r\naccountable for prior or subsequent shipments of marihuana imported by\r\nDefendants H or I if those acts were beyond the scope of, and not reasonably\r\nforeseeable in connection with, the criminal activity he agreed to jointly\r\nundertake with Defendants H and I (i.e., the importation of the single shipment\r\nof marihuana).\",\r\nand inserting in lieu thereof:\r\n\"1. The principles and limits of sentencing accountability under this guideline are not\r\nalways the same as the principles and limits of criminal liability. Under\r\nsubsections (a)(1) and (a)(2), the focus is on the specific acts and omissions for\r\nwhich the defendant is to be held accountable in determining the applicable\r\nguideline range, rather than on whether the defendant is criminally liable for an\r\noffense as a principal, accomplice, or conspirator.\r\n2. A ‘jointly undertaken criminal activity’ is a criminal plan, scheme, endeavor, or\r\nenterprise undertaken by the defendant in concert with others, whether or not\r\ncharged as a conspiracy.\r\nIn the case of a jointly undertaken criminal activity, subsection (a)(1)(B) provides\r\nthat a defendant is accountable for the conduct (acts and omissions) of others that\r\nwas both:\r\n(i) in furtherance of the jointly undertaken criminal activity; and\r\n(ii) reasonably foreseeable in connection with that criminal activity.\r\nBecause a count may be worded broadly and include the conduct of many\r\nparticipants over a period of time, the scope of the criminal activity jointly\r\nAmendment 439 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003\r\n\r\nundertaken by the defendant (the ‘jointly undertaken criminal activity’) is not\r\nnecessarily the same as the scope of the entire conspiracy, and hence relevant\r\nconduct is not necessarily the same for every participant. In order to determine\r\nthe defendant’s accountability for the conduct of others under subsection\r\n(a)(1)(B), the court must first determine the scope of the criminal activity the\r\nparticular defendant agreed to jointly undertake (i.e., the scope of the specific\r\nconduct and objectives embraced by the defendant’s agreement). The conduct\r\nof others that was both in furtherance of, and reasonably foreseeable in\r\nconnection with, the criminal activity jointly undertaken by the defendant is\r\nrelevant conduct under this provision. The conduct of others that was not in\r\nfurtherance of the criminal activity jointly undertaken by the defendant, or was\r\nnot reasonably foreseeable in connection with that criminal activity, is not\r\nrelevant conduct under this provision.\r\nIn determining the scope of the criminal activity that the particular defendant\r\nagreed to jointly undertake (i.e., the scope of the specific conduct and objectives\r\nembraced by the defendant’s agreement), the court may consider any explicit\r\nagreement or implicit agreement fairly inferred from the conduct of the defendant\r\nand others.\r\nNote that the criminal activity that the defendant agreed to jointly undertake, and\r\nthe reasonably foreseeable conduct of others in furtherance of that criminal\r\nactivity, are not necessarily identical. For example, two defendants agree to\r\ncommit a robbery and, during the course of that robbery, the first defendant\r\nassaults and injures a victim. The second defendant is accountable for the assault\r\nand injury to the victim (even if the second defendant had not agreed to the\r\nassault and had cautioned the first defendant to be careful not to hurt anyone)\r\nbecause the assaultive conduct was in furtherance of the jointly undertaken\r\ncriminal activity (the robbery) and was reasonably foreseeable in connection with\r\nthat criminal activity (given the nature of the offense).\r\nWith respect to offenses involving contraband (including controlled substances),\r\nthe defendant is accountable for all quantities of contraband with which he was\r\ndirectly involved and, in the case of a jointly undertaken criminal activity, all\r\nreasonably foreseeable quantities of contraband that were within the scope of the\r\ncriminal activity that he jointly undertook.\r\nThe requirement of reasonable foreseeability applies only in respect to the\r\nconduct (i.e., acts and omissions) of others under subsection (a)(1)(B). It does\r\nnot apply to conduct that the defendant personally undertakes, aids, abets,\r\ncounsels, commands, induces, procures, or willfully causes; such conduct is\r\naddressed under subsection (a)(1)(A).\r\nIllustrations of Conduct for Which the Defendant is Accountable\r\n(a) Acts and omissions aided or abetted by the defendant\r\n(1) Defendant A is one of ten persons hired by Defendant B to off-\r\nload a ship containing marihuana. The off-loading of the ship is\r\ninterrupted by law enforcement officers and one ton of\r\nmarihuana is seized (the amount on the ship as well as the\r\namount off-loaded). Defendant A and the other off-loaders are\r\narrested and convicted of importation of marihuana. Regardless\r\nof the number of bales he personally unloaded, Defendant A is\r\n\r\naccountable for the entire one-ton quantity of marihuana.\r\nDefendant A aided and abetted the off-loading of the entire\r\nshipment of marihuana by directly participating in the off-\r\nloading of that shipment (i.e., the specific objective of the\r\ncriminal activity he joined was the off-loading of the entire\r\nshipment). Therefore, he is accountable for the entire shipment\r\nunder subsection (a)(1)(A) without regard to the issue of\r\nreasonable foreseeability. This is conceptually similar to the case\r\nof a defendant who transports a suitcase knowing that it contains\r\na controlled substance and, therefore, is accountable for the\r\ncontrolled substance in the suitcase regardless of his knowledge\r\nor lack of knowledge of the actual type or amount of that\r\ncontrolled substance.\r\nIn certain cases, a defendant may be accountable for particular\r\nconduct under more than one subsection of this guideline. As\r\nnoted in the preceding paragraph, Defendant A is accountable for\r\nthe entire one-ton shipment of marihuana under subsection\r\n(a)(1)(A). Defendant A also is accountable for the entire one-ton\r\nshipment of marihuana on the basis of subsection\r\n(a)(1)(B)(applying to a jointly undertaken criminal activity).\r\nDefendant A engaged in a jointly undertaken criminal activity\r\n(the scope of which was the importation of the shipment of\r\nmarihuana). A finding that the one-ton quantity of marihuana\r\nwas reasonably foreseeable is warranted from the nature of the\r\nundertaking itself (the importation of marihuana by ship typically\r\ninvolves very large quantities of marihuana). The specific\r\ncircumstances of the case (the defendant was one of ten persons\r\noff-loading the marihuana in bales) also support this finding. In\r\nan actual case, of course, if a defendant’s accountability for\r\nparticular conduct is established under one provision of this\r\nguideline, it is not necessary to review alternative provisions\r\nunder which such accountability might be established.\r\n(b) Acts and omissions aided or abetted by the defendant; requirement that\r\nthe conduct of others be in furtherance of the jointly undertaken criminal\r\nactivity and reasonably foreseeable\r\n(1) Defendant C is the getaway driver in an armed bank robbery in\r\nwhich $15,000 is taken and a teller is assaulted and injured.\r\nDefendant C is accountable for the money taken under\r\nsubsection (a)(1)(A) because he aided and abetted the act of\r\ntaking the money (the taking of money was the specific objective\r\nof the offense he joined). Defendant C is accountable for the\r\ninjury to the teller under subsection (a)(1)(B) because the assault\r\non the teller was in furtherance of the jointly undertaken criminal\r\nactivity (the robbery) and was reasonably foreseeable in\r\nconnection with that criminal activity (given the nature of the\r\noffense).\r\nAs noted earlier, a defendant may be accountable for particular\r\nconduct under more than one subsection. In this example,\r\nDefendant C also is accountable for the money taken on the basis\r\nof subsection (a)(1)(B) because the taking of money was in\r\nAmendment 439 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003\r\n\r\nfurtherance of the jointly undertaken criminal activity (the\r\nrobbery) and was reasonably foreseeable (as noted, the taking of\r\nmoney was the specific objective of the jointly undertaken\r\ncriminal activity).\r\n(c) Requirement that the conduct of others be in furtherance of the jointly\r\nundertaken criminal activity and reasonably foreseeable; scope of the\r\ncriminal activity\r\n(1) Defendant D pays Defendant E a small amount to forge an\r\nendorsement on an $800 stolen government check. Unknown to\r\nDefendant E, Defendant D then uses that check as a down\r\npayment in a scheme to fraudulently obtain $15,000 worth of\r\nmerchandise. Defendant E is convicted of forging the $800\r\ncheck and is accountable for the forgery of this check under\r\nsubsection (a)(1)(A). Defendant E is not accountable for the\r\n$15,000 because the fraudulent scheme to obtain $15,000 was\r\nnot in furtherance of the criminal activity he jointly undertook\r\nwith Defendant D (i.e., the forgery of the $800 check).\r\n(2) Defendants F and G, working together, design and execute a\r\nscheme to sell fraudulent stocks by telephone. Defendant F\r\nfraudulently obtains $20,000. Defendant G fraudulently obtains\r\n$35,000. Each is convicted of mail fraud. Defendants F and G\r\neach are accountable for the entire amount ($55,000). Each\r\ndefendant is accountable for the amount he personally obtained\r\nunder subsection (a)(1)(A). Each defendant is accountable for\r\nthe amount obtained by his accomplice under subsection\r\n(a)(1)(B) because the conduct of each was in furtherance of the\r\njointly undertaken criminal activity and was reasonably\r\nforeseeable in connection with that criminal activity.\r\n(3) Defendants H and I engaged in an ongoing marihuana\r\nimportation conspiracy in which Defendant J was hired only to\r\nhelp off-load a single shipment. Defendants H, I, and J are\r\nincluded in a single count charging conspiracy to import\r\nmarihuana. Defendant J is accountable for the entire single\r\nshipment of marihuana he helped import under subsection\r\n(a)(1)(A) and any acts and omissions in furtherance of the\r\nimportation of that shipment that were reasonably foreseeable\r\n(see the discussion in example (a)(1) above). He is not\r\naccountable for prior or subsequent shipments of marihuana\r\nimported by Defendants H or I because those acts were not in\r\nfurtherance of his jointly undertaken criminal activity (the\r\nimportation of the single shipment of marihuana).\r\n(4) Defendant K is a wholesale distributor of child pornography.\r\nDefendant L is a retail-level dealer who purchases child\r\npornography from Defendant K and resells it, but otherwise\r\noperates independently of Defendant K. Similarly, Defendant M\r\nis a retail-level dealer who purchases child pornography from\r\nDefendant K and resells it, but otherwise operates independently\r\nof Defendant K. Defendants L and M are aware of each other’s\r\ncriminal activity but operate independently. Defendant N is\r\n\r\nDefendant K’s assistant who recruits customers for Defendant K\r\nand frequently supervises the deliveries to Defendant K’s\r\ncustomers. Each defendant is convicted of a count charging\r\nconspiracy to distribute child pornography. Defendant K is\r\naccountable under subsection (a)(1)(A) for the entire quantity of\r\nchild pornography sold to Defendants L and M. Defendant N\r\nalso is accountable for the entire quantity sold to those\r\ndefendants under subsection (a)(1)(B) because the entire quantity\r\nwas within the scope of his jointly undertaken criminal activity\r\nand reasonably foreseeable. Defendant L is accountable under\r\nsubsection (a)(1)(A) only for the quantity of child pornography\r\nthat he purchased from Defendant K because the scope of his\r\njointly undertaken criminal activity is limited to that amount.\r\nFor the same reason, Defendant M is accountable under\r\nsubsection (a)(1)(A) only for the quantity of child pornography\r\nthat he purchased from Defendant K.\r\n(5) Defendant O knows about her boyfriend’s ongoing drug-\r\ntrafficking activity, but agrees to participate on only one occasion\r\nby making a delivery for him at his request when he was ill.\r\nDefendant O is accountable under subsection (a)(1)(A) for the\r\ndrug quantity involved on that one occasion. Defendant O is not\r\naccountable for the other drug sales made by her boyfriend\r\nbecause those sales were not in furtherance of her jointly\r\nundertaken criminal activity (i.e., the one delivery).\r\n(6) Defendant P is a street-level drug dealer who knows of other\r\nstreet-level drug dealers in the same geographic area who sell the\r\nsame type of drug as he sells. Defendant P and the other dealers\r\nshare a common source of supply, but otherwise operate\r\nindependently. Defendant P is not accountable for the quantities\r\nof drugs sold by the other street-level drug dealers because he is\r\nnot engaged in a jointly undertaken criminal activity with them.\r\nIn contrast, Defendant Q, another street-level drug dealer, pools\r\nhis resources and profits with four other street-level drug dealers.\r\nDefendant Q is engaged in a jointly undertaken criminal activity\r\nand, therefore, he is accountable under subsection (a)(1)(B) for\r\nthe quantities of drugs sold by the four other dealers during the\r\ncourse of his joint undertaking with them because those sales\r\nwere in furtherance of the jointly undertaken criminal activity\r\nand reasonably foreseeable in connection with that criminal\r\nactivity.\r\n(7) Defendant R recruits Defendant S to distribute 500 grams of\r\ncocaine. Defendant S knows that Defendant R is the prime\r\nfigure in a conspiracy involved in importing much larger\r\nquantities of cocaine. As long as Defendant S’s agreement and\r\nconduct is limited to the distribution of the 500 grams, Defendant\r\nS is accountable only for that 500 gram amount (under\r\nsubsection (a)(1)(A)), rather than the much larger quantity\r\nimported by Defendant R.\r\n(8) Defendants T, U, V, and W are hired by a supplier to backpack\r\nAmendment 439 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003\r\n\r\na quantity of marihuana across the border from Mexico into the\r\nUnited States. Defendants T, U, V, and W receive their\r\nindividual shipments from the supplier at the same time and\r\ncoordinate their importation efforts by walking across the border\r\ntogether for mutual assistance and protection. Each defendant is\r\naccountable for the aggregate quantity of marihuana transported\r\nby the four defendants. The four defendants engaged in a jointly\r\nundertaken criminal activity, the object of which was the\r\nimportation of the four backpacks containing marihuana\r\n(subsection (a)(1)(B)), and aided and abetted each other’s actions\r\n(subsection (a)(1)(A)) in carrying out the jointly undertaken\r\ncriminal activity. In contrast, if Defendants T, U, V, and W were\r\nhired individually, transported their individual shipments at\r\ndifferent times, and otherwise operated independently, each\r\ndefendant would be accountable only for the quantity of\r\nmarihuana he personally transported (subsection (a)(1)(A)). As\r\nthis example illustrates, in cases involving contraband (including\r\ncontrolled substances), the scope of the jointly undertaken\r\ncriminal activity (and thus the accountability of the defendant for\r\nthe contraband that was the object of that jointly undertaken\r\nactivity) may depend upon whether, in the particular\r\ncircumstances, the nature of the offense is more appropriately\r\nviewed as one jointly undertaken criminal activity or as a number\r\nof separate criminal activities.\".\r\nThe Commentary to §1B1.3 captioned \"Application Notes\" is amended in Note 3 (formerly\r\nNote 2) by deleting the first sentence as follows:\r\n\"‘Such acts and omissions that were part of the same course of conduct or common\r\nscheme or plan as the offense of conviction,’ as used in subsection (a)(2), refers to acts\r\nand omissions committed or aided and abetted by the defendant, or for which the\r\ndefendant would be otherwise accountable, that were part of the same course of conduct\r\nor common scheme or plan as the offense of conviction.\".\r\nThe Commentary to §1B1.3 captioned \"Application Notes\" is amended in Note 6 (formerly\r\nNote 5) in the first paragraph by deleting:\r\n\"For example, in §2K1.5, subsection (b)(1) applies ‘If the defendant is convicted under\r\n49 U.S.C. § 1472(l)(2).’\",\r\nand inserting in lieu thereof:\r\n\"For example, in §2S1.1, subsection (a)(1) applies if the defendant ‘is convicted under\r\n18 U.S.C. § 1956(a)(1)(A), (a)(2)(A), or (a)(3)(A).’\";\r\nand in the second paragraph by deleting:\r\n\"For example, §2K1.5(b)(1) (which is applicable only if the defendant is convicted under\r\n49 U.S.C. § 1472(l)(2)) would be applied in determining the offense level under §2X3.1\r\n(Accessory After the Fact) where the defendant was convicted of accessory after the fact\r\nto a violation of 49 U.S.C. § 1472(l)(2).\",\r\nand inserting in lieu thereof:\r\n\r\n\"For example, §2S1.1(a)(1) (which is applicable only if the defendant is convicted under\r\n18 U.S.C. § 1956(a)(1)(A), (a)(2)(A), or (a)(3)(A)) would be applied in determining the\r\noffense level under §2X3.1 (Accessory After the Fact) where the defendant was\r\nconvicted of accessory after the fact to a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1956(a)(1)(A),\r\n(a)(2)(A), or (a)(3)(A).\".\r\nThe Commentary to §1B1.3 captioned \"Application Notes\" is amended by inserting the\r\nfollowing additional notes:\r\n\"9. ‘Common scheme or plan’ and ‘same course of conduct’ are two closely-related\r\nconcepts.\r\n(A) Common scheme or plan. For two or more offenses to constitute part of a\r\ncommon scheme or plan, they must be substantially connected to each other by\r\nat least one common factor, such as common victims, common accomplices,\r\ncommon purpose, or similar modus operandi. For example, the conduct of five\r\ndefendants who together defrauded a group of investors by computer\r\nmanipulations that unlawfully transferred funds over an eighteen-month period\r\nwould qualify as a common scheme or plan on the basis of any of the above listed\r\nfactors; i.e., the commonality of victims (the same investors were defrauded on\r\nan ongoing basis), commonality of offenders (the conduct constituted an ongoing\r\nconspiracy), commonality of purpose (to defraud the group of investors), or\r\nsimilarity of modus operandi (the same or similar computer manipulations were\r\nused to execute the scheme).\r\n(B) Same course of conduct. Offenses that do not qualify as part of a common\r\nscheme or plan may nonetheless qualify as part of the same course of conduct if\r\nthey are sufficiently connected or related to each other as to warrant the\r\nconclusion that they are part of a single episode, spree, or ongoing series of\r\noffenses. Factors that are appropriate to the determination of whether offenses\r\nare sufficiently connected or related to each other to be considered as part of the\r\nsame course of conduct include the degree of similarity of the offenses and the\r\ntime interval between the offenses. The nature of the offenses may also be a\r\nrelevant consideration (e.g., a defendant’s failure to file tax returns in three\r\nconsecutive years appropriately would be considered as part of the same course\r\nof conduct because such returns are only required at yearly intervals).\r\n10. In the case of solicitation, misprision, or accessory after the fact, the conduct for\r\nwhich the defendant is accountable includes all conduct relevant to determining\r\nthe offense level for the underlying offense that was known, or reasonably should\r\nhave been known, by the defendant.\".","Reason":"Reason for Amendment: This amendment clarifies and more fully illustrates the operation\r\nof this guideline.

Subsection (b) (which applies only if subsection (a) does not apply), applies in\r\ntwo situations. First, it applies if the sentence resulting in the undischarged term\r\nof imprisonment was a federal sentence imposed pursuant to the Sentencing\r\nReform Act. In such cases, the court shall fashion a sentence equal to the total\r\npunishment that would have been imposed had both sentences been imposed at\r\nthe same time. Second, it applies if the conduct resulting in the undischarged\r\nterm of imprisonment was part of the same course of conduct as the instant\r\noffense and has been fully taken into account in determining the offense level for\r\nthe instant offense (e.g., where a defendant is prosecuted in both federal and state\r\n\r\ncourt for the same criminal conduct; or where a defendant is prosecuted in federal\r\nand state court for different criminal transactions that are part of the same course\r\nof conduct, such as two drug sales, but the conduct underlying both transactions\r\nis fully taken into account under §1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct) in determining the\r\noffense level for the instant offense).\r\n3. When a sentence is imposed pursuant to subsection (b), the court should adjust\r\nfor any term of imprisonment already served as a result of the conduct taken into\r\naccount in determining the instant sentence (e.g., if the appropriate total\r\npunishment determined under this subsection for all offenses is 30 months and\r\nthe defendant has already served 10 months of the prior undischarged term of\r\nimprisonment, the court should impose a sentence of 20 months concurrent with\r\nthe prior undischarged term).\r\n4. Where the defendant is serving an unexpired term of imprisonment in\r\ncircumstances other than those set forth in subsections (a) or (b), the court shall\r\nimpose a consecutive sentence to the extent necessary to fashion a sentence\r\nresulting in incremental punishment for the multiple offenses. To the extent\r\npracticable, the court shall impose a sentence for the instant offense that results\r\nin a combined sentence that approximates the total punishment that would have\r\nbeen imposed under §5G1.2 (Sentencing on Multiple Counts of Conviction) had\r\nall of the offenses been federal offenses for which sentences were being imposed\r\nat the same time. Where the defendant is serving a term of imprisonment for a\r\nstate offense, the information available may permit only a rough estimate of the\r\ntotal punishment that would have been imposed under the guidelines. It is not\r\nintended that the above methodology be applied in a manner that unduly\r\ncomplicates or prolongs the sentencing process. In fashioning an appropriate\r\nincremental punishment, the court should consider whether the offense was\r\ncommitted while the defendant was on bail or other release status from another\r\noffense. In such cases, a reasonable incremental penalty appropriately would\r\ninclude an additional enhancement equivalent to that provided in §2J1.7\r\n(Commission of Offense While on Release).\",\r\nand inserting in lieu thereof:\r\n\"2. Subsection (b) (which may apply only if subsection (a) does not apply), addresses\r\ncases in which the conduct resulting in the undischarged term of imprisonment\r\nhas been fully taken into account under §1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct) in\r\ndetermining the offense level for the instant offense. This can occur, for\r\nexample, where a defendant is prosecuted in both federal and state court, or in\r\ntwo or more federal jurisdictions, for the same criminal conduct or for different\r\ncriminal transactions that were part of the same course of conduct.\r\nWhen a sentence is imposed pursuant to subsection (b), the court should adjust\r\nfor any term of imprisonment already served as a result of the conduct taken into\r\naccount in determining the sentence for the instant offense. Example: The\r\ndefendant has been convicted of a federal offense charging the sale of 40 grams\r\nof cocaine. Under §1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct), the defendant is held accountable\r\nfor the sale of an additional 15 grams of cocaine that is part of the same course\r\nof conduct for which the defendant has been convicted and sentenced in state\r\ncourt (the defendant received a nine-month sentence of imprisonment, of which\r\nhe has served six months at the time of sentencing on the instant federal offense).\r\nThe guideline range applicable to the defendant is 10-16 months (Chapter Two\r\noffense level of 14 for sale of 55 grams of cocaine; 2-level reduction for\r\nAmendment 465 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003\r\n\r\nacceptance of responsibility; final offense level of 12; Criminal History Category\r\nI). The court determines that a sentence of 13 months provides the appropriate\r\ntotal punishment. Because the defendant has already served six months on the\r\nrelated state charge, a sentence of seven months, imposed to run concurrently\r\nwith the remainder of the defendant’s state sentence, achieves this result. For\r\nclarity, the court should note on the Judgment in a Criminal Case Order that the\r\nsentence imposed is not a departure from the guidelines because the defendant\r\nhas been credited for guideline purposes under §5G1.3(b) with six months served\r\nin state custody.\r\n3. Where the defendant is subject to an undischarged term of imprisonment in\r\ncircumstances other than those set forth in subsections (a) or (b), subsection (c)\r\napplies and the court shall impose a consecutive sentence to the extent necessary\r\nto fashion a sentence resulting in a reasonable incremental punishment for the\r\nmultiple offenses. In some circumstances, such incremental punishment can be\r\nachieved by the imposition of a sentence that is concurrent with the remainder of\r\nthe unexpired term of imprisonment. In such cases, a consecutive sentence is not\r\nrequired. To the extent practicable, the court should consider a reasonable\r\nincremental penalty to be a sentence for the instant offense that results in a\r\ncombined sentence of imprisonment that approximates the total punishment that\r\nwould have been imposed under §5G1.2 (Sentencing on Multiple Counts of\r\nConviction) had all of the offenses been federal offenses for which sentences\r\nwere being imposed at the same time. It is recognized that this determination\r\nfrequently will require an approximation. Where the defendant is serving a term\r\nof imprisonment for a state offense, the information available may permit only\r\na rough estimate of the total punishment that would have been imposed under the\r\nguidelines. Where the offense resulting in the undischarged term of\r\nimprisonment is a federal offense for which a guideline determination has\r\npreviously been made, the task will be somewhat more straightforward, although\r\neven in such cases a precise determination may not be possible.\r\nIt is not intended that the above methodology be applied in a manner that unduly\r\ncomplicates or prolongs the sentencing process. Additionally, this methodology\r\ndoes not, itself, require the court to depart from the guideline range established\r\nfor the instant federal offense. Rather, this methodology is meant to assist the\r\ncourt in determining the appropriate sentence (e.g., the appropriate point within\r\nthe applicable guideline range, whether to order the sentence to run concurrently\r\nor consecutively to the undischarged term of imprisonment, or whether a\r\ndeparture is warranted). Generally, the court may achieve an appropriate\r\nsentence through its determination of an appropriate point within the applicable\r\nguideline range for the instant federal offense, combined with its determination\r\nof whether that sentence will run concurrently or consecutively to the\r\nundischarged term of imprisonment.\r\nIllustrations of the Application of Subsection (c):\r\n(A) The guideline range applicable to the instant federal offense is 24-30\r\nmonths. The court determines that a total punishment of 36 months’\r\nimprisonment would appropriately reflect the instant federal offense and\r\nthe offense resulting in the undischarged term of imprisonment. The\r\nundischarged term of imprisonment is an indeterminate sentence of\r\nimprisonment with a 60-month maximum. At the time of sentencing on\r\nthe instant federal offense, the defendant has served ten months on the\r\nundischarged term of imprisonment. In this case, a sentence of 26\r\n\r\nmonths’ imprisonment to be served concurrently with the remainder of\r\nthe undischarged term of imprisonment would (1) be within the guideline\r\nrange for the instant federal offense, and (2) achieve an appropriate total\r\npunishment (36 months).\r\n(B) The applicable guideline range for the instant federal offense is 24-30\r\nmonths. The court determines that a total punishment of 36 months’\r\nimprisonment would appropriately reflect the instant federal offense and\r\nthe offense resulting in the undischarged term of imprisonment. The\r\nundischarged term of imprisonment is a six-month determinate sentence.\r\nAt the time of sentencing on the instant federal offense, the defendant has\r\nserved three months on the undischarged term of imprisonment. In this\r\ncase, a sentence of 30 months’ imprisonment to be served consecutively\r\nto the undischarged term of imprisonment would (1) be within the\r\nguideline range for the instant federal offense, and (2) achieve an\r\nappropriate total punishment (36 months).\r\n(C) The applicable guideline range for the instant federal offense is 24-30\r\nmonths. The court determines that a total punishment of 60 months’\r\nimprisonment would appropriately reflect the instant federal offense and\r\nthe offense resulting in the undischarged term of imprisonment. The\r\nundischarged term of imprisonment is a 12-month determinate sentence.\r\nIn this case, a sentence of 30 months’ imprisonment to be served\r\nconsecutively to the undischarged term of imprisonment would be the\r\ngreatest sentence imposable without departure for the instant federal\r\noffense.\r\n(D) The applicable guideline range for the instant federal offense is 24-30\r\nmonths. The court determines that a total punishment of 36 months’\r\nimprisonment would appropriately reflect the instant federal offense and\r\nthe offense resulting in the undischarged term of imprisonment. The\r\nundischarged term of imprisonment is an indeterminate sentence with a\r\n60-month maximum. At the time of sentencing on the instant federal\r\noffense, the defendant has served 22 months on the undischarged term of\r\nimprisonment. In this case, a sentence of 24 months to be served\r\nconcurrently with the remainder of the undischarged term of\r\nimprisonment would be the lowest sentence imposable without departure\r\nfor the instant federal offense.\".","Reason":"Reason for Amendment: This amendment deletes the prong of §5G1.3(b) pertaining to the\r\nsentencing of a defendant subject to an undischarged term of imprisonment previously imposed\r\npursuant to the Sentencing Reform Act because the Commission found a number of problems\r\nin implementation.

Under subsection (b)(1), the last date of the offense of conviction is the\r\ncontrolling date for ex post facto purposes. For example, if the offense of\r\nconviction (i.e., the conduct charged in the count of the indictment or information\r\nof which the defendant was convicted) was determined by the court to have been\r\ncommitted between October 15, 1991 and October 28, 1991, the date of October\r\n28, 1991 is the controlling date for ex post facto purposes. This is true even if the\r\ndefendant’s conduct relevant to the determination of the guideline range under\r\nAmendment 474 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003\r\n\r\n§1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct) included an act that occurred on November 2, 1991\r\n(after a revised Guideline Manual took effect).\";\r\nand in the caption by deleting \"Note\" and inserting in lieu thereof \"Notes\".\r\nThe Commentary to §1B1.11 captioned \"Background\" is amended by inserting the following\r\nadditional sentence as the first sentence of the first paragraph:\r\n\"Subsections (a) and (b)(1) provide that the court should apply the Guidelines Manual\r\nin effect on the date the defendant is sentenced unless the court determines that doing so\r\nwould violate the ex post facto clause in Article I, § 9 of the United States Constitution.\";\r\nand by inserting the following additional paragraphs at the end:\r\n\" Subsection (b)(2) provides that the Guidelines Manual in effect on a particular\r\ndate shall be applied in its entirety.\r\nSubsection (b)(3) provides that where the defendant is convicted of two offenses,\r\nthe first committed before, and the second after, a revised edition of the Guidelines\r\nManual became effective, the revised edition of the Guidelines Manual is to be applied\r\nto both offenses, even if the revised edition results in an increased penalty for the first\r\noffense. Because the defendant completed the second offense after the amendment to the\r\nguidelines took effect, the ex post facto clause does not prevent determining the sentence\r\nfor that count based on the amended guidelines. For example, if a defendant pleads\r\nguilty to a single count of embezzlement that occurred after the most recent edition of the\r\nGuidelines Manual became effective, the guideline range applicable in sentencing will\r\nencompass any relevant conduct (e.g., related embezzlement offenses that may have\r\noccurred prior to the effective date of the guideline amendments) for the offense of\r\nconviction. The same would be true for a defendant convicted of two counts of\r\nembezzlement, one committed before the amendments were enacted, and the second\r\nafter. In this example, the ex post facto clause would not bar application of the amended\r\nguideline to the first conviction; a contrary conclusion would mean that such defendant\r\nwas subject to a lower guideline range than if convicted only of the second offense.\r\nDecisions from several appellate courts addressing the analogous situation of the\r\nconstitutionality of counting pre-guidelines criminal activity as relevant conduct for a\r\nguidelines sentence support this approach. See United States v. Ykema, 887 F.2d 697\r\n(6th Cir. 1989) (upholding inclusion of pre-November 1, 1987, drug quantities as\r\nrelevant conduct for the count of conviction, noting that habitual offender statutes\r\nroutinely augment punishment for an offense of conviction based on acts committed\r\nbefore a law is passed), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 1062 (1990); United States v. Allen, 886\r\nF.2d 143 (8th Cir. 1989) (similar); see also United States v. Cusack, 901 F.2d 29 (4th Cir.\r\n1990) (similar).\r\nMoreover, the approach set forth in subsection (b)(3) should be followed\r\nregardless of whether the offenses of conviction are the type in which the conduct is\r\ngrouped under §3D1.2(d). The ex post facto clause does not distinguish between\r\ngroupable and nongroupable offenses, and unless that clause would be violated,\r\nCongress’ directive to apply the sentencing guidelines in effect at the time of sentencing\r\nmust be followed. Under the guideline sentencing system, a single sentencing range is\r\n\r\ndetermined based on the defendant’s overall conduct, even if there are multiple counts\r\nof conviction (see §§3D1.1-3D1.5, 5G1.2). Thus, if a defendant is sentenced in January\r\n1992 for a bank robbery committed in October 1988 and one committed in November\r\n1991, the November 1991 Guidelines Manual should be used to determine a combined\r\nguideline range for both counts. See generally United States v. Stephenson, 921 F.2d\r\n438 (2d Cir. 1990) (holding that the Sentencing Commission and Congress intended that\r\nthe applicable version of the guidelines be applied as a ‘cohesive and integrated whole’\r\nrather than in a piecemeal fashion).\r\nConsequently, even in a complex case involving multiple counts that occurred\r\nunder several different versions of the Guidelines Manual, it will not be necessary to\r\ncompare more than two manuals to determine the applicable guideline range -- the\r\nmanual in effect at the time the last offense of conviction was completed and the manual\r\nin effect at the time of sentencing.\".","Reason":"Reason for Amendment: This amendment expands §1B1.11 to address what has become a\r\nfrequently asked hotline question and troublesome application issue -- the application of\r\namended guidelines to multiple count cases in which the effective date of guideline revision(s)\r\noccurs between the offenses of conviction. The issue has also produced litigation before several\r\nappellate courts. See United States v. Castro, 972 F.2d 1107 (9th Cir. 1992), cert. denied, 113\r\nS. Ct. 1350 (1993); United States v.

The waste product is typically water or chemicals used to either\r\nremove impurities or form a precipitate (the precipitate, in some cases, being the controlled\r\nsubstance). Typically, a small amount of controlled substance remains in the waste water; often\r\nthis amount is too small to quantify and is listed as a trace amount (no weight given) in DEA\r\nreports. In these types of cases, the waste product is not consumable. The chemicals seized\r\nbefore the end of processing are also not usable in that form because further processing must\r\ntake place before they can be used. See, e.g., United States v.

When this is not the case, it\r\nis to be presumed that each 1/4 inch by 1/4 inch section of the blotter paper is\r\nequal to one dose.\r\nIn the case of liquid LSD (LSD that has not been placed onto a carrier medium),\r\nusing the weight of the LSD alone to calculate the offense level may not\r\nadequately reflect the seriousness of the offense. In such a case, an upward\r\ndeparture may be warranted.\".\r\nThe Commentary to §2D1.1 captioned \"Background\" is amended by inserting the following\r\nparagraphs at the end:\r\n\"Because the weights of LSD carrier media vary widely and typically far exceed\r\nthe weight of the controlled substance itself, the Commission has determined that basing\r\noffense levels on the entire weight of the LSD and carrier medium would produce\r\nunwarranted disparity among offenses involving the same quantity of actual LSD (but\r\n\r\ndifferent carrier weights), as well as sentences disproportionate to those for other, more\r\ndangerous controlled substances, such as PCP. Consequently, in cases involving LSD\r\ncontained in a carrier medium, the Commission has established a weight per dose of 0.4\r\nmilligram for purposes of determining the base offense level.\r\nThe dosage weight of LSD selected exceeds the Drug Enforcement\r\nAdministration’s standard dosage unit for LSD of 0.05 milligram (i.e., the quantity of\r\nactual LSD per dose) in order to assign some weight to the carrier medium. Because\r\nLSD typically is marketed and consumed orally on a carrier medium, the inclusion of\r\nsome weight attributable to the carrier medium recognizes (A) that offense levels for\r\nmost other controlled substances are based upon the weight of the mixture containing the\r\ncontrolled substance without regard to purity, and (B) the decision in Chapman v. United\r\nStates, 111 S. Ct. 1919 (1991) (holding that the term ‘mixture or substance’ in 21 U.S.C.\r\n§ 841(b)(1) includes the carrier medium in which LSD is absorbed). At the same time,\r\nthe weight per dose selected is less than the weight per dose that would equate the\r\noffense level for LSD on a carrier medium with that for the same number of doses of\r\nPCP, a controlled substance that comparative assessments indicate is more likely to\r\ninduce violent acts and ancillary crime than is LSD. (Treating LSD on a carrier medium\r\nas weighing 0.5 milligram per dose would produce offense levels equivalent to those for\r\nPCP.) Thus, the approach decided upon by the Commission will harmonize offense\r\nlevels for LSD offenses with those for other controlled substances and avoid an undue\r\ninfluence of varied carrier weight on the applicable offense level. Nonetheless, this\r\napproach does not override the applicability of ‘mixture or substance’ for the purpose of\r\napplying any mandatory minimum sentence (see Chapman; §5G1.1(b)).\".","Reason":"Reason for Amendment: The Commission has found that the weights of LSD carrier media\r\nvary widely and typically far exceed the weight of the controlled substance itself (e.g., LSD is\r\ntypically placed on blotter paper which generally weighs from 5 to 10 milligrams per dose; the\r\nweight of the LSD itself per dose is generally from 0.02 to 0.08 milligram; the Drug\r\nEnforcement Administration describes a standard dose of LSD as containing 0.05 milligram of\r\nLSD). As a result, basing the offense level on the entire weight of the LSD and carrier medium\r\nproduces unwarranted disparity among offenses involving the same quantity of actual LSD but\r\ndifferent carrier weights, as well as sentences that are disproportionate to those for other, more\r\ndangerous controlled substances, such as PCP, heroin, and cocaine. Under the guidelines prior\r\nto the amendment, for example, 100 grams of heroin or 500 grams of cocaine (weights that\r\ncorrespond to several thousand doses, the number depending upon the purity) result in the same\r\noffense level as 125 doses of LSD on blotter paper (which has an average weight of 8\r\nmilligrams per dose) or 1 dose of LSD on a sugar cube (2000 milligrams per dose).\r\nConsequently, in cases involving LSD contained in a carrier medium, this amendment\r\nestablishes a weight per dose of 0.4 milligram to be used for purposes of determining the base\r\noffense level. The dosage weight of LSD selected by the Commission exceeds the Drug\r\nEnforcement Administration’s standard dosage unit for LSD of 0.05 milligram (i.e., the quantity\r\nof actual LSD per dose) in order to assign some weight to the carrier medium.

Thus, the approach\r\ndecided upon by the Commission will harmonize offense levels for LSD offenses with those\r\nfor other controlled substances and avoid an undue influence of varied carrier weight on the\r\napplicable offense level.

Under Note (A) to subsection (c)(1), the tax loss is treated as\r\n$14,000 ($90,000 of actual gross income minus $40,000 of reported gross income =\r\n$50,000 x 28%) unless sufficient information is available to make a more accurate\r\nassessment of the tax loss.\r\nExample 2: A defendant files a tax return reporting income of $60,000 when his income\r\nwas actually $130,000. In addition, the defendant claims $10,000 in false tax credits.\r\nUnder Note (A) to subsection (c)(1), the tax loss is treated as $29,600 ($130,000 of actual\r\ngross income minus $60,000 of reported gross income = $70,000 x 28% = $19,600, plus\r\n$10,000 of false tax credits) unless sufficient information is available to make a more\r\naccurate assessment of the tax loss.\r\nExample 3: A defendant fails to file a tax return for a year in which his salary was\r\n$24,000, and $2,600 in income tax was withheld by his employer. Under the note to\r\nsubsection (c)(2), the tax loss is treated as $2,200 ($24,000 of gross income x 20% =\r\n$4,800, minus $2,600 of tax withheld) unless sufficient information is available to make\r\na more accurate assessment of the tax loss.\r\nIn determining the tax loss attributable to the offense, the court should use as many\r\nmethods set forth in subsection (c) and this commentary as are necessary given the\r\ncircumstances of the particular case. If none of the methods of determining the tax loss\r\nset forth fit the circumstances of the particular case, the court should use any method of\r\ndetermining the tax loss that appears appropriate to reasonably calculate the loss that\r\nwould have resulted had the offense been successfully completed.\".\r\nThe Commentary to §2T1.1 captioned \"Application Notes\" is amended in Note 3 (formerly\r\nNote 5) by deleting \"or local\" and inserting in lieu thereof \"local, or foreign\".\r\nThe Commentary to §2T1.1 captioned \"Application Notes\" is amended in Note 4 (formerly\r\nNote 6) by deleting \"§2T1.1(b)(2)\" and inserting in lieu thereof \"subsection (b)(2)\"; by inserting\r\na comma immediately following \"applied\"; and by inserting \"or fictitious entities\" immediately\r\nfollowing \"shells\".\r\nThe Commentary to §2T1.1 captioned \"Application Notes\" is amended by inserting the\r\nfollowing additional notes:\r\n\"5. A ‘credit claimed against tax’ is an item that reduces the amount of tax directly.\r\nIn contrast, a ‘deduction’ is an item that reduces the amount of taxable income.\r\n6. ‘Gross income,’ for the purposes of this section, has the same meaning as it has\r\nin 26 U.S.C. § 61 and 26 C.F.R. § 1.61.\r\n7. If the offense involves both individual and corporate tax returns, the tax loss is\r\nthe aggregate tax loss from the offenses taken together.\".\r\n\r\nThe Commentary to §2T1.1 captioned \"Background\" is amended by deleting:\r\n\" This guideline relies most heavily on the amount of tax evaded because the chief\r\ninterest protected by the statute is the collection of taxes. A greater evasion is obviously\r\nmore harmful to the treasury, and more serious than a smaller one with otherwise similar\r\ncharacteristics. Furthermore, as the potential benefit from tax evasion increases, the\r\nsanction necessary to deter also increases.\r\nThe overlapping imprisonment ranges in the Sentencing Table are intended to\r\nminimize the significance of disputes. The consequence of an inexact estimate of the tax\r\nloss is never severe, even when the tax loss is near the boundary of a range. For\r\nexample, although the difference between $39,999 and $40,001 results in a change from\r\nlevel 10 to level 11, any sentence of eight to twelve months would be within the\r\nguidelines regardless of the offense level determination made by the court. Indeed, any\r\nsentence between ten and twelve months would be within the guidelines for a tax loss\r\nranging from $20,000 to $150,000. As a consequence, for all dollar amounts, the\r\nSentencing Table affords the court considerable latitude in evaluating other factors, even\r\nwhen the amount of the tax loss is uncertain.\r\nUnder pre-guidelines practice, roughly half of all tax evaders were sentenced to\r\nprobation without imprisonment, while the other half received sentences that required\r\nthem to serve an average prison term of twelve months. This guideline is intended to\r\nreduce disparity in sentencing for tax evasion and to somewhat increase average sentence\r\nlength. As a result, the number of purely probationary sentences will be reduced. The\r\nCommission believes that any additional costs of imprisonment that may be incurred as\r\na result of the increase in the average term of imprisonment for tax evasion are\r\ninconsequential in relation to the potential increase in revenue. According to estimates\r\ncurrent at the time this guideline was originally developed (1987), income taxes are\r\nunderpaid by approximately $90 billion annually.\r\nAlthough under pre-guidelines practice some large-scale evaders served as much\r\nas five years in prison, the average sentence length for defendants sentenced to a term of\r\nimprisonment did not increase rapidly with the amount of tax evaded. Thus, the average\r\ntime served by those sentenced to a term of imprisonment for evading less than $10,000\r\nin taxes was about nine months, while the corresponding figure for those evading over\r\n$100,000 in taxes was about sixteen months. Guideline sentences should result in small\r\nincreases in the average length of imprisonment for most tax cases that involve less than\r\n$100,000 in tax evaded. The increase is expected to be somewhat larger for cases\r\ninvolving more taxes.\r\nFailure to report criminally derived income is included as a factor for deterrence\r\npurposes. Criminally derived income is generally difficult to establish, so that the tax\r\nloss in such cases will tend to be substantially understated. An enhancement for\r\noffenders who violate the tax laws as part of a pattern of criminal activity from which\r\nthey derive a substantial portion of their income also serves to implement the mandate\r\nof 28 U.S.C. § 994(i)(2). Estimates from pre-guidelines practice were that, on average,\r\nthe presence of this factor increased time served by the equivalent of 2 levels.\r\nAlthough tax evasion always involves some planning, unusually sophisticated\r\nAmendment 491 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003\r\n\r\nefforts to conceal the evasion decrease the likelihood of detection and therefore warrant\r\nan additional sanction for deterrence purposes. Analyses of pre-guidelines data for other\r\nfrauds and property crimes showed that careful planning or sophistication generally\r\nresulted in an average increase of at least 2 levels.\",\r\nand inserting in lieu thereof:\r\n\" This guideline relies most heavily on the amount of loss that was the object of the\r\noffense. Tax offenses, in and of themselves, are serious offenses; however, a greater tax\r\nloss is obviously more harmful to the treasury and more serious than a smaller one with\r\notherwise similar characteristics. Furthermore, as the potential benefit from the offense\r\nincreases, the sanction necessary to deter also increases.\r\nUnder pre-guidelines practice, roughly half of all tax evaders were sentenced to\r\nprobation without imprisonment, while the other half received sentences that required\r\nthem to serve an average prison term of twelve months.

As a result, the number of purely probationary sentences will be\r\nreduced. The Commission believes that any additional costs of imprisonment that may\r\nbe incurred as a result of the increase in the average term of imprisonment for tax\r\noffenses are inconsequential in relation to the potential increase in revenue. According\r\nto estimates current at the time this guideline was originally developed (1987), income\r\ntaxes are underpaid by approximately $90 billion annually. Guideline sentences should\r\nresult in small increases in the average length of imprisonment for most tax cases that\r\ninvolve less than $100,000 in tax loss. The increase is expected to be somewhat larger\r\nfor cases involving more taxes.\r\nFailure to report criminally derived income is included as a factor for deterrence\r\npurposes.

Willful Failure To File Return, Supply Information, or Pay Tax\r\n(a) Base Offense Level:\r\n(1) 1 level less than the level from §2T4.1 (Tax Table)\r\ncorresponding to the tax loss; or\r\n(2) 5, if there is no tax loss.\r\n\r\nFor purposes of this guideline, ‘tax loss’ means the total amount\r\nof tax that the taxpayer owed and did not pay, but, in the event\r\nof a failure to file in any year, not less than 10 percent of the\r\namount by which the taxpayer’s gross income for that year\r\nexceeded $20,000.\r\n(b) Specific Offense Characteristics\r\n(1) If the defendant failed to report or to correctly identify\r\nthe source of income exceeding $10,000 in any year from\r\ncriminal activity, increase by 2 levels. If the resulting\r\noffense level is less than level 12, increase to level 12.\r\n(2) If sophisticated means were used to impede discovery of\r\nthe nature or extent of the offense, increase by 2 levels.\r\n(c) Cross Reference\r\n(1) If the defendant is convicted of a willful violation of\r\n26 U.S.C. § 6050I, apply §2S1.3 (Failure to Report\r\nMonetary Transactions) in lieu of this guideline.\r\nCommentary\r\nStatutory Provision: 26 U.S.C. § 7203 (other than a willful violation of 26 U.S.C.\r\n§ 6050I).\r\nApplication Notes:\r\n1. ‘Criminal activity’ means any conduct constituting a criminal offense under\r\nfederal, state, or local law.\r\n2. ‘Sophisticated means,’ as used in §2T1.2(b)(2), includes conduct that is more\r\ncomplex or demonstrates greater intricacy or planning than a routine tax-evasion\r\ncase. An enhancement would be applied, for example, where the defendant used\r\noffshore bank accounts or transactions through corporate shells.\r\n3. In determining the total tax loss attributable to the offense (see §1B1.3(a)(2)), all\r\nconduct violating the tax laws should be considered as part of the same course of\r\nconduct or common scheme or plan unless the evidence demonstrates that the\r\nconduct is clearly unrelated. See Application Note 3 of the Commentary to\r\n§2T1.1.\r\nBackground: Violations of 26 U.S.C. § 7203 are usually serious misdemeanors that are\r\nsimilar to tax evasion, except that there need be no affirmative act in support of the\r\noffense. They are rarely prosecuted unless the defendant also owed taxes that he failed\r\nto pay.\r\nBecause the conduct generally is tantamount to tax evasion, the guideline is\r\nAmendment 491 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003\r\n\r\nsimilar to §2T1.1. Because the offense is a misdemeanor, the offense level has been set\r\nat one below the level corresponding to evasion of the same amount of taxes.\r\nAn alternative measure of the tax loss, 10 percent of gross income in excess of\r\n$20,000, has been provided because of the potential difficulty of determining the amount\r\nof tax the taxpayer owed. It is expected that this alternative measure generally will\r\nunderstate the amount of tax owed.\r\nThe intended impact of this guideline is to increase the average time served for\r\nthis offense, and to increase significantly the number of violators who receive a term of\r\nimprisonment. Under pre-guidelines practice, the average time served for this offense\r\nwas approximately 2.5 months, including those who were not sentenced to prison.\r\nConsidering only those who did serve a term of imprisonment, the average term was\r\nabout six to seven months.\r\n§2T1.3. Fraud and False Statements Under Penalty of Perjury\r\n(a) Base Offense Level:\r\n(1) Level from §2T4.1 (Tax Table) corresponding to the tax\r\nloss, if the offense was committed in order to facilitate\r\nevasion of a tax; or\r\n(2) 6, otherwise.\r\nFor purposes of this guideline, the ‘tax loss’ is 28 percent of the\r\namount by which the greater of gross income and taxable income\r\nwas understated, plus 100 percent of the total amount of any false\r\ncredits claimed against tax. If the taxpayer is a corporation, use\r\n34 percent in lieu of 28 percent.\r\n(b) Specific Offense Characteristics\r\n(1) If the defendant failed to report or to correctly identify\r\nthe source of income exceeding $10,000 in any year from\r\ncriminal activity, increase by 2 levels. If the resulting\r\noffense level is less than level 12, increase to level 12.\r\n(2) If sophisticated means were used to impede discovery of\r\nthe nature or extent of the offense, increase by 2 levels.\r\nCommentary\r\nStatutory Provision: 26 U.S.C. § 7206, except § 7206(2). For additional statutory\r\nprovision(s), see Appendix A (Statutory Index).\r\nApplication Notes:\r\n1. ‘Criminal activity’ means any conduct constituting a criminal offense under\r\n\r\nfederal, state, or local law.\r\n2. ‘Sophisticated means,’ as used in §2T1.3(b)(2), includes conduct that is more\r\ncomplex or demonstrates greater intricacy or planning than a routine tax-evasion\r\ncase. An enhancement would be applied, for example, where the defendant used\r\noffshore bank accounts or transactions through corporate shells.\r\n3.

See Application Note 3 of the Commentary to\r\n§2T1.1.\r\n4. The amount by which the greater of gross income and taxable income was\r\nunderstated, plus 100 percent of the total amount of any false credits claimed\r\nagainst tax is calculated as follows: (1) determine the amount, if any, by which\r\nthe gross income was understated; (2) determine the amount, if any, by which the\r\ntaxable income was understated; and (3) determine the amount of any false\r\ncredit(s) claimed (a tax ‘credit’ is an item that reduces the amount of tax directly;\r\nin contrast, a ‘deduction’ is an item that reduces the amount of taxable income).\r\nUse the amount determined under step (1) or (2), whichever is greater, plus any\r\namount determined under step (3).\r\nBackground: This guideline covers conduct that usually is analogous to tax evasion,\r\nalthough the elements differ. Accordingly, the offense is treated much like tax evasion.\r\nExistence of a tax loss is not an element of these offenses. Furthermore, in\r\ninstances where the defendant is setting the groundwork for evasion of a tax that is\r\nexpected to become due in the future, he may make false statements that underreport\r\nincome that as of the time of conviction may not yet have resulted in a tax loss. In order\r\nto gauge the seriousness of these offenses, the guidelines establish a rule for determining\r\na ‘tax loss’ based on the nature and magnitude of the false statements made. Use of this\r\napproach also avoids complex problems of proof and invasion of privacy when returns\r\nof persons other than the defendant and co-defendants are involved.\".\r\nSection 2T1.4(a)(1) is amended by deleting \"resulting tax loss, if any\" and inserting in lieu\r\nthereof \"tax loss\".\r\nSection 2T1.4(a)(2) is amended by deleting \"otherwise\" and inserting in lieu thereof \"if there\r\nis no tax loss\".\r\nSection 2T1.4(a) is amended by deleting \"§2T1.3\" and inserting in lieu thereof \"§2T1.1\".\r\nSection 2T1.4(b)(1) is amended by inserting \"(A)\" immediately following \"If\"; and by inserting\r\n\"; or (B) the defendant was in the business of preparing or assisting in the preparation of tax\r\nreturns\" immediately before \", increase\".\r\nSection 2T1.4(b)(2) is amended by deleting \"nature\" and inserting in lieu thereof \"existence\".\r\nAmendment 491 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003\r\n\r\nSection 2T1.4(b) is amended by deleting:\r\n\"(3) If the defendant was in the business of preparing or assisting in the preparation\r\nof tax returns, increase by 2 levels.\".\r\nThe Commentary to §2T1.4 captioned \"Statutory Provision\" is amended by inserting \"(other\r\nthan a violation based upon 26 U.S.C. § 6050I)\" immediately following \"§ 7206(2)\".\r\nThe Commentary to §2T1.4 captioned \"Application Notes\" is amended by deleting Notes 1, 3,\r\nand 4 as follows:\r\n\"1.

In certain instances, such as promotion of a tax shelter scheme, the defendant may\r\nadvise other persons to violate their tax obligations through filing returns that\r\nfind no support in the tax laws. If this type of conduct can be shown to have\r\nresulted in the filing of false returns (regardless of whether the principals were\r\naware of their falsity), the misstatements in all such returns will contribute to one\r\naggregate ‘tax loss.’\";\r\nby renumbering Note 2 as Note 3; and by inserting the following as Notes 1 and 2:\r\n\"1. For the general principles underlying the determination of tax loss, see §2T1.1(c)\r\nand Application Note 1 of the Commentary to §2T1.1 (Tax Evasion; Willful\r\nFailure to File Return, Supply Information, or Pay Tax; Fraudulent or False\r\nReturns, Statements, or Other Documents). In certain instances, such as\r\npromotion of a tax shelter scheme, the defendant may advise other persons to\r\nviolate their tax obligations through filing returns that find no support in the tax\r\nlaws.

The position of trust must have contributed in some substantial way to facilitating\r\nthe crime and not merely have provided an opportunity that could as easily have\r\nbeen afforded to other persons. This adjustment, for example, would not apply\r\nto an embezzlement by an ordinary bank teller.\",\r\nand inserting in lieu thereof:\r\n\"1. ‘Public or private trust’ refers to a position of public or private trust characterized\r\nby professional or managerial discretion (i.e., substantial discretionary judgment\r\nthat is ordinarily given considerable deference). Persons holding such positions\r\nordinarily are subject to significantly less supervision than employees whose\r\nresponsibilities are primarily non-discretionary in nature. For this enhancement\r\nto apply, the position of trust must have contributed in some significant way to\r\nfacilitating the commission or concealment of the offense (e.g., by making the\r\ndetection of the offense or the defendant’s responsibility for the offense more\r\ndifficult). This adjustment, for example, would apply in the case of an\r\nembezzlement of a client’s funds by an attorney serving as a guardian, a bank\r\nexecutive’s fraudulent loan scheme, or the criminal sexual abuse of a patient by\r\na physician under the guise of an examination. This adjustment would not apply\r\nin the case of an embezzlement or theft by an ordinary bank teller or hotel clerk\r\nbecause such positions are not characterized by the above-described factors.\r\nNotwithstanding the preceding paragraph, because of the special nature of the\r\nUnited States mail an adjustment for an abuse of a position of trust will apply to\r\nany employee of the U.S. Postal Service who engages in the theft or destruction\r\nof undelivered United States mail.\".","Reason":"Reason for Amendment: This amendment reformulates the definition of an abuse of position\r\nof trust to better distinguish cases warranting this enhancement.","EffectiveDate":"Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1993."},{"Id":491,"Title":"Amendment 491","Text":"The Commentary to §4A1.2 captioned \"Application Notes\" is amended in Note\r\n1 by inserting the following additional sentence at the end of the first paragraph:\r\n\"Conduct that is part of the instant offense means conduct that is relevant conduct to the\r\ninstant offense under the provisions of §1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct).\".\r\nThe Commentary to §4A1.2 captioned \"Application Notes\" is amended in Note 6 in the first\r\nsentence of the first paragraph by inserting \"(A)\" immediately before \"have been reversed\"; by\r\ndeleting the comma following \"law\"; and by inserting \"or (B) have been ruled constitutionally\r\ninvalid in a prior case\" immediately before \"are not to be counted\";\r\nThe Commentary to §4A1.2 captioned \"Application Notes\" is amended in Note 6 by deleting\r\nthe second sentence as follows:\r\n\"Also, sentences resulting from convictions that a defendant shows to have been\r\npreviously ruled constitutionally invalid are not to be counted.\",\r\nand inserting in lieu thereof:\r\n\"With respect to the current sentencing proceeding, this guideline and commentary do\r\nnot confer upon the defendant any right to attack collaterally a prior conviction or\r\nsentence beyond any such rights otherwise recognized in law (e.g., 21 U.S.C. § 851\r\nexpressly provides that a defendant may collaterally attack certain prior convictions).\";\r\nand by beginning a new paragraph with the third sentence.\r\nThe Commentary to §4A1.2 captioned \"Background\" is amended by deleting the second\r\nparagraph as follows:\r\n\"The Commission leaves for court determination the issue of whether a defendant may\r\ncollaterally attack at sentencing a prior conviction.\".","Reason":"Reason for Amendment: This amendment expressly provides that the term \"part of the instant\r\noffense\" in §4A1.2(a)(1) means relevant conduct as defined in §1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct) to\r\navoid double counting and ensure consistency with other guideline provisions.\r\nThis amendment also clarifies the Commission’s intent with respect to whether §4A1.2 confers\r\non defendants a right to attack prior convictions collaterally at sentencing, an issue on which\r\nthe appellate courts have differed.

For purposes of the guidelines, a ‘plant’ is an organism having leaves and a\r\nreadily observable root formation (e.g., a marihuana cutting having roots, a\r\nrootball, or root hairs is a marihuana plant).\".","Reason":"Reason for Amendment: This is an eight-part amendment. First, this amendment adds\r\ndefinitions of hashish and hashish oil to §2D1.1 (Unlawful Manufacturing, Importing,\r\nExporting, or Trafficking; Attempt or Conspiracy) in the notes following the Drug Quantity\r\nTable. These terms are not defined by statute or in the existing guidelines, leading to litigation\r\nas to which substances are to be classified as hashish or hashish oil, as opposed to marihuana.\r\nSee United States v. Gravelle, 819 F. Supp. 1076 (S.D. Fla. 1993); United States v. Schultz,\r\n810 F. Supp. 230 (S.D. Ohio 1992).\r\nSecond, this amendment clarifies the treatment of marihuana that has a moisture content\r\nsufficient to render it unusable without drying (e.g., a bale of marihuana left in the rain or\r\nrecently harvested marihuana that has not had time to dry). In such cases, using the weight of\r\nthe wet marihuana can increase the offense level for a factor that bears no relationship to the\r\nscale of the offense or the marketable form of the marihuana. Prior to the effective date of the\r\n1993 amendments, two circuits had approved weighing wet marihuana despite the fact that the\r\nmarihuana was not in a usable form. United States v. Pinedo-Montoya, 966 F.2d 591 (10th Cir.\r\n1992); United States v. Garcia, 925 F.2d 170 (7th Cir. 1991). Although Application Note 1 in\r\nthe Commentary to §2D1.1, effective November 1, 1993 (pertaining to unusable parts of a\r\nmixture or substance) should produce the appropriate result because marihuana must be dried\r\nbefore being used, this type of case is sufficiently distinct to warrant a specific reference in this\r\napplication note to ensure correct application of the guideline.\r\nThird, this amendment simplifies the Commentary to §2D1.1 by consolidating application notes\r\n8 and 13.\r\nFourth, this amendment deletes an outdated application note in the Commentary to §2D1.1\r\npertaining to the classification of d-lysergic acid as a listed precursor chemical.\r\nFifth, this amendment addresses the issue of what constitutes a marihuana plant. Several\r\ncircuits have confronted the issue of when a cutting from a marihuana plant becomes a \"plant.\"\r\n\r\nThe appellate courts generally have held that the term \"plant\" should be defined by \"its plain\r\nand ordinary dictionary meaning. . . . [A] marihuana ‘plant’ includes those cuttings\r\naccompanied by root balls.\" United States v. Edge, 989 F.2d 871, 878 (6th Cir. 1993) (quoting\r\nUnited States v. Eves, 932 F.2d 856, 860 (10th Cir. 1991), appeal after remand, 30 F.3d 134\r\n(6th Cir. 1994)). See also United States v. Malbrough, 922 F.2d 458, 465 (8th Cir. 1990)\r\n(acquiescing in the district court’s apparent determination that certain marihuana cuttings that\r\ndid not have their own \"root system\" should not be counted as plants), cert. denied, 501 S. Ct.\r\n1258 (1991); United States v. Carlisle, 907 F.2d 94, 96 (9th Cir. 1990) (finding that cuttings\r\nwere plants where each cutting had previous degrees of root formation not clearly erroneous);\r\nUnited States v. Angell, 794 F. Supp. 874, 875 (D. Minn. 1990) (refusing to count as plants\r\nmarihuana cuttings that have no visible root structure), aff’d in part and rev’d in part, 11 F.3d\r\n806 (8th Cir.), cert. denied, 114 S. Ct. 3747 (1994); United States v. Fitol, 733 F. Supp. 1312,\r\n1316 (D. Minn. 1990) (\"individual cuttings, planted with the intent of growing full size plants,\r\nand which had grown roots, are ‘plants’ both within common parlance and within Section\r\n841(b)\"); United States v. Speltz, 733 F. Supp. 1311, 1312 (D. Minn. 1990) (small marihuana\r\nplants, e.g., cuttings with roots, are nonetheless still marihuana plants), aff’d, 938 F.2d 188 (8th\r\nCir. 1991). Because this issue arises frequently, this amendment adds an application note to\r\nthe Commentary of §2D1.1 setting forth the definition of a plant for guidelines purposes.\r\nSixth, this amendment provides equivalencies for two additional controlled substances: (1)\r\nkhat, and (2) levo-alpha-acetylmethadol (LAAM) in the Drug Equivalency Tables in the\r\nCommentary to §2D1.1.\r\nSeventh, this amendment deletes the distinction between d- and l-methamphetamine in the\r\nDrug Equivalency Tables in the Commentary to §2D1.1. L-methamphetamine, which is a rather\r\nweak form of methamphetamine, is rarely seen and is not made intentionally, but rather results\r\nfrom a botched attempt to produce d-methamphetamine. Under this amendment,\r\nl-methamphetamine would be treated the same as d-methamphetamine (i.e., as if an attempt to\r\nmanufacture or distribute d-methamphetamine). Currently, unless the methamphetamine is\r\nspecifically tested to determine its form, litigation can result over whether the\r\nmethamphetamine is l- methamphetamine or d-methamphetamine. In addition, there is another\r\nform of methamphetamine (dl-methamphetamine) that is not listed in the Drug Equivalency\r\nTable. The listing of l-methamphetamine as a separate form of methamphetamine has led to\r\nlitigation as to how dl-methamphetamine should be treated. In United States v. Carroll, 6 F.3d\r\n735 (11th Cir. 1993), cert. denied, 114 S. Ct. 1234 (1994), a case in which the Eleventh Circuit\r\nheld that dl-methamphetamine should be treated as d-methamphetamine, the majority and\r\ndissenting opinions both point out the complexity engendered by the current distinction\r\nbetween d- and l- methamphetamine. Under this amendment, all forms of methamphetamine\r\nare treated alike, thereby simplifying guideline application.\r\nEighth, this amendment revises the Commentary to §2D1.1 to provide that in a case involving\r\nnegotiation for a quantity of a controlled substance, the negotiated quantity is used to determine\r\nthe offense level unless the completed transaction establishes a different quantity, or the\r\ndefendant establishes that he or she was not reasonably capable of producing the negotiated\r\namount or otherwise did not intend to produce that amount. Disputes over the interpretation\r\nof this application note have produced much litigation. See, e.g., United States v. Tillman,8\r\nF.3d 17 (11th Cir. 1993); United States v. Smiley, 997 F.2d 475 (8th Cir. 1993); United States\r\nv. Barnes, 993 F.2d 680 (9th Cir. 1993), cert. denied, 115 S. Ct. 96 (1994); United States v.\r\nAmendment 519 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003\r\n\r\nRodriguez, 975 F.2d 999 (3d Cir. 1992); United States v.

For example, in the case of an offense involving 300 grams of\r\npiperidine and 800 grams of benzyl cyanide, the piperidine is converted to 600\r\ngrams of ephedrine and the benzyl cyanide is converted to 800 grams of\r\nephedrine, using the Precursor Chemical Equivalency Table, for a total of 1400\r\ngrams of ephedrine.

When two or more list I chemicals are used together in the same manufacturing\r\n\r\nprocess, calculate the offense level for each separately and use the quantity that\r\nresults in the greatest base offense level. In any other case, the quantities should\r\nbe added together (using the List I Chemical Equivalency Table) for the purpose\r\nof calculating the base offense level.\r\nExamples:\r\n(a) The defendant was in possession of five kilograms of ephedrine and three\r\nkilograms of hydriodic acid. Ephedrine and hydriodic acid typically are\r\nused together in the same manufacturing process to manufacture\r\nmethamphetamine. Therefore, the base offense level for each listed\r\nchemical is calculated separately and the list I chemical with the higher\r\nbase offense level is used. Five kilograms of ephedrine result in a base\r\noffense level of 24; 300 grams of hydriodic acid result in a base offense\r\nlevel of 14. In this case, the base offense level would be 24.\r\n(b) The defendant was in possession of five kilograms of ephedrine and two\r\nkilograms of phenylacetic acid. Although both of these chemicals are\r\nused to manufacture methamphetamine, they are not used together in the\r\nsame manufacturing process. Therefore, the quantity of phenylacetic acid\r\nshould be converted to an ephedrine equivalency using the List I\r\nChemical Equivalency Table and then added to the quantity of ephedrine.\r\nIn this case, the two kilograms of phenylacetic acid convert to two\r\nkilograms of ephedrine (see List I Chemical Equivalency Table),\r\nresulting in a total equivalency of seven kilograms of ephedrine.\".\r\nThe Commentary to §2D1.11 is amended by deleting \"listed precursor\" wherever it appears and\r\ninserting in lieu thereof \"list I\"; and by deleting \"listed essential\" and inserting in lieu thereof\r\nin each instance \"list II\".\r\nThe Commentary to §2D1.11 captioned \"Background\" is amended in the second sentence by\r\ndeleting \"Listed precursor chemicals are critical to the formation of a controlled substance and\"\r\nand inserting in lieu thereof \"List I chemicals are important to the manufacture of a controlled\r\nsubstance and usually\".\r\nThe Commentary to §2D1.11 captioned \"Background\" is amended by deleting the last sentence\r\nas follows:\r\n\"Listed essential chemicals are generally solvents, catalysts, and reagents, and do not\r\nbecome part of the finished product.\",\r\nand inserting in lieu thereof:\r\n\"List II chemicals are generally used as solvents, catalysts, and reagents.\".","Reason":"Reason for Amendment: The Domestic Chemical Diversion Act of 1993, Pub.

This amendment conforms §2D1.11 (Unlawfully Distributing, Importing,\r\nExporting or Possessing a Listed Chemical; Attempt or Conspiracy) to these statutory changes.\r\nThe Act also adds pills containing ephedrine as a list I chemical. Ephedrine itself is a list I\r\nchemical under 21 U.S.C. § 802(34). Pills containing ephedrine previously were not covered\r\nby the statute and, thus, legally could be purchased \"over the counter.\" Purchases of these pills\r\nwere sometimes made in large quantities and the pills crushed and processed to extract the\r\nephedrine (which can be used to make methamphetamine). Unlike ephedrine, which is\r\npurchased from a chemical company and is virtually 100 percent pure, these tablets contain a\r\nsubstantially lower percentage of ephedrine (about 25 percent). To avoid unwarranted\r\ndisparity, this amendment adds a note to §2D1.11 providing that the amount of actual ephedrine\r\ncontained in a pill is to be used in determining the offense level.\r\nIn addition, the Act removes three chemicals from, and adds two others to, the listed chemicals\r\ncontrolled under the Controlled Substances Act. Two of the chemicals removed from the list\r\nare not currently listed in §2D1.11 because the Commission was aware that they are not used\r\nin the manufacture of any controlled substance. The third chemical removed from the list, d-\r\nlysergic acid, was listed both as a listed chemical in §2D1.11 and as a controlled substance in\r\n§2D1.1 (Unlawful Manufacturing, Importing, Exporting, or Trafficking; Attempt or\r\nConspiracy). This amendment conforms §2D1.11 by deleting all references to d-lysergic acid.\r\nThe two chemicals added as listed chemicals are benzaldehyde and nitroethane. Both of these\r\nchemicals are used to make methamphetamine. The base offense levels for listed chemicals\r\nin §2D1.11 are determined by reference to the most common controlled substance the chemical\r\nis used to manufacture; consequently, this amendment adds these chemicals to the Chemical\r\nQuantity Table based on information provided by the Drug Enforcement Administration\r\nregarding their use in the production of methamphetamine.\r\nA number of the chemicals in the Chemical Quantity Table in §2D1.11 are used in the same\r\nprocess to make a controlled substance. A note at the end of the existing Precursor Chemical\r\nEquivalency Table addresses this situation for hydriodic acid and ephedrine. This amendment\r\nexpands this note to cover other chemicals that similarly are used together.\r\nIn addition, this amendment corrects Application Note 3 of the Commentary to §2D1.11 with\r\nrespect to an example of a listed chemical that is used with P2P to manufacture\r\nmethamphetamine and a reference to a subdivision of the Drug Equivalency Tables in the\r\nCommentary to §2D1.1.","EffectiveDate":"Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1995."},{"Id":517,"Title":"Amendment 517","Text":"Section 2D1.12(a) is amended by inserting \"(Apply the greater)\" immediately\r\nafter \"Base Offense Level\"; and by deleting \"12\" and inserting in lieu thereof:\r\n\"(1) 12, if the defendant intended to manufacture a controlled substance or knew or\r\nbelieved the prohibited equipment was to be used to manufacture a controlled\r\nsubstance; or\r\n(2) 9, if the defendant had reasonable cause to believe the prohibited equipment was\r\nto be used to manufacture a controlled substance.\".","Reason":"Reason for Amendment: The Domestic Chemical Diversion Act of 1993, Pub.

For example, in the case of a conspiracy\r\nto interfere with a person’s civil rights (a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 241) that\r\ninvolved an aggravated assault (the use of force) to deny certain rights or benefits\r\nin furtherance of discrimination (a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 245), the underlying\r\noffense in respect to both the violation of 18 U.S.C. § 241 (to which §2H1.1\r\napplies) and the violation of 18 U.S.C. § 245 (to which §2H1.3 applies) would\r\nbe the aggravated assault.\r\n‘2 plus the offense level applicable to any underlying offense’ means 2 levels\r\nabove the offense level (base offense level plus any applicable specific offense\r\ncharacteristics and cross references) from the offense guideline in Chapter Two\r\nthat most closely corresponds to the underlying offense. For example, if the\r\nunderlying offense was second degree murder, which under §2A1.2 has an\r\noffense level of 33, ‘2 plus the offense level applicable to any underlying\r\noffense’ would be 33 + 2 = 35. If the underlying offense was assault, criminal\r\nsexual conduct, kidnapping, abduction or unlawful restraint, the offense level\r\nfrom the guideline for the most comparable offense in §§2A2.1-2A4.2 (Assault,\r\nCriminal Sexual Abuse, and Kidnapping, Abduction, or Unlawful Restraint)\r\nwould first be determined, and 2 levels then would be added. If the underlying\r\noffense was damage to property by means of arson or an explosive device, the\r\noffense level from §2K1.4 (Arson; Property Damage By Use of Explosives)\r\nwould first be determined and 2 levels would be added. If the offense was\r\nproperty damage by other means, the offense level from §2B1.3 (Property\r\nDamage or Destruction) would first be determined and 2 levels would be added.\r\nIf the offense was a conspiracy or attempt to commit arson, ‘2 plus the offense\r\nlevel applicable to any underlying offense’ would be the offense level from the\r\nguideline applicable to a conspiracy or attempt to commit arson plus 2 levels.\r\nIn certain cases, the count of which the defendant is convicted may set forth\r\nconduct that constitutes more than one underlying offense (e.g., two instances of\r\nassault, or one instance of assault and one instance of arson). In such cases,\r\ndetermine the offense level for the underlying offense by treating each\r\nunderlying offense as if contained in a separate count of conviction. To\r\ndetermine which of the alternative base offense levels (e.g., §2H1.1(a)(1) or\r\n(a)(2)) results in the greater offense level, apply Chapter Three, Parts A, B, C,\r\nand D to each alternative base offense level. Use whichever results in the greater\r\noffense level. Example: The defendant is convicted of one count of conspiracy\r\nto violate civil rights that included two level 12 underlying offenses (of a type\r\nnot grouped together under Chapter Three, Part D). No adjustment from Chapter\r\nThree, Parts A, B, or C applies. The base offense level from §2H1.1(a)(1) is 15.\r\nThe offense level for each underlying offense from §2H1.1(a)(2) is 14 (2 + 12).\r\nUnder Chapter Three, Part D (Multiple Counts), the two level 14 underlying\r\n\r\noffenses result in a combined offense level of 16. This offense level is greater\r\nthan the alternative base offense level of 15 under §2H1.1(a)(1). Therefore, the\r\ncase is treated as if there were two counts, one for each underlying offense, with\r\na base offense level under §2H1.1(a)(2) of 14 for each underlying offense.\r\n2. Where the adjustment in §2H1.1(b)(1) is applied, do not apply §3B1.3 (Abuse\r\nof Position of Trust or Use of Special Skill).\r\nBackground: This section applies to intimidating activity by various groups, including\r\nformally and informally organized groups as well as hate groups. The maximum term\r\nof imprisonment authorized by statute is ten years; except where death results, the\r\nmaximum term of imprisonment authorized by statute is life imprisonment. The base\r\noffense level for this guideline assumes threatening or otherwise serious conduct.\r\n§2H1.3.

In the case of a violation of 42 U.S.C. § 3631, apply this guideline where the\r\noffense involved the threat or use of force. Otherwise, apply §2H1.5.\r\nBackground: The statutes covered by this guideline provide federal protection for the\r\nexercise of civil rights in a variety of contexts (e.g., voting, employment, public\r\naccommodations, etc.). The base offense level in §2H1.3(a) reflects that the threat or use\r\nof force is inherent in the offense. The maximum term of imprisonment authorized by\r\nstatute is one year if no bodily injury results, ten years if bodily injury results, and life\r\nimprisonment if death results.\r\n§2H1.4.

See the discussion\r\nin the Commentary to §2H1.1.\r\n2. Do not apply the adjustment from §3B1.3 (Abuse of Position of Trust or Use of\r\nSpecial Skill).\r\nBackground: This maximum term of imprisonment authorized by 18 U.S.C. § 242 is one\r\nyear if no bodily injury results, ten years if bodily injury results, and life imprisonment\r\nif death results. A base offense level of 10 is prescribed at §2H1.4(a)(1) providing a\r\nguideline sentence near the one-year statutory maximum for cases not resulting in death\r\nor bodily injury because of the compelling public interest in deterring and adequately\r\npunishing those who violate civil rights under color of law. The Commission intends to\r\nrecommend that this one-year statutory maximum penalty be increased. An alternative\r\nbase offense level is provided at §2H1.4(a)(2). The 6-level increase under subsection\r\n(a)(2) reflects the 2-level increase that is applied to other offenses covered in this Part\r\nplus a 4-level increase for the commission of the offense under actual or purported legal\r\nauthority. This 4-level increase is inherent in the base offense level of 10 under\r\nsubsection (a)(1).\r\nEnhancement under §3B1.3 (Abuse of Position of Trust or Use of Special Skill) is\r\ninappropriate because the base offense level in §2H1.4(a) reflects that the abuse of actual\r\nor purported legal authority is inherent in the offense.\r\n\r\n§2H1.5. Other Deprivations of Rights or Benefits in Furtherance of\r\nDiscrimination\r\n(a) Base Offense Level (Apply the greater):\r\n(1) 6; or\r\n(2) 2 plus the offense level applicable to any underlying\r\noffense.\r\n(b) Specific Offense Characteristic\r\n(1) If the defendant was a public official at the time of the\r\noffense, increase by 4 levels.\r\nCommentary\r\nStatutory Provision: 18 U.S.C. § 246.\r\nApplication Notes:\r\n1. ‘2 plus the offense level applicable to any underlying offense’ is defined in the\r\nCommentary to §2H1.1.\r\n2. Where the adjustment in §2H1.5(b)(1) is applied, do not apply §3B1.3 (Abuse\r\nof Position of Trust or Use of Special Skill).\r\nBackground: Violations of the statutes covered by this provision do not necessarily\r\ninvolve the use of force or threatening conduct or violations by public officials.\r\nAccordingly, the minimum base offense level (level 6) provided is lower than that of the\r\nother guidelines in this subpart.\".\r\nA replacement guideline with accompanying commentary is inserted as §2H1.1 (Offenses\r\nInvolving Individual Rights).\r\nSection 3A1.1 (Vulnerable Victim) is deleted in its entirety as follows:\r\n\"§3A1.1. Vulnerable Victim\r\nIf the defendant knew or should have known that a victim of the offense\r\nwas unusually vulnerable due to age, physical or mental condition, or that\r\na victim was otherwise particularly susceptible to the criminal conduct,\r\nincrease by 2 levels.\r\nCommentary\r\nApplication Notes:\r\nAmendment 521 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003\r\n\r\n1. This adjustment applies to offenses where an unusually vulnerable victim is\r\nmade a target of criminal activity by the defendant. The adjustment would apply,\r\nfor example, in a fraud case where the defendant marketed an ineffective cancer\r\ncure or in a robbery where the defendant selected a handicapped victim. But it\r\nwould not apply in a case where the defendant sold fraudulent securities by mail\r\nto the general public and one of the victims happened to be senile. Similarly, for\r\nexample, a bank teller is not an unusually vulnerable victim solely by virtue of\r\nthe teller’s position in a bank.\r\n2. Do not apply this adjustment if the offense guideline specifically incorporates\r\nthis factor. For example, where the offense guideline provides an enhancement\r\nfor the age of the victim, this guideline should not be applied unless the victim\r\nwas unusually vulnerable for reasons unrelated to age.\".\r\nA replacement guideline with accompanying commentary is inserted as §3A1.1 (Hate Crime\r\nMotivation or Vulnerable Victim).\r\nThe Commentary to §2H4.1 captioned \"Application Note\" is amended in Note 1 by deleting\r\n\"2 plus the offense\" and inserting in lieu thereof \"Offense\".","Reason":"Reason for Amendment: This is a five-part amendment. First, the amendment adds an\r\nadditional subsection to §3A1.1 (Vulnerable Victim) to implement the directive contained in\r\nSection 280003 of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 by providing\r\na three-level increase in the offense level for offenses that are \"hate crimes.\" Second, the\r\namendment consolidates §§2H1.1 (Offenses Involving Individual Rights), 2H1.3 (Use of Force\r\nor Threat of Force to Deny Benefits or Rights in Furtherance of Discrimination; Damage to\r\nReligious Real Property), 2H1.4 (Interference with Civil Rights Under Color of Law), and\r\n2H1.5 (Other Deprivations of Rights Benefits in Furtherance of Discrimination) into a revised\r\n§2H1.1 (Offenses Involving Individual Rights). This revised guideline provides greater\r\nconsistency in offense levels for similar conduct, reflects the additional enhancement now\r\ncontained in §3A1.1, and better reflects the seriousness of the underlying conduct. Third, the\r\namendment references violations of 18 U.S.C. § 248 (the Freedom of Access to Clinic\r\nEntrances Act of 1994, Pub. L. 103-259, 108 Stat. 694) to the consolidated §2H1.1. Fourth,\r\nthe amendment clarifies the operation of §3A1.1 with respect to a vulnerable victim. Fifth, the\r\namendment addresses the directive to the Commission in section 240002 of the Violent Crime\r\nControl and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 (pertaining to elderly victims of crimes of violence).\r\nSection 280003 of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 directs the\r\nCommission to provide a minimum enhancement of three levels for offenses that the finder of\r\nfact at trial determines are hate crimes. This directive also instructs the Commission to ensure\r\nthat there is reasonable consistency with other guidelines and that duplicative punishments for\r\nthe same offense are avoided. The congressional directive in section 280003 requires that the\r\nthree-level hate crimes enhancement apply where \"the finder of fact at trial determines beyond\r\na reasonable doubt\" that the offense of conviction was a hate crime. This amendment makes\r\nthe enhancement applicable if either the finder of fact at trial or, in the case of a guilty or nolo\r\ncontendere plea, the court at sentencing determines that the offense was a hate crime. By\r\nbroadening the applicability of the congressionally mandated enhancement, this amendment\r\nwill avoid unwarranted sentencing disparity based on the mode of conviction. The\r\n\r\nCommission’s general guideline promulgation authority, see 28 U.S.C. § 994, permits such a\r\nbroadening of the enhancement.\r\nThe addition of a generally applicable Chapter Three hate crimes enhancement requires\r\namendment of the civil rights offense guidelines to avoid duplicative punishments. In addition,\r\nto further the Commission’s goal of simplifying the operation of the guidelines, the proposed\r\namendment consolidates the four current civil rights offense guidelines into one guideline and\r\nadjusts these guidelines to take into account the new enhancement under §3A1.1(a).\r\nThe Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act of 1994 makes it a crime to interfere with\r\naccess to reproductive services or to interfere with certain religious activities. This Act\r\ncriminalizes a broad array of conduct, from non-violent obstruction of the entrance to a clinic\r\nto murder. The amendment treats these violations in the same way as other offenses involving\r\nindividual rights.\r\nSection 240002 of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 directs the\r\nCommission to ensure that the guidelines provide sufficiently stringent penalties for crimes of\r\nviolence against elderly victims. Upon review of the guidelines, the Commission determined\r\nthat the penalties currently provided generally appear appropriate; however, this amendment\r\nstrengthens the Commentary to §3A1.1 in one area by expressly providing a basis for an\r\nupward departure if both the current offense and a prior offense involved a vulnerable victim\r\n(including an elderly victim), regardless of the type of offense.\r\nFinally, Section 250003 of the Violent Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 directs the\r\nCommission to review, and if necessary, amend the sentencing guidelines to ensure that victim-\r\nrelated adjustments for fraud offenses against older victims are adequate. Section 250003 also\r\ndirects the Commission to study and report to the Congress on this issue. See Report to\r\nCongress: Adequacy of Penalties for Fraud Offenses Involving Elderly Victims (March 13,\r\n1995). Although the Commission found that the current guidelines generally provided\r\nadequate penalties in these cases, it noted some inconsistency in the application of §3A1.1\r\nregarding whether this adjustment required proof that the defendant had \"targeted the victim\r\non account of the victim’s vulnerability.\" This amendment revises the Commentary of §3A1.1\r\nto clarify application with respect to this issue.","EffectiveDate":"Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1995."},{"Id":519,"Title":"Amendment 519","Text":"Section §2K2.1(a)(1) is amended by deleting:\r\n\"defendant had at least two prior felony convictions of either a crime of violence or a\r\ncontrolled substance offense, and the instant offense involved a firearm listed in\r\n26 U.S.C. § 5845(a)\",\r\nand inserting in lieu thereof:\r\n\"offense involved a firearm described in 26 U.S.C. § 5845(a) or 18 U.S.C. § 921(a)(30),\r\nand the defendant had at least two prior felony convictions of either a crime of violence\r\nor a controlled substance offense\".\r\nAmendment 522 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003\r\n\r\nSection §2K2.1(a)(3) is amended by deleting:\r\n\"defendant had one prior felony conviction of either a crime of violence or a controlled\r\nsubstance offense, and the instant offense involved a firearm listed in 26 U.S.C.\r\n§ 5845(a)\",\r\nand inserting in lieu thereof:\r\n\"offense involved a firearm described in 26 U.S.C. § 5845(a) or 18 U.S.C. § 921(a)(30),\r\nand the defendant had one prior conviction of either a crime of violence or controlled\r\nsubstance offense\".\r\nSection §2K2.1(a)(4)(B) is amended by deleting \"listed in 26 U.S.C. § 5845(a)\" and inserting\r\nin lieu thereof \"described in 26 U.S.C. § 5845(a) or 18 U.S.C. § 921(a)(30)\".\r\nSection 2K2.1(a)(5) is amended by deleting \"listed in 26 U.S.C. § 5845(a)\" and inserting in lieu\r\nthereof \"described in 26 U.S.C. § 5845(a) or 18 U.S.C. § 921(a)(30)\".\r\nSection 2K2.1(a)(8) is amended by deleting \"or (m)\" and by inserting in lieu thereof \"(m), (s),\r\n(t), or (x)(1)\".\r\nThe Commentary to §2K2.1 captioned \"Statutory Provisions\" is amended by deleting \"(r)\" and\r\ninserting in lieu thereof \"(r)-(w), (x)(1)\"; and by deleting \"(g)\" and inserting in lieu thereof \"(g),\r\n(h), (j)-(n)\".\r\nThe Commentary to §2K2.1 captioned \"Application Notes\" is amended by deleting:\r\n\"3. ‘Firearm listed in 26 U.S.C. § 5845(a)’ includes: (i) any short-barreled rifle or\r\nshotgun or any weapon made therefrom; (ii) a machinegun; (iii) a silencer; (iv)\r\na destructive device; or (v) any ‘other weapon,’ as that term is defined by 26\r\nU.S.C. § 5845(e).

Thus, offenses involving a semiautomatic firearm\r\nrepresent the typical or \"heartland\" case under the guidelines. Consequently, the firearms\r\nenhancements in the guidelines for crimes of violence and drug trafficking can be considered\r\nto take into account the fact that firearms involved in these offenses typically are\r\nsemiautomatic. Moreover, the \"firepower\" or \"dangerousness\" of semiautomatic firearms,\r\ncompared to other types of firearms, varies substantially with caliber and magazine capacity.\r\nFor example, a .25 caliber, six-shot semiautomatic pistol is not considered as having as much\r\nfirepower as a .38 caliber, six-shot revolver or a .357 magnum, six-shot revolver. A nine-\r\nmillimeter semiautomatic pistol fires a somewhat more powerful cartridge than a .38 caliber\r\nrevolver and a somewhat less powerful cartridge than a .357 magnum revolver. But some nine-\r\nmillimeter semiautomatic pistols hold from 14-18 cartridges, compared to six cartridges for a\r\nrevolver. A high magazine capacity, nine-millimeter semiautomatic pistol can be said to have\r\nsignificantly more firepower than a revolver because it can fire a significantly larger number\r\nof shots without reloading.\r\nIf harm actually results (e.g., death or bodily injury), the guidelines generally take that harm\r\ninto account directly. Consequently, in considering any distinction between semiautomatic\r\nfirearms and other firearms, the issue is whether there is any significant difference in the risk\r\nof harm. The difference in the risk of harm also varies widely with the circumstances of the\r\noffense. For example, in a robbery at very close range, the difference in the likelihood of death\r\nor bodily injury between a revolver and semiautomatic pistol would seem to be small. In\r\ncontrast, in a drive-by shooting the greater firepower of a semiautomatic weapon likely would\r\nhave a more significant effect on the likelihood of death or injury.\r\nAfter considering the above factors, the Commission determined that the most appropriate\r\napproach at this time was to provide a specific basis for an upward departure when a high-\r\ncapacity semiautomatic firearm is possessed in connection with a crime of violence or drug\r\ntrafficking offense, thereby allowing the courts the flexibility to take this factor into account\r\nas appropriate in the circumstances of the particular case.","EffectiveDate":"Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1995."},{"Id":529,"Title":"Amendment 529","Text":"Chapter Five, Part K, Subpart Two is amended by inserting an additional policy\r\nstatement as §5K1.18 (Violent Street Gangs).","Reason":"Reason for Amendment: This amendment expressly provides a basis for an upward departure\r\nin the case of a defendant subject to a statutorily enhanced maximum penalty under 18 U.S.C.\r\nAmendment 533 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003\r\n\r\n§ 521 (pertaining to criminal street gangs), as enacted by section 150000 of the Violent Crime\r\nand Law Enforcement Act of 1994.","EffectiveDate":"Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1995."},{"Id":530,"Title":"Amendment 530","Text":"Section 7B1.3(g)(2) is amended by deleting \"the defendant may, to the extent\r\npermitted by law, be ordered to recommence supervised release upon release from\r\nimprisonment\" and inserting in lieu thereof:\r\n\"the court may include a requirement that the defendant be placed on a term of\r\nsupervised release upon release from imprisonment.

Behnezhad, 907 F.2d 896 (9th Cir. 1990), the Ninth Circuit held\r\nthat where a term of supervised release was revoked there was no statutory\r\nauthority to impose a further term of supervised release. Under this decision, in\r\nthe case of a revocation of a term of supervised release, an alternative that is\r\ncontingent upon imposition of a further term of supervised release (e.g., a period\r\nof imprisonment followed by a period of community confinement or detention\r\nas a condition of supervised release) cannot be implemented.

The provision also\r\namends section 3583(g) by eliminating the mandatory re-imprisonment period of at least one-\r\nthird of the term of supervised release if the defendant possesses a controlled substance.\r\nAdditionally, the provision requires the courts to revoke probation or supervised release and\r\nimpose a sentence that includes a term of imprisonment if the defendant is found to be in\r\npossession of a firearm, or refuses to participate in drug testing.

Subsection (b) (which may apply only if subsection (a) does not apply),\r\naddresses cases in which the conduct resulting in the undischarged term of\r\nimprisonment has been fully taken into account under §1B1.3 (Relevant\r\nConduct) in determining the offense level for the instant offense. This can occur,\r\nfor example, where a defendant is prosecuted in both federal and state court, or\r\nin two or more federal jurisdictions, for the same criminal conduct or for\r\ndifferent criminal transactions that were part of the same course of conduct.\r\nWhen a sentence is imposed pursuant to subsection (b), the court should adjust\r\nfor any term of imprisonment already served as a result of the conduct taken into\r\naccount in determining the sentence for the instant offense. Example: The\r\ndefendant has been convicted of a federal offense charging the sale of 30 grams\r\n\r\nof cocaine. Under §1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct), the defendant is held accountable\r\nfor the sale of an additional 15 grams of cocaine that is part of the same course\r\nof conduct for which the defendant has been convicted and sentenced in state\r\ncourt (the defendant received a nine-month sentence of imprisonment, of which\r\nhe has served six months at the time of sentencing on the instant federal offense).\r\nThe guideline range applicable to the defendant is 10-16 months (Chapter Two\r\noffense level of 14 for sale of 45 grams of cocaine; 2-level reduction for\r\nacceptance of responsibility; final offense level of 12; Criminal History Category\r\nI). The court determines that a sentence of 13 months provides the appropriate\r\ntotal punishment. Because the defendant has already served six months on the\r\nrelated state charge, a sentence of seven months, imposed to run concurrently\r\nwith the remainder of the defendant’s state sentence, achieves this result. For\r\nclarity, the court should note on the Judgment in a Criminal Case Order that the\r\nsentence imposed is not a departure from the guidelines because the defendant\r\nhas been credited for guideline purposes under §5G1.3(b) with six months served\r\nin state custody.\r\n3. Where the defendant is subject to an undischarged term of imprisonment in\r\ncircumstances other than those set forth in subsections (a) or (b), subsection (c)\r\napplies and the court shall impose a consecutive sentence to the extent necessary\r\nto fashion a sentence resulting in a reasonable incremental punishment for the\r\nmultiple offenses. In some circumstances, such incremental punishment can be\r\nachieved by the imposition of a sentence that is concurrent with the remainder\r\nof the unexpired term of imprisonment. In such cases, a consecutive sentence is\r\nnot required. To the extent practicable, the court should consider a reasonable\r\nincremental penalty to be a sentence for the instant offense that results in a\r\ncombined sentence of imprisonment that approximates the total punishment that\r\nwould have been imposed under §5G1.2 (Sentencing on Multiple Counts of\r\nConviction) had all of the offenses been federal offenses for which sentences\r\nwere being imposed at the same time. It is recognized that this determination\r\nfrequently will require an approximation. Where the defendant is serving a term\r\nof imprisonment for a state offense, the information available may permit only\r\na rough estimate of the total punishment that would have been imposed under the\r\nguidelines. Where the offense resulting in the undischarged term of\r\nimprisonment is a federal offense for which a guideline determination has\r\npreviously been made, the task will be somewhat more straightforward, although\r\neven in such cases a precise determination may not be possible.\r\nIt is not intended that the above methodology be applied in a manner that unduly\r\ncomplicates or prolongs the sentencing process. Additionally, this methodology\r\ndoes not, itself, require the court to depart from the guideline range established\r\nfor the instant federal offense. Rather, this methodology is meant to assist the\r\ncourt in determining the appropriate sentence (e.g., the appropriate point within\r\nthe applicable guideline range, whether to order the sentence to run concurrently\r\nor consecutively to the undischarged term of imprisonment, or whether a\r\ndeparture is warranted). Generally, the court may achieve an appropriate\r\nsentence through its determination of an appropriate point within the applicable\r\nguideline range for the instant federal offense, combined with its determination\r\nAmendment 535 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003\r\n\r\nof whether that sentence will run concurrently or consecutively to the\r\nundischarged term of imprisonment.\r\nIllustrations of the Application of Subsection (c):\r\n(A) The guideline range applicable to the instant federal offense is 24-30\r\nmonths. The court determines that a total punishment of 36 months’\r\nimprisonment would appropriately reflect the instant federal offense and\r\nthe offense resulting in the undischarged term of imprisonment. The\r\nundischarged term of imprisonment is an indeterminate sentence of\r\nimprisonment with a 60-month maximum. At the time of sentencing on\r\nthe instant federal offense, the defendant has served ten months on the\r\nundischarged term of imprisonment. In this case, a sentence of 26\r\nmonths’ imprisonment to be served concurrently with the remainder of\r\nthe undischarged term of imprisonment would (1) be within the guideline\r\nrange for the instant federal offense, and (2) achieve an appropriate total\r\npunishment (36 months).\r\n(B) The applicable guideline range for the instant federal offense is 24-30\r\nmonths. The court determines that a total punishment of 36 months’\r\nimprisonment would appropriately reflect the instant federal offense and\r\nthe offense resulting in the undischarged term of imprisonment. The\r\nundischarged term of imprisonment is a six-month determinate sentence.\r\nAt the time of sentencing on the instant federal offense, the defendant has\r\nserved three months on the undischarged term of imprisonment. In this\r\ncase, a sentence of 30 months’ imprisonment to be served consecutively\r\nto the undischarged term of imprisonment would (1) be within the\r\nguideline range for the instant federal offense, and (2) achieve an\r\nappropriate total punishment (36 months).\r\n(C) The applicable guideline range for the instant federal offense is 24-30\r\nmonths. The court determines that a total punishment of 60 months’\r\nimprisonment would appropriately reflect the instant federal offense and\r\nthe offense resulting in the undischarged term of imprisonment. The\r\nundischarged term of imprisonment is a 12-month determinate sentence.\r\nIn this case, a sentence of 30 months’ imprisonment to be served\r\nconsecutively to the undischarged term of imprisonment would be the\r\ngreatest sentence imposable without departure for the instant federal\r\noffense.\r\n(D) The applicable guideline range for the instant federal offense is 24-30\r\nmonths. The court determines that a total punishment of 36 months’\r\nimprisonment would appropriately reflect the instant federal offense and\r\nthe offense resulting in the undischarged term of imprisonment. The\r\nundischarged term of imprisonment is an indeterminate sentence with a\r\n60-month maximum. At the time of sentencing on the instant federal\r\noffense, the defendant has served 22 months on the undischarged term of\r\nimprisonment. In this case, a sentence of 24 months to be served\r\n\r\nconcurrently with the remainder of the undischarged term of\r\nimprisonment would be the lowest sentence imposable without departure\r\nfor the instant federal offense.\r\n4. If the defendant was on federal or state probation, parole, or supervised release\r\nat the time of the instant offense, and has had such probation, parole, or\r\nsupervised release revoked, the sentence for the instant offense should be\r\nimposed to be served consecutively to the term imposed for the violation of\r\nprobation, parole, or supervised release in order to provide an incremental\r\npenalty for the violation of probation, parole, or supervised release (in accord\r\nwith the policy expressed in §§7B1.3 and 7B1.4)\",\r\nand inserting in lieu thereof:\r\n\"2. Adjusted concurrent sentence - subsection (b) cases. When a sentence is\r\nimposed pursuant to subsection (b), the court should adjust the sentence for any\r\nperiod of imprisonment already served as a result of the conduct taken into\r\naccount in determining the guideline range for the instant offense if the court\r\ndetermines that period of imprisonment will not be credited to the federal\r\nsentence by the Bureau of Prisons. Example: The defendant is convicted of a\r\nfederal offense charging the sale of 30 grams of cocaine. Under §1B1.3\r\n(Relevant Conduct), the defendant is held accountable for the sale of an\r\nadditional 15 grams of cocaine, an offense for which the defendant has been\r\nconvicted and sentenced in state court. The defendant received a nine-month\r\nsentence of imprisonment for the state offense and has served six months on that\r\nsentence at the time of sentencing on the instant federal offense. The guideline\r\nrange applicable to the defendant is 10-16 months (Chapter Two offense level of\r\n14 for sale of 45 grams of cocaine; 2-level reduction for acceptance of\r\nresponsibility; final offense level of 12; Criminal History Category I). The court\r\ndetermines that a sentence of 13 months provides the appropriate total\r\npunishment. Because the defendant has already served six months on the related\r\nstate charge as of the date of sentencing on the instant federal offense, a sentence\r\nof seven months, imposed to run concurrently with the three months remaining\r\non the defendant’s state sentence, achieves this result. For clarity, the court\r\nshould note on the Judgment in a Criminal Case Order that the sentence imposed\r\nis not a departure from the guideline range because the defendant has been\r\ncredited for guideline purposes under §5G1.3(b) with six months served in state\r\ncustody that will not be credited to the federal sentence under 18 U.S.C. §\r\n3585(b).\r\n3. Concurrent or consecutive sentence - subsection (c) cases. In circumstances not\r\ncovered under subsection (a) or (b), subsection (c) applies. Under this\r\nsubsection, the court may impose a sentence concurrently, partially concurrently,\r\nor consecutively. To achieve a reasonable punishment and avoid unwarranted\r\ndisparity, the court should consider the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. § 3584\r\n(referencing 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)) and be cognizant of:\r\n(a) the type (e.g., determinate, indeterminate/parolable) and length of the\r\nAmendment 535 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003\r\n\r\nprior undischarged sentence;\r\n(b) the time served on the undischarged sentence and the time likely to be\r\nserved before release;\r\n(c) the fact that the prior undischarged sentence may have been imposed in\r\nstate court rather than federal court, or at a different time before the same\r\nor different federal court; and\r\n(d) any other circumstance relevant to the determination of an appropriate\r\nsentence for the instant offense.\r\n4. Partially concurrent sentence. In some cases under subsection (c), a partially\r\nconcurrent sentence may achieve most appropriately the desired result. To\r\nimpose a partially concurrent sentence, the court may provide in the Judgment\r\nin a Criminal Case Order that the sentence for the instant offense shall commence\r\n(A) when the defendant is released from the prior undischarged sentence, or (B)\r\non a specified date, whichever is earlier. This order provides for a fully\r\nconsecutive sentence if the defendant is released on the undischarged term of\r\nimprisonment on or before the date specified in the order, and a partially\r\nconcurrent sentence if the defendant is not released on the undischarged term of\r\nimprisonment by that date.\r\n5. Complex situations. Occasionally, the court may be faced with a complex case\r\nin which a defendant may be subject to multiple undischarged terms of\r\nimprisonment that seemingly call for the application of different rules. In such\r\na case, the court may exercise its discretion in accordance with subsection (c) to\r\nfashion a sentence of appropriate length and structure it to run in any appropriate\r\nmanner to achieve a reasonable punishment for the instant offense.\r\n6. Revocations. If the defendant was on federal or state probation, parole, or\r\nsupervised release at the time of the instant offense, and has had such probation,\r\nparole, or supervised release revoked, the sentence for the instant offense should\r\nbe imposed to run consecutively to the term imposed for the violation of\r\nprobation, parole, or supervised release in order to provide an incremental\r\npenalty for the violation of probation, parole, or supervised release. See §7B1.3\r\n(Revocation of Probation or Supervised Release) (setting forth a policy that any\r\nimprisonment penalty imposed for violating probation or supervised release\r\nshould be consecutive to any sentence of imprisonment being served or\r\nsubsequently imposed).\".\r\nThe Commentary to §5G1.3 captioned \"Background\" is amended by deleting:\r\n\"This guideline provides direction to the court when a term of imprisonment is imposed\r\non a defendant who is already subject to an undischarged term of imprisonment. See 18\r\nU.S.C. § 3584. Except in the cases in which subsection (a) applies, this guideline is\r\nintended to result in an appropriate incremental punishment for the instant offense that\r\nmost nearly approximates the sentence that would have been imposed had all the\r\n\r\nsentences been imposed at the same time.\",\r\nand inserting in lieu thereof:\r\n\"In a case in which a defendant is subject to an undischarged sentence of imprisonment,\r\nthe court generally has authority to impose an imprisonment sentence on the current\r\noffense to run concurrently with or consecutively to the prior undischarged term.\r\n18 U.S.C. § 3584(a). Exercise of that authority, however, is predicated on the court’s\r\nconsideration of the factors listed in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a), including any applicable\r\nguidelines or policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\".","Reason":"Reason for Amendment: This is a two-part amendment. First, this amendment clarifies the\r\napplication of subsections (a) and (b) of this guideline. Second, in circumstances covered by\r\nthe policy statement in subsection (c), this amendment affords the sentencing court additional\r\nflexibility to impose, as appropriate, a consecutive, concurrent, or partially concurrent sentence\r\nin order to achieve a reasonable punishment for the instant offense.\r\nAuthority to impose a partially concurrent sentence is found in the Sentencing Reform Act of\r\n1984 (SRA). In enacting 28 U.S.C. § 994(l)(1), Congress contemplated that 18 U.S.C. § 3584\r\nwould allow imposition of partially concurrent sentences, in addition to fully concurrent or\r\nconsecutive sentences. (\"It is the Committee’s intent that, to the extent feasible, the sentences\r\nfor each of the multiple offenses be determined separately and the degree to which they should\r\noverlap be specified.\") S. Rep. No. 225, 98th Cong., 1st Sess. 177 (1983). Without the ability\r\nto fashion such a sentence, the instruction to the Commission in 28 U.S.C. § 994(l)(1) to\r\nprovide a reasonable incremental penalty for additional offenses could not be implemented\r\nsuccessfully in certain situations, particularly when the defendant’s release date on an\r\nundischarged term of imprisonment cannot be determined readily in advance (e.g., in the case\r\nof an indeterminate sentence subject to parole release).\r\nPrior to the SRA, only the Bureau of Prisons had the authority to commence a federal sentence\r\nprior to the defendant’s release from imprisonment on a state sentence. See, e.g., United States\r\nv. Segal, 549 F.2d 1293, 1301 (9th Cir. 1977). SRA legislative history pertaining to 18 U.S.C.\r\n§ 3584 indicates that this new section was intended to authorize imposition of a federal prison\r\nsentence to run concurrently or consecutively to a state prison sentence. \"This . . . [section\r\n3584] changes the law that now applies to a person sentenced for a Federal offense who is\r\nalready serving a term of imprisonment for a state offense.\" S. Rep.

First, the amendment implements\r\nthe congressional directives in section 2 of the Sex Crimes Against Children Prevention Act\r\nof 1995, Pub. L. 104-71, 109 Stat. 774, by providing a two-level enhancement above the\r\ncurrently prescribed offense level for offenses involving the sexual exploitation of minors. The\r\ntwo-level enhancement is provided in the base offense levels under §§2G2.1, 2G2.2, and\r\n2G2.4.\r\nSecond, the amendment implements the congressional directive in section 3 of the above-noted\r\nAct by providing a two-level enhancement for offenses involving the sexual exploitation of a\r\nminor if a computer was used to transmit certain notices or advertisements of material\r\ninvolving minors engaged in sexually explicit conduct or to transport or ship that material. The\r\nenhancement in §2G2.2(b)(5) applies to the transmission of the material or of the notice or\r\nadvertisement of the material. The enhancement in §2G2.4(b)(3) applies only if the\r\ndefendant’s possession of the material resulted from the defendant’s use of a computer. In\r\naddition to these congressionally directed enhancements, the amendment adds a two-level\r\nenhancement under §2G2.1(b)(3) if a computer was used to solicit participation in sexually\r\nexplicit conduct by or with a minor for the purpose of producing sexually explicit material.\r\nThird, the amendment revises the Commentary to §2G2.2 to consolidate the definitions\r\napplicable to this guideline in the first application note and address several additional issues.\r\nThe amendment revises the definition of \"pattern of activity involving the sexual abuse or\r\nexploitation of a minor\" to clarify that \"sexual abuse or exploitation,\" for purposes of\r\n§2G2.2(b)(4), requires that the defendant personally had participated in such conduct. The\r\namendment defines \"sexual abuse or exploitation\" to mean conduct constituting criminal sexual\r\nabuse, sexual exploitation, or abusive sexual contact and to exclude trafficking in child\r\npornography. These revisions are consistent with United States v. Chapman, 60 F.3d 894 (1st\r\nCir. 1995) and United States v. Ketcham, 80 F.3d 789 (3d Cir. 1996), both of which held that\r\nthe defendant’s transportation or distribution of child pornography is not sexual exploitation\r\nwithin the meaning of the \"pattern of activity\" enhancement in §2G2.2(b)(4). In addition, the\r\namendment clarifies that the \"pattern of activity\" may include acts of sexual abuse or\r\nexploitation that were not committed during the course of the offense or that did not result in\r\n\r\na conviction. This revision responds in part to the holding in Chapman, 60 F.3d at 901, that\r\nthe \"pattern of activity\" enhancement is inapplicable to past sexual abuse or exploitation\r\nunrelated to the offense of conviction. The amended language expressly provides that such\r\nconduct may be considered. Accordingly, the conduct considered for purposes of the \"pattern\r\nof activity\" enhancement is broader than the scope of relevant conduct typically considered\r\nunder §1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct). In addition, the amendment provides that an upward\r\ndeparture may be warranted if the defendant (1) did not engage in a \"pattern of activity\" but\r\nnevertheless abused a minor at any time, or (2) engaged in a \"pattern of activity\" but the\r\nenhancement does not adequately reflect the seriousness of the sexual abuse or exploitation.\r\nIn addition, the amendment clarifies that prior convictions counted as part of the \"pattern of\r\nactivity\" also may be counted as part of the defendant’s criminal history under Chapter Four,\r\nif those convictions meet the criteria set forth in the relevant guidelines of that chapter.\r\nFourth, the amendment makes the \"Statutory Provisions\" in the Commentary to §§2G2.1 and\r\n2G2.2 more comprehensive by adding 18 U.S.C. § 2258(a) and (b) to the list of statutory\r\nprovisions covered by those guidelines.","EffectiveDate":"Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1996."},{"Id":535,"Title":"Amendment 535","Text":"Sections 2G1.1 and 2G1.2 are deleted in their entirety as follows:\r\n\"§2G1.1.

The consolidated offense\r\nguideline incorporates the cross references of §2G1.2, provides a definition of the term\r\n\"victim,\" and clarifies that the guideline covers offenses under 18 U.S.C. § 2423(a), but not 18\r\nU.S.C. § 2423(b) (a statutory provision referenced in Appendix A to §§2A3.1, 2A3.2, and\r\n2A3.3).\r\nSecond, this amendment implements the congressional directive in section 4 of the Sex Crimes\r\nAgainst Children Prevention Act of 1995, Pub. L. 104-71, 109 Stat. 774, by providing a three-\r\nlevel increase in the enhancement for offenses involving the transportation of minors with\r\nintent to engage in prostitution or other prohibited sexual conduct. This three-level increase\r\nis provided in the specific offense characteristic pertaining to the age of the victim in subsection\r\n(b)(2) and is in addition to the two-level increase in this enhancement described in the first part\r\n\r\nof this amendment.\r\nThird, this amendment addresses 18 U.S.C. § 2422(b), a new offense created by section 508\r\nof the Telecommunications Act of 1996, Pub. L. 104-104, 110 Stat. 56. That offense makes\r\nit unlawful, in interstate or foreign commerce, including through the mail, or within the special\r\nmaritime or territorial jurisdiction of the United States, to knowingly persuade, induce, entice,\r\nor coerce an individual under the age of 18 years to engage in prostitution or other prohibited\r\nsexual conduct. The amendment brings this new offense within the scope of the consolidated\r\nguideline. As revised, the guideline is broadly applicable to offenses that involve \"promoting\r\nprostitution or prohibited sexual conduct.\" That term is defined to encompass conduct covered\r\nby the new Telecommunications Act offense as well as conduct previously covered by the\r\nguideline; i.e., transporting a person, or inducing a person to travel, for the purpose of\r\nprostitution or other prohibited sexual conduct.","EffectiveDate":"Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1996."},{"Id":536,"Title":"Amendment 536","Text":"Section 3A1.4 is amended in the title by deleting \"International\".\r\nSection 3A1.4(a) is amended by deleting \"international\" and inserting in lieu thereof \"a federal\r\ncrime of\".\r\nThe Commentary to §3A1.4 captioned \"Application Notes\" is amended in Note 1 in the first\r\nsentence by deleting \"international\" and inserting in lieu thereof \"a federal crime of\"; and in\r\nthe second sentence by deleting \"International\" and inserting in lieu thereof \"Federal crime of\",\r\nand by deleting \"2331\" and inserting in lieu thereof \"2332b(g)\".","Reason":"Reason for Amendment: This amendment implements section 730 of the Antiterrorism and\r\nEffective Death Penalty Act of 1996, Pub.

Rather, the court\r\nshould take into account the totality of circumstances relevant to a decision to\r\nterminate supervised release, including the term of supervised release that would\r\nhave been appropriate in connection with a sentence under the amended\r\nguideline range.\".\r\nAmendment 549 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003\r\n\r\nThe Commentary to §1B1.10 captioned \"Background\" is amended in the third paragraph by\r\ninserting \"to determine an amended guideline range under subsection (b)\" after \"retroactively\";\r\nand by inserting before the fourth paragraph the following additional paragraph:\r\n\"The listing of an amendment in subsection (c) reflects policy determinations by the\r\nCommission that a reduced guideline range is sufficient to achieve the purposes of\r\nsentencing and that, in the sound discretion of the court, a reduction in the term of\r\nimprisonment may be appropriate for previously sentenced, qualified defendants. The\r\nauthorization of such a discretionary reduction does not otherwise affect the lawfulness\r\nof a previously imposed sentence, does not authorize a reduction in any other component\r\nof the sentence, and does not entitle a defendant to a reduced term of imprisonment as\r\na matter of right.\".","Reason":"Reason for Amendment: This amendment makes a number of substantive and clarifying\r\nchanges in the policy statement relating to retroactive application of an amendment that reduces\r\na guideline range. The amendment provides that, in exercising discretion to reduce the term\r\nof imprisonment of an incarcerated defendant, a court may not reduce the term of imprisonment\r\nbelow time served (or, put differently, grant a greater reduction in imprisonment than the\r\nimprisonment time remaining to be served). In those cases in which the combination of time\r\nalready served and this limitation preclude a defendant from receiving the full reduction the\r\ncourt would be inclined to grant as a result of an amended guideline range, the amended\r\ncommentary instructs that the court may weigh the equities of such a situation in connection\r\nwith a separate motion for early termination of supervised release under 18 U.S.C. §\r\n3583(e)(1). The amendment also makes clear that, contrary to the holding in United States v.\r\nEtherton, 101 F.3d 80 (9th Cir. 1996), a reduction in the term of imprisonment imposed upon\r\nrevocation of supervised release is not authorized by the policy statement. Finally, the\r\namendment makes a number of changes in the title and text of the policy statement to improve\r\nthe precision of the language, adds commentary emphasizing court discretion in applying\r\namendments that the Commission has listed for possible retroactive application, and adds\r\nbackground commentary more fully describing the legal consequences flowing from a\r\nCommission decision to list an amendment for possible retroactive application.","EffectiveDate":"Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1997."},{"Id":546,"Title":"Amendment 546","Text":"Section 2A2.2(b) is amended by inserting after subdivision (4) the following\r\nadditional subdivision:\r\n\"(5) If the offense involved the violation of a court protection order, increase by 2\r\nlevels.\".\r\nChapter Two, Part A, Subpart 6 is amended in the title by inserting \"or Harassing\" after\r\n\"Threatening\"; and by inserting \", Stalking, and Domestic Violence\" after \"Communications\".\r\nSection 2A6.1 is amended in the title by inserting \"or Harassing\" after \"Threatening\".\r\nSection 2A6.1 is amended by deleting subsection (a) as follows:\r\n\"(a) Base Offense Level: 12\",\r\n\r\nand inserting in lieu thereof:\r\n\"(a) Base Offense Level:\r\n(1) 12; or\r\n(2) 6, if the defendant is convicted of an offense under 47 U.S.C.\r\n§ 223(a)(1)(C), (D), or (E) that did not involve a threat to injure\r\na person or property.\".\r\nSection 2A6.1(b) is amended by redesignating subdivision (2) as subdivision (4); and by\r\ninserting after subdivision (1) the following new subdivisions:\r\n\"(2) If the offense involved more than two threats, increase by 2 levels.\r\n(3) If the offense involved the violation of a court protection order,\r\nincrease by 2 levels.\".\r\nSection 2A6.1(b)(4), as redesignated, is amended by deleting \"If specific offense\r\ncharacteristic §2A6.1(b)(1) does not apply, and\" and inserting in lieu thereof \"If (A)\r\nsubsection (a)(2) and subdivisions (1), (2), and (3) do not apply, and (B)\".\r\nThe Commentary to §2A6.1 captioned \"Statutory Provisions\" is amended by inserting\r\n\"; 47 U.S.C. § 223(a)(1)(C)-(E)\" after \"879\".\r\nThe Commentary to §2A6.1 captioned \"Application Note\" is amended by deleting \"Note\"\r\nand inserting in lieu thereof \"Notes\"; and by inserting after Note 1 the following\r\nadditional note:\r\n\"2.

For example, if the\r\ndefendant engaged in several acts of mailing threatening letters to the same\r\nvictim over a period of years (including acts that occurred prior to the\r\noffense), then for purposes of determining whether subsections (b)(1),\r\n(b)(2), and (b)(3) apply, the court shall consider only those prior acts of\r\nthreatening the victim that have a substantial and direct connection to the\r\noffense.\r\nFor purposes of Chapter Three, Part D (Multiple Counts), multiple counts\r\ninvolving making a threatening or harassing communication to the same\r\nvictim are grouped together under §3D1.2 (Groups of Closely Related\r\nCounts).

Stalking or Domestic Violence\r\n(a) Base Offense Level: 14\r\n(b) Specific Offense Characteristic\r\n(1) If the offense involved one of the following\r\naggravating factors: (A) the violation of a court\r\nprotection order; (B) bodily injury; (C)\r\npossession, or threatened use, of a dangerous\r\nweapon; or (D) a pattern of activity involving\r\nstalking, threatening, harassing, or assaulting the\r\nsame victim, increase by 2 levels. If the offense\r\ninvolved more than one of these aggravating\r\nfactors, increase by 4 levels.\r\n(c) Cross Reference\r\n(1) If the offense involved conduct covered by\r\nanother offense guideline from Chapter Two, Part\r\nA (Offenses Against the Person), apply that\r\noffense guideline, if the resulting offense level is\r\ngreater than that determined above.\r\nCommentary\r\nStatutory Provisions: 18 U.S.C. §§ 2261-2262.\r\nApplication Notes:\r\n1. For purposes of this guideline—\r\n‘Bodily injury’ and ‘dangerous weapon’ are defined in the Commentary to\r\n§1B1.1 (Application Instructions).\r\n‘Pattern of activity involving stalking, threatening, harassing, or assaulting the\r\nsame victim’ means any combination of two or more separate instances of\r\nstalking, threatening, harassing, or assaulting the same victim, whether or not\r\nsuch conduct resulted in a conviction. For example, a single instance of stalking\r\naccompanied by a separate instance of threatening, harassing, or assaulting the\r\nsame victim constitutes a pattern of activity for purposes of this guideline.\r\n\r\n‘Stalking’ means traveling with the intent to injure or harass another person and,\r\nin the course of, or as a result of, such travel, placing the person in reasonable\r\nfear of death or serious bodily injury to the person or the person’s immediate\r\nfamily. See 18 U.S.C. § 2261A. ‘Immediate family’ has the meaning set forth\r\nin 18 U.S.C. § 115(c)(2).\r\n2. Subsection (b)(1) provides for a two-level or four-level enhancement based on\r\nthe degree to which the offense involved aggravating factors listed in that\r\nsubsection. If the offense involved aggravating factors more serious than the\r\nfactors listed in subsection (b)(1), the cross reference in subsection (c) most\r\nlikely will apply, if the resulting offense level is greater, because the more\r\nserious conduct will be covered by another offense guideline from Chapter Two,\r\nPart A. For example, §2A2.2 (Aggravated Assault) most likely would apply\r\npursuant to subsection (c) if the offense involved assaultive conduct in which\r\ninjury more serious than bodily injury occurred or if a dangerous weapon was\r\nused rather than merely possessed.\r\n3. In determining whether subsection (b)(1)(D) applies, the court shall consider,\r\nunder the totality of the circumstances, any conduct that occurred prior to or\r\nduring the offense; however, conduct that occurred prior to the offense must be\r\nsubstantially and directly connected to the offense. For example, if a defendant\r\nengaged in several acts of stalking the same victim over a period of years\r\n(including acts that occurred prior to the offense), then for purposes of\r\ndetermining whether subsection (b)(1)(D) applies, the court shall look to the\r\ntotality of the circumstances, considering only those prior acts of stalking the\r\nvictim that have a substantial and direct connection to the offense.\r\nPrior convictions taken into account under subsection (b)(1)(D) are also counted\r\nfor purposes of determining criminal history points pursuant to Chapter Four,\r\nPart A (Criminal History).\r\n4. For purposes of Chapter Three, Part D (Multiple Counts), multiple counts\r\ninvolving stalking, threatening, or harassing the same victim are grouped\r\ntogether (and with counts of other offenses involving the same victim that are\r\ncovered by this guideline) under §3D1.2 (Groups of Closely Related Counts).\r\nFor example, if the defendant is convicted of two counts of stalking the\r\ndefendant’s ex-spouse under 18 U.S.C. § 2261A and one count of interstate\r\ndomestic violence involving an assault of the ex-spouse under 18 U.S.C. § 2261,\r\nthe stalking counts would be grouped together with the interstate domestic\r\nviolence count. This grouping procedure avoids unwarranted ‘double counting’\r\nwith the enhancement in subsection (b)(1)(D) (for multiple acts of stalking,\r\nthreatening, harassing, or assaulting the same victim) and recognizes that the\r\nstalking and interstate domestic violence counts are sufficiently related to warrant\r\ngrouping.\r\nMultiple counts that are cross referenced to another offense guideline pursuant\r\nto subsection (c) are to be grouped together if §3D1.2 would require grouping\r\nof those counts under that offense guideline. Similarly, multiple counts cross\r\nAmendment 549 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003\r\n\r\nreferenced pursuant to subsection (c) are not to be grouped together if §3D1.2\r\nwould preclude grouping of the counts under that offense guideline. For\r\nexample, if the defendant is convicted of multiple counts of threatening an ex-\r\nspouse in violation of a court protection order under 18 U.S.C. § 2262 and the\r\ncounts are cross referenced to §2A6.1 (Threatening or Harassing\r\nCommunications), the counts would group together because Application Note 2\r\nof §2A6.1 specifically requires grouping. In contrast, if the defendant is\r\nconvicted of multiple counts of assaulting the ex-spouse in violation of a court\r\nprotection order under 18 U.S.C. § 2262 and the counts are cross referenced to\r\n§2A2.2 (Aggravated Assault), the counts probably would not group together\r\ninasmuch as §3D1.2(d) specifically precludes grouping of counts covered by\r\n§2A2.2 and no other provision of §3D1.2 would likely apply to require grouping.\r\nMultiple counts involving different victims are not to be grouped under §3D1.2.\r\n5. If the defendant received an enhancement under subsection (b)(1) but that\r\nenhancement does not adequately reflect the extent or seriousness of the conduct\r\ninvolved, an upward departure may be warranted. For example, an upward\r\ndeparture may be warranted if the defendant stalked the victim on many\r\noccasions over a prolonged period of time.\".","Reason":"Reason for Amendment: This is a five-part amendment. First, this amendment addresses the\r\nnew offense of interstate stalking, 18 U.S.C. § 2261A, which was enacted as section 1069 of\r\nthe National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1997, Pub. L. 104–201, 110 Stat. 2422.\r\nThat offense makes it unlawful to travel across a state line or within federal jurisdiction with\r\nthe intent to injure or harass another person and, in the course of, or as a result of, such travel,\r\nto place that person in reasonable fear of death or serious bodily injury to that person or that\r\nperson’s immediate family.\r\nThe amendment adds a new guideline, §2A6.2 (Stalking or Domestic Violence), to cover the\r\nstalking offense. The new guideline provides for a base offense level of 14 and an\r\nenhancement for the presence of one or more aggravating factors that are often part of a\r\nstalking offense, including the violation of a court protection order and the presence of a pattern\r\nof stalking, harassing, threatening, or assaultive conduct. The new guideline also provides for\r\na cross reference to other Chapter Two guidelines if the offense involved more serious conduct,\r\nsuch as aggravated assault or kidnapping, that would produce a greater offense level. In\r\naddition, the new guideline permits the consideration of prior stalking, harassing, threatening,\r\nor assaultive conduct if that conduct is directly and substantially related to the offense.\r\nThe new guideline also incorporates the definitions of “bodily injury” and “dangerous weapon”\r\nfound in §1B1.1 (Application Instructions). The definition of bodily injury found in the\r\nguidelines differs from the definition of bodily injury in 18 U.S.C. § 2266 that is applicable to\r\ninterstate stalking and interstate domestic violence offenses. The definition of “bodily injury”\r\nin 18 U.S.C. § 2266 explicitly includes sexual abuse, but the guideline definition of “bodily\r\ninjury” does not. However, the Commission is fully aware that criminal sexual abuse often is\r\npart of a domestic violence offense under 18 U.S.C. §§ 2261 and 2262 and may be part of a\r\nstalking offense under 18 U.S.C. § 2261A. It is the view of the Commission that the new\r\nguideline provides an adequate mechanism for taking into account the occurrence of criminal\r\n\r\nsexual abuse in any of these offenses. This is because the guideline definition of “serious\r\nbodily injury” in §1B1.1 deems serious bodily injury -- a more serious gradient of bodily injury\r\n-- to have occurred if the offense involved conduct constituting criminal sexual abuse under 18\r\nU.S.C. § 2241 or § 2242 or any similar offense under state law. Under the new guideline, any\r\noffense that involved criminal sexual abuse almost certainly will be subject to the cross\r\nreference to another offense guideline and to the rule deeming such conduct to be serious\r\nbodily injury (for purposes of applying a serious bodily injury enhancement in that other\r\nguideline to the offense). Therefore, in all likelihood, the sentence will be enhanced for the\r\noccurrence of criminal sexual abuse because the case will be cross referenced to another\r\nguideline that enhances for serious bodily injury.\r\nSecond, the amendment changes the manner in which the offenses of interstate domestic\r\nviolence, 18 U.S.C. § 2261, and interstate violation of a protection order, 18 U.S.C. § 2262, are\r\ntreated under the guidelines. Instead of being referenced to the guidelines that may cover\r\nunderlying conduct, the amendment brings those offenses under the ambit of the new guideline,\r\n§2A6.2. This change recognizes that the aggravating factors accounted for in the new guideline\r\noften are present in these offenses as well.\r\nThird, the amendment adds an enhancement to §2A2.2 (Aggravated Assault), if the offense\r\ninvolved the violation of a court protection order, to ensure an appropriately severe offense\r\nlevel for stalking, domestic violence, and other cases that are sentenced under the aggravated\r\nassault guideline and involve this factor.\r\nFourth, the amendment addresses several new harassing telecommunications offenses,\r\n47 U.S.C. § 223(a)(1)(C)-(E), which were enacted in section 502 of the Telecommunications\r\nAct of 1996, Pub. L. 104–104, 110 Stat. 56. Those offenses make it unlawful to make a\r\ntelephone call or utilize a telecommunications device, whether or not conversation or\r\ncommunication ensues, without disclosing one’s identity and with the intent to annoy, abuse,\r\nthreaten, or harass any person at the called number or who receives the communication; make\r\nor cause the telephone of another to repeatedly or continuously ring, with the intent to harass\r\nany person at the called number; or make repeated telephone calls or repeatedly initiate\r\nconversation with a telecommunications device, during which conversation or communication\r\nensues, solely to harass any person at the called number or who receives the communication.\r\nThe amendment incorporates these new offenses into §2A6.1 (Threatening Communications).\r\nRecognizing that these offenses carry only a two-year maximum term of imprisonment, the\r\namendment provides an alternative offense level of 6 (as compared to 12), if the defendant is\r\nconvicted of any of these offenses and there was no threat to injure a person or property. The\r\namendment also adds enhancements if the offense involved more than two threats or the\r\nviolation of a court protection order.\r\nFifth, this amendment addresses a circuit conflict regarding the enhancement in §2A6.1 that\r\nprovides a 6-level increase if the offense involved any conduct evidencing an intent to carry\r\nout a threat. Specifically, the conflict is whether or not conduct which occurred prior to the\r\nmaking of the threat can evidence an intent to carry out the threat. Compare United States v.\r\nHornick, 942 F.2d 105 (2d Cir. 1991) (“a person cannot take action that will constitute proof\r\nof his intent to carry out a threat until after the threat has been made”) cert. denied, 502 U.S.\r\n1061 (1992) with United States v. Taylor, 88 F.3d 938 (11th Cir. 1996) (“the essential inquiry\r\nfor §2A6.1(b)(1) is whether the facts of the case, taken as a whole, establish a sufficiently direct\r\nAmendment 551 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003\r\n\r\nconnection between the defendant’s pre-threat conduct and his threat”); United States v.\r\nSullivan, 75 F.3d 297 (7th Cir. 1996)(same); United States v. Gary, 18 F.3d 1123 (4th Cir.)\r\n(same), cert. denied 513 U.S. 844 (1994); United States v. Hines, 26 F.3d 1469 (9th Cir.\r\n1994)(same).\r\nThe amendment essentially adopts the Eleventh Circuit’s view by adding an application note\r\nto both §§2A6.1 and 2A6.2 to provide that conduct which occurred prior to the offense shall\r\nbe considered in determining specified enhancements in those guidelines if the prior conduct\r\nis substantially and directly connected to the offense.","EffectiveDate":"Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1997."},{"Id":547,"Title":"Amendment 547","Text":"The Commentary to §2A2.4 captioned \"Application Notes\" is amended in Note\r\n1 by inserting the following after \"(Aggravated Assault).\":\r\n\"Conversely, the base offense level does not reflect the possibility that the defendant\r\nmay create a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury to another person in the\r\ncourse of fleeing from a law enforcement official (although an offense under 18 U.S.C.\r\n§ 758 for fleeing or evading a law enforcement checkpoint at high speed will often, but\r\nnot always, involve the creation of that risk).

To the extent\r\nthat any of the above-noted statutory provisions conflict with the\r\nprovisions of this guideline, the applicable statutory provision shall\r\ncontrol.\r\nBackground: Section 3553(a)(7) of Title 18 requires the court, ‘in determining\r\nthe particular sentence to be imposed,’ to consider ‘the need to provide restitution\r\nto any victims of the offense.’ Section 3556 of Title 18 authorizes the court to\r\nimpose restitution in accordance with 18 U.S.C. §§ 3663 and 3664, which\r\nauthorize restitution for violations of Title 18 or 49 U.S.C. § 46312, § 46502, or\r\n§ 46504. For other offenses, restitution may be imposed as a condition of\r\nprobation or supervised release. See 18 U.S.C. § 3563(b)(3) as amended by\r\nSection 7110 of Pub. L. No. 100-690 (1988).\r\nA court’s authority to decline to order restitution is limited. Subsection\r\n(a)(1) of this guideline requires the court to order restitution for offenses under\r\nTitle 18, United States Code, or 49 U.S.C. § 46312, § 46502, or § 46504, unless\r\nfull restitution has already been made or ‘the court determines that the\r\ncomplication and prolongation of the sentencing process resulting from the\r\nfashioning of an order of restitution . . . outweighs the need to provide restitution\r\nto any victims.’ 18 U.S.C. § 3663(d). The legislative history of 18 U.S.C. §\r\n3579, the precursor of 18 U.S.C. § 3663, states that even ‘[i]n those unusual\r\nAmendment 571 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003\r\n\r\ncases where the precise amount owed is difficult to determine, the section\r\nauthorizes the court to reach an expeditious, reasonable determination of\r\nappropriate restitution by resolving uncertainties with a view toward achieving\r\nfairness to the victim.’ S. Rep. No. 532, 97th Cong., 2d Sess. 31, reprinted in\r\n1982 U.S. Code Cong. & Ad. News 2515, 2537. If the court does not order\r\nrestitution, or orders only partial restitution, it must state its reasons for doing so.\r\n18 U.S.C. § 3553(c). Subsection (a)(2) provides for restitution as a condition of\r\nprobation or supervised release for offenses not set forth in Title 18, United\r\nStates Code, or 49 U.S.C. § 46312, § 46502, or § 46504.\r\nIn determining whether to impose an order of restitution, and the amount\r\nof restitution, the court shall consider the amount of loss the victim suffered as\r\na result of the offense, the financial resources of the defendant, the financial\r\nneeds of the defendant and his dependents, and other factors the court deems\r\nappropriate. 18 U.S.C. § 3664(a).\r\nPursuant to Rule 32(b)(4)(D), Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the\r\nprobation officer’s presentence investigation report must contain a victim impact\r\nstatement. That report must contain information about the financial impact on\r\nthe victim and the defendant’s financial condition. The sentencing judge may\r\nbase findings on the presentence report or other testimony or evidence supported\r\nby a preponderance of the evidence. 18 U.S.C. § 3664(d).\r\nUnless the court orders otherwise, restitution must be made immediately.\r\n18 U.S.C. § 3663(f)(3). The court may permit the defendant to make restitution\r\nwithin a specified period or in specified installments, provided that the last\r\ninstallment is paid not later than the expiration of probation, five years after the\r\nend of the defendant’s term of imprisonment, or in any other case five years after\r\nthe date of sentencing. 18 U.S.C. § 3663(f)(1) and (2).

Instead, the amendment provides that the\r\ncourt shall take such costs into consideration in determining the appropriate amount of a\r\npunitive fine.\r\nBecause, under the amended procedure, it no longer will be necessary to determine a separate\r\nfine increment for costs associated with implementing the sentence, the issue on which the\r\ncircuit courts have differed should not arise. This procedure also should substantially simplify\r\nfine calculations, thereby allowing court and probation officer resources to be used more\r\nefficiently and productively.","EffectiveDate":"Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1997."},{"Id":570,"Title":"Amendment 570","Text":"The Commentary to §5E1.3 captioned \"Background\" is amended by deleting\r\nthe entire text as follows:\r\n\"Background: The Victims of Crime Act of 1984, Pub.
