It would apply, for example, to a hedge fund\r\nprofessional who regularly participates in securities transactions or to a lawyer who\r\nregularly provides professional assistance in securities transactions, if the defendant’s\r\nemployment in such a position was used to facilitate significantly the commission or\r\nconcealment of the offense. It ordinarily would not apply to a position such as a clerical\r\nworker in an investment firm, because such a position ordinarily does not involve spe-\r\ncial skill. See §3B1.3, comment. (n. 4).”.\r\nThe Commentary to §2B1.4 captioned “Background” is amended by adding at the end\r\nthe following new paragraph:\r\n“ Subsection (b)(2) implements the directive to the Commission in sec-\r\ntion 1079A(a)(1)(A) of Public Law 111–203.”.","Reason":"REASON FOR AMENDMENT: This amendment responds to the two directives to the Com-\r\nmission in the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, Pub.\r\nL. 111–203 (the “Act”). The first directive relates to securities fraud and similar of-\r\nfenses, and the second directive relates to mortgage fraud and financial institution\r\nfraud.\r\nAmendment 761\r\n4 ║ Supplement to Appendix C (November 1, 2016)\r\nSecurities Fraud and Similar Offenses\r\nSection 1079A(a)(1)(A) of the Act directs the Commission to “review and, if appropriate,\r\namend” the guidelines and policy statements applicable to “persons convicted of of-\r\nfenses relating to securities fraud or any other similar provision of law, in order to\r\nreflect the intent of Congress that penalties for the offenses under the guidelines and\r\npolicy statements appropriately account for the potential and actual harm to the public\r\nand the financial markets from the offenses.” Section 1079A(a)(1)(B) provides that in\r\npromulgating any such amendment the Commission shall—\r\n(i) ensure that the guidelines and policy statements, particularly section\r\n2B1.1(b)(14) and section 2B1.1(b)(17) (and any successors thereto), re-\r\nflect—\r\n(I) the serious nature of the offenses described in subparagraph\r\n(A);\r\n(II) the need for an effective deterrent and appropriate punishment\r\nto prevent the offenses; and\r\n(III) the effectiveness of incarceration in furthering the objectives\r\ndescribed in subclauses (I) and (II);\r\n(ii) consider the extent to which the guidelines appropriately account for\r\nthe potential and actual harm to the public and the financial markets\r\nresulting from the offenses;\r\n(iii) ensure reasonable consistency with other relevant directives and\r\nguidelines and Federal statutes;\r\n(iv) make any necessary conforming changes to guidelines; and\r\n(v) ensure that the guidelines adequately meet the purposes of sentencing,\r\nas set forth in section 3553(a)(2) of title 18, United States Code.\r\nThe amendment responds to this directive in two ways. First, the amendment amends\r\nthe fraud guideline, §2B1.1 (Theft, Property Destruction, and Fraud), to provide a spe-\r\ncial rule for determining actual loss in cases involving the fraudulent inflation or de-\r\nflation in the value of a publicly traded security or commodity. Case law and comments\r\nreceived by the Commission indicate that determinations of loss in cases involving se-\r\ncurities fraud and similar offenses are complex and that a variety of different methods\r\nare in use, possibly resulting in unwarranted sentencing disparities.\r\nThe amendment amends §2B1.1 to provide a special rule regarding how to calculate\r\nactual loss in these types of cases. Specifically, the amendment creates a new Applica-\r\ntion Note 3(F)(ix) which establishes a rebuttable presumption that “the actual loss at-\r\ntributable to the change in value of the security or commodity is the amount deter-\r\nmined by (I) calculating the difference between the average price of the security or\r\ncommodity during the period that the fraud occurred and the average price of the se-\r\ncurity or commodity during the 90-day period after the fraud was disclosed to the mar-\r\nket, and (II) multiplying the difference in average price by the number of shares out-\r\nstanding.” The special rule further provides that, “[i]n determining whether the\r\namount so determined is a reasonable estimate of the actual loss attributable to the\r\nchange in value of the security or commodity, the court may consider, among other\r\nfactors, the extent to which the amount so determined includes significant changes in\r\nvalue not resulting from the offense (e.g., changes caused by external market forces,\r\nAmendment 761\r\nsuch as changed economic circumstances, changed investor expectations, and new in-\r\ndustry-specific or firm-specific facts, conditions, or events).”\r\nThe special rule is based upon what is sometimes referred to as the “modified rescis-\r\nsory method” and should ordinarily provide a “reasonable estimate of the loss” as re-\r\nquired by Application Note 3(C). This special rule is intended to provide courts a work-\r\nable and consistent formula for calculating loss that “resulted from the offense.”\r\nSee §2B1.1, comment. (n.3(A)(i)). By averaging the stock price during the period in\r\nwhich the fraud occurred and a set 90-day period after the fraud was discovered, the\r\nspecial rule reduces the impact on the loss calculation of factors other than the fraud,\r\nsuch as overall growth or decline in the price of the stock. See, e.g., United States v.\r\nBakhit, 218 F. Supp. 2d 1232 (C.D. Cal. 2002); United States v. Snyder, 291 F.3d 1291\r\n(11th Cir. 2002); United States v. Brown, 595 F.3d 498 (3d Cir. 2010); see also 15 U.S.C.\r\n§ 78u-4(e) (statutorily setting forth a similar method for loss calculation in the context\r\nof private securities litigation). Furthermore, applying this special rule could “elimi-\r\nnate[], or at least reduce[], the complexity, uncertainty, and expense inherent in at-\r\ntempting to determine out-of-pocket losses on a case-by-case basis.” See United States\r\nv. Grabske, 260 F. Supp. 2d. 866, 873–74 (N.D. Cal. 2002).\r\nBy applying a rebuttable presumption, however, the amendment also provides suffi-\r\ncient flexibility for a court to consider the extent to which the amount determined un-\r\nder the special rule includes significant changes in value not resulting from the offense\r\n(e.g., changes caused by external market forces, such as changed economic circum-\r\nstances, changed investor expectations, and new industry-specific or firm-specific\r\nfacts, conditions, or events).\r\nThe amendment also responds to the first directive by amending the insider trading\r\nguideline, §2B1.4 (Insider Trading). First, it provides a new specific offense character-\r\nistic if the offense involved an “organized scheme to engage in insider trading.” In such\r\na case, the new specific offense characteristic provides a minimum offense level of 14.\r\nThe commentary is also amended to provide factors the court may consider in deter-\r\nmining whether the new minimum offense level applies.\r\nThe amendment reflects the Commission’s view that a defendant who engages in con-\r\nsidered, calculated, systematic, or repeated efforts to obtain and trade on inside infor-\r\nmation (as opposed to fortuitous or opportunistic instances of insider trading) war-\r\nrants, at minimum, a short but definite period of incarceration. Sentencing data indi-\r\ncate that when a defendant engages in an organized insider trading scheme, the gain\r\nfrom the offense ordinarily triggers an enhancement under §2B1.4(b)(1) of sufficient\r\nmagnitude to result in a guideline range that requires a period of imprisonment. The\r\namendment, however, ensures that the guidelines require a period of incarceration\r\neven in such a case involving relatively little gain.\r\nThe amendment also amends the commentary to §2B1.4 to provide more guidance on\r\nthe applicability of §3B1.3 (Abuse of Position of Trust or Use of Special Skill) in insider\r\ntrading cases. In particular, the new commentary in Application Note 2 provides that\r\n§3B1.3 should be applied if the defendant’s employment in a position that involved\r\nregular participation or professional assistance in creating, issuing, buying, selling, or\r\ntrading securities or commodities was used to facilitate significantly the commission\r\nor concealment of the offense. The commentary further provides examples of positions\r\nthat may qualify for the adjustment, including a hedge fund professional who regularly\r\nparticipates in securities transactions or a lawyer who regularly provides professional\r\nassistance in securities transactions. Individuals who occupy such positions possess\r\nspecial knowledge regarding the financial markets and the rules prohibiting insider\r\nAmendment 761\r\n6 ║ Supplement to Appendix C (November 1, 2016)\r\ntrading, and generally are viewed as more culpable. See §3B1.3, comment. (backg’d.).\r\nThe commentary also provides as an example of a position that would not qualify for\r\nthe adjustment in §3B1.4 a clerical worker in an investment firm. Such a position or-\r\ndinarily does not involve special skill and is not generally viewed as more culpable.\r\nMortgage Fraud and Financial Institution Fraud\r\nSection 1079A(a)(2)(A) of the Act directs the Commission to “review and, if appropriate,\r\namend” the guidelines and policy statements applicable to “persons convicted of fraud\r\noffenses relating to financial institutions or federally related mortgage loans and any\r\nother similar provisions of law, to reflect the intent of Congress that the penalties for\r\nthe offenses under the guidelines and policy statements ensure appropriate terms of\r\nimprisonment for offenders involved in substantial bank frauds or other frauds relat-\r\ning to financial institutions.” Section 1079A(a)(2)(B) of the Act provides that, in prom-\r\nulgating any such amendment, the Commission shall—\r\n(i) ensure that the guidelines and policy statements reflect—\r\n(I) the serious nature of the offenses described in subpara-\r\ngraph (A);\r\n(II) the need for an effective deterrent and appropriate punishment\r\nto prevent the offenses; and\r\n(III) the effectiveness of incarceration in furthering the objectives\r\ndescribed in subclauses (I) and (II);\r\n(ii) consider the extent to which the guidelines appropriately account for\r\nthe potential and actual harm to the public and the financial markets\r\nresulting from the offenses;\r\n(iii) ensure reasonable consistency with other relevant directives and\r\nguidelines and Federal statutes;\r\n(iv) make any necessary conforming changes to guidelines; and\r\n(v) ensure that the guidelines adequately meet the purposes of sentencing,\r\nas set forth in section 3553(a)(2) of title 18, United States Code.\r\nThe amendment responds to this directive in two ways.\r\nFirst, the amendment adds language to the credits against loss rule, found in Applica-\r\ntion Note 3(E) of the commentary to §2B1.1. Application Note 3(E)(i) generally provides\r\nthat the determination of loss under subsection (b)(1) shall be reduced by the money\r\nreturned and the fair market value of the property returned and services rendered to\r\nthe victim before the offense was detected. In the context of a case involving collateral\r\npledged or otherwise provided by the defendant, Application Note 3(E)(ii) provides that\r\nthe loss to the victim shall be reduced by either “the amount the victim has recovered\r\nat the time of sentencing from disposition of the collateral, or if the collateral has not\r\nbeen disposed of by that time, the fair market value of the collateral at the time of\r\nsentencing.”\r\nThe Commission received comment that, in cases involving mortgage fraud where the\r\ncollateral has not been disposed of by the time of sentencing, the fair market value of\r\nAmendment 761\r\nthe collateral may be difficult to determine and may require frequent updating, espe-\r\ncially in cases involving multiple properties. The comments further indicate that the\r\nlack of a uniform process may result in unwarranted sentencing disparities.\r\nThe amendment responds to these concerns by establishing a new Application Note\r\n3(E)(iii) applicable to fraud cases involving a mortgage loan where the underlying col-\r\nlateral has not been disposed of by the time of sentencing. In such a case, new Appli-\r\ncation Note 3(E)(iii) makes two changes to the calculation of credits against loss. First,\r\nthe note changes the date on which the fair market value of the collateral is deter-\r\nmined, from the time of sentencing to the date on which the guilt of the defendant has\r\nbeen established. This change is intended to avoid the need to reassess the fair market\r\nvalue of such collateral on multiple occasions up to the date of sentencing. Second, it\r\nestablishes a rebuttable presumption that the most recent tax assessment value of the\r\ncollateral is a reasonable estimate of the fair market value. In determining whether\r\nthe tax assessment is a reasonable estimate of fair market value, the note further pro-\r\nvides that the court may consider the recency of the tax assessment and the extent to\r\nwhich the jurisdiction’s tax assessment practices reflect factors not relevant to fair\r\nmarket value, among other factors.\r\nBy structuring the special rule in this manner, the amendment addresses the need to\r\nprovide a uniform practicable method for determining fair market value of undisposed\r\ncollateral while providing sufficient flexibility for courts to address differences among\r\njurisdictions regarding how closely the most recent tax assessment correlates to fair\r\nmarket value. The Commission heard concerns, for example, that, in some jurisdic-\r\ntions, the most recent tax assessment may be outdated or based upon factors, such as\r\nthe age or status of the homeowner, that have no correlation to fair market value.\r\nThe amendment also responds to the second directive by amending the commentary\r\nregarding the application of §2B1.1(b)(15)(B), which provides an enhancement of 4 lev-\r\nels if the offense involved specific types of financial harms (e.g., jeopardizing a financial\r\ninstitution or organization). This commentary, contained in Application Note 12 to\r\n§2B1.1, provides a non-exhaustive list of factors the court shall consider in determining\r\nwhether, as a result of the offense, the safety and soundness of a financial institution\r\nor an organization that was a publicly traded company or that had more than 1,000 em-\r\nployees was substantially jeopardized. For example, in the context of financial institu-\r\ntions, the court shall consider whether the financial institution became insolvent, was\r\nforced to reduce benefits to pensioners or insureds, was unable on demand to refund\r\nfully any deposit, payment, or investment, or was so depleted of its assets as to be\r\nforced to merge with another institution. Similarly, in the context of a covered organi-\r\nzation, the court shall consider whether the organization became insolvent or suffered\r\na substantial reduction in the value of its assets, filed for bankruptcy, suffered a sub-\r\nstantial reduction in the value of its equity securities or its employee retirement ac-\r\ncounts, or substantially reduced its workforce or employee pension benefits.\r\nThe amendment amends Application Note 12 to add as a new consideration whether\r\none of the listed harms was likely to result from the offense, but did not result from\r\nthe offense because of federal government intervention, such as a “bailout.” This\r\namendment reflects the Commission’s intent that §2B1.1(b)(15)(B) account for the risk\r\nof harm from the defendant’s conduct and its view that a defendant should not avoid\r\nthe application of the enhancement because the harm that was otherwise likely to re-\r\nsult from the offense conduct did not occur because of fortuitous federal government\r\nintervention.\r\nAmendment 762\r\n8 ║ Supplement to Appendix C (November 1, 2016)\r\nDeparture Provisions\r\nFinally, the amendment also responds to the Act’s directives by amending the depar-\r\nture provisions in §2B1.1 to provide two examples of cases in which a departure may\r\nbe warranted.\r\nFirst, the amendment amends Application Note 19(A)(iv), which provides that an up-\r\nward departure may be warranted if the offense created a risk of substantial loss be-\r\nyond the loss determined for purposes of subsection (b)(1). The amendment adds “risk\r\nof a significant disruption of a national financial market” as an example of such a risk.\r\nThis part of the amendment responds to the requirement in the Act to consider\r\nwhether the guidelines applicable to the offenses covered by the directives appropri-\r\nately “account for the potential and actual harm to the public and the financial mar-\r\nkets[.]”\r\nThe amendment also amends Application Note 19(C), which provides that a downward\r\ndeparture may be warranted if the offense level substantially overstates the serious-\r\nness of the offense, by adding an example of a case in which such a departure may be\r\nappropriate. The example provides that “a securities fraud involving a fraudulent\r\nstatement made publicly to the market may produce an aggregate loss amount that is\r\nsubstantial but diffuse, with relatively small loss amounts suffered by a relatively\r\nlarge number of victims,” and that, “in such a case, the loss table in subsection (b)(1)\r\nand the victims table in subsection (b)(2) may combine to produce an offense level that\r\nsubstantially overstates the seriousness of the offense.” This part of the amendment\r\nresponds to concerns raised in comment and case law that the cumulative impact of\r\nthe loss table and the victims table may overstate the seriousness of the offense in\r\ncertain cases.","EffectiveDate":"Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2012."},{"Id":762,"Title":"Amendment 762","Text":"The Commentary to §2D1.1 captioned “Application Notes” is amended in\r\nNote 10(D) in the subdivision captioned “Cocaine and Other Schedule I and II Stimu-\r\nlants (and their immediate precursors)” by inserting after the entry relating to N-N-\r\nDimethylamphetamine the following new entry:\r\n“1 gm of N-Benzylpiperazine = 100 gm of marihuana”.","Reason":"REASON FOR AMENDMENT: This amendment responds to concerns raised by the Second\r\nCircuit Court of Appeals and others regarding the sentencing of offenders convicted of\r\noffenses involving BZP (N-Benzylpiperazine), which is a Schedule I stimulant.\r\nSee United States v. Figueroa, 647 F.3d 466 (2d Cir. 2011). The amendment estab-\r\nlishes a marijuana equivalency for BZP offenses in the Drug Equivalency Table pro-\r\nvided in Application Note 10(D) in §2D1.1 (Unlawful Manufacturing, Importing, Ex-\r\nporting, or Trafficking (Including Possession with Intent to Commit These Offenses);\r\nAttempt or Conspiracy). The marijuana equivalency established by the amendment\r\nprovides that 1 gram of BZP equals 100 grams of marijuana.\r\nPrior to the amendment, the Drug Equivalency Table did not include a marijuana\r\nequivalency for BZP. As a result, in offenses involving BZP, the court determined the\r\nAmendment 763\r\nbase offense level using the marijuana equivalency of “the most closely related con-\r\ntrolled substance” referenced in §2D1.1. See §2D1.1, comment. (n. 5). In determining\r\nthe most closely related controlled substance, the commentary directs the court to con-\r\nsider (1) whether the controlled substance not referenced in §2D1.1 has a chemical\r\nstructure that is substantially similar to a controlled substance that is referenced in\r\n§2D1.1, (2) whether the controlled substance not referenced in §2D1.1 has a stimulant,\r\ndepressant, or hallucinogenic effect similar to a controlled substance referenced in the\r\nguideline, and (3) whether a lesser or greater quantity of the controlled substance not\r\nreferenced in §2D1.1 is needed to produce a substantially similar effect as a controlled\r\nsubstance that is referenced in §2D1.1.\r\nIn applying these factors, courts have reached different conclusions regarding which\r\ncontrolled substance referenced in §2D1.1 is most closely related to BZP and have\r\ntherefore used different marijuana equivalencies in sentencing BZP offenders. The\r\nCommission’s review of case law and sentencing data indicate that some district courts\r\nhave found that the controlled substance most closely related to BZP is amphetamine\r\nand used the marijuana equivalency for amphetamine, see United States v. Major,\r\n801 F. Supp. 2d 511, 514 (E.D. Va. 2011) (using the marijuana equivalency for amphet-\r\namine at full potency), while other district courts have found that the controlled sub-\r\nstance most related to BZP is MDMA, but at varying potencies. See United States v.\r\nBennett, 659 F.3d 711, 715–16 (8th Cir. 2011) (affirming a district court’s use of the\r\nmarijuana equivalency for MDMA at full potency); United States v. Rose,\r\n722 F. Supp. 2d 1286, 1289 (M.D. Ala. 2010) (concluding that BZP is most closely re-\r\nlated to MDMA, but imposing a variance to reflect BZP’s reduced potency compared to\r\nMDMA). The different findings of which controlled substance is the most closely re-\r\nlated to BZP, and the application of different potencies of those controlled substances,\r\nhave resulted in courts imposing vastly different sentence lengths for the same con-\r\nduct.\r\nThe Commission reviewed scientific literature and received expert testimony and com-\r\nment relating to BZP and concluded that BZP is a stimulant with pharmacologic prop-\r\nerties similar to that of amphetamine, but is only one-tenth to one-twentieth as potent\r\nas amphetamine, depending on the particular user’s history of drug abuse. Accord-\r\ningly, in order to promote uniformity in sentencing BZP offenders and to reflect the\r\nbest available scientific evidence, the amendment establishes a marijuana equivalency\r\nof 1 gram of BZP equals 100 grams of marijuana. This corresponds to one-twentieth of\r\nthe marijuana equivalency for amphetamine, which is 1 gram of amphetamine equals\r\n2 kilograms (or 2,000 grams) of marijuana.","EffectiveDate":"Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2012."},{"Id":763,"Title":"Amendment 763","Text":"Section 2D1.11 is amended in subsection (b) by adding at the end the\r\nfollowing:\r\n“(6) If the defendant meets the criteria set forth in subdivisions (1)–(5) of subsec-\r\ntion (a) of §5C1.2 (Limitation on Applicability of Statutory Minimum Sentences\r\nin Certain Cases), decrease by 2 levels.”.\r\nThe Commentary to 2D1.11 captioned “Application Notes” is amended by adding at\r\nthe end the following:\r\nAmendment 763\r\n10 ║ Supplement to Appendix C (November 1, 2016)\r\n“9.

See §5C1.2(b)(2)(requiring a minimum of-\r\nfense level of level 17 if the ‘statutorily required minimum sentence is at least\r\nfive years’).”.","Reason":"REASON FOR AMENDMENT: This amendment adds a new specific offense characteristic\r\nat subsection (b)(6) of §2D1.11 (Unlawfully Distributing, Importing, Exporting or Pos-\r\nsessing a Listed Chemical; Attempt or Conspiracy) that provides a 2-level decrease if\r\nthe defendant meets the criteria set forth in subdivisions (1)–(5) of subsection (a) of\r\n§5C1.2 (Limitation on Applicability of Statutory Minimum Sentences in Certain Cases)\r\n(commonly referred to as the “safety valve” criteria). The new specific offense charac-\r\nteristic in §2D1.11 parallels the existing 2-level decrease at subsection (b)(16) of\r\n§2D1.1(Unlawful Manufacturing, Importing, Exporting, or Trafficking (Including Pos-\r\nsession with Intent to Commit These Offenses); Attempt or Conspiracy).\r\nThe Commission in 1995 created the 2-level reduction in §2D1.1 for offenders who meet\r\nthe safety valve criteria in response to a directive in section 80001 of the Violent Crime\r\nControl and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, Pub. L. No. 103–322. Section 80001 pro-\r\nvided an exception to otherwise applicable statutory minimum sentences for defend-\r\nants convicted of specified drug offenses and who meet the criteria specified in\r\n18 U.S.C. § 3553(f)(1)–(5), and directed the Commission to promulgate guidelines to\r\ncarry out these purposes. The reduction in §2D1.1 initially was limited to defendants\r\nwhose offense level was level 26 or greater, see USSG App. C, Amendment 515 (effec-\r\ntive November 1, 1995), but was subsequently expanded to apply to offenders with an\r\noffense level lower than level 26 to address proportionality concerns. See USSG App. C,\r\nAmendment 624 (effective November 1, 2001). Specifically, the Commission deter-\r\nmined that limiting the applicability of the reduction to defendants with an offense\r\nlevel of level 26 or greater “is inconsistent with the general principles underlying the\r\ntwo-level reduction . . . to provide lesser punishment for first time, nonviolent offend-\r\ners.” Id.\r\nFor similar reasons of proportionality, this amendment expands application of the\r\n2-level reduction to offenses involving list I and list II chemicals sentenced under\r\n§2D1.11. List I chemicals are important to the manufacture of a controlled substance\r\nand usually become part of the final product, while list II chemicals are generally used\r\nas solvents, catalysts, and reagents. See USSG §2D1.11, comment. (backg’d.). Sec-\r\ntion 2D1.11 is generally structured to provide base offense levels that are tied to, but\r\nless severe than, the base offense levels in §2D1.1 for offenses involving the final prod-\r\nuct. The Commission determined that adding the 2-level reduction for meeting the\r\nsafety valve criteria in §2D1.11 would promote the proportionality the Commission has\r\nintended to achieve between §§2D1.1 and 2D1.11.\r\nThe amendment also adds new commentary relating to the “safety valve” reduction in\r\n§2D1.11 that is consistent with the commentary relating to the “safety valve” reduction\r\nin §2D1.1. See USSG §2D1.1, comment. (n. 21). The commentary makes clear that the\r\nnew 2-level reduction in §2D1.11 applies regardless of the offense of conviction, and\r\nthat the minimum offense level of 17 in subsection (b) of §5C1.2 (Limitation on Ap-\r\nplicability of Statutory Minimum Sentences in Certain Cases) does not apply. Section\r\n5C1.2(b) provides for an offense level not less than level 17 for defendants who meet\r\nthe criteria of subdivisions (1) – (5) of section (a) in §5C1.2 and for whom the statutorily\r\nrequired minimum sentence is at least 5 years. See USSG App. C, Amendment 624\r\n(effective November 1, 2001). Since none of the offenses referenced to §2D1.11 carries\r\nAmendment 764\r\na statutory mandatory minimum, the minimum offense level of 17 at §5C1.2(b) does\r\nnot affect application of the new 2-level reduction in §2D1.11.","EffectiveDate":"Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2012."},{"Id":764,"Title":"Amendment 764","Text":"The Commentary to §2L1.2 captioned “Application Notes” is amended in\r\nNote 1(B)(vii) by inserting before the period at the end the following: “, but only if the\r\nrevocation occurred before the defendant was deported or unlawfully remained in the\r\nUnited States”.","Reason":"REASON FOR AMENDMENT: This amendment responds to a circuit conflict over the ap-\r\nplication of the enhancements found at §2L1.2(b)(1)(A) and (B) to a defendant who was\r\nsentenced on two or more occasions for the same drug trafficking conviction (e.g., be-\r\ncause of a revocation of probation, parole, or supervised release), such that there was\r\na sentence imposed before the defendant’s deportation, then an additional sentence\r\nimposed after the deportation. The amendment resolves the conflict by amending the\r\ndefinition of “sentence imposed” in Application Note 1(B)(vii) to §2L1.2 (Unlawfully\r\nEntering or Remaining in the United States) to state that the length of the sentence\r\nimposed includes terms of imprisonment given upon revocation of probation, parole, or\r\nsupervised release, but “only if the revocation occurred before the defendant was de-\r\nported or unlawfully remained in the United States.”\r\nSection 2L1.2(b)(1) generally reflects the Commission’s determination that both the\r\nseriousness and the timing of the prior offense for which the defendant was deported\r\nare relevant to assessing the defendant’s culpability for the illegal reentry offense. A\r\ndefendant who was deported after a conviction for a felony drug trafficking offense\r\nreceives an enhancement under either prong (A) or (B) of subsection (b)(1), depending\r\non the length of the sentence imposed. If the sentence imposed was more than\r\n13 months, the defendant receives a 16-level enhancement to the base offense level\r\nunder prong (A). If the sentence imposed was 13 months or less, the defendant receives\r\na 12-level enhancement under prong (B). However, for defendants whose prior convic-\r\ntions are remote in time and thus do not receive criminal history points, these enhance-\r\nments are reduced to 12 levels and 8 levels, respectively.\r\nThe majority of circuits that have considered the meaning of “sentence imposed” in this\r\ncontext have held that the later, additional sentence imposed after deportation does\r\nnot lengthen the sentence imposed for purposes of the subsection (b)(1) enhancement.\r\nSee United States v. Bustillos-Pena, 612 F.3d 863 (5th Cir. 2010); United States v.\r\nLopez, 634 F.3d 948 (7th Cir. 2011); United States v. Rosales-Garcia, 667 F.3d 1348\r\n(10th Cir. 2012); United States v. Guzman-Bera, 216 F.3d 1019 (11th Cir. 2000). Under\r\nthe majority approach, if the sentence imposed was 13 months or less before the de-\r\nfendant was deported, and was only increased to more than 13 months after the de-\r\nportation, the defendant is not subject to the enhancement in prong (A) because the\r\n“sentence imposed” includes only the sentence imposed before the deportation. Under\r\nthis approach, such a defendant receives the enhancement in prong (B) instead.\r\nThe Second Circuit has reached the contrary conclusion, holding that defendants who\r\nhad their sentences increased to more than 13 months upon revocation after deporta-\r\nAmendment 765\r\n12 ║ Supplement to Appendix C (November 1, 2016)\r\ntion are subject to the enhancement in prong (A) because the “sentence imposed” in-\r\ncludes the additional revocation sentence imposed after deportation. See United States\r\nv. Compres-Paulino, 393 F.3d 116 (2d Cir. 2004).\r\nThe amendment adopts the approach taken by the majority of circuits, with the result\r\nthat the term of imprisonment imposed upon revocation counts toward the calculation\r\nof the offense level in §2L1.2 only if it was imposed before the defendant was deported\r\nor unlawfully remained in the United States. According to public comment and testi-\r\nmony received by the Commission, and as courts have observed, the circumstances\r\nunder which persons are found present in this country and have their probation, pa-\r\nrole, or supervised release revoked for a prior offense vary widely. See Bustillos-Pena,\r\n612 F.3d at 867–68 (describing differences among revocation proceedings). In some ju-\r\nrisdictions, the revocation is typically based on the offender’s illegal return, while in\r\nothers, the revocation is typically based on the offender’s committing an additional\r\ncrime. Furthermore, in some cases revocation proceedings commonly occur before the\r\noffender is sentenced on the illegal reentry offense, while in other cases the revocation\r\noccurs after the federal sentencing. See Rosales-Garcia, 667 F.3d at 1354 (observing\r\nthat considering post-deportation revocation sentences could result in disparities\r\nbased on the “happenstance” of whether that revocation occurred before or after the\r\nprosecution for the illegal reentry offense). Therefore, assessing the seriousness of the\r\nprior crime based on the sentence imposed before deportation should result in more\r\nconsistent application of the enhancements in §2L1.2(b)(1)(A) and (B) and promote\r\nuniformity in sentencing.","EffectiveDate":"Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2012."},{"Id":765,"Title":"Amendment 765","Text":"Section 2L2.2 is amended in subsection (b) by adding at the end the fol-\r\nlowing:\r\n“(4) (Apply the Greater):\r\n(A) If the defendant committed any part of the instant offense to conceal\r\nthe defendant’s membership in, or authority over, a military, paramil-\r\nitary, or police organization that was involved in a serious human\r\nrights offense during the period in which the defendant was such a\r\nmember or had such authority, increase by 2 levels.

See generally 28 U.S.C. § 509B(e).\r\nSerious human rights offenses generally have a statutory maximum term of\r\nimprisonment of 20 years, but if death resulted, a higher statutory maximum term of\r\nimprisonment of any term of years or life applies. See 18 U.S.C. §§ 1091(b), 2340A(a),\r\n2442(b). For the offense of war crimes, a statutory maximum term of imprisonment of\r\nany term of years or life always applies. See 18 U.S.C. § 2441(a). For the offense of\r\nincitement to genocide, the statutory maximum term of imprisonment is five years.\r\nSee 18 U.S.C. § 1091(c).”.\r\nAmendment 765\r\n14 ║ Supplement to Appendix C (November 1, 2016)\r\nAppendix A (Statutory Index) is amended by inserting after the line referenced to\r\n18 U.S.C. § 2425 the following:\r\n“18 U.S.C. § 2441 2X5.1”.","Reason":"REASON FOR AMENDMENT: This amendment results from the Commission’s multi-year\r\nreview to ensure that the guidelines provide appropriate guidelines penalties for cases\r\ninvolving human rights violations. This amendment addresses human rights violators\r\nin two areas: defendants who are convicted of a human rights offense, and defendants\r\nwho are convicted of immigration or naturalization fraud to conceal the defendant’s\r\ninvolvement, or possible involvement, in a human rights offense.\r\nSerious Human Rights Offenses\r\nFirst, the amendment addresses defendants whose instant offense of conviction is a\r\n“serious human rights offense.” In the Human Rights Enforcement Act of 2009, Pub.\r\nL. 111–122 (Dec. 22, 2009), Congress defined “serious human rights offenses” as “vio-\r\nlations of Federal criminal laws relating to genocide, torture, war crimes, and the use\r\nor recruitment of child soldiers under sections 1091, 2340, 2340A, 2441, and 2442 of\r\ntitle 18, United States Code.” In that legislation, Congress authorized a new section\r\nwithin the Department of Justice “with responsibility for the enforcement of laws\r\nagainst suspected participants in [such] offenses.” That section was established the\r\nfollowing year, when the Human Rights and Special Prosecutions Section was created\r\nin the Justice Department’s Criminal Division. Serious human rights offenses gener-\r\nally have a statutory maximum term of imprisonment of 20 years, but if death resulted,\r\na higher statutory maximum term of imprisonment of any term of years or life applies.\r\nSee 18 U.S.C. §§ 1091(b), 2340A(a), 2442(b). For the offense of war crimes, a statutory\r\nmaximum term of imprisonment of any term of years or life always applies.\r\nSee 18 U.S.C. § 2441(a). For the offense of incitement to genocide, the statutory maxi-\r\nmum term of imprisonment is five years. See 18 U.S.C. § 1091(c).\r\nSerious human rights offenses can be committed in a variety of ways, including, for\r\nexample, assault, kidnapping, and murder. As a result, the guidelines generally have\r\naddressed these offenses by referencing them to a number of different Chapter Two\r\noffense guidelines, such as §§2A1.1 (First Degree Murder), 2A1.2 (Second Degree Mur-\r\nder), 2A2.1 (Assault with Intent to Commit Murder; Attempted Murder), 2A2.2 (Ag-\r\ngravated Assault) and 2A4.1 (Kidnapping, Abduction, Unlawful Restraint). In addi-\r\ntion, certain of these Chapter Two offense guidelines use as a base offense level the\r\noffense level from another guideline applicable to the underlying conduct (e.g., §2H1.1\r\n(Offenses Involving Individual Rights), which is the guideline to which genocide of-\r\nfenses are referenced). The offense of committing a war crime in violation of 18 U.S.C.\r\n§ 2441, however, has not been referenced to any guideline prior to this amendment.\r\nThe amendment amends Appendix A (Statutory Index) to reference these offenses to\r\n§2X5.1 (Other Felony Offenses). Section 2X5.1 addresses the variety of ways in which\r\na war crimes offense may be committed by generally directing the court to apply the\r\nmost analogous offense guideline.\r\nThe amendment also establishes a new Chapter Three adjustment at §3A1.5 (Serious\r\nHuman Rights Offense) if the defendant was convicted of a serious human rights of-\r\nfense. The new guideline provides two tiers of adjustments, corresponding to the dif-\r\nfering statutory penalties that apply to such offenses. The adjustment generally pro-\r\nvides a 4-level increase if the defendant was convicted of a serious human rights of-\r\nAmendment 766\r\nfense, and a minimum offense level of 37 if death resulted. If the defendant was con-\r\nvicted of an offense under 18 U.S.C. § 1091(c) for inciting genocide, however, the ad-\r\njustment provides a 2-level increase in light of the lesser statutory maximum penalty\r\nsuch offenses carry compared to the other offenses covered by this adjustment.\r\nThe new Chapter Three adjustment accounts for the particularly egregious nature of\r\nserious human rights offenses while generally maintaining the proportionality pro-\r\nvided by the various Chapter Two guidelines that cover such offenses.\r\nImmigration Fraud\r\nSecond, the amendment addresses cases in which the offense of conviction is for immi-\r\ngration or naturalization fraud and the defendant committed any part of the instant\r\noffense to conceal the defendant’s involvement, or possible involvement, in a serious\r\nhuman rights offense. These offenders are sentenced under §2L2.2 (Fraudulently Ac-\r\nquiring Documents Relating to Naturalization, Citizenship, or Legal Resident Status\r\nfor Own Use; False Personation or Fraudulent Marriage by Alien to Evade Immigra-\r\ntion Law; Fraudulently Acquiring or Improperly Using a United States Passport). The\r\noffenders covered by this amendment fall into two categories. In the first category are\r\ndefendants who concealed their connection to a military, paramilitary, or police organ-\r\nization that was involved in a serious human rights offense. In the second category are\r\ndefendants who concealed having participated in a serious human rights offense.\r\nThe amendment adds a new specific offense characteristic to §2L2.2 at subsection (b)(4)\r\nthat contains two subparagraphs. Subparagraph (A) applies if the defendant commit-\r\nted any part of the instant offense to conceal the defendant’s membership in, or au-\r\nthority over, a military, paramilitary, or police organization that was involved in a\r\nserious human rights offense during the period in which the defendant was such a\r\nmember or had such authority, and provides a 2-level increase and a minimum offense\r\nlevel of 13. Subparagraph (B) applies if the defendant committed any part of the in-\r\nstant offense to conceal the defendant’s participation in a serious human rights offense,\r\nand provides a 6-level increase if the offense was incitement to genocide, or a 10-level\r\nincrease and minimum offense level of 25 if the offense was any other serious human\r\nrights offense. The amendment also adds an application note defining the terms “seri-\r\nous human rights offense” and “the offense of incitement to genocide.”\r\nThe new enhancement reflects the impact that such immigration fraud offenses can\r\nhave on the ability of immigration and naturalization authorities to make fully in-\r\nformed decisions regarding the defendant’s immigration petition, application or other\r\nrequest and is intended to ensure that the United States is not a safe haven for those\r\nwho have committed serious human rights offenses.","EffectiveDate":"Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2012."},{"Id":766,"Title":"Amendment 766","Text":"The Commentary to §4A1.2 captioned “Application Notes” is amended in\r\nNote 5 by striking “counted.

Paragraphs (1) and (2) of §4A1.2(c) do not apply.”.\r\nAmendment 766\r\n16 ║ Supplement to Appendix C (November 1, 2016)","Reason":"REASON FOR AMENDMENT: This amendment resolves differences among circuits regard-\r\ning when prior sentences for the misdemeanor offenses of driving while intoxicated\r\nand driving under the influence (and any similar offenses by whatever name they are\r\nknown) are counted toward the defendant’s criminal history score.\r\nConvictions for driving while intoxicated and similar offenses encompass a range of\r\noffense conduct. For example, convictions for driving while intoxicated and similar of-\r\nfenses can be classified as anything from traffic infractions to misdemeanors and felo-\r\nnies, and they are subject to a broad spectrum of penalties (ranging from a fine to years\r\nin custody for habitual offenders). When the prior offense is a felony, the sentence\r\nclearly counts toward the defendant’s criminal history score because “[s]entences for\r\nall felony offenses are counted.” See subsection (c) of §4A1.2 (Definitions and Instruc-\r\ntions for Computing Criminal History). However, when the prior sentence is for a mis-\r\ndemeanor or petty offense, circuits have taken different approaches, in part because of\r\nlanguage added to §4A1.2(c)(1). See USSG App. C, Amendment 352 (effective Novem-\r\nber 1, 1990) (adding “careless or reckless driving” to the offenses listed in §4A1.2(c)(1)).\r\nWhen the prior sentence is a misdemeanor or petty offense, §4A1.2(c) specifies that the\r\noffense is counted, but with two exceptions, limited to cases in which the prior offense\r\nis on (or similar to an offense that is on) either of two lists. On the first list are offenses\r\nfrom “careless or reckless driving” to “trespassing.” In such a case, the sentence is\r\ncounted only if (A) the sentence was a term of probation of more than one year or a\r\nterm of imprisonment of at least 30 days, or (B) the prior offense was similar to the\r\ninstant offense. See §4A1.2(c)(1). On the second list are offenses from “fish and game\r\nviolations” to “vagrancy.” In such a case, the sentence is never counted.\r\nSee §4A1.2(c)(2).\r\nMost circuits have held that driving while intoxicated convictions, including misde-\r\nmeanors and petty offenses, always count toward the criminal history score, without\r\nexception, even if the offense met the criteria for either of the two lists. These circuits\r\nhave relied on Application Note 5 to §4A1.2, which has provided:\r\nSentences for Driving While Intoxicated or Under the Influence.—Con-\r\nvictions for driving while intoxicated or under the influence (and simi-\r\nlar offenses by whatever name they are known) are counted. Such of-\r\nfenses are not minor traffic infractions within the meaning of\r\n§4A1.2(c).\r\nSee United States v. Pando, 545 F.3d 682, 683–85 (8th Cir. 2008) (holding that a con-\r\nviction for driving while ability impaired was properly included in defendant’s criminal\r\nhistory, and rejecting defendant’s argument that his offense was similar to careless or\r\nreckless driving); United States v. Thornton, 444 F.3d 1163, 1165–67 (9th Cir. 2006)\r\n(holding that driving with high blood alcohol level was properly included in defendant’s\r\ncriminal history, and rejecting defendant’s argument that his conviction was “similar”\r\nto minor traffic infraction or public intoxication). See also United States v. LeBlanc,\r\n45 F.3d 192, 195 (7th Cir. 1995) (“[A]pplication note [5] reflects the Sentencing Com-\r\nmission’s conclusion ‘that driving while intoxicated offenses are of sufficient gravity to\r\nmerit inclusion in the defendant’s criminal history, however they might be classified\r\nunder state law.’ ”); United States v. Deigert, 916 F.2d 916, 918 (4th Cir. 1990) (holding\r\nthat defendant’s alcohol-related traffic offenses are counted under Application Note 5).\r\nThe Second Circuit took a different approach in United States v. Potes-Castillo,\r\n638 F.3d 106 (2d Cir. 2011), holding that Application Note 5 could be read either (1) to\r\n“mean that, like felonies, driving while ability impaired sentences are always counted,\r\nAmendment 767\r\nwithout possibility of exception” or (2) “as setting forth the direction that driving while\r\nability impaired sentences must not be treated as minor traffic infractions or local or-\r\ndinance violations and excluded under section 4A1.2(c)(2).” Id. at 110–11. The Second\r\nCircuit adopted the second reading and, accordingly, held that a prior sentence for\r\ndriving while ability impaired “should be treated like any other misdemeanor or petty\r\noffense, except that they cannot be exempted under section 4A1.2(c)(2).” Id. at 113.\r\nAccording to the Second Circuit, such a sentence can qualify for an exception, and\r\ntherefore not be counted, under the first list (e.g., if it was similar to “careless or reck-\r\nless driving” and the other criteria for a first-list exception were met).\r\nThe amendment resolves the issue by amending Application Note 5 to clarify that con-\r\nvictions for driving while intoxicated and similar offenses are always counted, without\r\nregard to how the offenses are classified. Further, the amendment states plainly that\r\nparagraphs (1) and (2) of §4A1.2(c) do not apply.\r\nThis amendment reflects the Commission’s view that convictions for driving while in-\r\ntoxicated and other similar offenses are sufficiently serious to always count toward a\r\ndefendant’s criminal history score. The amendment clarifies the Commission’s intent\r\nand should result in more consistent calculation of criminal history scores among the\r\ncircuits.","EffectiveDate":"Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2012."},{"Id":767,"Title":"Amendment 767","Text":"Section 5G1.2 is amended in subsection (b) by striking “Except as other-\r\nwise required by law (see §5G1.1(a), (b)), the sentence imposed on each other count\r\nshall be the total punishment as determined in accordance with Part D of Chapter\r\nThree, and Part C of this Chapter.” and inserting “For all counts not covered by sub-\r\nsection (a), the court shall determine the total punishment and shall impose that total\r\npunishment on each such count, except to the extent otherwise required by law.”.\r\nThe Commentary to §5G1.2 captioned “Application Notes” is amended in Note 1, in the\r\nfirst paragraph, by inserting before the period at the end of the first sentence the fol-\r\nlowing: “and determining the defendant’s guideline range on the Sentencing Table in\r\nChapter Five, Part A (Sentencing Table)”; and\r\nafter the first paragraph, by inserting the following new paragraph:\r\n“Note that the defendant’s guideline range on the Sentencing Table may be affected or\r\nrestricted by a statutorily authorized maximum sentence or a statutorily required min-\r\nimum sentence not only in a single-count case, see §5G1.1 (Sentencing on a Single\r\nCount of Conviction), but also in a multiple-count case.

Counts 1, 3, and 4 have statutory maximums of 10 years,\r\n20 years, and 2 years, respectively. Count 2 has a statutory maximum\r\nof 30 years and a mandatory minimum of 10 years.\r\nFor Defendant A, the court determines that the final offense level is 19\r\nand the defendant is in Criminal History Category I, which yields a\r\nguideline range on the Sentencing Table of 30 to 37 months. Because\r\nof the 10-year mandatory minimum on Count 2, however, Defendant\r\nA’s guideline sentence is 120 months. See subparagraph (B), above. Af-\r\nter considering that guideline sentence, the court determines that the\r\nappropriate ‘total punishment’ to be imposed on Defendant A is\r\n120 months. Therefore, subsection (b) requires that the total punish-\r\nment of 120 months be imposed on each of Counts 1, 2, and 3. The sen-\r\ntence imposed on Count 4 is limited to 24 months, because a statutory\r\nmaximum of 2 years applies to that particular count.\r\nFor Defendant B, in contrast, the court determines that the final of-\r\nfense level is 30 and the defendant is in Criminal History Category II,\r\nwhich yields a guideline range on the Sentencing Table of 108 to\r\n135 months. Because of the 10-year mandatory minimum on Count 2,\r\nhowever, Defendant B’s guideline range is restricted to 120 to\r\n135 months. See subparagraph (B), above. After considering that re-\r\nstricted guideline range, the court determines that the appropriate ‘to-\r\nAmendment 767\r\ntal punishment’ to be imposed on Defendant B is 130 months. There-\r\nfore, subsection (b) requires that the total punishment of 130 months\r\nbe imposed on each of Counts 2 and 3. The sentences imposed on\r\nCounts 1 and 4 are limited to 120 months (10 years) and 24 months\r\n(2 years), respectively, because of the applicable statutory maximums.\r\n(D) Special Rule on Resentencing.—In a case in which (i) the defendant’s\r\nguideline range on the Sentencing Table was affected or restricted by\r\na statutorily required minimum sentence (as described in subpara-\r\ngraph (B)), (ii) the court is resentencing the defendant, and (iii) the\r\nstatutorily required minimum sentence no longer applies, the defend-\r\nant’s guideline range for purposes of the remaining counts shall be re-\r\ndetermined without regard to the previous effect or restriction of the\r\nstatutorily required minimum sentence.”.","Reason":"REASON FOR AMENDMENT: This amendment responds to an application issue regarding\r\nthe applicable guideline range in a case in which the defendant is sentenced on multi-\r\nple counts of conviction, at least one of which involves a mandatory minimum sentence\r\nthat is greater than the minimum of the otherwise applicable guideline range. The\r\nissue arises under §5G1.2 (Sentencing on Multiple Counts of Conviction) when at least\r\none count in a multiple-count case involves a mandatory minimum sentence that af-\r\nfects the otherwise applicable guideline range. In such cases, circuits differ over\r\nwhether the guideline range is affected only for the count involving the mandatory\r\nminimum or for all counts in the case.\r\nThe Fifth Circuit has held that, in such a case, the effect on the guideline range applies\r\nto all counts in the case. See United States v. Salter, 241 F.3d 392, 395–96 (5th Cir.\r\n2001). In that case, the guideline range on the Sentencing Table was 87 to 108 months,\r\nbut one of the three counts carried a mandatory minimum sentence of 10 years\r\n(120 months), which resulted in a guideline sentence of 120 months. The Fifth Circuit\r\ninstructed the district court that the appropriate guideline sentence was 120 months\r\non each of the three counts.\r\nThe Ninth Circuit took a different approach in United States v. Evans-Martinez,\r\n611 F.3d 635 (9th Cir. 2010), holding that, in such a case, “a mandatory minimum\r\nsentence becomes the starting point for any count that carries a mandatory minimum\r\nsentence higher than what would otherwise be the Guidelines sentencing range,” but\r\n“[a]ll other counts . . . are sentenced based on the Guidelines sentencing range, regard-\r\nless [of] the mandatory minimum sentences that apply to other counts.” See id. at 637.\r\nThe Ninth Circuit stated that it would be more “logical” to follow the Fifth Circuit’s\r\napproach but “such logic is overcome by the precise language of the Sentencing Guide-\r\nlines.” See id.\r\nThe District of Columbia Circuit appears to follow an approach similar to the Ninth\r\nCircuit. See United States v. Kennedy, 133 F.3d 53, 60–61 (D.C. Cir. 1998) (one of two\r\ncounts carried a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment; district court treated life\r\nimprisonment as the guidelines sentence for both counts; Court of Appeals reversed,\r\nholding that the appropriate guidelines range for the other count was 262 to\r\n327 months).\r\nThe amendment adopts the approach followed by the Fifth Circuit and makes three\r\nchanges to §5G1.2. First, it amends §5G1.2(b) to clarify that the court is to determine\r\nthe total punishment and impose that total punishment on each count, except to the\r\nextent otherwise required by law.\r\nAmendment 768\r\n20 ║ Supplement to Appendix C (November 1, 2016)\r\nSecond, it amends the Commentary to clarify that the defendant’s guideline range in\r\na multiple-count case may be restricted by a mandatory minimum penalty or statutory\r\nmaximum penalty (i.e., a mandatory minimum may increase the bottom of the other-\r\nwise applicable guideline range and a statutory maximum may decrease the top of the\r\notherwise applicable guideline range) in a manner similar to how the guideline range\r\nin a single-count case may be restricted by a minimum or maximum penalty under\r\n§5G1.1 (Sentencing on a Single Count of Conviction). Specifically, it clarifies that when\r\nany count involves a mandatory minimum that restricts the defendant’s guideline\r\nrange, the guideline range is restricted as to all counts. It also provides examples of\r\nhow these restrictions operate.\r\nThird, it amends the commentary to clarify that in a case in which (1) a defendant’s\r\nguideline range was affected or restricted by a mandatory minimum penalty, (2) the\r\ncourt is resentencing the defendant, and (3) the mandatory minimum sentence no\r\nlonger applies, the court shall redetermine the defendant’s guideline range for pur-\r\nposes of the remaining counts without regard to the mandatory minimum penalty.\r\nThese changes resolve the application issue by clarifying the manner in which the\r\nCommission intended this guideline to operate, and by providing examples similar to\r\nthose used in training probation officers and judges. When there is only one count, the\r\nguidelines provide a single guideline range, and that range may be restricted if a man-\r\ndatory minimum is involved, as described in §5G1.1 (Sentencing on a Single Count of\r\nConviction). When there is more than one count, the guidelines also provide a single\r\nguideline range, and that range also may be restricted if a mandatory minimum is\r\ninvolved. These changes provide clarity and consistency for cases in which a manda-\r\ntory minimum is present and are intended to ensure that sentencing courts resolve\r\nmultiple-count cases in a straightforward, logical manner, with a single guideline\r\nrange, a single set of findings and reasons, and a single set of departure and variance\r\nconsiderations.","EffectiveDate":"Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2012."},{"Id":768,"Title":"Amendment 768","Text":"Chapter Five, Part K, Subpart 2 is amended by striking §5K2.19 and its\r\naccompanying commentary as follows:\r\n“§5K2.19.

L.\r\n111–225 (enacted August 10, 2010), which amended 18 U.S.C. § 1791 (Providing or\r\npossessing contraband in prison) to make it a class A misdemeanor to provide a mobile\r\nphone or similar device to an inmate, or for an inmate to possess a mobile phone or\r\nsimilar device. Offenses under section 1791 are referenced in Appendix A (Statutory\r\nIndex) to §2P1.2 (Providing or Possessing Contraband in Prison). The penalty struc-\r\nture of section 1791 is based on the type of contraband involved, and the other class A\r\nmisdemeanors in section 1791 receive a base offense level of 6 in §2P1.2. Under the\r\namendment, the class A misdemeanor in section 1791 that applies when the contra-\r\nband is a cell phone will also receive a base offense level of 6 in §2P1.2. This change\r\nmaintains the relationship between the penalty structures of the statute and the\r\nguideline.\r\nPrevent All Cigarette Trafficking Act of 2009\r\nSecond, the amendment responds to the Prevent All Cigarette Trafficking Act of 2009\r\n(PACT Act), Pub. L. 111–154 (enacted March 31, 2010). The PACT Act made a series\r\nof revisions to the Jenkins Act, 15 U.S.C. § 375 et seq., which is one of several laws\r\ngoverning the sale, shipment and taxation of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco.\r\nThe PACT Act raised the criminal penalty at 15 U.S.C. § 377 for a knowing violation\r\nof the Jenkins Act from a misdemeanor to a felony with a statutory maximum term of\r\nimprisonment of 3 years. The amendment amends Appendix A (Statutory Index) to\r\nreference section 377 offenses to §2T2.1 (Non-Payment of Taxes) and §2T2.2 (Regula-\r\ntory Offenses). These two guidelines are the most analogous guidelines for a sec-\r\ntion 377 offense because the offense may involve either non-payment of taxes or regu-\r\nlatory offenses. Accordingly, the amendment also amends the Commentary to §§2T2.1\r\nAmendment 769\r\nand 2T2.2 to add section 377 to their lists of statutory provisions. These lists indicate\r\nthat §2T2.1 applies if the conduct constitutes non-payment, evasion, or attempted eva-\r\nsion of taxes, and §2T2.2 applies if the conduct is tantamount to a record-keeping vio-\r\nlation rather than an effort to evade payment of taxes.\r\nThe PACT Act also created a new class A misdemeanor at 18 U.S.C. § 1716E, prohib-\r\niting the knowing shipment of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco through the United\r\nStates mail. The amendment amends Appendix A (Statutory Index) to reference sec-\r\ntion 1716E offenses to §2T2.2. Section 2T2.2 is the most analogous guideline because\r\noffenses under section 1716E are regulatory offenses.\r\nAnimal Crush Video Prohibition Act of 2010\r\nThird, the amendment responds to the Animal Crush Video Prohibition Act of 2010,\r\nPub. L. 111–294 (enacted December 9, 2010), which substantially revised the criminal\r\noffense at 18 U.S.C. § 48 (Animal crush videos). Section 48 makes it a crime to create\r\nor distribute an “animal crush video,” which is defined by the statute in a manner that\r\nrequires, among other things, that the depiction be obscene. The maximum term of\r\nimprisonment for a section 48 offense is 7 years. The amendment amends Appendix A\r\n(Statutory Index) to reference section 48 offenses to §2G3.1 (Importing, Mailing, or\r\nTransporting Obscene Matter; Transferring Obscene Matter to a Minor; Misleading\r\nDomain Names). Section 2G3.1 is the most analogous guideline because obscenity is\r\nan element of section 48 offenses.\r\nIndian Arts and Crafts Amendments Act of 2010\r\nFourth, the amendment responds to the Indian Arts and Crafts Amendments Act of\r\n2010, Pub. L. 111–211 (enacted July 29, 2010), which amended the criminal offense at\r\n18 U.S.C. § 1159 (Misrepresentation of Indian produced goods and services) to reduce\r\npenalties for first offenders when the value of the goods involved is less than $1,000.\r\nThe maximum term of imprisonment under section 1159 had been 5 years for a first\r\noffender and 15 years for a repeat offender. The Act retained this penalty structure,\r\nexcept that the statutory maximum term of imprisonment for a first offender was re-\r\nduced to 1 year in a case in which the value of the goods involved is less than $1,000.\r\nThe amendment amends Appendix A (Statutory Index) to reference section 1159 of-\r\nfenses to §2B1.1 (Theft, Property Destruction, and Fraud). Section 2B1.1 is the most\r\nanalogous guideline because an offense under section 1159 has elements of fraud and\r\ndeceit.\r\nThe amendment also addresses an existing offense, 18 U.S.C. § 1158 (Counterfeiting\r\nIndian Arts and Crafts Board trade mark), which makes it a crime to counterfeit or\r\nunlawfully affix a Government trademark used or devised by the Indian Arts and\r\nCrafts Board or to make any false statement for the purpose of obtaining the use of\r\nany such mark. The maximum term of imprisonment under section 1158 is 5 years for\r\na first offender and 15 years for a repeat offender. The amendment amends Appendix A\r\n(Statutory Index) to reference section 1158 offenses to both §§2B1.1 and 2B5.3 (Crim-\r\ninal Infringement of Copyright or Trademark). These two guidelines are the most anal-\r\nogous guidelines because an offense under section 1158 contains alternative sets of\r\nelements, one of which involves trademark infringement and one of which involves\r\nfalse statements.\r\nAmendment 770\r\n24 ║ Supplement to Appendix C (November 1, 2016)\r\nPublic Contracting Offenses\r\nFinally, the amendment responds to Public Law 111–350 (enacted January 4, 2011),\r\nwhich enacted certain laws relating to public contracts as a new positive-law title of\r\nthe Code — title 41, “Public Contracts.” As part of this codification, two criminal of-\r\nfenses, 41 U.S.C. §§ 53 and 423(a)–(b), and their respective penalty provisions,\r\n41 U.S.C. §§ 54 and 423(e), were given new title 41 section numbers: sections 8702 and\r\n8707 for sections 53 and 54, respectively, and sections 2102 and 2105 for sec-\r\ntions 423(a)–(b) and 423(e), respectively. The substantive offenses and their related\r\npenalties did not change. The amendment makes changes to Appendix A (Statutory\r\nIndex) to reflect the renumbering and includes a reference for the new section 2102,\r\nwhose predecessor section 423(a)–(b) was not referenced in Appendix A. The changes\r\nare technical.","EffectiveDate":"Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2012."},{"Id":770,"Title":"Amendment 770","Text":"The Commentary to §1B1.10 captioned “Application Notes” is amended\r\nin Note 4 by striking “Application Note 10 to §2D1.1” and inserting “the Drug Equiva-\r\nlency Tables in the Commentary to §2D1.1 (see §2D1.1, comment.

The\r\ncombined length of the sentences (‘total punishment’) is determined by the\r\ncourt after determining the adjusted combined offense level and the Criminal\r\nHistory Category and determining the defendant’s guideline range on the Sen-\r\ntencing Table in Chapter Five, Part A (Sentencing Table).\r\nNote that the defendant’s guideline range on the Sentencing Table may be af-\r\nfected or restricted by a statutorily authorized maximum sentence or a statu-\r\ntorily required minimum sentence not only in a single-count case, see §5G1.1\r\n(Sentencing on a Single Count of Conviction), but also in a multiple-count case.\r\nSee Note 3, below.\r\nExcept as otherwise required by subsection (e) or any other law, the total pun-\r\nishment is to be imposed on each count and the sentences on all counts are to\r\nbe imposed to run concurrently to the extent allowed by the statutory maxi-\r\nmum sentence of imprisonment for each count of conviction.\r\nThis section applies to multiple counts of conviction (A) contained in the same\r\nindictment or information, or (B) contained in different indictments or infor-\r\nmations for which sentences are to be imposed at the same time or in a consol-\r\nidated proceeding.\r\nUsually, at least one of the counts will have a statutory maximum adequate to\r\npermit imposition of the total punishment as the sentence on that count. The\r\nsentence on each of the other counts will then be set at the lesser of the total\r\npunishment and the applicable statutory maximum, and be made to run con-\r\ncurrently with all or part of the longest sentence.

The amendment also makes stylistic changes to the Commentary\r\nto §2D1.11 by adding headings to certain application notes.\r\n(2) Amendment 767 made revisions to §5G1.2 (Sentencing on Multiple Counts of\r\nConviction), including a revision to Application Note 1.

L. 112–269 (enacted Jan-\r\nuary 14, 2013), which contains a directive to the Commission regarding offenses in-\r\nvolving stolen trade secrets or economic espionage.\r\nSection 3(a) of the Act directs the Commission to “review and, if appropriate, amend”\r\nthe guidelines “applicable to persons convicted of offenses relating to the transmission\r\nor attempted transmission of a stolen trade secret outside of the United States or eco-\r\nnomic espionage, in order to reflect the intent of Congress that penalties for such of-\r\nfenses under the Federal sentencing guidelines and policy statements appropriately\r\nreflect the seriousness of these offenses, account for the potential and actual harm\r\ncaused by these offenses, and provide adequate deterrence against such offenses.” Sec-\r\ntion 3(b) of the Act states that, in carrying out the directive, the Commission shall\r\nconsider, among other things, whether the guidelines adequately address the simple\r\nmisappropriation of a trade secret; the transmission or attempted transmission of a\r\nstolen trade secret outside of the United States; and the transmission or attempted\r\ntransmission of a stolen trade secret outside of the United States that is committed or\r\nattempted to be committed for the benefit of a foreign government, foreign instrumen-\r\ntality, or foreign agent.\r\nAmendment 771\r\nThe offenses described in the directive may be prosecuted under 18 U.S.C. § 1831 (Eco-\r\nnomic espionage), which requires that the defendant specifically intend or know that\r\nthe offense “will benefit any foreign government, foreign instrumentality, or foreign\r\nagent,” and 18 U.S.C. § 1832 (Theft of trade secrets), which does not require such spe-\r\ncific intent or knowledge. The statutory maximum terms of imprisonment are 15 years\r\nfor a section 1831 offense and 10 years for a section 1832 offense. Both offenses are\r\nreferenced in Appendix A (Statutory Index) to §2B1.1 (Theft, Property Destruction,\r\nand Fraud).\r\nIn response to the directive, the amendment revises the existing specific offense char-\r\nacteristic at §2B1.1(b)(5), which provides an enhancement of two levels “[i]f the offense\r\ninvolved misappropriation of a trade secret and the defendant knew or intended that\r\nthe offense would benefit a foreign government, foreign instrumentality, or foreign\r\nagent,” in two ways. First, it broadens the scope of the enhancement to provide a 2-\r\nlevel increase for trade secret offenses in which the defendant knew or intended that\r\nthe trade secret would be transported or transmitted out of the United States. Second,\r\nit increases the severity of the enhancement to provide a 4-level enhancement and a\r\nminimum offense level of 14 for trade secret offenses in which the defendant knew or\r\nintended that the offense would benefit a foreign government, foreign instrumentality,\r\nor foreign agent. The enhancement also is redesignated as subsection (b)(13).\r\nIn responding to the directive, the Commission consulted with individuals or groups\r\nrepresenting law enforcement, owners of trade secrets, victims of economic espionage\r\noffenses, the United States Department of Justice, the United States Department of\r\nHomeland Security, the United States Department of State, the Office of the United\r\nStates Trade Representative, the Federal Public and Community Defenders, and\r\nstanding advisory groups, among others. The Commission also considered relevant\r\ndata and literature.\r\nThe Commission received public comment and testimony that the transmission of sto-\r\nlen trade secrets outside of the United States creates significant obstacles to effective\r\ninvestigation and prosecution and causes both increased harm to victims and more\r\ngeneral harms to the nation. With respect to the victim, civil remedies may not be\r\nreadily available or effective, and the transmission of a stolen trade secret outside of\r\nthe United States substantially increases the risk that the trade secret will be ex-\r\nploited by a foreign competitor. In contrast, the simple movement of a stolen trade\r\nsecret within a domestic multinational company (e.g., from a United States office to an\r\noverseas office of the same company) may not pose the same risks or harms. More\r\ngenerally, the Commission heard that foreign actors increasingly target United States\r\ncompanies for trade secret theft and that such offenses pose a growing threat to the\r\nnation’s global competitiveness, economic growth, and national security. Accordingly,\r\nthe Commission determined that a 2-level enhancement is warranted for cases in\r\nwhich the defendant knew or intended that a stolen trade secret would be transported\r\nor transmitted outside of the United States.\r\nThe Commission also received public comment and testimony that cases involving eco-\r\nnomic espionage (i.e., trade secret offenses that benefit foreign governments or entities\r\nunder the substantial control of foreign governments) are particularly serious. In such\r\ncases, the United States is unlikely to obtain a foreign government’s cooperation when\r\nseeking relief for the victim, and offenders backed by a foreign government likely will\r\nhave significant financial resources to combat civil remedies. In addition, a foreign\r\ngovernment’s involvement increases the threat to the nation’s economic and national\r\nsecurity. Accordingly, the Commission determined that the existing enhancement for\r\nAmendment 772\r\n32 ║ Supplement to Appendix C (November 1, 2016)\r\neconomic espionage should be increased from 2 to 4 levels and that such offenses\r\nshould be subject to a minimum offense level of 14. This heightened enhancement is\r\nconsistent with the higher statutory maximum penalties and fines applicable to such\r\noffenses and the Commission’s established treatment of economic espionage as a more\r\nserious form of trade secret theft.\r\nConsistent with the directive, the Commission also considered whether the guidelines\r\nappropriately account for the simple misappropriation of a trade secret. The Commis-\r\nsion determined that such offenses are adequately accounted for by existing provisions\r\nin the Guidelines Manual, such as the loss table in §2B1.1(b)(1), the sophisticated\r\nmeans enhancement at §2B1.1(b)(10), and the adjustment for abuse of position of trust\r\nor use of special skill at §3B1.3.","EffectiveDate":"Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2013."},{"Id":772,"Title":"Amendment 772","Text":"Section 2B1.1 is amended by inserting before paragraph (9) the following\r\nnew paragraph:\r\n“(8) (Apply the greater) If—\r\n(A) the offense involved conduct described in 18 U.S.C. § 670, increase by\r\n2 levels; or\r\n(B) the offense involved conduct described in 18 U.S.C. § 670, and the de-\r\nfendant was employed by, or was an agent of, an organization in the\r\nsupply chain for the pre-retail medical product, increase by 4 levels.”;\r\nThe Commentary to §2B1.1 captioned “Application Notes” is amended in Note 1 by\r\ninserting after the paragraph that begins “ ‘Personal information’ means” the follow-\r\ning:\r\n“ ‘Pre-retail medical product’ has the meaning given that term in 18 U.S.C. § 670(e).”;\r\nand by inserting after the paragraph that begins “ ‘Publicly traded company’ means”\r\nthe following:\r\n“ ‘Supply chain’ has the meaning given that term in 18 U.S.C. § 670(e).”;\r\nin Note 3(F)(i) by striking “Note 9(A)” and inserting “Note 10(A)”; and\r\nby renumbering Notes 7 through 19 as 8 through 20; by inserting after Note 6 the\r\nfollowing:\r\n“7.

If the offense is an “aggravated offense,” however, higher statutory maximum\r\nterms of imprisonment are provided. The offense is an “aggravated offense” if—\r\n(1) the defendant is employed by, or is an agent of, an or-\r\nganization in the supply chain for the pre-retail medi-\r\ncal product; or\r\n(2) the violation—\r\n(A) involves the use of violence, force, or a threat of\r\nviolence or force;\r\n(B) involves the use of a deadly weapon;\r\n(C) results in serious bodily injury or death, includ-\r\ning serious bodily injury or death resulting\r\nfrom the use of the medical product involved; or\r\n(D) is subsequent to a prior conviction for an of-\r\nfense under section 670.\r\nSpecifically, the higher statutory maximum terms of imprisonment are:\r\n(1) Five years, if—\r\n(A) the defendant is employed by, or is an agent of,\r\nan organization in the supply chain for the pre-\r\nretail medical product; or\r\n(B) the violation (i) involves the use of violence,\r\nforce, or a threat of violence or force, (ii) in-\r\nvolves the use of a deadly weapon, or (iii) is sub-\r\nsequent to a prior conviction for an offense un-\r\nder section 670.\r\n(2) 15 years, if the value of the medical products involved\r\nin the offense is $5,000 or greater.\r\n(3) 20 years, if both (1) and (2) apply.\r\n(4) 30 years, if the offense results in serious bodily injury\r\nor death, including serious bodily injury or death re-\r\nsulting from the use of the medical product involved.\r\nThe amendment amends Appendix A (Statutory Index) to reference the new offense at\r\n18 U.S.C. § 670 to §2B1.1 (Theft, Property Destruction, and Fraud). The Commission\r\nconcluded that §2B1.1 is the appropriate guideline because the elements of the new\r\noffense include theft or fraud.\r\nResponse to Directive\r\nSection 7 of the Act directs the Commission to “review and, if appropriate, amend” the\r\nfederal sentencing guidelines and policy statements applicable to the new offense and\r\nthe related offenses “to reflect the intent of Congress that penalties for such offenses\r\nAmendment 772\r\nbe sufficient to deter and punish such offenses, and appropriately account for the ac-\r\ntual harm to the public from these offenses.” The amendment amends §2B1.1 to ad-\r\ndress offenses involving pre-retail medical products in two ways.\r\nFirst, the amendment adds a new specific offense characteristic at §2B1.1(b)(8) that\r\nprovides a two-pronged enhancement with an instruction to apply the greater.\r\nProng (A) provides a 2-level enhancement if the offense involved conduct described in\r\n18 U.S.C. § 670. Prong (B) provides a 4-level enhancement if the offense involved con-\r\nduct described in 18 U.S.C. § 670 and the defendant was employed by, or an agent of,\r\nan organization in the supply chain for the pre-retail product. Accompanying this new\r\nspecific offense characteristic is new Commentary providing that, if prong (B) applies,\r\n“do not apply an adjustment under §3B1.3 (Abuse of Position of Trust or Use of Special\r\nSkill).”\r\nBased on public comment, testimony and sentencing data, the Commission concluded\r\nthat an enhancement differentiating fraud and theft offenses involving medical prod-\r\nucts from those involving other products is warranted by the additional risk such of-\r\nfenses pose to public health and safety. In addition, such offenses undermine the pub-\r\nlic’s confidence in the medical regulatory and distribution system. The Commission\r\nalso concluded that the risks and harms it identified would be present in any theft or\r\nfraud offense involving a pre-retail medical product, regardless of the offense of con-\r\nviction. Therefore application of the new specific offense characteristic is not limited to\r\noffenses charged under 18 U.S.C. § 670.\r\nThe amendment provides a 4-level enhancement for defendants who commit such of-\r\nfenses while employed in the supply chain for the pre-retail medical product. Such\r\ndefendants are subject to an increased statutory maximum and the Commission deter-\r\nmined that a heightened enhancement should apply to reflect the likelihood that the\r\ndefendant’s position in the supply chain facilitated the commission or concealment of\r\nthe offense. Defendants who receive the 4-level enhancement are not subject to the\r\nadjustment at §3B1.3 because the new enhancement adequately accounts for the con-\r\ncerns covered by §3B1.3. The Commission determined that existing specific offense\r\ncharacteristics generally account for other aggravating factors included in the Act,\r\nsuch as loss, use or threat of force, risk of death or serious bodily injury, and weapon\r\ninvolvement, and therefore additional new specific offense characteristics are not nec-\r\nessary. See, e.g., §§2B1.1(b)(1), (b)(3), and (b)(15) (as redesignated by the amendment).\r\nSecond, it amends the upward departure provisions in the Commentary to §2B1.1 at\r\nApplication Note 19(A) to provide — as an example of a case in which an upward de-\r\nparture would be warranted — a case “involving conduct described in 18 U.S.C. § 670\r\nif the offense resulted in serious bodily injury or death, including serious bodily injury\r\nor death resulting from the use of the pre-retail medical product.” Public comment and\r\ntestimony indicated that §2B1.1 may not adequately account for the harm created by\r\ntheft or fraud offenses involving pre-retail medical products when such serious bodily\r\ninjury or death actually occurs as a result of the offense. For example, some pre-retail\r\nmedical products are stolen as part of a scheme to re-sell them into the supply chain,\r\nbut if the products have not been properly stored in the interim, their subsequent use\r\ncan seriously injure the individual consumers who buy and use them. Thus, the amend-\r\nment expands the scope of the existing upward departure provision to address such\r\nharms and to clarify that an upward departure is appropriate in such cases not only if\r\nserious bodily injury or death occurred during the theft or fraud, but also if such seri-\r\nous bodily injury or death resulted from the victim’s use of a pre-retail medical product\r\nthat had previously been obtained by theft or fraud.\r\nAmendment 773\r\n36 ║ Supplement to Appendix C (November 1, 2016)\r\nFinally, the amendment amends the Commentary to §2B1.1 to provide relevant defi-\r\nnitions and make other conforming changes.","EffectiveDate":"Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2013."},{"Id":773,"Title":"Amendment 773","Text":"Section 2B5.3(b) is amended by renumbering paragraph (5) as (6); by\r\ninserting after paragraph (4) the following:\r\n“(5) If the offense involved a counterfeit drug, increase by 2 levels.”; and\r\nby inserting after paragraph (6) (as so renumbered) the following:\r\n“(7) If the offense involved a counterfeit military good or service the use, malfunc-\r\ntion, or failure of which is likely to cause (A) the disclosure of classified infor-\r\nmation; (B) impairment of combat operations; or (C) other significant harm to\r\n(i) a combat operation, (ii) a member of the Armed Forces, or (iii) national se-\r\ncurity, increase by 2 levels.

One Act in-\r\ncreased penalties for offenses involving counterfeit military goods and services; the\r\nother increased penalties for offenses involving counterfeit drugs and included a di-\r\nrective to the Commission. The amendment also responds to recent statutory changes\r\nto 21 U.S.C. § 333 (Penalties for violations of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetics\r\nAct) that increase penalties for offenses involving intentionally adulterated drugs.\r\nSection 2320 and Counterfeit Military Goods and Services\r\nFirst, the amendment responds to changes to section 2320 made by the National De-\r\nfense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012, Pub. L. 112–81 (enacted December 31,\r\n2011) (the “NDAA”). In general, section 2320 prohibits trafficking in goods or services\r\nusing a counterfeit mark, and provides a statutory maximum term of imprisonment of\r\n10 years, or 20 years for a second or subsequent offense. If the offender knowingly or\r\nrecklessly causes or attempts to cause serious bodily injury or death, the statutory\r\nmaximum is increased to 20 years or any term of years or life, respectively. Offenses\r\nunder section 2320 are referenced in Appendix A (Statutory Index) to §2B5.3 (Criminal\r\nInfringement of Copyright or Trademark).\r\nSection 818 of the NDAA amended section 2320 to add a new subsection (a)(3) that\r\nprohibits trafficking in counterfeit military goods and services, the use, malfunction,\r\nor failure of which is likely to cause serious bodily injury or death, the disclosure of\r\nclassified information, impairment of combat operations, or other significant harm to\r\na combat operation, a member of the Armed Forces, or national security. A “counterfeit\r\nmilitary good or service” is defined as a good or service that uses a counterfeit mark\r\nand that (A) is falsely identified or labeled as meeting military specifications, or (B) is\r\nintended for use in a military or national security application. See 18 U.S.C.\r\n§ 2320(f)(4). An individual who commits an offense under subsection (a)(3) is subject\r\nto a statutory maximum term of imprisonment of 20 years, or 30 years for a second or\r\nsubsequent offense. See 18 U.S.C. § 2320(b)(3).\r\nThe legislative history of the NDAA indicates that Congress amended section 2320\r\nbecause of concerns about national security and the protection of United States ser-\r\nvicemen and women. After reviewing the legislative history, public comment, testi-\r\nmony, and data, the Commission determined that an offense involving counterfeit mil-\r\nitary goods and services that jeopardizes the safety of United States troops and com-\r\npromises mission effectiveness warrants increased punishment.\r\nSpecifically, the amendment addresses offenses involving counterfeit military goods\r\nand services by amending §2B5.3 to create a new specific offense characteristic at sub-\r\nsection (b)(7). Subsection (b)(7) provides a 2-level enhancement and a minimum offense\r\nlevel of 14 if the offense involves a counterfeit military good or service the use, mal-\r\nfunction, or failure of which is likely to cause the disclosure of classified information,\r\nimpairment of combat operations, or other significant harm to a combat operation, a\r\nmember of the Armed Forces, or to national security. The Commission set the mini-\r\nmum offense level at 14 so that it would be proportionate to the minimum offense level\r\nAmendment 773\r\n38 ║ Supplement to Appendix C (November 1, 2016)\r\nin the enhancement for “conscious or reckless risk of death or serious bodily injury” at\r\nsubsection (b)(5)(A). That enhancement is moved from (b)(5)(A) to (b)(6)(A) by the\r\namendment.\r\nAlthough section 2320(a)(3) includes offenses that are likely to cause “serious bodily\r\ninjury or death,” the new specific offense characteristic does not because the Commis-\r\nsion determined that such risk of harm is adequately addressed by the existing en-\r\nhancement for offenses involving the “conscious or reckless risk of death or serious\r\nbodily injury.” Consistent with that approach, the amendment includes commentary\r\nproviding that the “other significant harm” specified in subsection (b)(7) does not in-\r\nclude death or serious bodily injury and that §2B5.3(b)(6)(A) would apply if the offense\r\ninvolved a counterfeit military good or service the use, malfunction, or failure of which\r\nis likely to cause serious bodily injury or death.\r\nSection 2320 and Counterfeit Drugs\r\nSecond, the amendment responds to changes made by section 717 of the Food and Drug\r\nAdministration Safety and Innovation Act, Pub. L. 112–144 (enacted July 9, 2012) (the\r\n“FDASIA”), which amended section 2320 to add a new subsection (a)(4) that prohibits\r\ntrafficking in a counterfeit drug. A “counterfeit drug” is a drug, as defined by section\r\n201 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. § 321), that uses a coun-\r\nterfeit mark. See 18 U.S.C. § 2320(f)(6). An individual who commits an offense under\r\nsubsection (a)(4) is subject to the same statutory maximum term of imprisonment as\r\nfor an offense involving a counterfeit military good or service — 20 years, or 30 years\r\nfor a second or subsequent offense. See 18 U.S.C. § 2320(b)(3).\r\nSection 717 of the FDASIA also contained a directive to the Commission to “review and\r\namend, if appropriate” the guidelines and policy statements applicable to persons con-\r\nvicted of an offense described in section 2320(a)(4) — i.e., offenses involving counterfeit\r\ndrugs — “in order to reflect the intent of Congress that such penalties be increased in\r\ncomparison to those currently provided by the guidelines and policy statements.”\r\nSee Pub. L. 112–144, § 717(b)(1). In addition, section 717(b)(2) provides that, in re-\r\nsponding to the directive, the Commission shall, among other things, ensure that the\r\nguidelines reflect the serious nature of section 2320(a)(4) offenses and consider the\r\nextent to which the guidelines account for the potential and actual harm to the public\r\nresulting from such offenses.\r\nAfter reviewing the legislative history of the FDASIA, public comment, testimony, and\r\ndata, the Commission determined that offenses involving counterfeit drugs involve a\r\nthreat to public safety and undermine the public’s confidence in the drug supply chain.\r\nFurthermore, unlike many other goods covered by the infringement guideline, offenses\r\ninvolving counterfeit drugs circumvent a regulatory scheme established to protect the\r\nhealth and safety of the public. Accordingly, the amendment responds to the directive\r\nby adding a new specific offense characteristic at §2B5.3(b)(5) that provides a 2-level\r\nenhancement if the offense involves a counterfeit drug.\r\nOffenses Resulting in Death or Serious Bodily Injury\r\nThird, the amendment amends the Commentary to §2B5.3 to add a new upward de-\r\nparture consideration if the offense resulted in death or serious bodily injury. The ad-\r\ndition of this departure consideration recognizes the distinction between an offense\r\ninvolving the risk of death or serious bodily injury and one in which death or serious\r\nbodily injury actually results. Departures for these reasons are already authorized in\r\nthe guidelines, see §§5K2.1 (Death) (Policy Statement), 5K2.2 (Physical Injury) (Policy\r\nAmendment 774\r\nStatement), but the amendment is intended to heighten awareness of the availability\r\nof a departure in such cases.\r\nSection 333 and Offenses Involving Intentionally Adulterated Drugs\r\nFinally, the amendment provides a statutory reference for the new offense at 21 U.S.C.\r\n§ 333(b)(7) created by section 716 of the FDASIA. Section 333(b)(7) applies to any per-\r\nson who knowingly and intentionally adulterates a drug such that the drug is adulter-\r\nated under certain provisions of 21 U.S.C. § 351 and has a reasonable probability of\r\ncausing serious adverse health consequences or death to humans or animals. It pro-\r\nvides a statutory maximum term of imprisonment of 20 years.\r\nThe amendment amends Appendix A (Statutory Index) to reference offenses under sec-\r\ntion 333(b)(7) to §2N1.1 (Tampering or Attempting to Tamper Involving Risk of Death\r\nor Bodily Injury). The Commission concluded that offenses under section 333(b)(7) are\r\nsimilar to tampering offenses under 18 U.S.C. § 1365 (Tampering with consumer prod-\r\nucts), which are referenced to §2N1.1. In addition, the public health harms that Con-\r\ngress intended to target in adulteration cases are similar to those targeted by viola-\r\ntions of section 1365(a) and are best addressed under §2N1.1.","EffectiveDate":"Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2013."},{"Id":774,"Title":"Amendment 774","Text":"The Commentary to §2T1.1 captioned “Application Notes” is amended in\r\nNote 1 by inserting “Tax Loss.—” at the beginning;\r\nin Note 2 by inserting “Total Tax Loss Attributable to the Offense.—” at the beginning,\r\nand by redesignating subdivisions (a) through (e) as (A) through (E);\r\nby inserting after Note 2 the following:\r\n“3.

These circuit courts generally rea-\r\nson that, while a district court need not speculate about unclaimed deductions if the\r\ndefendant offers weak support, nothing in the guidelines prohibits a sentencing court\r\nfrom considering evidence of unclaimed deductions where a defendant offers convinc-\r\ning proof. See United States v. Hoskins, 654 F.3d 1086, 1094 (10th Cir. 2011) (“[W]here\r\ndefendant offers convincing proof — where the court’s exercise is neither nebulous nor\r\ncomplex — nothing in the Guidelines prohibits a sentencing court from considering\r\nevidence of unclaimed deductions in analyzing a defendant’s estimate of the tax loss\r\nsuffered by the government.”); United States v. Martinez-Rios, 143 F.3d 662, 671\r\n(2d Cir. 1998) (holding that “the sentencing court need not base its tax loss calculation\r\non gross unreported income if it can make a ‘more accurate determination’ of the in-\r\ntended loss and that determination of the tax loss involves giving the defendant the\r\nbenefit of legitimate but unclaimed deductions”); United States v. Gordon, 291 F.3d\r\n181, 187 (2d Cir. 2002) (applying Martinez-Rios, the court held that the district court\r\nAmendment 774\r\nerred when it refused to consider potential unclaimed deductions in its sentencing\r\nanalysis).\r\nSix other circuit courts — the Fourth, Fifth, Seventh, Eighth, Ninth, and Eleventh —\r\nhave reached the opposite conclusion, directly or indirectly holding that a court may\r\nnot consider unclaimed deductions to reduce the tax loss. These circuit courts generally\r\nreason that the “object of the [defendant’s] offense” is established by the amount stated\r\non the fraudulent return, and that courts should not be required to reconstruct the\r\ndefendant’s return based on speculation regarding the many hypothetical ways the\r\ndefendant could have completed the return. See United States v. Delfino, 510 F.3d 468,\r\n473 (4th Cir. 2007) (“The law simply does not require the district court to engage in\r\n[speculation as to what deductions would have been allowed], nor does it entitle the\r\nDelfinos to the benefit of deductions they might have claimed now that they stand\r\nconvicted of tax evasion.”); United States v. Phelps, 478 F.3d 680, 682 (5th Cir. 2007)\r\n(holding that the defendant could not reduce tax loss by taking a social security tax\r\ndeduction that he did not claim on the false return); United States v. Chavin, 316 F.3d\r\n666, 677 (7th Cir. 2002) (“Here, the object of [the defendant]’s offense was the amount\r\nby which he underreported and fraudulently stated his tax liability on his return; ref-\r\nerence to other unrelated mistakes on the return such as unclaimed deductions tells\r\nus nothing about the amount of loss to the government that his scheme intended to\r\ncreate.”); United States v. Psihos, 683 F.3d 777, 781–82 (7th Cir. 2012) (following\r\nChavin in disallowing consideration of unclaimed deductions); United States v. Sher-\r\nman, 372 F.App’x 668, 676–77 (8th Cir. 2010); United States v. Blevins, 542 F.3d 1200,\r\n1203 (8th Cir. 2008) (declining to decide “whether an unclaimed tax benefit may ever\r\noffset tax loss,” but finding the district court properly declined to reduce tax loss based\r\non taxpayers’ unclaimed deductions); United States v. Yip, 592 F.3d 1035, 1041\r\n(9th Cir. 2010) (“We hold that § 2T1.1 does not entitle a defendant to reduce the tax\r\nloss charged to him by the amount of potentially legitimate, but unclaimed, deductions\r\neven if those deductions are related to the offense.”); United States v. Clarke, 562 F.3d\r\n1158, 1165 (11th Cir. 2009) (holding that the defendant was not entitled to a tax loss\r\ncalculation based on a filing status other than the one he actually used; “[t]he district\r\ncourt did not err in computing the tax loss based on the fraudulent return Clarke ac-\r\ntually filed, and not on the tax return Clarke could have filed but did not.”).\r\nThe amendment resolves the conflict by amending the Commentary to §2T1.1 to es-\r\ntablish a new application note regarding the consideration of unclaimed credits, de-\r\nductions, or exemptions in calculating a defendant’s tax loss. This amendment reflects\r\nthe Commission’s view that consideration of legitimate unclaimed credits, deductions,\r\nor exemptions, subject to certain limitations and exclusions, is most consistent with\r\nexisting provisions regarding the calculation of tax loss in §2T1.1. See, e.g., USSG\r\n§2T1.1, comment. (n.1) (“the guidelines contemplate that the court will simply make a\r\nreasonable estimate based on the available facts”); USSG §2T1.1, comment. (backg’d.)\r\n(“a greater tax loss is obviously more harmful to the treasury and more serious than a\r\nsmaller one with otherwise similar characteristics”); USSG §2T1.1, comment. (n.1) (al-\r\nlowing a sentencing court to go beyond the presumptions set forth in the guideline if\r\n“the government or defense provides sufficient information for a more accurate assess-\r\nment of the tax loss,” and providing “the court should use any method of determining\r\nthe tax loss that appears appropriate to reasonably calculate the loss that would have\r\nresulted had the offense been successfully completed”).\r\nThe new application note first provides that courts should always account for the\r\nstandard deduction and personal and dependent exemptions to which the defendant\r\nwas entitled. The Commission received public comment and testimony that such de-\r\nductions and exemptions are commonly considered and accepted by the government\r\nAmendment 774\r\n42 ║ Supplement to Appendix C (November 1, 2016)\r\nduring the course of its investigation and during the course of plea negotiations. Con-\r\nsistent with this standard practice, the Commission determined that accounting for\r\nthese generally undisputed and readily verifiable deductions and exemptions where\r\nthey are not previously claimed (most commonly where the offense involves a failure\r\nto file a tax return) is appropriate.\r\nThe new application note further provides that courts should also account for any other\r\npreviously unclaimed credit, deduction, or exemption that is needed to ensure a rea-\r\nsonable estimate of the tax loss, but only to the extent certain conditions are met. First,\r\nthe credit, deduction, or exemption must be one that was related to the tax offense and\r\ncould have been claimed at the time the tax offense was committed. This condition\r\nreflects the Commission’s determination that a defendant should not be permitted to\r\ninvoke unforeseen or after-the-fact changes or characterizations — such as offsetting\r\nlosses that occur before or after the relevant tax year or substituting a more advanta-\r\ngeous depreciation method or filing status — to lower the tax loss. To permit a defend-\r\nant to optimize his return in this manner would unjustly reward defendants, and could\r\nrequire unjustifiable speculation and complexity at the sentencing hearing.\r\nSecond, the otherwise unclaimed credit, deduction, or exemption must be reasonably\r\nand practicably ascertainable. Consistent with the instruction in Application Note 1,\r\nthis condition reaffirms the Commission’s position that sentencing courts need only\r\nmake a reasonable estimate of tax loss. In this regard, the Commission recognized that\r\nconsideration of some unclaimed credits, deductions, or exemptions could require sen-\r\ntencing courts to make unnecessarily complex tax determinations, and therefore con-\r\ncluded that limiting consideration of unclaimed credits, deductions, or exemptions to\r\nthose that are reasonably and practicably ascertainable is appropriate.\r\nThird, the defendant must present information to support the credit, deduction, or ex-\r\nemption sufficiently in advance of sentencing to provide an adequate opportunity to\r\nevaluate whether it has sufficient indicia of reliability to support its probable accuracy.\r\nConsistent with the principles set forth in §6A1.3 (Resolution of Disputed Factors)\r\n(Policy Statement), this condition ensures that the parties have an adequate oppor-\r\ntunity to present information relevant to the court’s consideration of any unclaimed\r\ncredits, deductions, or exemptions raised at sentencing.\r\nIn addition, the new application note provides that certain categories of credits, deduc-\r\ntions, or exemptions shall not be considered by the court in any case. In particular,\r\n“the court shall not account for payments to third parties made in a manner that en-\r\ncouraged or facilitated a separate violation of law (e.g., ‘under the table’ payments to\r\nemployees or expenses incurred to obstruct justice).” The Commission determined that\r\npayments made in this manner result in additional harm to the tax system and the\r\nlegal system as a whole. Therefore, to use them to reduce the tax loss would unjustifi-\r\nably benefit the defendant and would result in a tax loss figure that understates the\r\nseriousness of the offense and the culpability of the defendant.\r\nFinally, the application note makes clear that the burden is on the defendant to estab-\r\nlish any credit, deduction, or exemption permitted under this new application note by\r\na preponderance of the evidence, which is also consistent with the commentary in\r\n§6A1.3.","EffectiveDate":"Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2013."},{"Id":775,"Title":"Amendment 775","Text":"The Commentary to §3E1.1 captioned “Application Notes” is amended in\r\nNote 6 by adding at the end of the paragraph that begins “Because the Government”\r\nthe following as the last sentence: “The government should not withhold such a motion\r\nbased on interests not identified in §3E1.1, such as whether the defendant agrees to\r\nwaive his or her right to appeal.”; and\r\nby adding after the paragraph that begins “Because the Government” the following\r\nnew paragraph:\r\n“If the government files such a motion, and the court in deciding whether to grant the\r\nmotion also determines that the defendant has assisted authorities in the investigation\r\nor prosecution of his own misconduct by timely notifying authorities of his intention to\r\nenter a plea of guilty, thereby permitting the government to avoid preparing for trial\r\nand permitting the government and the court to allocate their resources efficiently, the\r\ncourt should grant the motion.”.\r\nThe Commentary to §3E1.1 captioned “Background” is amended in the paragraph that\r\nbegins “Section 401(g)” by striking “the last paragraph” and inserting “the first sen-\r\ntence of the second paragraph”.","Reason":"REASON FOR AMENDMENT: This amendment addresses two circuit conflicts involving\r\nthe guideline for acceptance of responsibility, §3E1.1 (Acceptance of Responsibility). A\r\ndefendant who clearly demonstrates acceptance of responsibility for his offense re-\r\nceives a 2-level reduction under subsection (a) of §3E1.1. The two circuit conflicts both\r\ninvolve the circumstances under which the defendant is eligible for a third level of\r\nreduction under subsection (b) of §3E1.1. Subsection (b) provides:\r\n(b) If the defendant qualifies for a decrease under subsection (a),\r\nthe offense level determined prior to the operation of subsec-\r\ntion (a) is level 16 or greater, and upon motion of the govern-\r\nment stating that the defendant has assisted authorities in the\r\ninvestigation or prosecution of his own misconduct by timely\r\nnotifying authorities of his intention to enter a plea of guilty,\r\nthereby permitting the government to avoid preparing for trial\r\nand permitting the government and the court to allocate their\r\nresources efficiently, decrease the offense level by 1 additional\r\nlevel.\r\nThe first circuit conflict involves the government’s discretion under subsection (b) and,\r\nin particular, whether the government may withhold a motion based on an interest not\r\nidentified in §3E1.1, such as the defendant’s refusal to waive his right to appeal. The\r\nsecond conflict involves the court’s discretion under subsection (b) and, in particular,\r\nwhether the court may decline to apply the third level of reduction when the govern-\r\nment has moved for it.\r\nThese circuit conflicts are unusual in that they involve guideline and commentary pro-\r\nvisions that Congress directly amended. See section 401(g) of the Prosecutorial Reme-\r\ndies and Other Tools to end the Exploitation of Children Today Act of 2003, Pub.\r\nL. 108–21 (the “PROTECT Act”); see also USSG App. C, Amendment 649 (effective\r\nApril 30, 2003) (implementing amendments to the guidelines made directly by the\r\nPROTECT Act). They also implicate a congressional directive to the Commission not\r\nAmendment 775\r\n44 ║ Supplement to Appendix C (November 1, 2016)\r\nto “alter or repeal” the congressional amendments. See section 401(j)(4) of the PRO-\r\nTECT Act. Accordingly, in considering these conflicts, the Commission has not only\r\nreviewed public comment, sentencing data, case law, and the other types of infor-\r\nmation it ordinarily considers, but has also studied the operation of §3E1.1 before the\r\nPROTECT Act, the congressional action to amend §3E1.1, and the legislative history\r\nof that congressional action.\r\nThe Government’s Discretion to Withhold the Motion\r\nThe first circuit conflict involves the government’s discretion under subsection (b) and,\r\nin particular, whether the government may withhold a motion based on an interest not\r\nidentified in §3E1.1, such as the defendant’s refusal to waive his right to appeal.\r\nSeveral circuits have held that a defendant’s refusal to sign an appellate waiver is a\r\nlegitimate reason for the government to withhold a §3E1.1(b) motion. See, e.g., United\r\nStates v. Johnson, 581 F.3d 994, 1002 (9th Cir. 2009) (holding that “allocation and\r\nexpenditure of prosecutorial resources for the purposes of defending an appeal is a\r\nrational basis” for such refusal); United States v. Deberry, 576 F.3d 708, 711 (7th Cir.\r\n2009) (holding that requiring the defendant to sign an appeal waiver would avoid “ex-\r\npense and uncertainty” on appeal); United States v. Newson, 515 F.3d 374, 378\r\n(5th Cir. 2008) (holding that the government’s interests under §3E1.1 encompass not\r\nonly the government’s time and effort at prejudgment stage but also at post-judgment\r\nproceedings).\r\nIn contrast, the Fourth Circuit has held that a defendant’s refusal to sign an appellate\r\nwaiver is not a legitimate reason for the government to withhold a §3E1.1(b) motion.\r\nSee United States v. Divens, 650 F.3d 343, 348 (4th Cir. 2011) (stating that “the text\r\nof §3E1.1(b) reveals a concern for the efficient allocation of trial resources, not appel-\r\nlate resources” [emphasis in original]); see also United States v. Davis, 714 F.3d 474,\r\n476 (7th Cir. 2013) (Rovner, J., concurring) (“insisting that [the defendant] waive his\r\nright to appeal before he may receive the maximum credit under the Guidelines for\r\naccepting responsibility serves none of the interests identified in section 3E1.1”). The\r\nmajority in Davis called for the conflict to be resolved, stating: “Resolution of this con-\r\nflict is the province of the Supreme Court or the Sentencing Commission.” Davis,\r\n714 F.3d at 475 (per curiam). The Second Circuit, stating that the Fourth Circuit’s\r\nreasoning in Divens applies “with equal force” to the defendant’s request for an evi-\r\ndentiary hearing on sentencing issues, held that the government may not withhold a\r\n§3E1.1 motion based upon such a request. See United States v. Lee, 653 F.3d 170, 175\r\n(2d Cir. 2011).\r\nThe PROTECT Act added Commentary to §3E1.1 stating that “[b]ecause the Govern-\r\nment is in the best position to determine whether the defendant has assisted authori-\r\nties in a manner that avoids preparing for trial, an adjustment under subsection (b)\r\nmay only be granted upon a formal motion by the Government at the time of sentenc-\r\ning.” See §3E1.1, comment. (n.6). The PROTECT Act also amended §3E1.1(b) to pro-\r\nvide that the government motion state, among other things, that the defendant’s noti-\r\nfication of his intention to enter a plea of guilty permitted “the government to avoid\r\npreparing for trial and . . . the government and the court to allocate their resources\r\nefficiently . . . .”\r\nIn its study of the PROTECT Act, the Commission could discern no congressional in-\r\ntent to allow decisions under §3E1.1 to be based on interests not identified in §3E1.1.\r\nFurthermore, consistent with Divens and the concurrence in Davis, the Commission\r\ndetermined that the defendant’s waiver of his or her right to appeal is an example of\r\nAmendment 775\r\nan interest not identified in §3E1.1. Accordingly, this amendment adds an additional\r\nsentence to the Commentary stating that “[t]he government should not withhold such\r\na motion based on interests not identified in §3E1.1, such as whether the defendant\r\nagrees to waive his or her right to appeal.”\r\nThe Court’s Discretion to Deny the Motion\r\nThe second conflict involves the court’s discretion under subsection (b) and, in partic-\r\nular, whether the court may decline to apply the third level of reduction when the\r\ngovernment has moved for it.\r\nThe Seventh Circuit has held that if the government makes the motion (and the other\r\ntwo requirements of subsection (b) are met, i.e., the defendant qualifies for the 2-level\r\ndecrease and the offense level is level 16 or greater), the third level of reduction must\r\nbe awarded. See United States v. Mount, 675 F.3d 1052 (7th Cir. 2012).\r\nIn contrast, the Fifth Circuit has held that the district court retains discretion to deny\r\nthe motion. See United States v. Williamson, 598 F.3d 227, 230 (5th Cir. 2010). In\r\nWilliamson, the defendant was convicted after jury trial but successfully appealed. Af-\r\nter remand, he pled guilty to a lesser offense. The government moved for the third level\r\nof reduction, but the court declined to grant it because “regardless of however much\r\nadditional trial preparation the government avoided through Williamson’s guilty plea\r\nfollowing remand, the preparation for the initial trial and the use of the court’s re-\r\nsources for that trial meant that the § 3E1.1(b) benefits to the government and the\r\ncourt were not obtained.” Id. at 231. The Fifth Circuit affirmed, holding that the deci-\r\nsion whether to grant the third level of reduction “is the district court’s — not the\r\ngovernment’s — even though the court may only do so on the government’s motion.”\r\nId. at 230.\r\nThis amendment amends the Commentary to §3E1.1 by adding the following state-\r\nment: “If the government files such a motion, and the court in deciding whether to\r\ngrant the motion also determines that the defendant has assisted authorities in the\r\ninvestigation or prosecution of his own misconduct by timely notifying authorities of\r\nhis intention to enter a plea of guilty, thereby permitting the government to avoid pre-\r\nparing for trial and permitting the government and the court to allocate their resources\r\nefficiently, the court should grant the motion.”\r\nIn its study of the PROTECT Act, the Commission could discern no congressional in-\r\ntent to take away from the court its responsibility under §3E1.1 to make its own de-\r\ntermination of whether the conditions were met. In particular, both the language\r\nadded to the Commentary by the PROTECT Act and the legislative history of the PRO-\r\nTECT Act speak in terms of allowing the court discretion to “grant” the third level of\r\nreduction. See USSG §3E1.1, comment. (n.6) (stating that the third level of reduction\r\n“may only be granted upon a formal motion by the Government”); H.R. Rep. No.\r\n108–66, at 59 (2003) (Conf. Rep.) (stating that the PROTECT Act amendment would\r\n“only allow courts to grant an additional third point reduction for ‘acceptance of re-\r\nsponsibility’ upon motion of the government.”). In addition, the Commission observes\r\nthat one of the considerations in §3E1.1(b) is whether the defendant’s actions permit-\r\nted the court to allocate its resources efficiently, and the court is in the best position to\r\nmake that determination. Accordingly, consistent with congressional intent, this\r\namendment recognizes that the court continues to have discretion to decide whether\r\nto grant the third level of reduction.\r\nAmendment 776\r\n46 ║ Supplement to Appendix C (November 1, 2016)\r\nFinally, and as mentioned above, the Commission in its study of the PROTECT Act\r\ncould discern no congressional intent to allow decisions under §3E1.1 to be based on\r\ninterests not identified in §3E1.1. For that reason, this amendment indicates that, if\r\nthe government has filed the motion and the court also determines that the circum-\r\nstances identified in §3E1.1 are present, the court should grant the motion.","EffectiveDate":"Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2013."},{"Id":776,"Title":"Amendment 776","Text":"The Commentary to §5G1.3 captioned “Background” is amended by strik-\r\ning the following: “In a case in which a defendant is subject to an undischarged sen-\r\ntence of imprisonment, the court generally has authority to impose an imprisonment\r\nsentence on the current offense to run concurrently with or consecutively to the prior\r\nundischarged term. 18 U.S.C. § 3584(a). Exercise of that authority,”;\r\nand inserting the following: “Federal courts generally ‘have discretion to select\r\nwhether the sentences they impose will run concurrently or consecutively with respect\r\nto other sentences that they impose, or that have been imposed in other proceedings,\r\nincluding state proceedings.’ See Setser v. United States, 132 S. Ct. 1463, 1468 (2012);\r\n18 U.S.C. § 3584(a). Federal courts also generally have discretion to order that the\r\nsentences they impose will run concurrently with or consecutively to other state sen-\r\ntences that are anticipated but not yet imposed. See Setser, 132 S. Ct. at 1468. Exercise\r\nof that discretion,”.","Reason":"REASON FOR AMENDMENT: This amendment responds to a recent Supreme Court deci-\r\nsion that federal courts have discretion to order that the sentence run consecutively to\r\n(or concurrently with) an anticipated, but not yet imposed, state sentence. See Setser\r\nv. United States, 132 S. Ct. 1463, 1468 (2012).\r\nThe discretion recognized in Setser for anticipated state sentences is similar to the\r\ndiscretion that federal courts have under 18 U.S.C. § 3584 for previously imposed sen-\r\ntences. Under section 3584, a federal court imposing a sentence generally has discre-\r\ntion to order that the sentence run consecutively to (or, in the alternative, concurrently\r\nwith) a term of imprisonment previously imposed but not yet discharged. See 18 U.S.C.\r\n§ 3584(a). Section 5G1.3 (Imposition of a Sentence on a Defendant Subject to an Un-\r\ndischarged Term of Imprisonment) provides guidance to the court in determining\r\nwhether, and how, to use the discretion under section 3584, i.e., whether the sentence\r\nshould run consecutively to (or, in the alternative, concurrently with) the prior undis-\r\ncharged term of imprisonment.\r\nThe amendment amends the background commentary to §5G1.3 to include a statement\r\nthat, in addition to the discretion provided by section 3584, federal courts also gener-\r\nally have discretion under Setser to order that the sentences they impose will run con-\r\nsecutively to or concurrently with other state sentences that are anticipated but not\r\nyet imposed. Determining whether, and how, to use this discretion will depend on the\r\nadequacy of the information available. See Setser, 132 S. Ct. at 1471 n.6 (“Of course, a\r\ndistrict court should exercise the power to impose anticipatory consecutive (or concur-\r\nrent) sentences intelligently. In some situations, a district court may have inadequate\r\ninformation and may forbear, but in other situations, that will not be the case.”). Add-\r\ning this statement to the guideline that applies to the court’s discretion under section\r\nAmendment 777\r\n3584 is intended to provide heightened awareness of the court’s similar discretion un-\r\nder Setser.","EffectiveDate":"Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2013."},{"Id":777,"Title":"Amendment 777","Text":"The Commentary to §2B1.1 captioned “Application Notes” is amended in\r\nNote 15 (as renumbered by Amendment 772) by striking “1a(5)” both places it appears\r\nand inserting “1a(11)”;

L. 112–95 (enacted February 14, 2012), which established a new\r\ncriminal offense at 18 U.S.C. § 39A (Aiming a laser pointer at an aircraft). The offense\r\napplies to whoever knowingly aims the beam of a laser pointer at an aircraft in the\r\nspecial aircraft jurisdiction of the United States or at the flight path of such an aircraft.\r\nThe statutory maximum term of imprisonment is five years.\r\nThe amendment amends Appendix A (Statutory Index) to reference section 39A of-\r\nfenses to §2A5.2 (Interference with Flight Crew Member or Flight Attendant; Interfer-\r\nence with Dispatch, Navigation, Operation, or Maintenance of Mass Transportation\r\nVehicle). Section 2A5.2 is the most analogous guideline because the offense involves\r\ninterference with an aircraft in flight.\r\nRestraining the Harassment of a Victim or Witness\r\nSecond, the amendment responds to section 3(a) of the Child Protection Act of 2012,\r\nPub. L. 112–206 (enacted December 7, 2012), which established a new offense at\r\n18 U.S.C. § 1514(c) that makes it a criminal offense to knowingly and intentionally\r\nviolate or attempt to violate an order issued under section 1514 (Civil action to restrain\r\nharassment of a victim or witness). The new offense has a statutory maximum term of\r\nimprisonment of five years.\r\nThe amendment amends Appendix A (Statutory Index) to reference section 1514(c)\r\noffenses to §2J1.2 (Obstruction of Justice). Section 2J1.2 is the most analogous guide-\r\nline because the offense involves interference with judicial proceedings.\r\nRestricted Buildings and Grounds\r\nThird, the amendment responds to the Federal Restricted Buildings and Grounds Im-\r\nprovement Act of 2011, Pub. L. 112–98 (enacted March 8, 2012), which amended the\r\ncriminal offense at 18 U.S.C. § 1752 (Restricted building or grounds). As so amended,\r\nthe statute defines “restricted buildings or grounds” to mean any restricted area (A) of\r\nthe White House or its grounds, or the Vice President’s official residence or its grounds;\r\n(B) of a building or grounds where the President or other person protected by the\r\nUnited States Secret Service is or will be temporarily visiting; or (C) of a building or\r\ngrounds restricted in conjunction with an event designated as a special event of na-\r\ntional significance. The statute makes it a crime to enter or remain; to impede or dis-\r\nrupt the orderly conduct of business or official functions; to obstruct or impede ingress\r\nor egress; or to engage in any physical violence against any person or property. The\r\nAct did not change the statutory maximum term of imprisonment, which is ten years\r\nif the person used or carried a deadly or dangerous weapon or firearm or if the offense\r\nresults in significant bodily injury, and one year in any other case.\r\nThe amendment amends Appendix A (Statutory Index) to reference section 1752 of-\r\nfenses to §2A2.4 (Obstructing or Impeding Officers) and §2B2.3 (Trespass). These\r\nguidelines are most analogous because the elements of offenses under section 1752\r\ninvolve either trespass at certain locations (i.e., locations permanently or temporarily\r\nprotected by the Secret Service) or interference with official business at such locations,\r\nor both.\r\nThe amendment also amends §2B2.3(b)(1) to ensure that a trespass under section 1752\r\nprovides a 4-level enhancement if the trespass occurred at the White House or the Vice\r\nAmendment 777\r\n50 ║ Supplement to Appendix C (November 1, 2016)\r\nPresident’s official residence, or a 2-level enhancement if the trespass occurred at any\r\nother location permanently or temporarily protected by the Secret Service. Sec-\r\ntion 2B2.3(b)(1) provides a 2-level enhancement if the trespass occurred at locations\r\nthat involve a significant federal interest, such as nuclear facilities, airports, and sea-\r\nports. A trespass at a location protected by the Secret Service is no less serious than a\r\ntrespass at other locations that involve a significant federal interest and warrants an\r\nequivalent enhancement of 2 levels. Section 2B2.3(b)(1) also provides a 2-level en-\r\nhancement if the trespass occurred at a residence. A trespass at the residence of the\r\nPresident or the Vice President is more serious and poses a greater risk of harm than\r\na trespass at an ordinary residence and warrants an enhancement of 4 levels.\r\nAviation Smuggling\r\nFourth, the amendment responds to the Ultralight Aircraft Smuggling Prevention Act\r\nof 2012, Pub. L. 112–93 (enacted February 10, 2012), which amended the criminal of-\r\nfense at 19 U.S.C. § 1590 (Aviation smuggling) to clarify that the term “aircraft” in-\r\ncludes ultralight aircraft and to cover attempts and conspiracies. Section 1590 makes\r\nit unlawful for the pilot of an aircraft to transport merchandise, or for any individual\r\non board any aircraft to possess merchandise, knowing that the merchandise will be\r\nintroduced into the United States contrary to law. It is also unlawful for a person to\r\ntransfer merchandise between an aircraft and a vessel on the high seas or in the cus-\r\ntoms waters of the United States unlawfully. The Act did not change the statutory\r\nmaximum terms of imprisonment, which are 20 years if any of the merchandise in-\r\nvolved was a controlled substance, see § 1590(d)(2), and five years otherwise,\r\nsee § 1590(d)(1).\r\nThe amendment amends Appendix A (Statutory Index) to reference offenses under sec-\r\ntion 1590(d)(1) to §2T3.1 (Evading Import Duties or Restrictions (Smuggling); Receiv-\r\ning or Trafficking in Smuggled Property). In such cases, §2T3.1 is the most analogous\r\nguideline because the offense involves smuggling. The amendment also amends Ap-\r\npendix A (Statutory Index) to reference offenses under section 1590(d)(2) to §2D1.1\r\n(Unlawful Manufacturing, Importing, Exporting, or Trafficking (Including Possession\r\nwith Intent to Commit These Offenses); Attempt or Conspiracy). In such cases, §2D1.1\r\nis the most analogous guideline because controlled substances are involved in these\r\noffenses.\r\nInteraction Between Offense Guidelines in Chapter Two, Part J, and Certain\r\nAdjustments in Chapter Three, Part C\r\nFifth, the amendment responds to an application issue that may arise in cases in which\r\nthe defendant is sentenced under an offense guideline in Chapter Two, Part J (Offenses\r\nInvolving the Administration of Justice) and the defendant may also be subject to an\r\nadjustment under Chapter Three, Part C (Obstruction and Related Adjustments). Spe-\r\ncifically, there are application notes in four Chapter Two, Part J guidelines that, it has\r\nbeen argued, preclude the court from applying adjustments in Chapter Three, Part C.\r\nSee, e.g., United States v. Duong, 665 F.3d 364 (1st Cir. 2012) (observing that, “accord-\r\ning to the literal terms” of the application notes, an adjustment under Chapter Three,\r\nPart C “ ‘does not apply,’ ” but “reject[ing] that premise”).\r\nThe amendment amends the relevant application notes in Chapter Two, Part J\r\n(see §§2J1.2, comment. (n.2(A)); 2J1.3, comment. (n.2); 2J1.6, comment. (n.2); 2J1.9,\r\ncomment. (n.1)) to clarify the Commission’s intent that they restrict the court from\r\napplying §3C1.1 (Obstructing or Impeding the Administration of Justice) but do not\r\nrestrict the court from applying §§3C1.2, 3C1.3, and 3C1.4. These changes resolve the\r\nAmendment 777\r\napplication issue consistent with Duong and promote clarity and consistency in the\r\napplication of these adjustments.\r\nExport Offenses Under 18 U.S.C. § 554\r\nSixth, the amendment broadens the range of guidelines to which export offenses under\r\n18 U.S.C. § 554 (Smuggling goods from the United States) are referenced. Section 554\r\nmakes it unlawful to export or send from the United States (or attempt to do so) any\r\nmerchandise, article, or object contrary to any law or regulation of the United States.\r\nIt also makes it unlawful to receive, conceal, buy, sell, or in any manner facilitate the\r\ntransportation, concealment, or sale of such merchandise, article, or object, prior to\r\nexportation, knowing the same to be intended for exportation contrary to any law or\r\nregulation of the United States. Offenses under section 554 have a statutory maximum\r\nterm of imprisonment of ten years, and they are referenced in Appendix A (Statutory\r\nIndex) to three guidelines: §§2B1.5 (Theft of, Damage to, or Destruction of, Cultural\r\nHeritage Resources or Paleontological Resources; Unlawful Sale, Purchase, Exchange,\r\nTransportation, or Receipt of Cultural Heritage Resources or Paleontological Re-\r\nsources), 2M5.2 (Exportation of Arms, Munitions, or Military Equipment or Services\r\nWithout Required Validated Export License), and 2Q2.1 (Offenses Involving Fish,\r\nWildlife, and Plants).\r\nThe amendment amends Appendix A (Statutory Index) to add §2M5.1 (Evasion of Ex-\r\nport Controls; Financial Transactions with Countries Supporting International Ter-\r\nrorism) to the list of guidelines to which offenses under section 554 are referenced. Not\r\nall offenses under section 554 involve munitions, cultural resources, or wildlife, so a\r\nreference to an additional guideline is warranted. For example, a section 554 offense\r\nmay be based on the export of ordinary commercial goods in violation of economic sanc-\r\ntions or on the export of “dual-use” goods (i.e., goods that have both commercial and\r\nmilitary applications). For such cases, the additional reference to §2M5.1 promotes\r\nclarity and consistency in guideline application, and the penalty structure of §2M5.1\r\nprovides appropriate distinctions between offenses that violate national security con-\r\ntrols and offenses that do not.\r\nTechnical and Stylistic Changes\r\nFinally, the amendment makes certain technical and stylistic changes to the Guide-\r\nlines Manual. First, it amends the Commentary to §2B1.1 (Theft, Property Destruc-\r\ntion, and Fraud) to provide updated references to the definitions contained in 7 U.S.C.\r\n§ 1a, which were renumbered by Public Law 111–203 (enacted July 21, 2010). Second,\r\nit amends the Notes to the Drug Quantity Table in §2D1.1 (Unlawful Manufacturing,\r\nImporting, Exporting, or Trafficking (Including Possession with Intent to Commit\r\nThese Offenses); Attempt or Conspiracy) to provide updated references to the defini-\r\ntion of tetrahydrocannabinols contained in 21 C.F.R. § 1308.11(d), which were renum-\r\nbered by 75 Fed. Reg. 79296 (December 20, 2010). Third, it makes several stylistic\r\nrevisions in the Guidelines Manual to change “court martial” to “court-martial.” The\r\nchanges are not substantive.","EffectiveDate":"Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2013."},{"Id":778,"Title":"Amendment 778","Text":"The Commentary to §1B1.8 captioned “Application Notes” is amended in\r\nNote 3 by striking “(Inadmissibility of Pleas” and inserting “Pleas”.\r\nThe Commentary to §2M3.1 captioned “Application Notes” is amended in Note 1 by\r\nstriking “12958” and inserting “13526”.\r\nThe Commentary to §8B2.1 captioned “Background” is amended by striking\r\n“805(a)(2)(5)” and inserting “805(a)(5)”.\r\nThe Commentary to §8D1.2 captioned “Application Note” is amended in Note 1 by\r\nstriking “3561(b)” and inserting “3561(c)”.","Reason":"REASON FOR AMENDMENT: This amendment makes certain technical changes to Com-\r\nmentary in the Guidelines Manual.

For example:\r\n(A) Defendant A is subject to a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment\r\nof 120 months. The original guideline range at the time of sentencing\r\nAmendment 780\r\n54 ║ Supplement to Appendix C (November 1, 2016)\r\nwas 135 to 168 months, which is entirely above the mandatory mini-\r\nmum, and the court imposed a sentence of 101 months pursuant to a\r\ngovernment motion to reflect the defendant’s substantial assistance to\r\nauthorities. The court determines that the amended guideline range as\r\ncalculated on the Sentencing Table is 108 to 135 months. Ordinarily,\r\n§5G1.1 would operate to restrict the amended guideline range to 120\r\nto 135 months, to reflect the mandatory minimum term of imprison-\r\nment. For purposes of this policy statement, however, the amended\r\nguideline range remains 108 to 135 months.\r\nTo the extent the court considers it appropriate to provide a reduction\r\ncomparably less than the amended guideline range pursuant to sub-\r\nsection (b)(2)(B), Defendant A’s original sentence of 101 months\r\namounted to a reduction of approximately 25 percent below the mini-\r\nmum of the original guideline range of 135 months. Therefore, an\r\namended sentence of 81 months (representing a reduction of approxi-\r\nmately 25 percent below the minimum of the amended guideline range\r\nof 108 months) would amount to a comparable reduction and may be\r\nappropriate.\r\n(B) Defendant B is subject to a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment\r\nof 120 months. The original guideline range at the time of sentencing\r\n(as calculated on the Sentencing Table) was 108 to 135 months, which\r\nwas restricted by operation of §5G1.1 to a range of 120 to 135 months.\r\nSee §5G1.1(c)(2). The court imposed a sentence of 90 months pursuant\r\nto a government motion to reflect the defendant’s substantial assis-\r\ntance to authorities. The court determines that the amended guideline\r\nrange as calculated on the Sentencing Table is 87 to 108 months. Ordi-\r\nnarily, §5G1.1 would operate to restrict the amended guideline range\r\nto precisely 120 months, to reflect the mandatory minimum term of\r\nimprisonment. See §5G1.1(b). For purposes of this policy statement,\r\nhowever, the amended guideline range is considered to be 87 to\r\n108 months (i.e., unrestricted by operation of §5G1.1 and the statutory\r\nminimum of 120 months).\r\nTo the extent the court considers it appropriate to provide a reduction\r\ncomparably less than the amended guideline range pursuant to sub-\r\nsection (b)(2)(B), Defendant B’s original sentence of 90 months\r\namounted to a reduction of approximately 25 percent below the original\r\nguideline range of 120 months. Therefore, an amended sentence of\r\n65 months (representing a reduction of approximately 25 percent be-\r\nlow the minimum of the amended guideline range of 87 months) would\r\namount to a comparable reduction and may be appropriate.”.\r\nThe Commentary to §1B1.10 captioned “Background” is amended by striking “subsec-\r\ntion (c)” both places such term appears and inserting “subsection (d)”.","Reason":"REASON FOR AMENDMENT: This amendment clarifies an application issue that has\r\narisen with respect to §1B1.10 (Reduction in Term of Imprisonment as a Result of\r\nAmended Guideline Range) (Policy Statement). Circuits have conflicting interpreta-\r\ntions of when, if at all, §1B1.10 provides that a statutory minimum continues to limit\r\nthe amount by which a defendant’s sentence may be reduced under 18 U.S.C.\r\n§ 3582(c)(2) when the defendant’s original sentence was below the statutory minimum\r\ndue to substantial assistance.\r\nAmendment 780\r\nThis issue arises in two situations. First, there are cases in which the defendant’s orig-\r\ninal guideline range was above the mandatory minimum but the defendant received a\r\nsentence below the mandatory minimum pursuant to a government motion for sub-\r\nstantial assistance. For example, consider a case in which the mandatory minimum\r\nwas 240 months, the original guideline range was 262 to 327 months, and the defend-\r\nant’s original sentence was 160 months, representing a 39 percent reduction for sub-\r\nstantial assistance below the bottom of the guideline range. In a sentence reduction\r\nproceeding pursuant to Amendment 750, the amended guideline range as determined\r\non the Sentencing Table is 168 to 210 months, but after application of the “trumping”\r\nmechanism in §5G1.1 (Sentencing on a Single Count of Conviction), the mandatory\r\nminimum sentence of 240 months is the guideline sentence. See §5G1.1(b). Section\r\n1B1.10(b)(2)(B) provides that such a defendant may receive a comparable 39 percent\r\nreduction from the bottom of the amended guideline range, but circuits are split over\r\nwhat to use as the bottom of the range.\r\nThe Eighth Circuit has taken the view that the bottom of the amended guideline range\r\nin such a case would be 240 months, i.e., the guideline sentence that results after ap-\r\nplication of the “trumping” mechanism in §5G1.1. See United States v. Golden,\r\n709 F.3d 1229, 1231–33 (8th Cir. 2013). In contrast, the Seventh Circuit has taken the\r\nview that the bottom of the amended guideline range in such a case would be\r\n168 months, i.e., the bottom of the amended range as determined by the Sentencing\r\nTable, without application of the “trumping” mechanism in §5G1.1. See United States\r\nv. Wren, 706 F.3d 861, 863 (7th Cir. 2013). Each circuit found support for its view in\r\nan Eleventh Circuit decision, United States v. Liberse, 688 F.3d 1198 (11th Cir. 2012),\r\nwhich also discussed this issue.\r\nSecond, there are cases in which the defendant’s original guideline range as deter-\r\nmined by the Sentencing Table was, at least in part, below the mandatory minimum,\r\nand the defendant received a sentence below the mandatory minimum pursuant to a\r\ngovernment motion for substantial assistance. In these cases, the “trumping” mecha-\r\nnism in §5G1.1 operated at the original sentence to restrict the guideline range to be\r\nno less than the mandatory minimum. For example, consider a case in which the orig-\r\ninal Sentencing Table guideline range was 140 to 175 months but the mandatory min-\r\nimum was 240 months, resulting (after operation of §5G1.1) in a guideline sentence of\r\n240 months. The defendant’s original sentence was 96 months, representing a 60 per-\r\ncent reduction for substantial assistance below the statutory and guideline minimum.\r\nIn a sentence reduction proceeding, the amended Sentencing Table guideline range is\r\n110 to 137 months, resulting (after operation of §5G1.1) in a guideline sentence of\r\n240 months. Section 1B1.10(b)(2)(B) provides that such a defendant may receive a re-\r\nduction from the bottom of the amended guideline range, but circuits are split over\r\nwhat to use as the bottom of the range.\r\nThe Eleventh Circuit, the Sixth Circuit, and the Second Circuit have taken the view\r\nthat the bottom of the amended range in such a case would remain 240 months, i.e., the\r\nguideline sentence that results after application of the “trumping” mechanism in\r\n§5G1.1. See United States v. Glover, 686 F.3d 1203, 1208 (11th Cir. 2012); United\r\nStates v. Joiner, 727 F.3d 601 (6th Cir. 2013); United States v. Johnson, 732 F.3d 109\r\n(2d Cir. 2013). Under these decisions, the defendant in the example would have an\r\noriginal range of 240 months and an amended range of 240 months, and would not be\r\neligible for any reduction because the range has not been lowered. In contrast, the\r\nThird Circuit and the District of Columbia Circuit have taken the view that the bottom\r\nAmendment 781\r\n56 ║ Supplement to Appendix C (November 1, 2016)\r\nof the amended range in such a case would be 110 months, i.e., the bottom of the Sen-\r\ntencing Table guideline range. See United States v. Savani, 733 F.3d 56, 66–7 (3d Cir.\r\n2013); In re Sealed Case, 722 F.3d 361, 369–70 (D.C. Cir. 2013).\r\nThe amendment generally adopts the approach of the Third Circuit in Savani and the\r\nDistrict of Columbia Circuit in In re Sealed Case. It amends §1B1.10 to specify that, if\r\nthe case involves a statutorily required minimum sentence and the court had the au-\r\nthority to impose a sentence below the statutorily required minimum sentence pursu-\r\nant to a government motion to reflect the defendant’s substantial assistance to author-\r\nities, then for purposes of §1B1.10 the amended guideline range shall be determined\r\nwithout regard to the operation of §5G1.1 and §5G1.2. The amendment also adds a\r\nnew application note with examples.\r\nThis clarification ensures that defendants who provide substantial assistance to the\r\ngovernment in the investigation and prosecution of others have the opportunity to re-\r\nceive the full benefit of a reduction that accounts for that assistance. See USSG App. C.\r\nAmend 759 (Reason for Amendment). As the Commission noted in the reason for that\r\namendment: “The guidelines and the relevant statutes have long recognized that de-\r\nfendants who provide substantial assistance are differently situated than other de-\r\nfendants and should be considered for a sentence below a guideline or statutory mini-\r\nmum even when defendants who are otherwise similar (but did not provide substantial\r\nassistance) are subject to a guideline or statutory minimum. Applying this principle\r\nwhen the guideline range has been reduced and made available for retroactive appli-\r\ncation under section 3582(c)(2) appropriately maintains this distinction and furthers\r\nthe purposes of sentencing.” Id.","EffectiveDate":"Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2014."},{"Id":781,"Title":"Amendment 781","Text":"Section 2A2.2(b) is amended by redesignating paragraphs (4) through (6)\r\nas paragraphs (5) through (7), respectively; and by inserting after paragraph (3) the\r\nfollowing new paragraph (4):\r\n“(4) If the offense involved strangling, suffocating, or attempting to strangle or suf-\r\nfocate a spouse, intimate partner, or dating partner, increase by 3 levels.\r\nHowever, the cumulative adjustments from application of subdivisions (2), (3),\r\nand (4) shall not exceed 12 levels.”.\r\nThe Commentary to §2A2.2 captioned “Statutory Provisions” is amended by inserting\r\nafter “113(a)(2), (3), (6),” the following: “(8),”.\r\nThe Commentary to §2A2.2 captioned “Application Notes” is amended in Note 1 by\r\nstriking “or (C)” and inserting “(C) strangling, suffocating, or attempting to strangle or\r\nsuffocate; or (D)”; and by adding at the end the following new paragraphs:\r\n“ ‘Strangling’ and ‘suffocating’ have the meaning given those terms in 18 U.S.C. § 113.\r\n‘Spouse,’ ‘intimate partner,’ and ‘dating partner’ have the meaning given those terms\r\nin 18 U.S.C. § 2266.”;\r\nAmendment 781\r\nand in Note 4 by striking “(b)(6)” and inserting “(b)(7)”.\r\nThe Commentary to §2A2.2 captioned “Background” is amended in the first paragraph\r\nby striking “minor assaults” and inserting “other assaults”; by striking the comma af-\r\nter “serious bodily injury” and inserting a semicolon; and by striking the comma after\r\n“cause bodily injury” and inserting “; strangling, suffocating, or attempting to strangle\r\nor suffocate;”;\r\nand in the paragraph that begins “Subsection” by striking “(b)(6)” both places it ap-\r\npears and inserting “(b)(7)”.\r\nSection 2A2.3 is amended in the heading by striking “Minor Assault” and inserting\r\n“Assault”.\r\nSection 2A2.3(b)(1) is amended by inserting after “substantial bodily injury to” the fol-\r\nlowing: “a spouse, intimate partner, or dating partner, or”.\r\nThe Commentary to §2A2.3 captioned “Statutory Provisions” is amended by inserting\r\nafter “112,” the following: “113(a)(4), (5), (7),”.\r\nThe Commentary to §2A2.3 captioned “Application Notes” is amended in Note 1 by\r\nstriking “ ‘Minor assault’ means a misdemeanor assault, or a felonious assault not cov-\r\nered by §2A2.2 (Aggravated Assault).” and inserting the following new paragraph:\r\n“ ‘Spouse,’ ‘intimate partner,’ and ‘dating partner’ have the meaning given those terms\r\nin 18 U.S.C. § 2266.”.\r\nThe Commentary to §2A2.3 captioned “Background” is amended by striking “Minor\r\nassault and battery are covered by this section.” and inserting the following: “This sec-\r\ntion applies to misdemeanor assault and battery and to any felonious assault not cov-\r\nered by §2A2.2 (Aggravated Assault).”.\r\nSection 2A6.2(b)(1) is amended by striking “(C)” and inserting “(C) strangling, suffo-\r\ncating, or attempting to strangle or suffocate; (D)”; by striking “(D) a pattern” and in-\r\nserting “(E) a pattern”; and by striking “these aggravating factors” and inserting “sub-\r\ndivisions (A), (B), (C), (D), or (E)”.\r\nThe Commentary to §2A6.2 captioned “Application Notes” is amended in Note 1 by\r\nstriking the paragraph referenced to “Stalking” as follows:\r\n“ ‘Stalking’ means (A) traveling with the intent to kill, injure, harass, or intimidate\r\nanother person and, in the course of, or as a result of, such travel, placing the person\r\nin reasonable fear of death or serious bodily injury to that person or an immediate\r\nfamily member of that person; or (B) using the mail or any facility of interstate or\r\nforeign commerce to engage in a course of conduct that places that person in reasonable\r\nfear of the death of, or serious bodily injury to, that person or an immediate family\r\nmember of that person.

L.\r\nNo. 113–4 (March 7, 2013), which provided new and expanded criminal offenses and\r\nincreased penalties for certain crimes pertaining to assault, sexual abuse, stalking,\r\ndomestic violence, and human trafficking.\r\nThe Act established new assault offenses and enhanced existing assault offenses at\r\n18 U.S.C. § 113 (Assaults within maritime and territorial jurisdiction). In general, sec-\r\ntion 113 sets forth a range of penalties for assaults within the special maritime and\r\nterritorial jurisdiction of the United States. The legislative history of the Act indicates\r\nthat Congress intended many of these changes to allow federal prosecutors to address\r\ndomestic violence against Native American women more effectively. Such violence of-\r\nten occurs in a series of incidents of escalating seriousness.\r\nFirst, the amendment responds to changes in sections 113(a)(1) and (a)(2). Sec-\r\ntion 113(a)(1) prohibits assault with intent to commit murder, and the Act amended it\r\nto also prohibit assault with intent to commit a violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 2241 (Aggra-\r\nvated sexual abuse) or 2242 (Sexual abuse), with a statutory maximum term of impris-\r\nonment of 20 years. Section 113(a)(2) prohibits assault with intent to commit any fel-\r\nony except murder, and prior to the Act had also excluded assault with intent to com-\r\nmit a violation of Chapter 109A, including sections 2241, 2242, 2243 (Sexual abuse of\r\na minor or ward) and 2244 (Abusive sexual contact), with a statutory maximum term\r\nof imprisonment of 10 years. The Act amended section 113(a)(2) to prohibit assault\r\nwith intent to commit any felony except murder or a violation of section 2241 or 2242.\r\nThe effect of the statutory change is that an assault with intent to commit a violation\r\nof section 2243 or 2244 may now be prosecuted under section 113(a)(2). Offenses under\r\nsection 2241 and 2242 are referenced to §2A3.1 (Criminal Sexual Abuse; Attempt to\r\nCommit Criminal Sexual Abuse), and offenses under section 2243 and 2244 are refer-\r\nenced to §§2A3.2 (Criminal Sexual Abuse of a Minor Under the Age of Sixteen Years\r\n(Statutory Rape) or Attempt to Commit Such Acts); 2A3.3 (Criminal Sexual Abuse of\r\na Ward or Attempt to Commit Such Acts); and 2A3.4 (Abusive Sexual Contact or At-\r\ntempt to Commit Abusive Sexual Contact).\r\nThe amendment amends Appendix A (Statutory Index) to reference the expanded of-\r\nfense conduct prohibited by 18 U.S.C. § 113(a)(1) to §2A3.1 and to reference the ex-\r\npanded offense conduct prohibited by 18 U.S.C. § 113(a)(2) to §§2A3.2, 2A3.3, and\r\n2A3.4. The Commission concluded that an assault offense committed with the intent\r\nto commit a sexual abuse offense is analogous to, and in some cases more serious than,\r\nan attempted sexual abuse offense under Chapter 109A, and the criminal sexual abuse\r\nguidelines which apply to attempted sexual abuse offenses were therefore appropriate\r\nfor this conduct.\r\nAmendment 781\r\n60 ║ Supplement to Appendix C (November 1, 2016)\r\nSecond, the Act increased the statutory maximum penalty for violations of 18 U.S.C.\r\n§ 113(a)(4) from six months to one year of imprisonment. Section 113(a)(4) prohibits\r\nan assault by striking, beating, or wounding. Because the crime had been categorized\r\nas a Class B misdemeanor, Appendix A did not previously include a reference for sec-\r\ntion 113(a)(4). The amendment adds such a reference to §2A2.3 (Assault). The Com-\r\nmission determined that §2A2.3 will provide appropriate punishment that is con-\r\nsistent with the statutory maximum term of imprisonment, while sufficiently address-\r\ning the possible levels of bodily harm that may result to victims in individual cases of\r\nassault by striking, beating, or wounding.\r\nThird, the Act expanded 18 U.S.C. § 113(a)(7), which prohibits assaults resulting in\r\nsubstantial bodily injury to an individual who has not attained the age of sixteen years,\r\nto also apply to assaults resulting in substantial bodily injury to a spouse, intimate\r\npartner, or dating partner, and provides a statutory maximum term of imprisonment\r\nof five years. Offenses under section 113(a)(7) are referenced in Appendix A to §2A2.3\r\n(Assault). The amendment broadened the scope of §2A2.3(b)(1)(B), which provides a\r\n4-level enhancement if the offense resulted in substantial bodily injury to an individual\r\nunder the age of sixteen years, to also provide a 4-level enhancement if the offense\r\nresulted in substantial bodily injury to a spouse, intimate partner, or dating partner.\r\nThe Commission determined that because the expanded assaultive conduct of a victim\r\nof domestic violence has the same statutory maximum term of imprisonment, the same\r\nenhancement was warranted as for assaults of individuals under the age of sixteen\r\nresulting in substantial bodily injury.\r\nFourth, the Act created a new section 113(a)(8) in title 18, which prohibits the assault\r\nof a spouse, intimate partner, or dating partner by strangulation, suffocation, or at-\r\ntempting to strangle or suffocate, with a statutory maximum term of imprisonment of\r\nten years. After reviewing legislative history, public comment, testimony at a public\r\nhearing on February 13, 2014, and data, the Commission determined that strangula-\r\ntion and suffocation of a spouse, intimate partner, or dating partner represents a sig-\r\nnificant harm not addressed by existing guidelines and specific offense characteristics.\r\nComment and testimony that the Commission received indicated that strangulation\r\nand suffocation in the domestic violence context is serious conduct that warrants en-\r\nhanced punishment regardless of whether it results in a provable injury that would\r\nlead to a bodily injury enhancement; this conduct harms victims physically and psy-\r\nchologically and can be a predictor of future serious or lethal violence. Testimony and\r\ndata also indicated that cases of strangulation and suffocation often involve other bod-\r\nily injury to a victim separate from the strangulation and suffocation. Congress specif-\r\nically addressed strangulation and suffocation in the domestic violence context, and\r\ntestimony and data indicated that almost all cases involving this conduct occur in that\r\ncontext and that strangulation and suffocation is most harmful in such cases.\r\nAccordingly, the amendment amends Appendix A to reference section 113(a)(8) to\r\n§2A2.2 (Aggravated Assault) and amends the Commentary to §2A2.2 to provide that\r\nthe term “aggravated assault” includes an assault involving strangulation, suffocation,\r\nor an attempt to strangle or suffocate. The amendment amends §2A2.2 to provide a\r\n3-level enhancement at §2A2.2(b)(4) for strangling, suffocating, or attempting to stran-\r\ngle or suffocate a spouse, intimate partner, or dating partner. The amendment also\r\nprovides that the cumulative impact of the enhancement for use of a weapon at\r\n§2A2.2(b)(2), bodily injury at §2A2.2(b)(3), and strangulation or suffocation at\r\n§2A2.2(b)(4) is capped at 12 levels. The Commission determined that the cap would\r\nassure that these three specific offense characteristics, which data suggests co-occur\r\nAmendment 781\r\nfrequently, will enhance the ultimate sentence without leading to an excessively severe\r\nresult.\r\nAlthough the amendment refers section 113(a)(8) offenses to §2A2.2, it also amends\r\n§2A6.2 (Stalking or Domestic Violence) to address cases involving strangulation, suf-\r\nfocation, or attempting to strangle or suffocate, as a conforming change. The amend-\r\nment adds strangulation and suffocation as a new aggravating factor at §2A6.2(b)(1),\r\nwhich results in a 2-level enhancement, or in a 4-level enhancement if it applies in\r\nconjunction with another aggravating factor such as bodily injury or the use of a\r\nweapon.\r\nFifth, the amendment removes the term “minor assault” from the Guidelines Manual.\r\nMisdemeanor assaults and other felonious assaults are referenced to §2A2.3, which\r\nprior to this amendment was titled “Minor Assault.” Informed by public comment, the\r\nCommission determined that use of the term “minor” is inconsistent with the severity\r\nof the underlying crimes and does a disservice to the victims and communities affected.\r\nTherefore, the amendment changes the title of §2A2.3 to “Assault,” and it removes\r\nother references to “minor assault” from the Background and Commentary sections of\r\n§§2A2.2 and 2A2.3. This is a stylistic change that does not affect the application of\r\n§2A2.3.\r\nSixth, the amendment amended the Commentary to §5D1.1 (Imposition of a Term of\r\nSupervised Release) to provide additional guidance on the imposition of supervised\r\nrelease for domestic violence and stalking offenders. The amendment describes the\r\nstatutory requirements pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3583(a) if a defendant is convicted for\r\nthe first time of a domestic violence offense as defined in 18 U.S.C. § 3561(b). Under\r\nsection 3583, a term of supervised release is required, and the defendant is also re-\r\nquired to attend an approved rehabilitation program if one is available within a\r\n50-mile radius from the defendant’s residence.\r\nThe Commission received public comment and testimony that supervised release\r\nshould be recommended in every case of domestic violence and stalking, and the Com-\r\nmission’s sentencing data showed that in more than ninety percent of the cases sen-\r\ntenced under §2A6.2, supervised release was imposed. Based on this comment, testi-\r\nmony, and data, the amendment amends the Commentary to §5D1.1 to provide that in\r\nany other case involving either a domestic violence or a stalking offense, it is “highly\r\nrecommended” that a term of supervised release be imposed.\r\nSeventh, the amendment responds to changes made by the Act amending the federal\r\nstatutes related to stalking and domestic violence. For the crimes of interstate domes-\r\ntic violence (18 U.S.C. § 2261), stalking (18 U.S.C. § 2261A), and interstate violation\r\nof a protective order (18 U.S.C. § 2262), the Act expanded the scope of each offense to\r\nprovide that a defendant’s mere presence in a special maritime or territorial jurisdic-\r\ntion is sufficient for purposes of satisfying the jurisdictional element of the crimes. The\r\nAct also revised the prohibited conduct set forth in section 2261A to now include stalk-\r\ning with intent to “intimidate” the victim, and it added the use of an “electronic com-\r\nmunication service” or “electronic communication system” as prohibited means of com-\r\nmitting the crime.\r\nThe amendment updates the definition of “stalking” in §2A6.2 to reflect these changes\r\nby tying the definition to the conduct described in 18 U.S.C. § 2261A. The Commission\r\ndetermined that such a change would simplify the application of §2A6.2, while also\r\nensuring that the definition of stalking remains consistent with any future statutory\r\nchanges.\r\nAmendment 781\r\n62 ║ Supplement to Appendix C (November 1, 2016)\r\nEighth, the Act amended 8 U.S.C. § 1375a (Regulation of international marriage bro-\r\nkers) by reorganizing existing offenses and increasing the statutory maximum term of\r\nimprisonment for knowing violations of the regulations concerning marriage brokers\r\nfrom one year to five years. The Act also added a new criminal provision for “knowingly\r\nand with intent to defraud another person outside of the United States in order to\r\nrecruit, solicit, entice, or induce that person into entering a dating or matrimonial re-\r\nlationship,” making false or fraudulent representations regarding the background in-\r\nformation required to be provided to an international marriage brokers. The new of-\r\nfense has a statutory maximum term of imprisonment of one year. The amendment\r\nreferenced this new offense in Appendix A to §2B1.1 (Larceny, Embezzlement, and\r\nOther Forms of Theft; Offenses Involving Stolen Property; Property Damage or De-\r\nstruction; Fraud and Deceit; Forgery; Offenses involving Altered or Counterfeit Instru-\r\nments Other than Counterfeit Bearer Obligations of the United States). The Commis-\r\nsion concluded that §2B1.1 is the appropriate guideline because the elements of the\r\nnew offense include fraud and deceit. The amendment also amended Appendix A by\r\nrevising the other criminal subsections, which continue to be referred to §2H3.1 (In-\r\nterception of Communications; Eavesdropping; Disclosure of Certain Private or Pro-\r\ntected Information), to accord with the reorganization of the statute.\r\nNinth, the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act, passed as part of the\r\nAct, included a provision expanding subsection (c) of 18 U.S.C. § 2423 (Transportation\r\nof minors), which had previously prohibited U.S. citizens or permanent residents who\r\ntraveled abroad from engaging in illicit sexual conduct. After the Act, the same prohi-\r\nbition now also applies to those individuals who reside temporarily or permanently in\r\na foreign country and engage in such conduct. Section 2423 contains four offenses, set\r\nforth in subsections (a) through (d), each of which prohibits sexual conduct with mi-\r\nnors. Prior to the amendment, Appendix A referenced sections 2423(a) and 2423(b) to\r\n§2G1.3 (Commercial Sex Act or Prohibited Sexual Conduct with a Minor; Transporta-\r\ntion of Minors; Travel to Engage in Commercial Sex or Prohibited Sexual Conduct with\r\na Minor; Sex Trafficking of Children), but provided no reference for sections 2423(c) or\r\n2423(d), which prohibits arranging, inducing, procuring, or facilitating the travel of a\r\nperson for illicit sexual conduct, for the purpose of commercial advantage or financial\r\ngain. Both subsections (c) and (d) provide a 30 year statutory maximum term of im-\r\nprisonment.\r\nThe amendment adds references in Appendix A for 18 U.S.C. §§ 2423(c) and (d). Based\r\non the seriousness of the prohibited conduct, the severity of the penalties, and the vul-\r\nnerability of the victims involved, the Commission concluded that 18 U.S.C. §§ 2423(c)\r\nand (d) should also be referenced in Appendix A to §2G1.3.\r\nTenth, the Act created a new Class A misdemeanor offense at 18 U.S.C. § 1597 prohib-\r\niting the knowing destruction, concealment, confiscation or possession of an actual or\r\npurported passport or other immigration documents of another individual if done in\r\nthe course of violating or with the intent to violate 18 U.S.C. § 1351, relating to fraud\r\nin foreign labor contracting, or 8 U.S.C. § 1324, relating to bringing in or harboring\r\ncertain aliens. The new offense also prohibits this conduct if it is done in order to,\r\nwithout lawful authority, maintain, prevent, or restrict the labor or services of the in-\r\ndividual, and the knowing obstruction, attempt to obstruct, or interference with or pre-\r\nvention of the enforcement of section 1597. Section 1597 has a statutory maximum\r\nterm of imprisonment of one year.\r\nThe amendment references this misdemeanor offense to §2X5.2 (Class A Misdemean-\r\nors (Not Covered by Another Specific Offense Guideline)). This reference comports with\r\nAmendment 782\r\nthe Commission’s intent when it promulgated §2X5.2, as stated in Amendment 685\r\n(effective November 1, 2006), that the Commission will reference new Class A misde-\r\nmeanor offenses either to §2X5.2 or to another, more specific Chapter Two guideline,\r\nif appropriate. The Commission determined that with a base offense level of 6, §2X5.2\r\ncovers the range of sentencing possibilities that are available for defendants convicted\r\nof this offense, regardless of their criminal history. The Commission may consider ref-\r\nerencing section 1597 to another substantive guideline in the future after more infor-\r\nmation becomes available regarding the type of conduct that constitutes the typical\r\nviolation and the aggravating or mitigating factors that may apply.\r\nFinally, the amendment removes from Appendix A the guideline references for two\r\njurisdictional statutes in title 18 related to crimes committed within Indian country.\r\nSection 1152, also known as the General Crimes Act, grants federal jurisdiction for\r\nfederal offenses committed by non-Indians within Indian country. Section 1153, also\r\nknown as the Major Crimes Act, grants federal jurisdiction over Indians who commit\r\ncertain enumerated offenses within Indian country. The Act expanded section 1153 to\r\ninclude any felony assault under section 113. Because sections 1152 and 1153 are\r\nsimply jurisdictional statutes that do not provide substantive offenses, the Commission\r\ndetermined there is no need for Appendix A to provide a guidelines reference for those\r\nstatutes.","EffectiveDate":"Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2014."},{"Id":782,"Title":"Amendment 782","Text":"Section 2D1.1(c) is amended by striking paragraph (17);

Attempt or Conspiracy) incorporate\r\nthe statutory mandatory minimum penalties for such offenses.\r\nWhen Congress passed the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986, Pub. L. 99–570, the Commis-\r\nsion responded by generally incorporating the statutory mandatory minimum sen-\r\ntences into the guidelines and extrapolating upward and downward to set guideline\r\nsentencing ranges for all drug quantities. The quantity thresholds in the Drug Quan-\r\ntity Table were set so as to provide base offense levels corresponding to guideline\r\nranges that were slightly above the statutory mandatory minimum penalties. Accord-\r\ningly, offenses involving drug quantities that trigger a five-year statutory minimum\r\nwere assigned a base offense level (level 26) corresponding to a sentencing guideline\r\nrange of 63 to 78 months for a defendant in Criminal History Category I (a guideline\r\nrange that exceeds the five-year statutory minimum for such offenses by at least three\r\nmonths). Similarly, offenses that trigger a ten-year statutory minimum were assigned\r\na base offense level (level 32) corresponding to a sentencing guideline range of 121 to\r\n151 months for a defendant in Criminal History Category I (a guideline range that\r\nexceeds the ten-year statutory minimum for such offenses by at least one month). The\r\nbase offense levels for drug quantities above and below the mandatory minimum\r\nthreshold quantities were extrapolated upward and downward to set guideline sen-\r\ntencing ranges for all drug quantities, see §2D1.1, comment. (backg’d.), with a mini-\r\nmum base offense level of 6 and a maximum base offense level of 38 for most drug\r\ntypes.\r\nThis amendment changes how the applicable statutory mandatory minimum penalties\r\nare incorporated into the Drug Quantity Table while maintaining consistency with\r\nsuch penalties. See 28 U.S.C. § 994(b)(1) (providing that each sentencing range must\r\nbe “consistent with all pertinent provisions of title 18, United States Code”);\r\nsee also 28 U.S.C. § 994(a) (providing that the Commission shall promulgate guide-\r\nlines and policy statements “consistent with all pertinent provisions of any Federal\r\nstatute”).\r\nSpecifically, the amendment reduces by two levels the offense levels assigned to the\r\nquantities that trigger the statutory mandatory minimum penalties, resulting in cor-\r\nresponding guideline ranges that include the mandatory minimum penalties. Accord-\r\ningly, offenses involving drug quantities that trigger a five-year statutory minimum\r\nare assigned a base offense level of 24 (51 to 63 months at Criminal History Category I,\r\nwhich includes the five-year (60 month) statutory minimum for such offenses), and\r\noffenses involving drug quantities that trigger a ten-year statutory minimum are as-\r\nsigned a base offense level of 30 (97 to 121 months at Criminal History Category I,\r\nAmendment 782\r\nwhich includes the ten-year (120 month) statutory minimum for such offenses). Of-\r\nfense levels for quantities above and below the mandatory minimum threshold quan-\r\ntities similarly are adjusted downward by two levels, except that the minimum base\r\noffense level of 6 and the maximum base offense level of 38 for most drug types is\r\nretained, as are previously existing minimum and maximum base offense levels for\r\nparticular drug types.\r\nThe amendment also makes parallel changes to the quantity tables in §2D1.11 (Un-\r\nlawfully Distributing, Importing, Exporting or Possessing a Listed Chemical; Attempt\r\nor Conspiracy), which apply to offenses involving chemical precursors of controlled sub-\r\nstances. Section 2D1.11 is generally structured to provide offense levels that are tied\r\nto, but less severe than, the base offense levels in §2D1.1 for offenses involving the\r\nfinal product.\r\nIn considering this amendment, the Commission held a hearing on March 13, 2014,\r\nand heard expert testimony from the Executive Branch, including the Attorney Gen-\r\neral and the Director of the Federal Bureau of Prisons, defense practitioners, state and\r\nlocal law enforcement, and interested community representatives. The Commission\r\nalso received substantial written public comment, including from the Federal judici-\r\nary, members of Congress, academicians, community organizations, law enforcement\r\ngroups, and individual members of the public.\r\nThe Commission determined that setting the base offense levels slightly above the\r\nmandatory minimum penalties is no longer necessary to achieve its stated purpose.\r\nPreviously, the Commission has stated that “[t]he base offense levels are set at guide-\r\nline ranges slightly higher than the mandatory minimum levels [levels 26 and 32] to\r\npermit some downward adjustment for defendants who plead guilty or otherwise coop-\r\nerate with authorities.” However, changes in the law and recent experience with simi-\r\nlar reductions in base offense levels for crack cocaine offenses indicate that setting the\r\nbase offense levels above the mandatory minimum penalties is no longer necessary to\r\nprovide adequate incentives to plead guilty or otherwise cooperate with authorities.\r\nIn 1994, after the initial selection of levels 26 and 32, Congress enacted the “safety\r\nvalve” provision, which applies to certain non-violent drug defendants and allows the\r\ncourt, without a government motion, to impose a sentence below a statutory mandatory\r\nminimum penalty if the court finds, among other things, that the defendant “has truth-\r\nfully provided to the Government all information and evidence the defendant has con-\r\ncerning the offense or offenses that were part of the same course of conduct or of a\r\ncommon scheme or plan.” See 18 U.S.C. § 3553(f). The guidelines incorporate the\r\n“safety valve” at §5C1.2 (Limitation on Applicability of Statutory Minimum Sentences\r\nin Certain Cases) and, furthermore, provide a 2-level reduction if the defendant meets\r\nthe “safety valve” criteria. See §2D1.1(b)(16).\r\nThese statutory and guideline provisions, which are unrelated to the guideline range’s\r\nrelationship to the mandatory minimum, provide adequate incentive to plead guilty.\r\nCommission data indicate that defendants charged with a mandatory minimum pen-\r\nalty in fact are more likely to plead guilty if they qualify for the “safety valve” than if\r\nthey do not. In fiscal year 2012, drug trafficking defendants charged with a mandatory\r\nminimum penalty had a plea rate of 99.6 percent if they qualified for the “safety valve”\r\nand a plea rate of 93.9 percent if they did not.\r\nRecent experience with similar reductions in the base offense levels for crack cocaine\r\noffenses indicates that the amendment should not negatively affect the rates at which\r\nAmendment 782\r\n72 ║ Supplement to Appendix C (November 1, 2016)\r\noffenders plead guilty or otherwise cooperate with authorities. Similar to this amend-\r\nment, the Commission in 2007 amended the Drug Quantity Table for cocaine base\r\n(“crack” cocaine) so that the quantities that trigger mandatory minimum penalties\r\nwere assigned base offense levels 24 and 30, rather than 26 and 32. See USSG App. C,\r\nAmendment 706 (effective November 1, 2007). In 2010, in implementing the emergency\r\ndirective in section 8 of the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010, Pub. L. 111–220, the Commis-\r\nsion moved crack cocaine offenses back to a guideline penalty structure based on lev-\r\nels 26 and 32.\r\nDuring the period when crack cocaine offenses had a guideline penalty structure based\r\non levels 24 and 30, the overall rates at which crack cocaine defendants pled guilty\r\nremained stable. Specifically, in the fiscal year before the 2007 amendment took effect,\r\nthe plea rate for crack cocaine defendants was 93.1 percent. In the two fiscal years\r\nafter the 2007 amendment took effect, the plea rates for such defendants were 95.2 per-\r\ncent and 94.0 percent, respectively. For those same fiscal years, the overall rates at\r\nwhich crack cocaine defendants received substantial assistance departures under\r\n§5K1.1 (Substantial Assistance to Authorities) were 27.8 percent in the fiscal year be-\r\nfore the 2007 amendment took effect and 25.3 percent and 25.6 percent in the two fiscal\r\nyears after the 2007 amendment took effect. This recent experience indicates that this\r\namendment, which is similar in nature to the 2007 crack cocaine amendment, should\r\nnot negatively affect the willingness of defendants to plead guilty or otherwise cooper-\r\nate with authorities. See 28 U.S.C. § 991(b) (specifying that sentencing policies are to\r\n“reflect, to the extent practicable, advancement in knowledge of human behavior as it\r\nrelates to the criminal justice process”).\r\nThe amendment also reflects the fact that the guidelines now more adequately differ-\r\nentiate among drug trafficking offenders than when the Drug Quantity Table was ini-\r\ntially established. Since the initial selection of offense levels 26 and 32, the guidelines\r\nhave been amended many times — often in response to congressional directives — to\r\nprovide a greater emphasis on the defendant’s conduct and role in the offense rather\r\nthan on drug quantity. The version of §2D1.1 in the original 1987 Guidelines Manual\r\ncontained a single specific offense characteristic: a 2-level enhancement if a firearm or\r\nother dangerous weapon was possessed. Section 2D1.1 in effect at the time of this\r\namendment contains fourteen enhancements and three downward adjustments (in-\r\ncluding the “mitigating role cap” provided in subsection (a)(5)). These numerous ad-\r\njustments, both increasing and decreasing offense levels based on specific conduct, re-\r\nduce the need to rely on drug quantity in setting the guideline penalties for drug traf-\r\nficking offenders as a proxy for culpability, and the amendment permits these adjust-\r\nments to differentiate among offenders more effectively.\r\nThe amendment was also motived by the significant overcapacity and costs of the Fed-\r\neral Bureau of Prisons. The Sentencing Reform Act directs the Commission to ensure\r\nthat the sentencing guidelines are “formulated to minimize the likelihood that the Fed-\r\neral prison population will exceed the capacity of the Federal prisons.” See 28 U.S.C.\r\n§ 994(g). Reducing the federal prison population and the costs of incarceration has be-\r\ncome an urgent consideration. The Commission observed that the federal prisons are\r\nnow 32 percent overcapacity, and drug trafficking offenders account for approximately\r\n50 percent of the federal prison population (100,114 of 199,810 inmates as of Octo-\r\nber 26, 2013, for whom the Commission could determine the offense of conviction).\r\nSpending on federal prisons exceeds $6 billion a year, or more than 25 percent of the\r\nentire budget for the Department of Justice. The Commission received testimony from\r\nthe Department of Justice and others that spending on federal prisons is now crowding\r\nout resources available for federal prosecutors and law enforcement, aid to state and\r\nAmendment 783\r\nlocal law enforcement, crime victim services, and crime prevention programs, all of\r\nwhich promote public safety.\r\nIn response to these concerns, the Commission considered the amendment an appro-\r\npriate step toward alleviating the overcapacity of the federal prisons. Based on an\r\nanalysis of the 24,968 offenders sentenced under §2D1.1 in fiscal year 2012, the Com-\r\nmission estimates the amendment will affect the sentences of 17,457 — or 69.9 percent\r\n— of drug trafficking offenders sentenced under §2D1.1, and their average sentence\r\nwill be reduced by 11 months — or 17.7 percent — from 62 months to 51 months. The\r\nCommission estimates these sentence reductions will correspond to a reduction in the\r\nfederal prison population of approximately 6,500 inmates within five years after its\r\neffective date.\r\nThe Commission carefully weighed public safety concerns and, based on past experi-\r\nence, existing statutory and guideline enhancements, and expert testimony, concluded\r\nthat the amendment should not jeopardize public safety. In particular, the Commission\r\nwas informed by its studies that compared the recidivism rates for offenders who were\r\nreleased early as a result of retroactive application of the Commission’s 2007 crack\r\ncocaine amendment with a control group of offenders who served their full terms of\r\nimprisonment. See USSG App. C, Amendment 713 (effective March 3, 2008). The Com-\r\nmission detected no statistically significant difference in the rates of recidivism for the\r\ntwo groups of offenders after two years, and again after five years. This study suggests\r\nthat modest reductions in drug penalties such as those provided by the amendment\r\nwill not increase the risk of recidivism.\r\nFurthermore, existing statutory enhancements, such as those available under\r\n18 U.S.C. § 924(c), and guideline enhancements for offenders who possess firearms,\r\nuse violence, have an aggravating role in the offense, or are repeat or career offenders,\r\nensure that the most dangerous or serious offenders will continue to receive appropri-\r\nately severe sentences. In addition, the Drug Quantity Table as amended still provides\r\na base offense level of 38 for offenders who traffic the greatest quantities of most drug\r\ntypes and, therefore, sentences for these offenders will not be reduced. Similarly, the\r\nDrug Quantity Table as amended maintains minimum base offense levels that pre-\r\nclude sentences of straight probation for drug trafficking offenders with small quanti-\r\nties of most drug types.\r\nFinally, the Commission relied on testimony from the Department of Justice that the\r\namendment would not undermine public safety or law enforcement initiatives. To the\r\ncontrary, the Commission received testimony from several stakeholders that the\r\namendment would permit resources otherwise dedicated to housing prisoners to be\r\nused to reduce overcrowding, enhance programming designed to reduce the risk of re-\r\ncidivism, and to increase law enforcement and crime prevention efforts, thereby en-\r\nhancing public safety.","EffectiveDate":"Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2014."},{"Id":783,"Title":"Amendment 783","Text":"Section 2D1.1(b) is amended by redesignating paragraphs (14) through\r\n(16) as paragraphs (15) through (17), respectively; and by inserting after para-\r\ngraph (13) the following new paragraph (14):\r\nAmendment 783\r\n74 ║ Supplement to Appendix C (November 1, 2016)\r\n“(14) If (A) the offense involved the cultivation of marihuana on state or federal land\r\nor while trespassing on tribal or private land; and (B) the defendant receives\r\nan adjustment under §3B1.1 (Aggravating Role), increase by 2 levels.”.\r\nThe Commentary to §2D1.1 captioned “Application Notes” is amended in Note 16 by\r\nstriking “(b)(14)(D)” and inserting “(b)(15)(D)”; by redesignating Notes 19 through 26\r\nas Notes 20 through 27, respectively; and by inserting after Note 18 the following new\r\nNote 19:\r\n“19.

The concerns included the fact that such operations\r\ntypically involve acts such as clearing existing vegetation, diverting natural water\r\nsources for irrigation, using potentially harmful chemicals, killing wild animals, and\r\nleaving trash and debris at the site. The concerns also included the risk to public safety\r\nof marihuana cultivation operations on federal or state land or while trespassing on\r\ntribal or private land. Additionally, when an operation is located on public land or on\r\nprivate land without the owner’s permission, the operation deprives the public or the\r\nowner of lawful access to and use of the land.\r\nAccordingly, this amendment provides an increase of two levels when a marihuana\r\ncultivation operation is located on state or federal land or while trespassing on tribal\r\nor private land, but only applies to defendants who received an adjustment under\r\n§3B1.1 (Aggravating Role).

Defendant A’s offense of\r\nconviction is for unlawfully possessing a shotgun on October 15. The\r\ncourt determines that, on the preceding February 10, Defendant A\r\nused the shotgun in connection with a robbery. Ordinarily, under these\r\ncircumstances, subsection (b)(6)(B) applies, and the cross reference in\r\nsubsection (c)(1) also applies if it results in a greater offense level.\r\nOrdinarily, the unlawful possession of the shotgun on February 10 will\r\nbe ‘part of the same course of conduct or common scheme or plan’ as\r\nthe unlawful possession of the same shotgun on October 15.\r\nSee §1B1.3(a)(2) and accompanying commentary (including, in partic-\r\nular, the factors discussed in Application Note 9 to §1B1.3). The use of\r\nthe shotgun ‘in connection with’ the robbery is relevant conduct be-\r\ncause it is a factor specified in subsections (b)(6)(B) and (c)(1).\r\nSee §1B1.3(a)(4) (‘any other information specified in the applicable\r\nguideline’).\r\n(ii) Firearm Not Cited in the Offense of Conviction. Defendant B’s offense\r\nof conviction is for unlawfully possessing a shotgun on October 15. The\r\ncourt determines that, on the preceding February 10, Defendant B un-\r\nlawfully possessed a handgun (not cited in the offense of conviction)\r\nand used the handgun in connection with a robbery.\r\nSubsection (b)(6)(B). In determining whether subsection (b)(6)(B) ap-\r\nplies, the threshold question for the court is whether the two unlawful\r\npossession offenses (the shotgun on October 15 and the handgun on\r\nFebruary 10) were ‘part of the same course of conduct or common\r\nscheme or plan’. See §1B1.3(a)(2) and accompanying commentary (in-\r\ncluding, in particular, the factors discussed in Application Note 9 to\r\n§1B1.3).\r\nIf they were, then the handgun possession offense is relevant conduct\r\nto the shotgun possession offense, and the use of the handgun ‘in con-\r\nnection with’ the robbery is relevant conduct because it is a factor spec-\r\nified in subsection (b)(6)(B).

Accordingly, subsection (b)(6)(B)\r\napplies.\r\nOn the other hand, if the court determines that the two unlawful pos-\r\nsession offenses were not ‘part of the same course of conduct or common\r\nscheme or plan,’ then the handgun possession offense is not relevant\r\nconduct to the shotgun possession offense and subsection (b)(6)(B) does\r\nnot apply.\r\nSubsection (c)(1). Under these circumstances, the cross reference in\r\nsubsection (c)(1) does not apply, because the handgun was not cited in\r\nthe offense of conviction.”.\r\nAmendment 784","Reason":"REASON FOR AMENDMENT: This amendment addresses cases in which the defendant is\r\nconvicted of a firearms offense (in particular, being a felon in possession of a firearm)\r\nand also possessed a firearm in connection with another offense, such as robbery or\r\nattempted murder.\r\nIn such a case, the defendant is sentenced under the firearms guideline, §2K2.1 (Un-\r\nlawful Receipt, Possession, or Transportation of Firearms or Ammunition; Prohibited\r\nTransactions Involving Firearms or Ammunition). If the defendant possessed any fire-\r\narm in connection with another felony offense, subsection (b)(6)(B) provides a 4-level\r\nenhancement and a minimum offense level of 18. If the defendant possessed any fire-\r\narm in connection with another offense, subsection (c)(1) provides a cross reference to\r\nthe offense guideline applicable to the other offense, if it results in a higher offense\r\nlevel. (For example, if the defendant possessed any firearm in connection with a rob-\r\nbery, a cross reference to the robbery guideline may apply.)\r\nThis amendment is a result of the Commission’s review of the operation of subsections\r\n(b)(6)(B) and (c)(1). The review was prompted in part because circuits have been fol-\r\nlowing a range of approaches in determining whether these provisions apply. Several\r\ncircuits have taken the view that subsections (b)(6)(B) and (c)(1) apply only if the other\r\noffense is a “groupable” offense under §3D1.2(d). See, e.g., United States v. Horton,\r\n693 F.3d 463, 478–79 (4th Cir. 2012) (felon in possession used a firearm in connection\r\nwith a murder, but the cross reference does not apply because murder is not “groupa-\r\nble”); United States v. Settle, 414 F.3d 629, 632–33 (6th Cir. 2005) (attempted murder);\r\nUnited States v. Jones, 313 F.3d 1019, 1023 n.3 (7th Cir. 2002) (murder); United States\r\nv. Williams, 431 F.3d 767, 772–73 & n.9 (11th Cir. 2005) (aggravated assault).\r\nBut see United States v. Kulick, 629 F.3d 165, 170 (3d Cir. 2010) (felon in possession\r\nused a firearm in connection with extortion; the cross reference may apply even though\r\nextortion is not “groupable”); United States v. Gonzales, 996 F.2d 88, 92 n.6 (5th Cir.\r\n1993) (relevant conduct principles do not restrict the application of subsec-\r\ntion (b)(6)(B)); United States v. Outley, 348 F.3d 476 (5th Cir. 2003) (relevant conduct\r\nprinciples do not restrict the application of subsection (c)(1)).\r\nThe amendment clarifies how relevant conduct principles operate in determining\r\nwhether subsections (b)(6)(B) and (c)(1) apply. Subsections (b)(6)(B) and (c)(1) are not\r\nintended to apply only when the other felony offense is a “groupable” offense. Such an\r\napproach would result in unwarranted disparities, with defendants who possess a fire-\r\narm in connection with a “groupable” offense (such as a drug offense) being subject to\r\nhigher penalties than defendants who possess a firearm in connection with a “non-\r\ngroupable” offense (such as murder or robbery). Instead, the central question for the\r\ncourt in these cases is whether the defendant’s two firearms offenses — the firearms\r\noffense of conviction, and his unlawful possession of a firearm in connection with the\r\nother felony offense — were “part of the same course of conduct or common scheme or\r\nplan.” See §1B1.3(a)(2). The amendment adds examples to the commentary to clarify\r\nhow relevant conduct principles are intended to operate in this context.\r\nThe amendment also responds to concerns regarding the impact of subsection (c)(1),\r\nparticularly in cases in which the defendant was convicted of unlawfully possessing a\r\nfirearm on one occasion but was found to have possessed a different firearm on another\r\noccasion in connection with another, more serious, offense. Because unlawfully pos-\r\nsessing a firearm is an offense based on a status (i.e., being a felon) that can continue\r\nfor many years, the cross reference at subsection (c)(1) may, in effect, expose such a\r\ndefendant to the highest offense level of any crime he may have committed at any time,\r\nregardless of its connection to the instant offense.\r\nAmendment 785\r\n78 ║ Supplement to Appendix C (November 1, 2016)\r\nWhile relevant conduct principles provide a limitation on the scope of subsection (c)(1)\r\n(and, as discussed above, this amendment clarifies how those principles operate in this\r\ncontext), the Commission determined that a further limitation on the scope of subsec-\r\ntion (c)(1) is appropriate. Specifically, the instant offense and the other offense must\r\nbe related to each other by, at a minimum, having an identifiable firearm in common.\r\nAccordingly, the amendment revises the cross reference so that it applies only to the\r\nparticular firearm or firearms cited in the offense of conviction.","EffectiveDate":"Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2014."},{"Id":785,"Title":"Amendment 785","Text":"The Commentary to §2L1.1 captioned “Application Notes” is amended in\r\nNote 5 after “vehicle” by striking the comma and inserting a semicolon; after “vessel”\r\nby striking “, or” and inserting a semicolon; and after “inhumane condition” by insert-\r\ning the following: “; or guiding persons through, or abandoning persons in, a dangerous\r\nor remote geographic area without adequate food, water, clothing, or protection from\r\nthe elements”.","Reason":"REASON FOR AMENDMENT: This amendment accounts for the risks of death, injury,\r\nstarvation, dehydration, or exposure that aliens potentially face when transported\r\nthrough dangerous and remote geographical areas, e.g., along the southern border of\r\nthe United States.\r\nSection 2L1.1 (Smuggling, Transporting, or Harboring an Unlawful Alien) currently\r\nhas an enhancement at subsection (b)(6), which provides for a 2-level increase and a\r\nminimum offense level of 18, for intentionally or recklessly creating a substantial risk\r\nof death or serious bodily injury to another person.

The Fifth Circuit emphasized that it\r\nis not enough to say, as the district court had, that traversing an entire geographical\r\nregion is inherently dangerous, but that it must be dangerous on the facts presented\r\nto and used by the district court. The Fifth Circuit identified such pertinent facts from\r\nits prior case law as the length of the journey, the temperature, whether the aliens\r\nwere provided food and water and allowed rest periods, and whether the aliens suffered\r\ninjuries and death. See, e.g., United States v. Garcia-Guerrero, 313 F.3d 892 (5th Cir.\r\n2002). Additional facts that have supported the enhancement include: whether the al-\r\niens were abandoned en route, the time of year during which the journey took place,\r\nthe distance traveled, and whether the aliens were adequately clothed for the journey.\r\nSee, e.g., United States v. Chapa, 362 Fed. App’x 411 (5th Cir. 2010); United States v.\r\nDe Jesus-Ojeda, 515 F.3d 434 (5th Cir. 2008); United States v. Hernandez-Pena,\r\n267 Fed. App’x 367 (5th Cir. 2008); United States v. Rodriguez-Cruz, 255 F.3d 1054\r\n(9th Cir. 2001).\r\nAmendment 786\r\nThe amendment adds to Application Note 5 the following new example of the conduct\r\nto which §2L1.1(b)(6) could apply: “or guiding persons through, or abandoning persons\r\nin, a dangerous or remote geographic area without adequate food, water, clothing, or\r\nprotection from the elements.” The Commission determined that this new example will\r\nclarify application of subsection (b)(6), highlight the potential risks in these types of\r\ncases, provide guidance for the courts to determine whether to apply the enhancement,\r\nand promote uniformity in sentencing by providing factors to consider when determin-\r\ning whether to apply §2L1.1(b)(6).","EffectiveDate":"Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2014."},{"Id":786,"Title":"Amendment 786","Text":"The Commentary to §5D1.2 captioned “Application Notes” is amended in\r\nNote 1, in the paragraph that begins “ ‘Sex offense’ means”, in subparagraph (A), by\r\nstriking “(ii) chapter 109B of such title;”, and by redesignating clauses (iii) through (vi)\r\nas clauses (ii) through (v), respectively; in subparagraph (B) by striking “(vi)” and in-\r\nserting “(v)”; and by adding at the end as the last sentence the following: “Such term\r\ndoes not include an offense under 18 U.S.C. § 2250 (Failure to register).”.\r\nThe Commentary to §5D1.2 captioned “Application Notes” is amended by adding at the\r\nend the following new Note 6:\r\n“6. Application of Subsection (c).—Subsection (c) specifies how a statutorily re-\r\nquired minimum term of supervised release may affect the minimum term of\r\nsupervised release provided by the guidelines.\r\nFor example, if subsection (a) provides a range of two years to five years, but\r\nthe relevant statute requires a minimum term of supervised release of three\r\nyears and a maximum term of life, the term of supervised release provided by\r\nthe guidelines is restricted by subsection (c) to three years to five years. Simi-\r\nlarly, if subsection (a) provides a range of two years to five years, but the rele-\r\nvant statute requires a minimum term of supervised release of five years and\r\na maximum term of life, the term of supervised release provided by the guide-\r\nlines is five years.\r\nThe following example illustrates the interaction of subsections (a) and (c)\r\nwhen subsection (b) is also involved. In this example, subsection (a) provides a\r\nrange of two years to five years; the relevant statute requires a minimum term\r\nof supervised release of five years and a maximum term of life; and the offense\r\nis a sex offense under subsection (b). The effect of subsection (b) is to raise the\r\nmaximum term of supervised release from five years (as provided by subsec-\r\ntion (a)) to life, yielding a range of two years to life. The term of supervised\r\nrelease provided by the guidelines is then restricted by subsection (c) to five\r\nyears to life. In this example, a term of supervised release of more than five\r\nyears would be a guideline sentence. In addition, subsection (b) contains a pol-\r\nicy statement recommending that the maximum — a life term of supervised\r\nrelease — be imposed.”.","Reason":"REASON FOR AMENDMENT: This amendment resolves a circuit conflict and a related\r\nguideline application issue about the calculation of terms of supervised release. The\r\nAmendment 786\r\n80 ║ Supplement to Appendix C (November 1, 2016)\r\ncircuit conflict involves defendants sentenced under statutes providing for mandatory\r\nminimum terms of supervised release, while the application issue relates specifically\r\nto defendants convicted of failure to register as a sex offender, in violation of 18 U.S.C.\r\n§ 2250.\r\nThe guideline term of supervised release is determined by §5D1.2 (Term of Supervised\r\nRelease). Section 5D1.2(a) sets forth general rules for determining the guideline term\r\nof supervised release, based on the statutory classification of the offense.\r\nSee §5D1.2(a)(1)–(3); 18 U.S.C. § 3559 (sentencing classification of offenses). For cer-\r\ntain terrorism-related and sex offenses, §5D1.2(b) operates to replace the top end of\r\nthe guideline term calculated under subsection (a) with a life term of supervised re-\r\nlease. In the case of a “sex offense,” as defined by Application Note 1 to §5D1.2, a policy\r\nstatement recommends that a life term of supervised release be imposed.\r\nSee §5D1.2(b), p.s. Finally, §5D1.2(c) states that “the term of supervised release im-\r\nposed shall be not less than any statutorily required term of supervised release.”\r\nWhen a Statutory Minimum Term of Supervised Release Applies\r\nFirst, there appear to be differences among the circuits in how to calculate the guide-\r\nline term of supervised release when there is a statutory minimum term of supervised\r\nrelease. These cases involve the meaning of subsection (c) and its interaction with sub-\r\nsection (a).\r\nThe Seventh Circuit has held that when there is a statutory minimum term of super-\r\nvised release, the statutory minimum term becomes the bottom of the guideline range\r\n(replacing the bottom of the term provided by (a)) and, if the statutory minimum equals\r\nor exceeds the top of the guideline term provided by subsection (a), the guideline\r\n“range” becomes a single point at the statutory minimum. United States v. Gibbs,\r\n578 F.3d 694, 695 (7th Cir. 2009). Thus, if subsection (a) provides a range of three to\r\nfive years, but the statute provides a range of five years to life, the “range” is precisely\r\nfive years. Gibbs involved a drug offense for which 21 U.S.C. § 841(b) required a su-\r\npervised release term of five years to life. See also United States v. Goodwin, 717 F.3d\r\n511, 519–20 (7th Cir. 2013) (applying Gibbs to a case involving a failure to register for\r\nwhich 18 U.S.C. § 3583(k) required a supervised release term of five years to life).\r\nThese cases are in tension with the approach of the Eighth Circuit in United States v.\r\nDeans, 590 F.3d 907, 911 (8th Cir. 2010). In Deans, the range calculated under sub-\r\nsection (a) was two to three years of supervised release. However, the relevant statute,\r\n21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(C), provided a range of three years to life. Under the Seventh\r\nCircuit’s approach in Gibbs, the guideline “range” would be precisely three years. With-\r\nout reference to Gibbs, the Eighth Circuit in Deans indicated that the statutory re-\r\nquirement “trumps” subsection (a), and the guideline range becomes the statutory\r\nrange — three years to life. 590 F.3d at 911. Thus, the district court’s imposition of five\r\nyears of supervised release “was neither an upward departure nor procedural er-\r\nror.” Id.\r\nThe amendment adopts the approach of the Seventh Circuit in Gibbs and Goodwin.\r\nThe amendment provides a new Application Note and examples explaining that, under\r\nsubsection (c), a statutorily required minimum term of supervised release operates to\r\nrestrict the low end of the guideline term of supervised release.\r\nThe Commission determined that this resolution was most consistent with its statu-\r\ntory obligation to determine the “appropriate length” of supervised release terms, and\r\nwith how a statutory minimum term of imprisonment operates to restrict the range of\r\nAmendment 786\r\nimprisonment provided by the guidelines. See 28 U.S.C. § 994(a)(1)(c); USSG\r\n§5G1.1(a). This outcome is also consistent with the Commission’s 2010 report on su-\r\npervised release, which found that most supervised release violations occur in the first\r\nyear after release from incarceration. See U.S. Sentencing Comm’n, Federal Offenders\r\nSentenced to Supervised Release, at 63 & n. 265 (July 2010). If an offender shows\r\nnon-compliance during the initial term of supervised release, the court may extend the\r\nterm of supervision up to the statutory maximum, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3583(e)(2).\r\nWhen the Defendant is Convicted of Failure to Register as a Sex Offender\r\nSecond, there are differences among the circuits over how to calculate the guideline\r\nrange of supervised release when a defendant is convicted, under 18 U.S.C. § 2250, of\r\nfailing to register as a sex offender. That offense carries a statutory minimum term of\r\nsupervised release of at least five years, with a term up to life permitted. See 18 U.S.C.\r\n§ 3583(k).\r\nThere is an application issue about when, if at all, such an offense is a “sex offense” for\r\npurposes of subsection (b) of §5D1.2. If a failure to register is a sex offense, then sub-\r\nsection (b) specifically provides for a term of supervised release of anywhere from the\r\nminimum provided by subsection (a) to the maximum provided by statute (i.e., life),\r\nand a policy statement contained within subsection (b) recommends that the maximum\r\nbe imposed. See §5D1.2(b), p.s. Another effect of the determination is that, if failure to\r\nregister is a “sex offense,” the guidelines recommend that special conditions of super-\r\nvised release also be imposed, such as participating in a sex offender monitoring pro-\r\ngram and submitting to warrantless searches. See §5D1.3(d)(7).\r\nApplication Note 1 defines “sex offense” to mean, among other things, “an offense, per-\r\npetrated against a minor, under” chapter 109B of title 18 (the only section of which is\r\nSection 2250). Circuits have reached different conclusions about the effect of this defi-\r\nnition.\r\nThe Seventh Circuit has held that a failure to register can never be a “sex offense”\r\nwithin the meaning of Note 1. United States v. Goodwin, 717 F.3d 511, 518–20 (7th Cir.\r\n2013); see also United States v. Segura, 747 F.3d 323, 329 (5th Cir. 2014) (agreeing\r\nwith Goodwin). The court in Goodwin reasoned that there is no specific victim of a\r\nfailure to register, and therefore a failure to register is never “perpetrated against a\r\nminor” and can never be a “sex offense” — rendering the definition’s inclusion of of-\r\nfenses under chapter 109B “surplusage.” 717 F.3d at 518. In an unpublished opinion,\r\nthe Second Circuit has determined that a failure to register was not a “sex offense.”\r\nSee United States v. Herbert, 428 Fed. App’x 37 (2d Cir. 2011). In both cases, the gov-\r\nernment argued for these outcomes, confessing error below.\r\nThere are unpublished decisions in other circuits that have reached different results,\r\nwithout discussion. In those cases, the defendant had a prior sex offense against a\r\nminor, and the circuit court determined that the failure to register was a “sex offense.”\r\nSee United States v. Zeiders, 440 Fed. App’x 699, 701 (11th Cir. 2011); United States\r\nv. Nelson, 400 Fed. App’x 781 (4th Cir. 2010).\r\nThe Commission agrees with the Seventh Circuit that failure to register is not an of-\r\nfense that is “perpetrated against a minor.” In addition, expert testimony and research\r\nreviewed by the Commission indicated that commission of a failure-to-register offense\r\nis not correlated with sex offense recidivism. The amendment resolves the application\r\nAmendment 787\r\n82 ║ Supplement to Appendix C (November 1, 2016)\r\nissue by amending the commentary to §5D1.2 to clarify that offenses under Sec-\r\ntion 2250 are not “sex offenses.”","EffectiveDate":"Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2014."},{"Id":787,"Title":"Amendment 787","Text":"The Commentary to §2L1.2 captioned “Application Notes” is amended by\r\nredesignating Note 8 as Note 9 and by inserting after Note 7 the following new Note 8:\r\n“8. Departure Based on Time Served in State Custody.—In a case in which the\r\ndefendant is located by immigration authorities while the defendant is serving\r\ntime in state custody, whether pre- or post-conviction, for a state offense, the\r\ntime served is not covered by an adjustment under §5G1.3(b) and, accordingly,\r\nis not covered by a departure under §5K2.23 (Discharged Terms of Imprison-\r\nment). See §5G1.3(a). In such a case, the court may consider whether a depar-\r\nture is appropriate to reflect all or part of the time served in state custody, from\r\nthe time immigration authorities locate the defendant until the service of the\r\nfederal sentence commences, that the court determines will not be credited to\r\nthe federal sentence by the Bureau of Prisons. Any such departure should be\r\nfashioned to achieve a reasonable punishment for the instant offense.\r\nSuch a departure should be considered only in cases where the departure is\r\nnot likely to increase the risk to the public from further crimes of the defend-\r\nant. In determining whether such a departure is appropriate, the court should\r\nconsider, among other things, (A) whether the defendant engaged in additional\r\ncriminal activity after illegally reentering the United States; (B) the serious-\r\nness of any such additional criminal activity, including (1) whether the defend-\r\nant used violence or credible threats of violence or possessed a firearm or other\r\ndangerous weapon (or induced another person to do so) in connection with the\r\ncriminal activity, (2) whether the criminal activity resulted in death or serious\r\nbodily injury to any person, and (3) whether the defendant was an organizer,\r\nleader, manager, or supervisor of others in the criminal activity; and (C) the\r\nseriousness of the defendant’s other criminal history.”.\r\nThe Commentary to §2X5.1 captioned “Application Notes” is amended in Note 1 by\r\ninserting after “§5G1.3 (Imposition of a Sentence on a Defendant Subject to an Undis-\r\ncharged Term of Imprisonment” the following: “or Anticipated State Term of Impris-\r\nonment”.\r\nSection 5G1.3 is amended in the heading by inserting after “Imposition of a Sentence\r\non a Defendant Subject to an Undischarged Term of Imprisonment” the following:\r\n“or Anticipated State Term of Imprisonment”.\r\nSection 5G1.3 is amended in subsection (b) by striking “and that was the basis for an\r\nincrease in the offense level for the instant offense under Chapter Two (Offense Con-\r\nduct) or Chapter Three (Adjustments)”; by redesignating subsection (c) as (d); and by\r\ninserting after subsection (b) the following new subsection (c):\r\n“(c) If subsection (a) does not apply, and a state term of imprisonment is antici-\r\npated to result from another offense that is relevant conduct to the instant\r\noffense of conviction under the provisions of subsections (a)(1), (a)(2), or (a)(3)\r\nAmendment 787\r\nof §1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct), the sentence for the instant offense shall be im-\r\nposed to run concurrently to the anticipated term of imprisonment.”.\r\nThe Commentary to §5G1.3 captioned “Application Notes” is amended in Note 2(A) by\r\nstriking “(i)” and by striking “; and (ii) has resulted in an increase in the Chapter Two\r\nor Three offense level for the instant offense”;\r\nin Note 2(B) by striking “increased the Chapter Two or Three offense level for the in-\r\nstant offense but”;\r\nby redesignating Notes 3 and 4 as Notes 4 and 5, respectively, and inserting after\r\nNote 2 the following new Note 3:\r\n“3. Application of Subsection (c).—Subsection (c) applies to cases in which the fed-\r\neral court anticipates that, after the federal sentence is imposed, the defendant\r\nwill be sentenced in state court and serve a state sentence before being trans-\r\nferred to federal custody for federal imprisonment. In such a case, where the\r\nother offense is relevant conduct to the instant offense of conviction under the\r\nprovisions of subsections (a)(1), (a)(2), or (a)(3) of §1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct),\r\nthe sentence for the instant offense shall be imposed to run concurrently to the\r\nanticipated term of imprisonment.”;\r\nand in Note 4 (as so redesignated), in the heading, by striking “(c)” and inserting “(d)”;\r\nin each of subparagraphs (A), (B), (C), and (D) by striking “(c)” each place such term\r\nappears and inserting “(d)”; and in subparagraph (E) by striking “subsection (c)” both\r\nplaces such term appears and inserting “subsection (d)”, and by striking “§5G1.3 (c)”\r\nand inserting “§5G1.3(d)”.\r\nSection 5K2.23 is amended by inserting after “Imposition of a Sentence on a Defendant\r\nSubject to Undischarged Term of Imprisonment” the following: “or Anticipated Term\r\nof Imprisonment”.","Reason":"REASON FOR AMENDMENT: This multi-part amendment addresses certain cases in\r\nwhich the defendant is subject to another term of imprisonment, such as an undis-\r\ncharged term of imprisonment or an anticipated term of imprisonment. The guideline\r\ngenerally applicable to undischarged terms of imprisonment is §5G1.3 (Imposition of\r\na Sentence on a Defendant Subject to an Undischarged Term of Imprisonment).\r\nSection 5G1.3 identifies three categories of cases in which a federal defendant is also\r\nsubject to an undischarged term of imprisonment. First, there are cases in which the\r\nfederal offense was committed while the defendant was serving the undischarged term\r\nof imprisonment (including work release, furlough, or escape status). In these cases,\r\nthe federal sentence is to be imposed consecutively to the remainder of the undis-\r\ncharged term of imprisonment. See §5G1.3(a). Second, assuming subsection (a) does\r\nnot apply, there are cases in which the conduct involved in the undischarged term of\r\nimprisonment is related to the conduct involved in the federal offense — specifically,\r\nthe offense for which the defendant is serving an undischarged term of imprisonment\r\nis relevant conduct under subsections (a)(1), (a)(2), or (a)(3) of §1B1.3 (Relevant Con-\r\nduct) — and was the basis for an increase in the offense level under Chapter Two or\r\nChapter Three. In these cases, the court is directed to adjust the federal sentence to\r\naccount for the time already served on the undischarged term of imprisonment (if the\r\nBureau of Prisons will not itself provide credit for that time already served) and is\r\nfurther directed to run the federal sentence concurrently with the remainder of the\r\nsentence for the undischarged term of imprisonment. See §5G1.3(b). Finally, in all\r\nAmendment 787\r\n84 ║ Supplement to Appendix C (November 1, 2016)\r\nother cases involving an undischarged state term of imprisonment, the court may im-\r\npose the federal sentence concurrently, partially concurrently, or consecutively, to\r\nachieve a reasonable punishment for the federal offense. See §5G1.3(c), p.s.\r\nWithin the category of cases covered by subsection (b), where the conduct involved in\r\nthe undischarged term of imprisonment is related to the federal offense conduct, the\r\nCommission considered whether the benefit of subsection (b) should continue to be\r\nlimited to cases in which the offense conduct related to the undischarged term of im-\r\nprisonment resulted in a Chapter Two or Three increase. The Commission determined\r\nthat this limitation added complexity to the guidelines and may lead to unwarranted\r\ndisparities. For example, a federal drug trafficking defendant who is serving an undis-\r\ncharged state term of imprisonment for a small amount of a controlled substance that\r\nis relevant conduct to the federal offense may not receive the benefit of subsection (b)\r\nbecause the amount of the controlled substance may not be sufficient to increase the\r\noffense level under Chapter Two. In contrast, a federal drug trafficking defendant who\r\nis serving an undischarged state term of imprisonment for a large amount of a con-\r\ntrolled substance that is relevant conduct to the federal offense may be more likely to\r\nreceive the benefit of subsection (b) because the amount of the controlled substance\r\nmay be more likely to increase the offense level under Chapter Two. The amendment\r\namends §5G1.3(b) to require a court to adjust the sentence and impose concurrent sen-\r\ntences in any case in which the prior offense is relevant conduct under the provisions\r\nof §1B1.3(a)(1), (a)(2), or (a)(3), regardless of whether the conduct from the prior offense\r\nformed the basis for a Chapter Two or Chapter Three increase. The Commission deter-\r\nmined that this amendment will simplify the operation of §5G1.3(b) and will also ad-\r\ndress concerns that the requirement that the relevant conduct increase the offense\r\nlevel under Chapters Two or Three is somewhat arbitrary.\r\nSecond, the amendment addresses cases in which there is an anticipated, but not yet\r\nimposed, state term of imprisonment that is relevant conduct to the instant offense of\r\nconviction under the provisions of subsections (a)(1), (a)(2), or (a)(3) of §1B1.3 (Relevant\r\nConduct). This amendment creates a new subsection (c) at §5G1.3 that directs the court\r\nto impose the sentence for the instant federal offense to run concurrently with the an-\r\nticipated but not yet imposed period of imprisonment if §5G1.3(a) does not apply.\r\nThis amendment is a further response to the Supreme Court’s decision in Setser v.\r\nUnited States, 132 S. Ct. 1463 (2012). Last year, the Commission amended the Back-\r\nground Commentary to §5G1.3 to provide heightened awareness of the court’s author-\r\nity under Setser. See USSG App. C, Amend. 776 (effective November 1, 2013). In Set-\r\nser, the Supreme Court held that a federal sentencing court has the authority to order\r\nthat a federal term of imprisonment run concurrent with, or consecutive to, an antici-\r\npated but not yet imposed state sentence. This amendment reflects the Commission’s\r\ndetermination that the concurrent sentence benefits of subsection (b) of §5G1.3 should\r\nbe available not only in cases in which the state sentence has already been imposed at\r\nthe time of federal sentencing (as subsection (b) provides), but also in cases in which\r\nthe state sentence is anticipated but has not yet been imposed, as long as the other\r\ncriteria in subsection (b) are satisfied (i.e., the state offense is relevant conduct under\r\nsubsections (a)(1), (a)(2), or (a)(3) of §1B1.3, and subsection (a) of §5G1.3 does not ap-\r\nply). By requiring courts to impose a concurrent sentence in these cases, the amend-\r\nment reduces disparities between defendants whose state sentences have already been\r\nimposed and those whose state sentences have not yet been imposed. The amendment\r\nalso promotes certainty and consistency.\r\nThird, the amendment addresses certain cases in which the defendant is an alien and\r\nis subject to an undischarged term of imprisonment. The amendment provides a new\r\nAmendment 788\r\ndeparture provision in §2L1.2 (Unlawfully Entering or Remaining in the United\r\nStates) for cases in which the defendant is located by immigration authorities while\r\nthe defendant is in state custody, whether pre- or post- conviction, for a state offense\r\nunrelated to the federal illegal reentry offense. In such a case, the time served is not\r\ncovered by an adjustment under §5G1.3(b) and, accordingly, is not covered by a depar-\r\nture under §5K2.23 (Discharged Terms of Imprisonment). The new departure provi-\r\nsion states that, in such a case, the court may consider whether a departure is appro-\r\npriate to reflect all or part of the time served in state custody for the unrelated offense,\r\nfrom the time federal immigration authorities locate the defendant until the service of\r\nthe federal sentence commences, that the court determines will not be credited to the\r\nfederal sentence by the Bureau of Prisons. The new departure provision also sets forth\r\nfactors for the court to consider in determining whether to provide such a departure,\r\nand states that a departure should be considered only if the departure will not increase\r\nthe risk to the public from further crimes of the defendant.\r\nThis amendment addresses concerns that the amount of time a defendant serves in\r\nstate custody after being located by immigration authorities may be somewhat arbi-\r\ntrary. Several courts have recognized a downward departure to account for the delay\r\nbetween when the defendant is “found” by immigration authorities and when the de-\r\nfendant is brought into federal custody. See, e.g., United States v. Sanchez-Rodriguez,\r\n161 F.3d 556, 563–64 (9th Cir. 1998) (affirming downward departure on the basis that,\r\nbecause of the delay in proceeding with the illegal reentry case, the defendant lost the\r\nopportunity to serve a greater portion of his state sentence concurrently with his illegal\r\nreentry sentence); United States v. Barrera-Saucedo, 385 F.3d 533, 537 (5th Cir. 2004)\r\n(holding that “it is permissible for a sentencing court to grant a downward departure\r\nto an illegal alien for all or part of time served in state custody from the time immigra-\r\ntion authorities locate the defendant until he is taken into federal custody”); see also\r\nUnited States v. Los Santos, 283 F.3d 422, 428–29 (2d Cir. 2002) (departure appropri-\r\nate if the delay was either in bad faith or unreasonable).

The Commission has determined that\r\nAmendment 782, subject to the limitation in new §1B1.10(e) delaying the effective date\r\nof sentence reduction orders until November 1, 2015, should be applied retroactively.\r\nAmendment 782 reduced by two levels the offense levels assigned to the quantities\r\nthat trigger the statutory mandatory minimum penalties in §2D1.1, and made parallel\r\nchanges to §2D1.11. Under the applicable standards set forth in the background com-\r\nmentary to §1B1.10, the Commission considers the following factors, among others:\r\n(1) the purpose of the amendment, (2) the magnitude of the change in the guideline\r\nrange made by the amendment, and (3) the difficulty of applying the amendment ret-\r\nroactively. See §1B1.10, comment. (backg’d.). Applying those standards to Amend-\r\nment 782, the Commission determined that, among other factors:\r\n(1) The purposes of the amendment are to reflect the Commission’s determination\r\nthat setting the base offense levels above mandatory minimum penalties is no\r\nlonger necessary and that a reduction would be an appropriate step toward\r\nalleviating the overcapacity of the federal prisons. See 28 U.S.C. § 994(g) (re-\r\nquiring the Commission to formulate guidelines to “minimize the likelihood\r\nthat the Federal prison population will exceed the capacity of the Federal pris-\r\nons”).\r\n(2) The number of cases potentially involved is large, and the magnitude of the\r\nchange in the guideline range is significant. The Commission determined that\r\nan estimated 46,000 offenders may benefit from retroactive application of\r\nAmendment 782 subject to the limitation in §1B1.10(e), and the average sen-\r\ntence reduction would be approximately 18 percent.\r\n(3) The administrative burdens of applying Amendment 782 retroactively are sig-\r\nnificant but manageable given the one-year delay in the effective date, which\r\nallows courts and agencies more time to prepare. This determination was in-\r\nformed by testimony at the Commission’s June 10, 2014 public hearing on ret-\r\nroactivity and by other public comment received by the Commission.\r\nAmendment 789\r\nThe Commission determined that public safety, among other factors, requires a limi-\r\ntation on retroactive application of Amendment 782. In light of the large number of\r\ncases potentially involved, the Commission determined that the agencies of the federal\r\ncriminal justice system responsible for the offenders’ reentry into society need time to\r\nprepare, and to help the offenders prepare, for that reentry. For example, the Bureau\r\nof Prisons has the responsibility under 18 U.S.C. § 3624(c) to ensure, to the extent\r\npracticable, that the defendant will spend a portion of his or her term of imprisonment\r\nunder conditions that will afford the defendant a reasonable opportunity to adjust to\r\nand prepare for his or her reentry into the community. The Commission received tes-\r\ntimony indicating that some offenders released pursuant to earlier retroactive guide-\r\nline amendments had been released without having had this opportunity. In addition,\r\nfor many of the defendants potentially involved, their sentence includes a term of su-\r\npervised release after imprisonment. The judiciary and its probation officers will have\r\nthe responsibility under 18 U.S.C. § 3624(e) to supervise those defendants when they\r\nare released by the Bureau of Prisons. The Commission received testimony from the\r\nCriminal Law Committee of the Judicial Conference of the United States that a delay\r\nwould permit courts and probation offices to prepare to effectively supervise this in-\r\ncreased number of defendants.\r\nThe Commission concluded that a one-year delay in the effective date of any orders\r\ngranting sentence reductions under Amendment 782 is needed (1) to give courts ade-\r\nquate time to obtain and review the information necessary to make an individualized\r\ndetermination in each case of whether a sentence reduction is appropriate, (2) to en-\r\nsure that, to the extent practicable, all offenders who are to be released have the op-\r\nportunity to participate in reentry programs and transitional services, such as place-\r\nment in halfway houses, while still in the custody of the Bureau of Prisons, which in-\r\ncreases their likelihood of successful reentry to society and thereby promotes public\r\nsafety, and (3) to permit those agencies that will be responsible for offenders after their\r\nrelease to prepare for the increased responsibility. Therefore, the Commission added a\r\nSpecial Instruction at subsection (e) providing that a reduced term of imprisonment\r\nbased on retroactive application of Amendment 782 shall not be ordered unless the\r\neffective date of the court’s order is November 1, 2015, or later. An application note\r\nclarifies that this special instruction does not preclude the court from conducting sen-\r\ntence reduction proceedings before November 1, 2015, as long as any order reducing\r\nthe defendant’s term of imprisonment has an effective date of November 1, 2015, or\r\nlater. As a result, offenders cannot be released from custody pursuant to retroactive\r\napplication of Amendment 782 before November 1, 2015.\r\nIn addition, public safety will be considered in every case because §1B1.10 requires the\r\ncourt, in determining whether and to what extent a reduction in the defendant’s term\r\nof imprisonment is warranted, to consider the nature and seriousness of the danger to\r\nany person or the community that may be posed by such a reduction. See §1B1.10,\r\ncomment. (n.1(B)(ii)).","EffectiveDate":"Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2014."},{"Id":789,"Title":"Amendment 789","Text":"Section 1B1.3(a)(1)(B) is amended by striking “all reasonably foreseeable\r\nacts and omissions of others in furtherance of the jointly undertaken criminal activity,”\r\nand inserting the following:\r\n“ all acts and omissions of others that were—\r\nAmendment 790\r\n(i) within the scope of the jointly undertaken criminal activity,\r\n(ii) in furtherance of that criminal activity, and\r\n(iii) reasonably foreseeable in connection with that criminal activity;”.\r\nThe Commentary to §1B1.3 captioned “Application Notes” is amended by striking\r\nNote 2 as follows:\r\n“2. A ‘jointly undertaken criminal activity’ is a criminal plan, scheme, endeavor,\r\nor enterprise undertaken by the defendant in concert with others, whether or\r\nnot charged as a conspiracy.\r\nIn the case of a jointly undertaken criminal activity, subsection (a)(1)(B) pro-\r\nvides that a defendant is accountable for the conduct (acts and omissions) of\r\nothers that was both:\r\n(A) in furtherance of the jointly undertaken criminal activity; and\r\n(B) reasonably foreseeable in connection with that criminal activity.\r\nBecause a count may be worded broadly and include the conduct of many par-\r\nticipants over a period of time, the scope of the criminal activity jointly under-\r\ntaken by the defendant (the ‘jointly undertaken criminal activity’) is not nec-\r\nessarily the same as the scope of the entire conspiracy, and hence relevant con-\r\nduct is not necessarily the same for every participant. In order to determine\r\nthe defendant’s accountability for the conduct of others under subsec-\r\ntion (a)(1)(B), the court must first determine the scope of the criminal activity\r\nthe particular defendant agreed to jointly undertake (i.e., the scope of the spe-\r\ncific conduct and objectives embraced by the defendant’s agreement). The con-\r\nduct of others that was both in furtherance of, and reasonably foreseeable in\r\nconnection with, the criminal activity jointly undertaken by the defendant is\r\nrelevant conduct under this provision. The conduct of others that was not in\r\nfurtherance of the criminal activity jointly undertaken by the defendant, or\r\nwas not reasonably foreseeable in connection with that criminal activity, is not\r\nrelevant conduct under this provision.\r\nIn determining the scope of the criminal activity that the particular defendant\r\nagreed to jointly undertake (i.e., the scope of the specific conduct and objectives\r\nembraced by the defendant’s agreement), the court may consider any explicit\r\nagreement or implicit agreement fairly inferred from the conduct of the defend-\r\nant and others.\r\nNote that the criminal activity that the defendant agreed to jointly undertake,\r\nand the reasonably foreseeable conduct of others in furtherance of that crimi-\r\nnal activity, are not necessarily identical. For example, two defendants agree\r\nto commit a robbery and, during the course of that robbery, the first defendant\r\nassaults and injures a victim. The second defendant is accountable for the as-\r\nsault and injury to the victim (even if the second defendant had not agreed to\r\nthe assault and had cautioned the first defendant to be careful not to hurt an-\r\nyone) because the assaultive conduct was in furtherance of the jointly under-\r\ntaken criminal activity (the robbery) and was reasonably foreseeable in con-\r\nnection with that criminal activity (given the nature of the offense).\r\nAmendment 790\r\n90 ║ Supplement to Appendix C (November 1, 2016)\r\nWith respect to offenses involving contraband (including controlled sub-\r\nstances), the defendant is accountable for all quantities of contraband with\r\nwhich he was directly involved and, in the case of a jointly undertaken criminal\r\nactivity, all reasonably foreseeable quantities of contraband that were within\r\nthe scope of the criminal activity that he jointly undertook.\r\nThe requirement of reasonable foreseeability applies only in respect to the con-\r\nduct (i.e., acts and omissions) of others under subsection (a)(1)(B). It does not\r\napply to conduct that the defendant personally undertakes, aids, abets, coun-\r\nsels, commands, induces, procures, or willfully causes; such conduct is ad-\r\ndressed under subsection (a)(1)(A).\r\nA defendant’s relevant conduct does not include the conduct of members of a\r\nconspiracy prior to the defendant joining the conspiracy, even if the defendant\r\nknows of that conduct (e.g., in the case of a defendant who joins an ongoing\r\ndrug distribution conspiracy knowing that it had been selling two kilograms of\r\ncocaine per week, the cocaine sold prior to the defendant joining the conspiracy\r\nis not included as relevant conduct in determining the defendant’s offense\r\nlevel). The Commission does not foreclose the possibility that there may be\r\nsome unusual set of circumstances in which the exclusion of such conduct may\r\nnot adequately reflect the defendant’s culpability; in such a case, an upward\r\ndeparture may be warranted.\r\nIllustrations of Conduct for Which the Defendant is Accountable\r\n(a) Acts and omissions aided or abetted by the defendant\r\n(1) Defendant A is one of ten persons hired by Defendant B to off-\r\nload a ship containing marihuana. The off-loading of the ship\r\nis interrupted by law enforcement officers and one ton of mari-\r\nhuana is seized (the amount on the ship as well as the amount\r\noff-loaded). Defendant A and the other off-loaders are arrested\r\nand convicted of importation of marihuana. Regardless of the\r\nnumber of bales he personally unloaded, Defendant A is ac-\r\ncountable for the entire one-ton quantity of marihuana. De-\r\nfendant A aided and abetted the off-loading of the entire ship-\r\nment of marihuana by directly participating in the off-loading\r\nof that shipment (i.e., the specific objective of the criminal ac-\r\ntivity he joined was the off-loading of the entire shipment).\r\nTherefore, he is accountable for the entire shipment under sub-\r\nsection (a)(1)(A) without regard to the issue of reasonable fore-\r\nseeability. This is conceptually similar to the case of a defend-\r\nant who transports a suitcase knowing that it contains a con-\r\ntrolled substance and, therefore, is accountable for the con-\r\ntrolled substance in the suitcase regardless of his knowledge or\r\nlack of knowledge of the actual type or amount of that con-\r\ntrolled substance.\r\nIn certain cases, a defendant may be accountable for particular\r\nconduct under more than one subsection of this guideline. As\r\nnoted in the preceding paragraph, Defendant A is accountable\r\nfor the entire one-ton shipment of marihuana under subsec-\r\ntion (a)(1)(A). Defendant A also is accountable for the entire\r\nAmendment 790\r\none-ton shipment of marihuana on the basis of subsec-\r\ntion (a)(1)(B) (applying to a jointly undertaken criminal activ-\r\nity). Defendant A engaged in a jointly undertaken criminal ac-\r\ntivity (the scope of which was the importation of the shipment\r\nof marihuana). A finding that the one-ton quantity of mari-\r\nhuana was reasonably foreseeable is warranted from the na-\r\nture of the undertaking itself (the importation of marihuana by\r\nship typically involves very large quantities of marihuana).\r\nThe specific circumstances of the case (the defendant was one\r\nof ten persons off-loading the marihuana in bales) also support\r\nthis finding. In an actual case, of course, if a defendant’s ac-\r\ncountability for particular conduct is established under one\r\nprovision of this guideline, it is not necessary to review alter-\r\nnative provisions under which such accountability might be es-\r\ntablished.\r\n(b) Acts and omissions aided or abetted by the defendant; requirement\r\nthat the conduct of others be in furtherance of the jointly undertaken\r\ncriminal activity and reasonably foreseeable\r\n(1) Defendant C is the getaway driver in an armed bank robbery\r\nin which $15,000 is taken and a teller is assaulted and injured.\r\nDefendant C is accountable for the money taken under subsec-\r\ntion (a)(1)(A) because he aided and abetted the act of taking the\r\nmoney (the taking of money was the specific objective of the\r\noffense he joined). Defendant C is accountable for the injury to\r\nthe teller under subsection (a)(1)(B) because the assault on the\r\nteller was in furtherance of the jointly undertaken criminal ac-\r\ntivity (the robbery) and was reasonably foreseeable in connec-\r\ntion with that criminal activity (given the nature of the of-\r\nfense).\r\nAs noted earlier, a defendant may be accountable for particular\r\nconduct under more than one subsection. In this example, De-\r\nfendant C also is accountable for the money taken on the basis\r\nof subsection (a)(1)(B) because the taking of money was in fur-\r\ntherance of the jointly undertaken criminal activity (the rob-\r\nbery) and was reasonably foreseeable (as noted, the taking of\r\nmoney was the specific objective of the jointly undertaken crim-\r\ninal activity).\r\n(c) Requirement that the conduct of others be in furtherance of the jointly\r\nundertaken criminal activity and reasonably foreseeable; scope of the\r\ncriminal activity\r\n(1) Defendant D pays Defendant E a small amount to forge an en-\r\ndorsement on an $800 stolen government check. Unknown to\r\nDefendant E, Defendant D then uses that check as a down pay-\r\nment in a scheme to fraudulently obtain $15,000 worth of mer-\r\nchandise. Defendant E is convicted of forging the $800 check\r\nand is accountable for the forgery of this check under subsec-\r\ntion (a)(1)(A). Defendant E is not accountable for the $15,000\r\nbecause the fraudulent scheme to obtain $15,000 was not in\r\nAmendment 790\r\n92 ║ Supplement to Appendix C (November 1, 2016)\r\nfurtherance of the criminal activity he jointly undertook with\r\nDefendant D (i.e., the forgery of the $800 check).\r\n(2) Defendants F and G, working together, design and execute a\r\nscheme to sell fraudulent stocks by telephone. Defendant F\r\nfraudulently obtains $20,000. Defendant G fraudulently ob-\r\ntains $35,000. Each is convicted of mail fraud. Defendants F\r\nand G each are accountable for the entire amount ($55,000).\r\nEach defendant is accountable for the amount he personally\r\nobtained under subsection (a)(1)(A). Each defendant is ac-\r\ncountable for the amount obtained by his accomplice under\r\nsubsection (a)(1)(B) because the conduct of each was in further-\r\nance of the jointly undertaken criminal activity and was rea-\r\nsonably foreseeable in connection with that criminal activity.\r\n(3) Defendants H and I engaged in an ongoing marihuana impor-\r\ntation conspiracy in which Defendant J was hired only to help\r\noff-load a single shipment. Defendants H, I, and J are included\r\nin a single count charging conspiracy to import marihuana. De-\r\nfendant J is accountable for the entire single shipment of ma-\r\nrihuana he helped import under subsection (a)(1)(A) and any\r\nacts and omissions in furtherance of the importation of that\r\nshipment that were reasonably foreseeable (see the discussion\r\nin example (a)(1) above). He is not accountable for prior or sub-\r\nsequent shipments of marihuana imported by Defendants H\r\nor I because those acts were not in furtherance of his jointly\r\nundertaken criminal activity (the importation of the single\r\nshipment of marihuana).\r\n(4) Defendant K is a wholesale distributor of child pornography.\r\nDefendant L is a retail-level dealer who purchases child por-\r\nnography from Defendant K and resells it, but otherwise oper-\r\nates independently of Defendant K. Similarly, Defendant M is\r\na retail-level dealer who purchases child pornography from De-\r\nfendant K and resells it, but otherwise operates independently\r\nof Defendant K. Defendants L and M are aware of each other’s\r\ncriminal activity but operate independently. Defendant N is\r\nDefendant K’s assistant who recruits customers for Defend-\r\nant K and frequently supervises the deliveries to Defend-\r\nant K’s customers. Each defendant is convicted of a count\r\ncharging conspiracy to distribute child pornography. Defend-\r\nant K is accountable under subsection (a)(1)(A) for the entire\r\nquantity of child pornography sold to Defendants L and M. De-\r\nfendant N also is accountable for the entire quantity sold to\r\nthose defendants under subsection (a)(1)(B) because the entire\r\nquantity was within the scope of his jointly undertaken crimi-\r\nnal activity and reasonably foreseeable. Defendant L is ac-\r\ncountable under subsection (a)(1)(A) only for the quantity of\r\nchild pornography that he purchased from Defendant K be-\r\ncause the scope of his jointly undertaken criminal activity is\r\nlimited to that amount. For the same reason, Defendant M is\r\naccountable under subsection (a)(1)(A) only for the quantity of\r\nchild pornography that he purchased from Defendant K.\r\nAmendment 790\r\n(5) Defendant O knows about her boyfriend’s ongoing drug-traf-\r\nficking activity, but agrees to participate on only one occasion\r\nby making a delivery for him at his request when he was ill.\r\nDefendant O is accountable under subsection (a)(1)(A) for the\r\ndrug quantity involved on that one occasion. Defendant O is\r\nnot accountable for the other drug sales made by her boyfriend\r\nbecause those sales were not in furtherance of her jointly un-\r\ndertaken criminal activity (i.e., the one delivery).\r\n(6) Defendant P is a street-level drug dealer who knows of other\r\nstreet-level drug dealers in the same geographic area who sell\r\nthe same type of drug as he sells. Defendant P and the other\r\ndealers share a common source of supply, but otherwise oper-\r\nate independently. Defendant P is not accountable for the\r\nquantities of drugs sold by the other street-level drug dealers\r\nbecause he is not engaged in a jointly undertaken criminal ac-\r\ntivity with them. In contrast, Defendant Q, another street-level\r\ndrug dealer, pools his resources and profits with four other\r\nstreet-level drug dealers. Defendant Q is engaged in a jointly\r\nundertaken criminal activity and, therefore, he is accountable\r\nunder subsection (a)(1)(B) for the quantities of drugs sold by\r\nthe four other dealers during the course of his joint undertak-\r\ning with them because those sales were in furtherance of the\r\njointly undertaken criminal activity and reasonably foreseea-\r\nble in connection with that criminal activity.\r\n(7) Defendant R recruits Defendant S to distribute 500 grams of\r\ncocaine. Defendant S knows that Defendant R is the prime fig-\r\nure in a conspiracy involved in importing much larger quanti-\r\nties of cocaine. As long as Defendant S’s agreement and conduct\r\nis limited to the distribution of the 500 grams, Defendant S is\r\naccountable only for that 500 gram amount (under subsec-\r\ntion (a)(1)(A)), rather than the much larger quantity imported\r\nby Defendant R.\r\n(8) Defendants T, U, V, and W are hired by a supplier to backpack\r\na quantity of marihuana across the border from Mexico into the\r\nUnited States. Defendants T, U, V, and W receive their indi-\r\nvidual shipments from the supplier at the same time and coor-\r\ndinate their importation efforts by walking across the border\r\ntogether for mutual assistance and protection. Each defendant\r\nis accountable for the aggregate quantity of marihuana trans-\r\nported by the four defendants. The four defendants engaged in\r\na jointly undertaken criminal activity, the object of which was\r\nthe importation of the four backpacks containing marihuana\r\n(subsection (a)(1)(B)), and aided and abetted each other’s ac-\r\ntions (subsection (a)(1)(A)) in carrying out the jointly under-\r\ntaken criminal activity. In contrast, if Defendants T, U, V,\r\nand W were hired individually, transported their individual\r\nshipments at different times, and otherwise operated inde-\r\npendently, each defendant would be accountable only for the\r\nquantity of marihuana he personally transported (subsec-\r\ntion (a)(1)(A)). As this example illustrates, in cases involving\r\ncontraband (including controlled substances), the scope of the\r\nAmendment 790\r\n94 ║ Supplement to Appendix C (November 1, 2016)\r\njointly undertaken criminal activity (and thus the accountabil-\r\nity of the defendant for the contraband that was the object of\r\nthat jointly undertaken activity) may depend upon whether, in\r\nthe particular circumstances, the nature of the offense is more\r\nappropriately viewed as one jointly undertaken criminal activ-\r\nity or as a number of separate criminal activities.”;\r\nby redesignating Notes 3 through 10 as Notes 5 through 12, respectively, and inserting\r\nthe following new Notes 2, 3, and 4:\r\n“2. Accountability Under More Than One Provision.—In certain cases, a defend-\r\nant may be accountable for particular conduct under more than one subsection\r\nof this guideline. If a defendant’s accountability for particular conduct is estab-\r\nlished under one provision of this guideline, it is not necessary to review alter-\r\nnative provisions under which such accountability might be established.\r\n3. Jointly Undertaken Criminal Activity (Subsection (a)(1)(B)).—\r\n(A) In General.—A ‘jointly undertaken criminal activity’ is a criminal plan,\r\nscheme, endeavor, or enterprise undertaken by the defendant in con-\r\ncert with others, whether or not charged as a conspiracy.\r\nIn the case of a jointly undertaken criminal activity, subsec-\r\ntion (a)(1)(B) provides that a defendant is accountable for the conduct\r\n(acts and omissions) of others that was:\r\n(i) within the scope of the jointly undertaken criminal activity;\r\n(ii) in furtherance of that criminal activity; and\r\n(iii) reasonably foreseeable in connection with that criminal activ-\r\nity.\r\nThe conduct of others that meets all three criteria set forth in subdivi-\r\nsions (i) through (iii) (i.e., ‘within the scope,’ ‘in furtherance,’ and ‘rea-\r\nsonably foreseeable’) is relevant conduct under this provision. How-\r\never, when the conduct of others does not meet any one of the criteria\r\nset forth in subdivisions (i) through (iii), the conduct is not relevant\r\nconduct under this provision.\r\n(B) Scope.—Because a count may be worded broadly and include the con-\r\nduct of many participants over a period of time, the scope of the ‘jointly\r\nundertaken criminal activity’ is not necessarily the same as the scope\r\nof the entire conspiracy, and hence relevant conduct is not necessarily\r\nthe same for every participant. In order to determine the defendant’s\r\naccountability for the conduct of others under subsection (a)(1)(B), the\r\ncourt must first determine the scope of the criminal activity the partic-\r\nular defendant agreed to jointly undertake (i.e., the scope of the specific\r\nconduct and objectives embraced by the defendant’s agreement). In do-\r\ning so, the court may consider any explicit agreement or implicit agree-\r\nment fairly inferred from the conduct of the defendant and others. Ac-\r\ncordingly, the accountability of the defendant for the acts of others is\r\nlimited by the scope of his or her agreement to jointly undertake the\r\nparticular criminal activity. Acts of others that were not within the\r\nAmendment 790\r\nscope of the defendant’s agreement, even if those acts were known or\r\nreasonably foreseeable to the defendant, are not relevant conduct un-\r\nder subsection (a)(1)(B).\r\nIn cases involving contraband (including controlled substances), the\r\nscope of the jointly undertaken criminal activity (and thus the account-\r\nability of the defendant for the contraband that was the object of that\r\njointly undertaken activity) may depend upon whether, in the particu-\r\nlar circumstances, the nature of the offense is more appropriately\r\nviewed as one jointly undertaken criminal activity or as a number of\r\nseparate criminal activities.\r\nA defendant’s relevant conduct does not include the conduct of mem-\r\nbers of a conspiracy prior to the defendant joining the conspiracy, even\r\nif the defendant knows of that conduct (e.g., in the case of a defendant\r\nwho joins an ongoing drug distribution conspiracy knowing that it had\r\nbeen selling two kilograms of cocaine per week, the cocaine sold prior\r\nto the defendant joining the conspiracy is not included as relevant con-\r\nduct in determining the defendant’s offense level). The Commission\r\ndoes not foreclose the possibility that there may be some unusual set\r\nof circumstances in which the exclusion of such conduct may not ade-\r\nquately reflect the defendant’s culpability; in such a case, an upward\r\ndeparture may be warranted.\r\n(C) In Furtherance.—The court must determine if the conduct (acts and\r\nomissions) of others was in furtherance of the jointly undertaken crim-\r\ninal activity.\r\n(D) Reasonably Foreseeable.—The court must then determine if the con-\r\nduct (acts and omissions) of others that was within the scope of, and in\r\nfurtherance of, the jointly undertaken criminal activity was reasonably\r\nforeseeable in connection with that criminal activity.\r\nNote that the criminal activity that the defendant agreed to jointly un-\r\ndertake, and the reasonably foreseeable conduct of others in further-\r\nance of that criminal activity, are not necessarily identical. For exam-\r\nple, two defendants agree to commit a robbery and, during the course\r\nof that robbery, the first defendant assaults and injures a victim. The\r\nsecond defendant is accountable for the assault and injury to the victim\r\n(even if the second defendant had not agreed to the assault and had\r\ncautioned the first defendant to be careful not to hurt anyone) because\r\nthe assaultive conduct was within the scope of the jointly undertaken\r\ncriminal activity (the robbery), was in furtherance of that criminal ac-\r\ntivity (the robbery), and was reasonably foreseeable in connection with\r\nthat criminal activity (given the nature of the offense).\r\nWith respect to offenses involving contraband (including controlled\r\nsubstances), the defendant is accountable under subsection (a)(1)(A)\r\nfor all quantities of contraband with which he was directly involved\r\nand, in the case of a jointly undertaken criminal activity under subsec-\r\ntion (a)(1)(B), all quantities of contraband that were involved in trans-\r\nactions carried out by other participants, if those transactions were\r\nAmendment 790\r\n96 ║ Supplement to Appendix C (November 1, 2016)\r\nwithin the scope of, and in furtherance of, the jointly undertaken crim-\r\ninal activity and were reasonably foreseeable in connection with that\r\ncriminal activity.\r\nThe requirement of reasonable foreseeability applies only in respect to\r\nthe conduct (i.e., acts and omissions) of others under subsec-\r\ntion (a)(1)(B). It does not apply to conduct that the defendant person-\r\nally undertakes, aids, abets, counsels, commands, induces, procures, or\r\nwillfully causes; such conduct is addressed under subsection (a)(1)(A).\r\n4. Illustrations of Conduct for Which the Defendant is Accountable under Sub-\r\nsections (a)(1)(A) and (B).—\r\n(A) Acts and omissions aided or abetted by the defendant.—\r\n(i) Defendant A is one of ten persons hired by Defendant B to off-\r\nload a ship containing marihuana. The off-loading of the ship\r\nis interrupted by law enforcement officers and one ton of mari-\r\nhuana is seized (the amount on the ship as well as the amount\r\noff-loaded). Defendant A and the other off-loaders are arrested\r\nand convicted of importation of marihuana. Regardless of the\r\nnumber of bales he personally unloaded, Defendant A is ac-\r\ncountable for the entire one-ton quantity of marihuana. De-\r\nfendant A aided and abetted the off-loading of the entire ship-\r\nment of marihuana by directly participating in the off-loading\r\nof that shipment (i.e., the specific objective of the criminal ac-\r\ntivity he joined was the off-loading of the entire shipment).\r\nTherefore, he is accountable for the entire shipment under sub-\r\nsection (a)(1)(A) without regard to the issue of reasonable fore-\r\nseeability. This is conceptually similar to the case of a defend-\r\nant who transports a suitcase knowing that it contains a con-\r\ntrolled substance and, therefore, is accountable for the con-\r\ntrolled substance in the suitcase regardless of his knowledge or\r\nlack of knowledge of the actual type or amount of that con-\r\ntrolled substance.\r\nIn certain cases, a defendant may be accountable for particular\r\nconduct under more than one subsection of this guideline. As\r\nnoted in the preceding paragraph, Defendant A is accountable\r\nfor the entire one-ton shipment of marihuana under subsec-\r\ntion (a)(1)(A). Defendant A also is accountable for the entire\r\none-ton shipment of marihuana on the basis of subsec-\r\ntion (a)(1)(B) (applying to a jointly undertaken criminal activ-\r\nity). Defendant A engaged in a jointly undertaken criminal ac-\r\ntivity and all three criteria of subsection (a)(1)(B) are met.\r\nFirst, the conduct was within the scope of the criminal activity\r\n(the importation of the shipment of marihuana). Second, the\r\noff-loading of the shipment of marihuana was in furtherance of\r\nthe criminal activity, as described above. And third, a finding\r\nthat the one-ton quantity of marihuana was reasonably fore-\r\nseeable is warranted from the nature of the undertaking itself\r\n(the importation of marihuana by ship typically involves very\r\nlarge quantities of marihuana). The specific circumstances of\r\nthe case (the defendant was one of ten persons off-loading the\r\nAmendment 790\r\nmarihuana in bales) also support this finding. In an actual\r\ncase, of course, if a defendant’s accountability for particular\r\nconduct is established under one provision of this guideline, it\r\nis not necessary to review alternative provisions under which\r\nsuch accountability might be established. See Application\r\nNote 2.\r\n(B) Acts and omissions aided or abetted by the defendant; acts and omis-\r\nsions in a jointly undertaken criminal activity.—\r\n(i) Defendant C is the getaway driver in an armed bank robbery\r\nin which $15,000 is taken and a teller is assaulted and injured.\r\nDefendant C is accountable for the money taken under subsec-\r\ntion (a)(1)(A) because he aided and abetted the act of taking the\r\nmoney (the taking of money was the specific objective of the\r\noffense he joined). Defendant C is accountable for the injury to\r\nthe teller under subsection (a)(1)(B) because the assault on the\r\nteller was within the scope and in furtherance of the jointly\r\nundertaken criminal activity (the robbery), and was reasonably\r\nforeseeable in connection with that criminal activity (given the\r\nnature of the offense).\r\nAs noted earlier, a defendant may be accountable for particular\r\nconduct under more than one subsection. In this example, De-\r\nfendant C also is accountable for the money taken on the basis\r\nof subsection (a)(1)(B) because the taking of money was within\r\nthe scope and in furtherance of the jointly undertaken criminal\r\nactivity (the robbery), and was reasonably foreseeable (as\r\nnoted, the taking of money was the specific objective of the\r\njointly undertaken criminal activity).\r\n(C) Requirements that the conduct of others be within the scope of the\r\njointly undertaken criminal activity, in furtherance of that criminal ac-\r\ntivity, and reasonably foreseeable.—\r\n(i) Defendant D pays Defendant E a small amount to forge an en-\r\ndorsement on an $800 stolen government check. Unknown to\r\nDefendant E, Defendant D then uses that check as a down pay-\r\nment in a scheme to fraudulently obtain $15,000 worth of mer-\r\nchandise. Defendant E is convicted of forging the $800 check\r\nand is accountable for the forgery of this check under subsec-\r\ntion (a)(1)(A). Defendant E is not accountable for the $15,000\r\nbecause the fraudulent scheme to obtain $15,000 was not\r\nwithin the scope of the jointly undertaken criminal activity\r\n(i.e., the forgery of the $800 check).\r\n(ii) Defendants F and G, working together, design and execute a\r\nscheme to sell fraudulent stocks by telephone. Defendant F\r\nfraudulently obtains $20,000. Defendant G fraudulently ob-\r\ntains $35,000. Each is convicted of mail fraud. Defendants F\r\nand G each are accountable for the entire amount ($55,000).\r\nEach defendant is accountable for the amount he personally\r\nobtained under subsection (a)(1)(A). Each defendant is ac-\r\ncountable for the amount obtained by his accomplice under\r\nAmendment 790\r\n98 ║ Supplement to Appendix C (November 1, 2016)\r\nsubsection (a)(1)(B) because the conduct of each was within the\r\nscope of the jointly undertaken criminal activity (the scheme to\r\nsell fraudulent stocks), was in furtherance of that criminal ac-\r\ntivity, and was reasonably foreseeable in connection with that\r\ncriminal activity.\r\n(iii) Defendants H and I engaged in an ongoing marihuana impor-\r\ntation conspiracy in which Defendant J was hired only to help\r\noff-load a single shipment. Defendants H, I, and J are included\r\nin a single count charging conspiracy to import marihuana. De-\r\nfendant J is accountable for the entire single shipment of ma-\r\nrihuana he helped import under subsection (a)(1)(A) and any\r\nacts and omissions of others related to the importation of that\r\nshipment on the basis of subsection (a)(1)(B) (see the discussion\r\nin example (A)(i) above). He is not accountable for prior or sub-\r\nsequent shipments of marihuana imported by Defendants H\r\nor I because those acts were not within the scope of his jointly\r\nundertaken criminal activity (the importation of the single\r\nshipment of marihuana).\r\n(iv) Defendant K is a wholesale distributor of child pornography.\r\nDefendant L is a retail-level dealer who purchases child por-\r\nnography from Defendant K and resells it, but otherwise oper-\r\nates independently of Defendant K. Similarly, Defendant M is\r\na retail-level dealer who purchases child pornography from De-\r\nfendant K and resells it, but otherwise operates independently\r\nof Defendant K. Defendants L and M are aware of each other’s\r\ncriminal activity but operate independently. Defendant N is\r\nDefendant K’s assistant who recruits customers for Defend-\r\nant K and frequently supervises the deliveries to Defend-\r\nant K’s customers. Each defendant is convicted of a count\r\ncharging conspiracy to distribute child pornography. Defend-\r\nant K is accountable under subsection (a)(1)(A) for the entire\r\nquantity of child pornography sold to Defendants L and M. De-\r\nfendant N also is accountable for the entire quantity sold to\r\nthose defendants under subsection (a)(1)(B) because the entire\r\nquantity was within the scope of his jointly undertaken crimi-\r\nnal activity (to distribute child pornography with Defend-\r\nant K), in furtherance of that criminal activity, and reasonably\r\nforeseeable. Defendant L is accountable under subsec-\r\ntion (a)(1)(A) only for the quantity of child pornography that he\r\npurchased from Defendant K because he is not engaged in a\r\njointly undertaken criminal activity with the other defendants.\r\nFor the same reason, Defendant M is accountable under sub-\r\nsection (a)(1)(A) only for the quantity of child pornography that\r\nhe purchased from Defendant K.\r\n(v) Defendant O knows about her boyfriend’s ongoing drug-traf-\r\nficking activity, but agrees to participate on only one occasion\r\nby making a delivery for him at his request when he was ill.\r\nDefendant O is accountable under subsection (a)(1)(A) for the\r\ndrug quantity involved on that one occasion. Defendant O is\r\nnot accountable for the other drug sales made by her boyfriend\r\nAmendment 790\r\nbecause those sales were not within the scope of her jointly un-\r\ndertaken criminal activity (i.e., the one delivery).\r\n(vi) Defendant P is a street-level drug dealer who knows of other\r\nstreet-level drug dealers in the same geographic area who sell\r\nthe same type of drug as he sells. Defendant P and the other\r\ndealers share a common source of supply, but otherwise oper-\r\nate independently. Defendant P is not accountable for the\r\nquantities of drugs sold by the other street-level drug dealers\r\nbecause he is not engaged in a jointly undertaken criminal ac-\r\ntivity with them. In contrast, Defendant Q, another street-level\r\ndrug dealer, pools his resources and profits with four other\r\nstreet-level drug dealers. Defendant Q is engaged in a jointly\r\nundertaken criminal activity and, therefore, he is accountable\r\nunder subsection (a)(1)(B) for the quantities of drugs sold by\r\nthe four other dealers during the course of his joint undertak-\r\ning with them because those sales were within the scope of the\r\njointly undertaken criminal activity, in furtherance of that\r\ncriminal activity, and reasonably foreseeable in connection\r\nwith that criminal activity.\r\n(vii) Defendant R recruits Defendant S to distribute 500 grams of\r\ncocaine. Defendant S knows that Defendant R is the prime fig-\r\nure in a conspiracy involved in importing much larger quanti-\r\nties of cocaine. As long as Defendant S’s agreement and conduct\r\nis limited to the distribution of the 500 grams, Defendant S is\r\naccountable only for that 500 gram amount (under subsec-\r\ntion (a)(1)(A)), rather than the much larger quantity imported\r\nby Defendant R. Defendant S is not accountable under subsec-\r\ntion (a)(1)(B) for the other quantities imported by Defendant R\r\nbecause those quantities were not within the scope of his jointly\r\nundertaken criminal activity (i.e., the 500 grams).\r\n(viii) Defendants T, U, V, and W are hired by a supplier to backpack\r\na quantity of marihuana across the border from Mexico into the\r\nUnited States. Defendants T, U, V, and W receive their indi-\r\nvidual shipments from the supplier at the same time and coor-\r\ndinate their importation efforts by walking across the border\r\ntogether for mutual assistance and protection. Each defendant\r\nis accountable for the aggregate quantity of marihuana trans-\r\nported by the four defendants. The four defendants engaged in\r\na jointly undertaken criminal activity, the object of which was\r\nthe importation of the four backpacks containing marihuana\r\n(subsection (a)(1)(B)), and aided and abetted each other’s ac-\r\ntions (subsection (a)(1)(A)) in carrying out the jointly under-\r\ntaken criminal activity (which under subsection (a)(1)(B) were\r\nalso in furtherance of, and reasonably foreseeable in connection\r\nwith, the criminal activity). In contrast, if Defendants T, U, V,\r\nand W were hired individually, transported their individual\r\nshipments at different times, and otherwise operated inde-\r\npendently, each defendant would be accountable only for the\r\nquantity of marihuana he personally transported (subsec-\r\ntion (a)(1)(A)). As this example illustrates, the scope of the\r\njointly undertaken criminal activity may depend upon\r\nAmendment 791\r\n100 ║ Supplement to Appendix C (November 1, 2016)\r\nwhether, in the particular circumstances, the nature of the of-\r\nfense is more appropriately viewed as one jointly undertaken\r\ncriminal activity or as a number of separate criminal activities.\r\nSee Application Note 3(B).”.\r\nThe Commentary to §2K2.1 captioned “Application Notes” is amended in Note 14(E)\r\nby striking “Application Note 9” both places such term appears and inserting “Appli-\r\ncation Note 11”.\r\nThe Commentary to §2X3.1 captioned “Application Notes” is amended in Note 1 by\r\nstriking “Application Note 10” and inserting “Application Note 12”.\r\nThe Commentary to §2X4.1 captioned “Application Notes” is amended in Note 1 by\r\nstriking “Application Note 10” and inserting “Application Note 12”.","Reason":"REASON FOR AMENDMENT: This amendment is a result of the Commission’s effort to\r\nclarify the use of relevant conduct in offenses involving multiple participants.\r\nThe amendment makes clarifying revisions to §1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct (Factors that\r\nDetermine the Guideline Range)). It restructures the guideline and its commentary to\r\nset out more clearly the three-step analysis the court applies in determining whether\r\na defendant is accountable for the conduct of others in a jointly undertaken criminal\r\nactivity under §1B1.3(a)(1)(B). The three-step analysis requires that the court (1) iden-\r\ntify the scope of the jointly undertaken criminal activity; (2) determine whether the\r\nconduct of others in the jointly undertaken criminal activity was in furtherance of that\r\ncriminal activity; and (3) determine whether the conduct of others was reasonably fore-\r\nseeable in connection with that criminal activity.\r\nPrior to this amendment, the “scope” element of the three-step analysis was identified\r\nin the commentary to §1B1.3 but was not included in the text of the guideline itself.\r\nThis amendment makes clear that, under the “jointly undertaken criminal activity”\r\nprovision, a defendant is accountable for the conduct of others in a jointly undertaken\r\ncriminal activity if the conduct meets all three criteria of the three-step analysis.

The amendment adjusts the amounts in each of the seven\r\nmonetary tables using a specific multiplier derived from the Consumer Price In-\r\ndex (CPI), and then rounds—\r\n amounts greater than $100,000,000 to the nearest multiple of $50,000,000;\r\n amounts greater than $10,000,000 to the nearest multiple of $5,000,000;\r\n amounts greater than $1,000,000 to the nearest multiple of $500,000;\r\n amounts greater than $100,000 to the nearest multiple of $50,000;\r\n amounts greater than $10,000 to the nearest multiple of $5,000;\r\n amounts greater than $1,000 to the nearest multiple of $500; and\r\n amounts of $1,000 or less to the nearest multiple of $50.\r\nIn addition, the amendment includes conforming changes to other Chapter Two guide-\r\nlines that refer to the monetary tables.\r\nCongress has generally mandated that agencies in the executive branch adjust the civil\r\nmonetary penalties they impose to account for inflation using the CPI. See 28 U.S.C.\r\n§ 2461 note (Federal Civil Penalties Inflationary Adjustment Act of 1990). Although\r\nthe Commission’s work does not involve civil monetary penalties, it does establish ap-\r\npropriate criminal sentences for categories of offenses and offenders, including appro-\r\npriate amounts for criminal fines. While some of the monetary values in the Chapter\r\nTwo guidelines have been revised since they were originally established in 1987, none\r\nof the tables has been specifically revised to account for inflation.\r\nDue to inflationary changes, there has been a gradual decrease in the value of the\r\ndollar over time. As a result, monetary losses in current offenses reflect, to some de-\r\ngree, a lower degree of harm and culpability than did equivalent amounts when the\r\nmonetary tables were established or last substantively amended. Similarly, the fine\r\nlevels recommended by the guidelines are lower in value than when they were last\r\nAmendment 792\r\n108 ║ Supplement to Appendix C (November 1, 2016)\r\nadjusted, and therefore, do not have the same sentencing impact as a similar fine in\r\nthe past. Based on its analysis and widespread support for inflationary adjustments\r\nexpressed in public comment, the Commission concluded that aligning the above mon-\r\netary tables with modern dollar values is an appropriate step at this time.\r\nThe amendment adjusts each table based on inflationary changes since the year each\r\nmonetary table was last substantially amended:\r\n Loss table in §2B1.1 and tax table in §2T4.1: adjusting for inflation from 2001\r\n($1.00 in 2001 = $1.34 in 2014);\r\n Loss tables in §§2B2.1 and 2B3.1 and fine table for individual defendants at\r\n§5E1.2(c)(3): adjusting for inflation from 1989 ($1.00 in 1989 = $1.91 in 2014);\r\n Volume of Commerce table in §2R1.1: adjusting for inflation from 2005 ($1.00\r\nin 2005 = $1.22 in 2014); and\r\n Fine table for organizational defendants at §8C2.4(d): adjusting for inflation\r\nfrom 1991 ($1.00 in 1991 = $1.74 in 2014).\r\nAdjusting from the last substantive amendment year appropriately accounts for the\r\nCommission’s previous work in revising these tables at various times. Although not\r\nspecifically focused on inflationary issues, previous Commissions engaged in careful\r\nexamination (and at times, a wholesale rewriting) of the monetary tables and ulti-\r\nmately included monetary and enhancement levels that it considered appropriate at\r\nthat time. The Commission estimates that this amendment would result in the Bureau\r\nof Prisons having approximately 224 additional prison beds available at the end of the\r\nfirst year after implementation, and approximately 956 additional prison beds availa-\r\nble at the end of its fifth year of implementation.\r\nFinally, the amendment adds a special instruction to both §§5E1.2 and 8C2.4 providing\r\nthat, for offenses committed prior to November 1, 2015, the court shall use the fine\r\nprovisions that were in effect on November 1, 2014, rather than the fine provisions as\r\namended for inflation. This addition responds to concerns expressed in public comment\r\nthat changes to the fine tables might create ex post facto problems. It ensures that an\r\noffender whose offense level is calculated under the current Guidelines Manual is not\r\nsubject to the inflated fine provisions if his or her offense was committed prior to No-\r\nvember 1, 2015. Such guidance is similar to that provided in the commentary to §5E1.3\r\n(Special Assessment) relating to the amount of the special assessment to be imposed\r\nin a given case.","EffectiveDate":"Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2015."},{"Id":791,"Title":"Amendment 791","Text":"Section 2B1.1 is amended in subsection (b)(2) by striking the following:\r\n“ (Apply the greatest) If the offense—\r\n(A) (i) involved 10 or more victims; or (ii) was committed through mass-\r\nmarketing, increase by 2 levels;\r\nAmendment 792\r\n(B) involved 50 or more victims, increase by 4 levels; or\r\n(C) involved 250 or more victims, increase by 6 levels.”,\r\nand inserting the following:\r\n“ (Apply the greatest) If the offense—\r\n(A) (i) involved 10 or more victims; (ii) was committed through mass-mar-\r\nketing; or (iii) resulted in substantial financial hardship to one or more\r\nvictims, increase by 2 levels;\r\n(B) resulted in substantial financial hardship to five or more victims, in-\r\ncrease by 4 levels; or\r\n(C) resulted in substantial financial hardship to 25 or more victims, in-\r\ncrease by 6 levels.”;\r\nin subsection (b)(10)(C) by inserting after “the offense otherwise involved sophisticated\r\nmeans” the following: “and the defendant intentionally engaged in or caused the con-\r\nduct constituting sophisticated means”;\r\nand in subsection (b)(16)(B) by inserting “or” at the end of subdivision (i), and by strik-\r\ning “; or (iii) substantially endangered the solvency or financial security of 100 or more\r\nvictims”.\r\nThe Commentary to §2B1.1 captioned “Application Notes” is amended in Note 3(A)(ii)\r\nby striking “(I) means the pecuniary harm that was intended to result from the offense;\r\nand” and inserting “(I) means the pecuniary harm that the defendant purposely sought\r\nto inflict; and”;\r\nin Note 3(F)(ix) by striking “there shall be a rebuttable presumption that the actual\r\nloss attributable to the change in value of the security or commodity is the amount\r\ndetermined by—” and inserting “the court in determining loss may use any method\r\nthat is appropriate and practicable under the circumstances.

This\r\namendment is a result of the Commission’s multi-year study of §2B1.1 and related\r\nguidelines, and follows extensive data collection and analysis relating to economic of-\r\nfenses and offenders. Using this Commission data, combined with legal analysis and\r\npublic comment, the Commission identified a number of specific areas where changes\r\nwere appropriate.\r\nVictims Table\r\nFirst, the amendment revises the victims table in §2B1.1(b)(2) to specifically incorpo-\r\nrate substantial financial hardship to victims as a factor in sentencing economic crime\r\noffenders. As amended, the first tier of the victims table provides for a 2-level enhance-\r\nment where the offense involved 10 or more victims or mass-marketing, or if the of-\r\nfense resulted in substantial financial hardship to one or more victims. The 4-level\r\nenhancement applies if the offense resulted in substantial financial hardship to five or\r\nmore victims, and the 6-level enhancement applies if the offense resulted in substan-\r\ntial financial hardship to 25 or more victims. As a conforming change, the special rule\r\nin Application Note 4(C)(ii)(I), pertaining to theft of undelivered mail, is also revised\r\nto refer to 10 rather than 50 victims.\r\nIn addition, the amendment adds a non-exhaustive list of factors for courts to consider\r\nin determining whether the offense caused substantial financial hardship. These fac-\r\ntors include: becoming insolvent; filing for bankruptcy; suffering substantial loss of a\r\nretirement, education, or other savings or investment fund; making substantial\r\nchanges to employment; making substantial changes to living arrangements; or suf-\r\nfering substantial harm to the victim’s ability to obtain credit. Two conforming changes\r\nare also included. First, one factor — substantial harm to ability to obtain credit —\r\nwas previously included in Application Note 20(A)(vi) as a potential departure consid-\r\neration. The amendment removes this language from the Application Note. Second,\r\nthe amendment deletes subsection (b)(16)(B)(iii), which provided for an enhancement\r\nwhere an offense substantially endangered the solvency or financial security of 100 or\r\nmore victims.\r\nThe Commission continues to believe that the number of victims is a meaningful meas-\r\nure of the harm and scope of an offense and can be indicative of its seriousness. It is\r\nfor this reason that the amended victims table maintains the 2-level enhancement for\r\noffenses that involve 10 or more victims or mass marketing. However, the revisions to\r\nAmendment 792\r\nthe victims table also reflect the Commission’s conclusion that the guideline should\r\nplace greater emphasis on the extent of harm that particular victims suffer as a result\r\nof the offense. Consistent with the Commission’s overall goal of focusing more on victim\r\nharm, the revised victims table ensures that an offense that results in even one victim\r\nsuffering substantial financial harm receives increased punishment, while also lessen-\r\ning the cumulative impact of loss and the number of victims, particularly in high-loss\r\ncases.\r\nIntended Loss\r\nSecond, the amendment revises the commentary at §2B1.1, Application Note 3(A)(ii),\r\nwhich has defined intended loss as “pecuniary harm that was intended to result from\r\nthe offense.” In interpreting this provision, courts have expressed some disagreement\r\nas to whether a subjective or an objective inquiry is required. Compare United States\r\nv. Manatau, 647 F.3d 1048 (10th Cir. 2011) (holding that a subjective inquiry is re-\r\nquired), United States v. Diallo, 710 F.3d 147, 151 (3d Cir. 2013) (“To make this deter-\r\nmination, we look to the defendant’s subjective expectation, not to the risk of loss to\r\nwhich he may have exposed his victims.”), United States v. Confredo, 528 F.3d 143,\r\n152 (2d Cir. 2008) (remanding for consideration of whether defendant had “proven a\r\nsubjective intent to cause a loss of less than the aggregate amount” of fraudulent\r\nloans), and United States v. Sanders, 343 F.3d 511, 527 (5th Cir. 2003) (“our case law\r\nrequires the government prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant\r\nhad the subjective intent to cause the loss that is used to calculate his offense level”),\r\nwith United States v. Innarelli, 524 F.3d 286, 291 (1st Cir. 2008) (“we focus our loss\r\ninquiry for purposes of determining a defendant’s offense level on the objectively rea-\r\nsonable expectation of a person in his position at the time he perpetrated the fraud,\r\nnot on his subjective intentions or hopes”) and United States v. Lane, 323 F.3d 568,\r\n590 (7th Cir. 2003) (“The determination of intended loss under the Sentencing Guide-\r\nlines therefore focuses on the conduct of the defendant and the objective financial risk\r\nto victims caused by that conduct”).\r\nThe amendment adopts the approach taken by the Tenth Circuit by revising the com-\r\nmentary in Application Note 3(A)(ii) to provide that intended loss means the pecuniary\r\nharm that “the defendant purposely sought to inflict.” The amendment reflects the\r\nCommission’s continued belief that intended loss is an important factor in economic\r\ncrime offenses, but also recognizes that sentencing enhancements predicated on in-\r\ntended loss, rather than losses that have actually accrued, should focus more specifi-\r\ncally on the defendant’s culpability.\r\nSophisticated Means\r\nThird, the amendment narrows the focus of the specific offense characteristic at\r\n§2B1.1(b)(10)(C) to cases in which the defendant intentionally engaged in or caused\r\nconduct constituting sophisticated means. Prior to the amendment, the enhancement\r\napplied if “the offense otherwise involved sophisticated means.” Based on this lan-\r\nguage, courts had applied this enhancement on the basis of the sophistication of the\r\noverall scheme without a determination of whether the defendant’s own conduct was\r\n“sophisticated.” See, e.g., United States v. Green, 648 F.3d 569, 576 (7th Cir. 2011);\r\nUnited States v. Bishop-Oyedepo, 480 Fed. App’x 431, 433–34 (7th Cir. 2012); United\r\nStates v. Jenkins-Watt, 574 F.3d 950, 965 (8th Cir. 2009). The Commission concluded\r\nthat basing the enhancement on the defendant’s own intentional conduct better re-\r\nflects the defendant’s culpability and will appropriately minimize application of this\r\nenhancement to less culpable offenders.\r\nAmendment 793\r\n112 ║ Supplement to Appendix C (November 1, 2016)\r\nFraud on the Market\r\nFinally, the amendment revises the special rule at Application Note 3(F)(ix) relating\r\nto the calculation of loss in cases involving the fraudulent inflation or deflation in the\r\nvalue of a publicly traded security or commodity. When this special rule was added to\r\nthe guidelines, it established a rebuttable presumption that the specified loss calcula-\r\ntion methodology provides a reasonable estimate of the actual loss in such cases. As\r\namended, the method provided in the special rule is no longer the presumed starting\r\npoint for calculating loss in these cases. Instead, the revised special rule states that\r\nthe provided method is one method that courts may consider, but that courts, in deter-\r\nmining loss, are free to use any method that is appropriate and practicable under the\r\ncircumstances. This amendment reflects the Commission’s view that the most appro-\r\npriate method to determine a reasonable estimate of loss will often vary in these highly\r\ncomplex and fact-intensive cases.\r\nThis amendment, in combination with related revisions to the mitigating role guideline\r\nat §3B1.2 (Mitigating Role), reflects the Commission’s overall goal of focusing the eco-\r\nnomic crime guideline more on qualitative harm to victims and individual offender\r\nculpability.","EffectiveDate":"Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2015."},{"Id":792,"Title":"Amendment 792","Text":"Section 2D1.1(c) is amended in each of subdivisions (5), (6), (7), (8), and\r\n(9) by striking the lines referenced to Schedule III Hydrocodone;\r\nand in each of subdivisions (10), (11), (12), (13), (14), (15), (16), and (17) by striking the\r\nlines referenced to Schedule III Hydrocodone, and in the lines referenced to Schedule\r\nIII substances (except Ketamine or Hydrocodone) by striking “or Hydrocodone”.\r\nThe annotation to §2D1.1(c) captioned “Notes to Drug Quantity Table” is amended in\r\nNote (B) in the last paragraph by striking “The term ‘Oxycodone (actual)’ refers” and\r\ninserting “The terms ‘Hydrocodone (actual)’ and ‘Oxycodone (actual)’ refer”.\r\nThe Commentary to §2D1.1 captioned “Application Notes” is amended in Note 8(D),\r\nunder the heading relating to Schedule I or II Opiates, by striking the line referenced\r\nto Hydrocodone/Dihydrocodeinone and inserting the following:\r\n“ 1 gm of Hydrocodone (actual) = 6700 gm of marihuana”;\r\nin the heading relating to Schedule III Substances (except ketamine and hydrocodone)\r\nby striking “and hydrocodone” both places such term appears;\r\nand in the heading relating to Schedule III Hydrocodone by striking the heading and\r\nsubsequent paragraphs as follows:\r\n“ Schedule III Hydrocodone****\r\n1 unit of Schedule III hydrocodone = 1 gm of marihuana\r\nAmendment 793\r\n****Provided, that the combined equivalent weight of all Schedule III sub-\r\nstances (except ketamine), Schedule IV substances (except flunitrazepam), and\r\nSchedule V substances shall not exceed 2,999.99 kilograms of marihuana.”;\r\nand in Note 27(C) by inserting after “methamphetamine,” the following: “hydroco-\r\ndone,”.","Reason":"REASON FOR AMENDMENT: This amendment changes the way the primary drug traf-\r\nficking guideline calculates a defendant’s drug quantity in cases involving hydrocodone\r\nin response to recent administrative actions by the Food and Drug Administration and\r\nthe Drug Enforcement Administration. The amendment adopts a marihuana equiva-\r\nlency for hydrocodone (1 gram equals 6700 grams of marihuana) based on the weight\r\nof the hydrocodone alone.\r\nIn 2013 and 2014, the Food and Drug Administration approved several new pharma-\r\nceuticals containing hydrocodone which can contain up to twelve times as much hydro-\r\ncodone in a single pill than was previously available. Separately, in October 2014, the\r\nDrug Enforcement Administration moved certain commonly-prescribed pharmaceuti-\r\ncals containing hydrocodone from the less-restricted Schedule III to the more-re-\r\nstricted Schedule II. Among other things, the scheduling doubled the statutory maxi-\r\nmum term of imprisonment available for trafficking in the pharmaceuticals that were\r\npreviously controlled under Schedule III from 10 years to 20 years. The change also\r\nrendered obsolete the entries in the Drug Quantity Table and Drug Equivalency Table\r\nin §2D1.1 (Unlawful Manufacturing, Importing, Exporting, or Trafficking (Including\r\nPossession with Intent to Commit These Offenses); Attempt or Conspiracy) that set a\r\nmarihuana equivalency for the pharmaceuticals that were previously controlled under\r\nSchedule III.\r\nAs a result of these administrative actions, all pharmaceuticals that include hydroco-\r\ndone are now subject to the same statutory penalties. There is wide variation in the\r\namount of hydrocodone available in these pharmaceuticals and in the amount of other\r\ningredients (such as binders, coloring, acetaminophen, etc.) they contain. This varia-\r\ntion raises significant proportionality issues within §2D1.1, where drug quantity for\r\nhydrocodone offenses has previously been calculated based on the weight of the entire\r\nsubstance that contains hydrocodone or on the number of pills. Neither of these calcu-\r\nlations directly took into account the amount of actual hydrocodone in the pills.\r\nThe amendment addresses these changed circumstances by setting a new marihuana\r\nequivalency for hydrocodone based on the weight of the hydrocodone alone. Without\r\nthis change, defendants with less actual hydrocodone could have received a higher\r\nguideline range than those with more hydrocodone because pills with less hydrocodone\r\ncan sometimes contain more non-hydrocodone ingredients, leading the lower-dose pills\r\nto weigh more.\r\nIn setting the marihuana equivalency, the Commission considered: potency of the\r\ndrug, medical use of the drug, and patterns of abuse and trafficking, such as prevalence\r\nof abuse, consequences of misuse including death or serious bodily injury from use, and\r\nincidence of violence associated with its trafficking. The Commission noted that the\r\nDrug Enforcement Administration’s rescheduling decision relied in part on the close\r\nrelationship between hydrocodone and oxycodone, a similar and commonly-prescribed\r\ndrug that was already controlled under Schedule II. Scientific literature, public com-\r\nment, and testimony supported the conclusion that the potency, medical use, and pat-\r\nterns of abuse and trafficking of hydrocodone are very similar to oxycodone. In partic-\r\nular, the Commission heard testimony from abuse liability specialists and reviewed\r\nAmendment 794\r\n114 ║ Supplement to Appendix C (November 1, 2016)\r\nscientific literature indicating that, in studies conducted under standards established\r\nby the Food and Drug Administration for determining the abuse liability of a particular\r\ndrug, the potencies of hydrocodone and oxycodone when abused are virtually identical,\r\neven though some physicians who prescribe the two drugs in a clinical setting might\r\nnot prescribe them in equal doses. Public comment indicated that both hydrocodone\r\nand oxycodone are among the top ten drugs most frequently encountered by law en-\r\nforcement and that their methods of diversion and rates of diversion per kilogram of\r\navailable drug are similar. Public comment and review of the scientific literature also\r\nindicated that the users of the two drugs share similar characteristics, and that some\r\nusers may use them interchangeably, a situation which may become more common as\r\nthe more powerful pharmaceuticals recently approved by the Food and Drug Admin-\r\nistration become available.\r\nBased on proportionality considerations and the Commission’s assessment that, for\r\npurposes of the drug guideline, hydrocodone and oxycodone should be treated equiva-\r\nlently, the amendment adopts a marihuana equivalency for hydrocodone (actual) that\r\nis the same as the existing equivalency for oxycodone (actual): 1 gram equals\r\n6,700 grams of marihuana.","EffectiveDate":"Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2015."},{"Id":793,"Title":"Amendment 793","Text":"The Commentary to §3B1.2 captioned “Application Notes” is amended in\r\nNote 3(A) by inserting after “that makes him substantially less culpable than the av-\r\nerage participant” the following: “in the criminal activity”, by striking “concerted” and\r\ninserting “the”, by striking “is not precluded from consideration for” each place such\r\nterm appears and inserting “may receive”, by striking “role” both places such term\r\nappears and inserting “participation”, and by striking “personal gain from a fraud of-\r\nfense and who had limited knowledge” and inserting “personal gain from a fraud of-\r\nfense or who had limited knowledge”;\r\nin Note 3(C) by inserting at the end the following new paragraphs:\r\n“ In determining whether to apply subsection (a) or (b), or an intermediate ad-\r\njustment, the court should consider the following non-exhaustive list of factors:\r\n(i) the degree to which the defendant understood the scope and structure\r\nof the criminal activity;\r\n(ii) the degree to which the defendant participated in planning or organiz-\r\ning the criminal activity;\r\n(iii) the degree to which the defendant exercised decision-making authority\r\nor influenced the exercise of decision-making authority;\r\n(iv) the nature and extent of the defendant’s participation in the commis-\r\nsion of the criminal activity, including the acts the defendant per-\r\nformed and the responsibility and discretion the defendant had in per-\r\nforming those acts;\r\nAmendment 794\r\n(v) the degree to which the defendant stood to benefit from the criminal\r\nactivity.\r\nFor example, a defendant who does not have a proprietary interest in the crim-\r\ninal activity and who is simply being paid to perform certain tasks should be\r\nconsidered for an adjustment under this guideline.\r\nThe fact that a defendant performs an essential or indispensable role in the\r\ncriminal activity is not determinative.

The Commission conducted a review of cases involving low-\r\nlevel offenders, analyzed case law, and considered public comment and testimony.\r\nOverall, the study found that mitigating role is applied inconsistently and more spar-\r\ningly than the Commission intended. In drug cases, the Commission’s study confirmed\r\nthat mitigating role is applied inconsistently to drug defendants who performed simi-\r\nlar low-level functions (and that rates of application vary widely from district to dis-\r\ntrict). For example, application of mitigating role varies along the southwest border,\r\nwith a low of 14.3 percent of couriers and mules receiving the mitigating role adjust-\r\nment in one district compared to a high of 97.2 percent in another. Moreover, among\r\ndrug defendants who do receive mitigating role, there are differences from district to\r\ndistrict in application rates of the 2-, 3-, and 4-level adjustments. In economic crime\r\ncases, the study found that the adjustment was often applied in a limited fashion. For\r\nexample, the study found that courts often deny mitigating role to otherwise eligible\r\ndefendants if the defendant was considered “integral” to the successful commission of\r\nthe offense.\r\nThis amendment provides additional guidance to sentencing courts in determining\r\nwhether a mitigating role adjustment applies. Specifically, it addresses a circuit con-\r\nflict and other case law that may be discouraging courts from applying the adjustment\r\nin otherwise appropriate circumstances. It also provides a non-exhaustive list of fac-\r\ntors for the court to consider in determining whether an adjustment applies and, if so,\r\nthe amount of the adjustment.\r\nSection 3B1.2 provides an adjustment of 2, 3, or 4 levels for a defendant who plays a\r\npart in committing the offense that makes him or her “substantially less culpable than\r\nthe average participant.” However, there are differences among the circuits about what\r\ndetermining the “average participant” requires. The Seventh and Ninth Circuits have\r\nconcluded that the “average participant” means only those persons who actually par-\r\nticipated in the criminal activity at issue in the defendant’s case, so that the defend-\r\nant’s relative culpability is determined only by reference to his or her co-participants\r\nin the case at hand. See, e.g., United States v. Benitez, 34 F.3d 1489, 1498 (9th Cir.\r\n1994); United States v. Cantrell, 433 F.3d 1269, 1283 (9th Cir. 2006); United States v.\r\nDePriest, 6 F.3d 1201, 1214 (7th Cir. 1993). The First and Second Circuits have con-\r\ncluded that the “average participant” also includes “the universe of persons participat-\r\ning in similar crimes.” See United States v. Santos, 357 F.3d 136, 142 (1st Cir. 2004);\r\nsee also United States v. Rahman, 189 F.3d 88, 159 (2d Cir. 1999). Under this latter\r\nAmendment 794\r\n116 ║ Supplement to Appendix C (November 1, 2016)\r\napproach, courts will ordinarily consider the defendant’s culpability relative both to\r\nhis co-participants and to the typical offender.\r\nThe amendment generally adopts the approach of the Seventh and Ninth Circuits, re-\r\nvising the commentary to specify that, when determining mitigating role, the defend-\r\nant is to be compared with the other participants “in the criminal activity.” Focusing\r\nthe court’s attention on the individual defendant and the other participants is more\r\nconsistent with the other provisions of Chapter Three, Part B. See, e.g., §3B1.2 (the\r\nadjustment is based on “the defendant’s role in the offense”); §3B1.2, comment. (n.3(C))\r\n(a determination about mitigating role “is heavily dependent upon the facts of the par-\r\nticular case”); Ch. 3, Pt. B, intro. comment. (the determination about mitigating role\r\n“is to be made on the basis of all conduct within the scope of §1B1.3 (Relevant Con-\r\nduct)”).\r\nNext, the amendment addresses cases in which the defendant was “integral” or “indis-\r\npensable” to the commission of the offense. Public comment suggested, and a review of\r\ncase law confirmed, that in some cases a defendant may be denied a mitigating role\r\nadjustment solely because he or she was “integral” or “indispensable” to the commis-\r\nsion of the offense. See, e.g., United States v. Skinner, 690 F.3d 772, 783–84 (6th Cir.\r\n2012) (a “defendant who plays a lesser role in a criminal scheme may nonetheless fail\r\nto qualify as a minor participant if his role was indispensible or critical to the success\r\nof the scheme”); United States v. Panaigua-Verdugo, 537 F.3d 722, 725 (7th Cir. 2008)\r\n(defendant “played an integral part in the transactions and therefore did not deserve\r\na minor participant reduction”); United States v. Deans, 590 F.3d 907, 910 (8th Cir.\r\n2010) (“Numerous decisions have upheld the denial of minor role adjustments to de-\r\nfendants who . . . play a critical role”); United States v. Carter, 971 F.2d 597, 600\r\n(10th Cir. 1992) (because defendant was “indispensible to the completion of the crimi-\r\nnal activity . . . to debate which one is less culpable than the others . . . is akin to the\r\nold argument over which leg of a three-legged stool is the most important leg.”). How-\r\never, a finding that the defendant was essential to the offense does not alter the re-\r\nquirement, expressed in Note 3(A), that the court must assess the defendant’s culpa-\r\nbility relative to the average participant in the offense. Accordingly, the amendment\r\nrevises the commentary to emphasize that “the fact that a defendant performs an es-\r\nsential or indispensable role in the criminal activity is not determinative” and that\r\nsuch a defendant may receive a mitigating role adjustment, if he or she is otherwise\r\neligible.\r\nThe amendment also revises two paragraphs in Note 3(A) that illustrate how mitigat-\r\ning role interacts with relevant conduct principles in §1B1.3. Specifically, the illustra-\r\ntions provide that certain types of defendants are “not precluded from consideration\r\nfor” a mitigating role adjustment. The amendment revises these paragraphs to state\r\nthat these types of defendants “may receive” a mitigating role adjustment. The Com-\r\nmission determined that the double-negative tone (“not precluded”) may have had the\r\nunintended effect of discouraging courts from applying the mitigating role adjustment\r\nin otherwise appropriate circumstances.\r\nFinally, the amendment provides a non-exhaustive list of factors for the court to con-\r\nsider in determining whether to apply a mitigating role adjustment and, if so, the\r\namount of the adjustment. The factors direct the court to consider the degree to which\r\nthe defendant understood the scope and structure of the criminal activity, participated\r\nin planning or organizing the criminal activity, and exercised decision-making author-\r\nity, as well as the acts the defendant performed and the degree to which he or she stood\r\nto benefit from the criminal activity. The Commission was persuaded by public com-\r\nment and a detailed review of cases involving low-level offenders, particularly in fraud\r\nAmendment 795\r\ncases, that providing a list of factors will give the courts a common framework for de-\r\ntermining whether to apply a mitigating role adjustment (and, if so, the amount of the\r\nadjustment) and will help promote consistency.\r\nThe amendment further provides, as an example, that a defendant who does not have\r\na proprietary interest in the criminal activity and who is simply being paid to perform\r\ncertain tasks should be considered for a mitigating role adjustment.","EffectiveDate":"Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2015."},{"Id":794,"Title":"Amendment 794","Text":"The Commentary to §2L1.2 captioned “Application Notes” is amended in\r\nNote 4(B) by striking “not counted as a single sentence” and inserting “not treated as\r\na single sentence”.\r\nSection 4A1.1(e) is amended by striking “such sentence was counted as a single sen-\r\ntence” and inserting “such sentence was treated as a single sentence”.\r\nThe Commentary to §4A1.1 captioned “Application Notes” is amended in Note 5 by\r\nstriking “are counted as a single sentence” and inserting “are treated as a single sen-\r\ntence”; and by striking “are counted as a single prior sentence” and inserting “are\r\ntreated as a single prior sentence”.\r\nSection 4A1.2(a)(2) is amended by striking “those sentences are counted separately or\r\nas a single sentence” and inserting “those sentences are counted separately or treated\r\nas a single sentence”; by striking “Count any prior sentence” and inserting “Treat any\r\nprior sentence”; and by striking “if prior sentences are counted as a single sentence”\r\nand inserting “if prior sentences are treated as a single sentence”.\r\nThe Commentary to §4A1.2 captioned “Application Notes” is amended in Note 3 by\r\nredesignating Note 3 as Note 3(B), and by inserting at the beginning the following:\r\n“ Application of ‘Single Sentence’ Rule (Subsection (a)(2)).—\r\n(A) Predicate Offenses.—In some cases, multiple prior sentences are\r\ntreated as a single sentence for purposes of calculating the criminal\r\nhistory score under §4A1.1(a), (b), and (c). However, for purposes of de-\r\ntermining predicate offenses, a prior sentence included in the single\r\nsentence should be treated as if it received criminal history points, if it\r\nindependently would have received criminal history points. Therefore,\r\nan individual prior sentence may serve as a predicate under the career\r\noffender guideline (see §4B1.2(c)) or other guidelines with predicate of-\r\nfenses, if it independently would have received criminal history points.\r\nHowever, because predicate offenses may be used only if they are\r\ncounted “separately” from each other (see §4B1.2(c)), no more than one\r\nprior sentence in a given single sentence may be used as a predicate\r\noffense.\r\nFor example, a defendant’s criminal history includes one robbery con-\r\nviction and one theft conviction.

Because this particular robbery met the def-\r\ninition of a felony crime of violence and independently would have re-\r\nceived 2 criminal history points under §4A1.1(b), it may serve as a\r\npredicate under the career offender guideline.\r\nNote, however, that if the sentences in the example above were im-\r\nposed thirteen years ago, the robbery independently would have re-\r\nceived no criminal history points under §4A1.1(b), because it was not\r\nimposed within ten years of the defendant’s commencement of the in-\r\nstant offense.

Generally, this operates to reduce the cumulative\r\nimpact of prior sentences in determining a defendant’s criminal history score. Courts,\r\nhowever, are divided over whether this “single sentence” rule also causes certain prior\r\nconvictions that ordinarily would qualify as predicate offenses under the career of-\r\nfender guideline to be disqualified from serving as predicate offenses. See §4B1.2 (Def-\r\ninitions of Terms Used in Section 4B1.1), comment. (n.3).\r\nIn 2010, in King v. United States, the Eighth Circuit held that when two or more prior\r\nsentences are treated as a single sentence under the guidelines, all the criminal history\r\npoints attributable to the single sentence are assigned to only one of the prior sentences\r\n— specifically, the one that was the longest. King, 595 F.3d 844, 852 (8th Cir. 2010).\r\nAccordingly, only that prior sentence may be considered a predicate offense for pur-\r\nposes of the career offender guideline. Id. at 849, 852.\r\nIn 2014, in United States v. Williams, a panel of the Sixth Circuit considered and re-\r\njected King, because it permitted the defendant to “evade career offender status be-\r\ncause he committed more crimes.” Williams, 753 F.3d 626, 639 (6th Cir. 2014) (empha-\r\nsis in original). See also United States v. Cornog, 945 F.2d 1504, 1506 n.3 (11th Cir.\r\n1991) (“It would be illogical . . . to ignore a conviction for a violent felony just because\r\nit happened to be coupled with a nonviolent felony conviction having a longer sen-\r\ntence.”).\r\nAmendment 796\r\nAfter the Williams decision, a different panel of the Eighth Circuit agreed with the\r\nSixth Circuit’s analysis but was not in a position to overrule the earlier panel’s decision\r\nin King. See Donnell v. United States, 765 F.3d 817, 820 (8th Cir. 2014). The Eighth\r\nCircuit has applied the analysis from King to a case involving the firearms guideline\r\nand to a case in which the prior sentences were consecutive rather than concurrent.\r\nSee, e.g., Pierce v. United States, 686 F.3d 529, 533 n.3 (8th Cir. 2012) (firearms);\r\nUnited States v. Parker, 762 F.3d 801, 808 (8th Cir. 2014) (consecutive sentences). This\r\nissue has also been addressed by other courts, some which have followed the Sixth\r\nCircuit’s approach in Williams. See, e.g., United States v. Carr, 2013 WL 4855341\r\n(N.D. Ga. 2013); United States v. Agurs, 2014 WL 3735584 (W.D. Pa., July 28, 2014).\r\nOther decisions have been consistent with the Eighth Circuit’s approach in King.\r\nSee, e.g., United States v. Santiago, 387 F. App’x 223 (3d Cir. 2010); United States v.\r\nMcQueen, 2014 WL 3749215 (E.D. Wash., July 28, 2014).\r\nThe amendment generally follows the Sixth Circuit’s approach in Williams. It amends\r\nthe commentary to §4A1.2 to provide that, for purposes of determining predicate of-\r\nfenses, a prior sentence included in a single sentence should be treated as if it received\r\ncriminal history points if it independently would have received criminal history points.\r\nIt also provides examples, including an example to illustrate the potential impact of\r\nthe applicable time periods prescribed in §4A1.2(e). Finally, §§4A1.1 (Criminal History\r\nCategory) and 4A1.2 are revised stylistically so that sentences “counted” as a single\r\nsentence are referred to instead as sentences “treated” as a single sentence.\r\nThe amendment ensures that those defendants who have committed more crimes, in\r\naddition to a predicate offense, remain subject to enhanced penalties under certain\r\nguidelines such as the career offender guideline.

As part of this study, the Commission considered feedback\r\nfrom the field, including conducting a roundtable discussion on these topics and con-\r\nsidering the varying case law interpreting these statutory and guideline definitions.\r\nIn particular, the Commission has received extensive comment, and is aware of nu-\r\nmerous court opinions, expressing a view that the definition of “crime of violence” is\r\ncomplex and unclear. The amendment is informed by this public comment and case\r\nlaw, as well as the Supreme Court’s recent decision in Johnson v. United States,\r\n135 S. Ct. 2551 (2015), regarding the statutory definition of “violent felony” in\r\n18 U.S.C. § 924(e) (commonly referred to as the “Armed Career Criminal Act” or\r\n“ACCA”). While not addressing the guidelines, that decision has given rise to signifi-\r\ncant litigation regarding the guideline definition of “crime of violence.” Finally, the\r\nCommission analyzed a range of sentencing data, including a study of the sentences\r\nrelative to the guidelines for the career offender guidelines. See U.S. Sent’g Comm’n,\r\nQuick Facts: Career Offenders (Nov. 2015) (highlighting the decreasing rate of within\r\nrange guideline sentences (27.5% in fiscal year 2014), which has been coupled with\r\nincreasing rates of government (45.6%) and non-government sponsored below range\r\nsentences (25.9%)).\r\nThe amendment makes several changes to the definition of “crime of violence” at\r\n§4B1.2 (Definitions of Terms Used in Section 4B1.1), which, prior to this amendment,\r\nwas defined as any offense under federal or state law, punishable by imprisonment for\r\na term exceeding one year, that\r\n● has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force\r\nagainst the person of another (“force clause” or “elements clause”),\r\nsee §4B1.2(a)(1);\r\n● is murder, manslaughter, kidnapping, aggravated assault, forcible sex of-\r\nfenses, robbery, arson, extortion, extortionate extension of credit, burglary of a\r\ndwelling, or involves the use of explosives (“enumerated offenses”),\r\nsee §4B1.2(a)(2) and comment. (n.1); or\r\n● otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical\r\ninjury to another (“residual clause”), see §4B1.2(a)(2).\r\nThe “crime of violence” definition at §4B1.2 is used to trigger increased sentences un-\r\nder several provisions in the Guidelines Manual, the most significant of which is\r\n§4B1.1 (Career Offender). See also §§2K1.3, 2K2.1, 2S1.1, 4A1.1(e), 7B1.1. The career\r\noffender guideline implements a directive to the Commission set forth at 28 U.S.C.\r\n§ 994(h), which in turn identifies offenders for whom the guidelines must provide in-\r\ncreased punishment. Tracking the criteria set forth in section 994(h), the Commission\r\nimplemented the directive by identifying a defendant as a career offender if (1) the\r\ndefendant was at least eighteen years old at the time he or she committed the instant\r\noffense of conviction; (2) the instant offense is a felony that is a crime of violence or a\r\ncontrolled substance offense, and (3) the defendant has at least two prior felony con-\r\nvictions of either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense. Where these\r\ncriteria are met, the directive at section 994(h), and therefore §4B1.1, provides for sig-\r\nnificantly higher sentences under the guidelines, such that the guideline range is “at\r\nAmendment 798\r\n128 ║ Supplement to Appendix C (November 1, 2016)\r\nor near the maximum [term of imprisonment] authorized.” Commission data shows\r\nthat application of §4B1.1 resulted in an increased final offense level, an increased\r\nCriminal History Category, or both for 91.3 percent of defendants sentenced under the\r\ncareer offender guideline in fiscal year 2014. See U.S. Sent’g Comm’n, Quick Facts:\r\nCareer Offenders (Nov. 2015) (46.3% of career offenders received an increase in both\r\nfinal offense level (from an average of 23 levels to 31 levels) and criminal history cate-\r\ngory (from an average of category IV to category VI); 32.6% had just a higher final\r\noffense level (from an average of 23 levels to 30 levels); and 12.4% had just a higher\r\nCriminal History Category (from an average of category IV to category VI)).\r\nResidual Clause\r\nFirst, the amendment deletes the “residual clause” at §4B1.2(a)(2). Prior to the amend-\r\nment, the term “crime of violence” in §4B1.2 included any offense that “otherwise in-\r\nvolves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.”\r\nIn Johnson, the Supreme Court considered an identical residual clause relating to the\r\nstatutory definition of “violent felony” in the Armed Career Criminal Act. The Court\r\nheld that using the “residual clause” to classify an offense as a “violent felony” violated\r\ndue process because the clause was unconstitutionally vague. See Johnson, 135 S. Ct.\r\nat 2563. While the Supreme Court in Johnson did not consider or address the sentenc-\r\ning guidelines, significant litigation has ensued regarding whether the Supreme\r\nCourt’s holding in Johnson should also apply to the residual clause in §4B1.2. Compare\r\nUnited States v. Matchett, 802 F.3d 1185 (11th Cir. 2015) (rejecting the argument that\r\nthe residual clause in §4B1.2 is unconstitutionally vague in light of Johnson) and\r\nUnited States v. Wilson, 622 F. App’x 393, 405 n.51 (5th Cir. 2015) (in considering the\r\napplicability of Johnson, noting “[o]ur case law indicates that a defendant cannot bring\r\na vagueness challenge against a Sentencing Guideline”), with United States v. Taylor,\r\n803 F.3d 931 (8th Cir. 2015) (finding that previous circuit precedent holding that the\r\nguidelines cannot be unconstitutionally vague because they do not proscribe conduct\r\nis doubtful after Johnson); United States v. Madrid, 805 F.3d 1204, 1211 (10th Cir.\r\n2015) (holding that that the residual clause of §4B1.2(a)(2) is void for vagueness);\r\nUnited States v. Harbin, 610 F. App’x 562 (6th Cir. 2015) (finding that defendant is\r\nentitled to the same relief as offenders sentenced under the residual clause of the\r\nACCA); and United States v. Townsend, 638 F. App’x 172, 177–78 (3d Cir. 2015) (re-\r\nmanding for resentencing in light of the government’s concession that, pursuant to\r\nJohnson, the defendant should not have been sentenced as a career offender).\r\nThe Commission determined that the residual clause at §4B1.2 implicates many of the\r\nsame concerns cited by the Supreme Court in Johnson, and, as a matter of policy,\r\namends §4B1.2(a)(2) to strike the clause. Removing the residual clause has the ad-\r\nvantage of alleviating the considerable application difficulties associated with that\r\nclause, as expressed by judges, probation officers, and litigants. Furthermore, remov-\r\ning the clause will alleviate some of the ongoing litigation and uncertainty resulting\r\nfrom the Johnson decision.\r\nList of Enumerated Offenses\r\nWith the deletion of the residual clause under subsection (a)(2), there are two remain-\r\ning components of the “crime of violence” definition – the “elements clause” and the\r\n“enumerated offenses clause.” The “elements clause” set forth in subsection (a)(1) re-\r\nmains unchanged by the amendment. Thus, any offense under federal or state law,\r\npunishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, qualifies as a “crime of\r\nviolence” if it has as an element the use, or attempted use, or threatened use of physical\r\nAmendment 798\r\nforce against the person of another. Importantly, such an offense may, but need not,\r\nbe specifically enumerated in subsection (a)(2) to qualify as a crime of violence.\r\nThe “enumerated offense clause” identifies specific offenses that qualify as crimes of\r\nviolence. In applying this clause, courts compare the elements of the predicate offense\r\nof conviction with the elements of the enumerated offense in its “generic, contemporary\r\ndefinition.” As has always been the case, such offenses qualify as crimes of violence\r\nregardless of whether the offense expressly has as an element the use, attempted use,\r\nor threatened use of physical force against the person of another. While most of the\r\noffenses on the enumerated list under §4B1.2(a)(2) remain the same, the amendment\r\ndoes revise the list in a number of ways to focus on the most dangerous repeat offend-\r\ners. The revised list is based on the Commission’s consideration of public hearing tes-\r\ntimony, a review of extensive public comment, and an examination of sentencing data\r\nrelating to the risk of violence in these offenses and the recidivism rates of career of-\r\nfenders. Additionally, the Commission’s revisions to the enumerated list also consider\r\nand reflect the fact that offenses not specifically enumerated will continue to qualify\r\nas a crime of violence if they satisfy the elements clause.\r\nAs amended, the enumerated offenses include murder, voluntary manslaughter, kid-\r\nnapping, aggravated assault, forcible sex offenses, robbery, arson, extortion, or the use\r\nor unlawful possession of a firearm described in 26 U.S.C. § 5845(a) or explosive ma-\r\nterial as defined in 18 U.S.C. § 841(c). For easier application, all enumerated offenses\r\nare now included in the guideline at §4B1.2; prior to the amendment, the list was set\r\nforth in both §4B1.2(a)(2) and the commentary at Application Note 1.\r\nManslaughter, which is currently enumerated in Application Note 1, is revised to in-\r\nclude only voluntary manslaughter. While Commission analysis indicates that it is\r\nrare for involuntary manslaughter to be identified as a predicate for the career offender\r\nguideline, this change provides that only voluntary manslaughter should be consid-\r\nered. This is also consistent with the fact that involuntary manslaughter generally\r\nwould not have qualified as a crime of violence under the “residual clause.” See Begay\r\nv. United States, 553 U.S. 137 (2008) (limiting crimes covered by the ACCA residual\r\nclause to those roughly similar in kind and degree of risk posed as the enumerated\r\noffenses, which typically involve “purposeful, violent, and aggressive conduct”).\r\nThe amendment deletes “burglary of a dwelling” from the list of enumerated offenses.\r\nIn implementing this change, the Commission considered that (1) burglary offenses\r\nrarely result in physical violence, (2) “burglary of a dwelling” is rarely the instant of-\r\nfense of conviction or the determinative predicate for purposes of triggering higher\r\npenalties under the career offender guideline, and (3) historically, career offenders\r\nhave rarely been rearrested for a burglary offense after release. The Commission con-\r\nsidered several studies and analyses in reaching these conclusions.\r\nFirst, several recent studies demonstrate that most burglaries do not involve physical\r\nviolence. See Bureau of Justice Statistics, National Crime Victimization Survey, Vic-\r\ntimization During Household Burglary (Sept. 2010) (finding that a household member\r\nexperienced some form of violent victimization in 7% of all household burglaries\r\nfrom 2003 to 2007); Richard S. Culp et al., Is Burglary a Crime of Violence?\r\nAn Analysis of National Data 1998–2007, at 29 (2015), available at\r\nhttps://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/grants/248651.pdf (concluding that 7.6% of burgla-\r\nries between 1998 and 2007 resulted in actual violence or threats of violence, while\r\nactual physical injury was reported in only 2.7% of all burglaries); see also United\r\nStates Department of Justice, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Uniform Crime Report,\r\nCrime in the United States (2014) (classifying burglary as a “property crime” rather\r\nAmendment 798\r\n130 ║ Supplement to Appendix C (November 1, 2016)\r\nthan a “violent crime”). Second, based upon an analysis of offenders sentenced in fiscal\r\nyear 2014, the Commission estimates that removing “burglary of a dwelling” as an\r\nenumerated offense in §4B1.2(a)(2) will reduce the overall proportion of offenders who\r\nqualify as a career offender by less than three percentage points. The Commission fur-\r\nther estimates that removing the enumerated offense would result in only about five\r\npercent of offenders sentenced under USSG §2K2.1 (Unlawful Receipt, Possession, or\r\nTransportation of Firearms or Ammunition; Prohibited Transactions Involving Fire-\r\narms or Ammunition) receiving a lower base offense level than would currently apply.\r\nFinally, a Commission analysis of recidivism rates for career offenders released during\r\ncalendar years 2004 through 2006 indicates that about five percent of such offenders\r\nwere rearrested for a burglary offense during the eight years after their release.\r\nIn reaching this conclusion, the Commission also considered that courts have struggled\r\nwith identifying a uniform contemporary, generic definition of “burglary of dwelling.”\r\nIn particular, circuits have disagreed regarding whether the requirement in Taylor v.\r\nUnited States, 495 U.S. 575, 598 (1990), that the burglary be of a “building or other\r\nstructure” applies in addition to the guidelines’ requirement that the burglary be of a\r\n“dwelling.” Compare United States v. Henriquez, 757 F.3d 144, 148–49 (4th Cir. 2014);\r\nUnited States v. McFalls, 592 F.3d 707 (6th Cir. 2010); United States v. Wenner,\r\n351 F.3d 969 (9th Cir. 2003) with United States v. Ramirez, 708 F.3d 295, 301 (1st Cir.\r\n2013); United States v. Murillo-Lopez, 444 F.3d 337, 340 (5th Cir. 2006); United States\r\nv. Rivera-Oros, 590 F.3d 1123 (10th Cir. 2009); United States v. McClenton, 53 F.3d\r\n584 (3d Cir. 1995); United States v. Graham, 982 F.2d 315 (8th Cir. 1992).\r\nAlthough “burglary of a dwelling” is deleted as an enumerated offense, the amendment\r\nadds an upward departure provision to §4B1.2 to address the unusual case in which\r\nthe instant offense or a prior felony conviction was any burglary offense involving vio-\r\nlence that did not otherwise qualify as a “crime of violence.” This departure provision\r\nallows courts to consider all burglary offenses, as opposed to just burglaries of a dwell-\r\ning, and reflects the Commission’s determination that courts should consider an up-\r\nward departure where a defendant would have received a higher offense level, higher\r\nCriminal History Category, or both (e.g., where the defendant would have been a ca-\r\nreer offender) if such burglary had qualified as a “crime of violence.”\r\nFinally, the amendment adds offenses that involve the “use or unlawful possession of\r\na firearm described in 26 U.S.C. § 5845(a) or an explosive material as defined in\r\n18 U.S.C. § 841(c)” to the enumerated list at §4B1.2(a)(2). This addition is consistent\r\nwith long-standing commentary in §4B1.2 categorically identifying possession of a fire-\r\narm described in 26 U.S.C. § 5845(a) as a “crime of violence,” and therefore maintains\r\nthe status quo. The Commission continues to believe that possession of these types of\r\nweapons (e.g., a sawed-off shotgun or sawed-off rifle, silencer, bomb, or machine gun)\r\ninherently presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another person. Addi-\r\ntionally, inclusion as an enumerated offense reflects Congress’s determination that\r\nsuch weapons are inherently dangerous and, when possessed unlawfully, serve only\r\nviolent purposes. See also USSG App. C, amend. 674 (effective Nov. 1, 2004) (expand-\r\ning the definition of “crime of violence” in Application Note 1 to §4B1.2 to include un-\r\nlawful possession of any firearm described in 26 U.S.C. § 5845(a)).\r\nEnumerated Offense Definitions\r\nThe amendment also adds definitions for the enumerated offenses of forcible sex of-\r\nfense and extortion. The amended guideline, however, continues to rely on existing\r\ncase law for purposes of defining the remaining enumerated offenses. The Commission\r\nAmendment 798\r\ndetermined that adding several new definitions could result in new litigation, and that\r\nit was instead best not to disturb the case law that has developed over the years.\r\nAs amended, “forcible sex offense” includes offenses with an element that consent to\r\nthe conduct is not given or is not legally valid, such as where consent to the conduct is\r\ninvoluntary, incompetent, or coerced. Consistent with the definition in §2L1.2 (Unlaw-\r\nfully Entering or Remaining in the United States), this addition reflects the Commis-\r\nsion’s determination that certain forcible sex offenses which do not expressly include\r\nas an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the\r\nperson of another should nevertheless constitute “crimes of violence” under §4B1.2.\r\nSee also USSG App. C, amend. 722 (effective Nov. 1, 2008) (clarifying the scope of the\r\nterm “forcible sex offense” as that term is used in the definition of “crime of violence”\r\nin §2L1.2, Application Note 1(B)(iii)).\r\nThe new commentary also provides that the offenses of sexual abuse of a minor and\r\nstatutory rape are included only if the sexual abuse of a minor or statutory rape was\r\n(A) an offense described in 18 U.S.C. § 2241(c), or (B) an offense under state law that\r\nwould have been an offense under section 2241(c) if the offense had occurred within\r\nthe special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States. This addition\r\nmakes clear that the term “forcible sex offense” in §4B1.2 includes sexual abuse of a\r\nminor and statutory rape where certain specified elements are present.\r\n“Extortion” is defined as “obtaining something of value from another by the wrongful\r\nuse of (i) force, (ii) fear of physical injury, or (iii) threat of physical injury.” Under case\r\nlaw existing at the time of this amendment, courts generally defined extortion as “ob-\r\ntaining something of value from another with his consent induced by the wrongful use\r\nof force, fear, or threats” based on the Supreme Court’s holding in United States v.\r\nNardello, 393 U.S. 286, 290 (1969) (defining “extortion” for purposes of the Hobbs Act).\r\nConsistent with the Commission’s goal of focusing the career offender and related en-\r\nhancements on the most dangerous offenders, the amendment narrows the generic\r\ndefinition of extortion by limiting the offense to those having an element of force or an\r\nelement of fear or threats “of physical injury,” as opposed to non-violent threats such\r\nas injury to reputation.\r\nDeparture Provision at §4B1.1\r\nFinally, the amendment adds a downward departure provision in §4B1.1 for cases in\r\nwhich one or both of the defendant’s “two prior felony convictions” is based on an of-\r\nfense that is classified as a misdemeanor at the time of sentencing for the instant fed-\r\neral offense.\r\nAn offense (whether a “crime of violence” or a “controlled substance offense”) is deemed\r\nto be a “felony” for purposes of the career offender guideline if it is punishable by im-\r\nprisonment for a term exceeding one year. This definition captures some state offenses\r\nthat are punishable by more than a year of imprisonment, but are in fact classified by\r\nthe state as misdemeanors. Such statutes are found, for example, in Colorado, Iowa,\r\nMaryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, and Vermont.\r\nThe Commission determined that the application of the career offender guideline\r\nwhere one or both of the defendant’s “two prior felony convictions” is an offense that is\r\nclassified as a misdemeanor may result in a guideline range that substantially\r\noverrepresents the seriousness of the defendant’s criminal history or substantially\r\noverstates the seriousness of the instant offense. While recognizing the importance of\r\nmaintaining a uniform and consistent definition of the term “felony” in the guidelines,\r\nAmendment 799\r\n132 ║ Supplement to Appendix C (November 1, 2016)\r\nthe Commission determined that it is also appropriate for a court to consider the seri-\r\nousness of the prior offenses (as reflected in the classification assigned by the convict-\r\ning jurisdiction) in deciding whether the significant increases under the career offender\r\nguideline are appropriate. Such consideration is consistent with the structure used by\r\nCongress in the context of the Armed Career Criminal Act. See 18 U.S.C. § 921(a)(20)\r\n(providing, for purposes of Chapter 44 of Title 18, that “crime punishable by imprison-\r\nment for a term exceeding one year” does not include a State offense classified as a\r\nmisdemeanor and punishable by two years or less). It is also consistent with the court’s\r\nobligation to account for the “nature and circumstances of the offense and the history\r\nand characteristics of the defendant.” See 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(1).","EffectiveDate":"Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is August 1, 2016."},{"Id":798,"Title":"Amendment 798","Text":"Section 1B1.13 is amended in the heading by striking “as a Result of\r\nMotion by Director of Bureau of Prisons” and inserting “Under 18 U.S.C.\r\n§ 3582(c)(1)(A)”.\r\nThe Commentary to §1B1.13 captioned “Application Notes” is amended in Note 1 by\r\nstriking the heading as follows: “Application of Subdivision (1)(A).—”; by striking\r\nNote 1(A) as follows:\r\n“(A) Extraordinary and Compelling Reasons.—Provided the defendant meets the\r\nrequirements of subdivision (2), extraordinary and compelling reasons exist\r\nunder any of the following circumstances:\r\n(i) The defendant is suffering from a terminal illness.\r\n(ii) The defendant is suffering from a permanent physical or medical con-\r\ndition, or is experiencing deteriorating physical or mental health be-\r\ncause of the aging process, that substantially diminishes the ability of\r\nthe defendant to provide self-care within the environment of a correc-\r\ntional facility and for which conventional treatment promises no sub-\r\nstantial improvement.\r\n(iii) The death or incapacitation of the defendant’s only family member ca-\r\npable of caring for the defendant’s minor child or minor children.\r\n(iv) As determined by the Director of the Bureau of Prisons, there exists in\r\nthe defendant’s case an extraordinary and compelling reason other\r\nthan, or in combination with, the reasons described in subdivisions (i),\r\n(ii), and (iii).”;\r\nby redesignating Notes 1(B) and 2 as Notes 3 and 5, respectively, and inserting before\r\nNote 3 (as so redesignated) the following new Notes 1 and 2:\r\n“1.

The Commission encourages the\r\nDirector of the Bureau of Prisons to file such a motion if the defendant meets\r\nany of the circumstances set forth in Application Note 1. The court is in a\r\nunique position to determine whether the circumstances warrant a reduction\r\n(and, if so, the amount of reduction), after considering the factors set forth\r\n18 U.S.C. § 3553(a) and the criteria set forth in this policy statement, such as\r\nthe defendant’s medical condition, the defendant’s family circumstances, and\r\nwhether the defendant is a danger to the safety of any other person or to the\r\ncommunity.\r\nThis policy statement shall not be construed to confer upon the defendant any\r\nright not otherwise recognized in law.”.\r\nThe Commentary to §1B1.13 captioned “Background” is amended by striking “This\r\npolicy statement implements 28 U.S.C. § 994(t).” and inserting the following:\r\n“The Commission is required by 28 U.S.C. § 994(a)(2) to develop general policy state-\r\nments regarding application of the guidelines or other aspects of sentencing that in the\r\nview of the Commission would further the purposes of sentencing (18 U.S.C.\r\n§ 3553(a)(2)), including, among other things, the appropriate use of the sentence mod-\r\nification provisions set forth in 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c). In doing so, the Commission is\r\nauthorized by 28 U.S.C. § 994(t) to ‘describe what should be considered extraordinary\r\nand compelling reasons for sentence reduction, including the criteria to be applied and\r\na list of specific examples.’ This policy statement implements 28 U.S.C. § 994(a)(2)\r\nand (t).”.","Reason":"REASON FOR AMENDMENT: This amendment is a result of the Commission’s review of\r\nthe policy statement pertaining to “compassionate release” at §1B1.13 (Reduction in\r\nTerm of Imprisonment as a Result of Motion by Director of Bureau of Prisons). The\r\namendment broadens certain eligibility criteria and encourages the Director of the Bu-\r\nreau of Prisons to file a motion for compassionate release when “extraordinary and\r\ncompelling reasons” exist.\r\nSection 3582(c)(1)(A) of title 18, United States Code, authorizes a federal court, upon\r\nmotion of the Director of the Bureau of Prisons, to reduce the term of imprisonment of\r\na defendant if “extraordinary and compelling reasons” warrant such a reduction or the\r\ndefendant is at least 70 years of age and meets certain other criteria. Such a reduction\r\nmust be consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Com-\r\nmission. See 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(1)(A); see also 28 U.S.C. §§ 992(a)(2) (stating that the\r\nCommission shall promulgate general policy statements regarding “the sentence mod-\r\nification provisions set forth in section[] . . . 3582(c) of title 18”); and 994(t) (stating\r\nthat the Commission, in promulgating any such policy statements, “shall describe\r\nwhat should be considered extraordinary and compelling reasons for sentence reduc-\r\ntion, including the criteria to be applied and a list of specific examples”). In turn, the\r\nCommission promulgated the policy statement at §1B1.13, which defines “extraordi-\r\nnary and compelling reasons” for compassionate release.\r\nThe Bureau of Prisons has developed its own criteria for the implementation of sec-\r\ntion 3582(c)(1)(A). See U.S. Department of Justice, Federal Bureau of Prisons, Com-\r\npassionate Release/Reduction in Sentence: Procedures for Implementation of 18 U.S.C.\r\n§§ 3582(c)(1)(A) and 4205(g) (Program Statement 5050.49, CN-1). Under its program\r\nAmendment 799\r\nstatement, a sentence reduction may be based on the defendant’s medical circum-\r\nstances (e.g., a terminal or debilitating medical condition; see 5050.49(3)(a)–(b)) or on\r\ncertain non-medical circumstances (e.g., an elderly defendant, the death or incapacita-\r\ntion of the family member caregiver of an inmate’s minor child, or the incapacitation\r\nof the defendant’s spouse or registered partner when the inmate would be the only\r\navailable caregiver; see 5050.49(4),(5),(6)).\r\nThe Commission has conducted an in-depth review of this topic, including considera-\r\ntion of Bureau of Prisons data documenting lengthy review of compassionate release\r\napplications and low approval rates, as well as two reports issued by the Department\r\nof Justice Office of the Inspector General that are critical of the Bureau of Prisons’\r\nimplementation of its compassionate release program. See U.S. Department of Justice,\r\nOffice of the Inspector General, The Federal Bureau of Prisons’ Compassionate Release\r\nProgram, I-2013-006 (April 2013); U.S. Department of Justice, Office of the Inspector\r\nGeneral, The Impact of the Aging Inmate Population on the Federal Bureau of Prisons,\r\nE-15-05 (May 2015). In February 2016, the Commission held a public hearing on com-\r\npassionate release and received testimony from witnesses and experts about the need\r\nto broaden the criteria for eligibility, to add guidance to the medical criteria, and to\r\nremove other administrative hurdles that limit the availability of compassionate re-\r\nlease for otherwise eligible defendants.\r\nThe amendment revises §1B1.13 in several ways. First, the amendment broadens the\r\nCommission’s guidance on what should be considered “extraordinary and compelling\r\nreasons” for compassionate release. It provides four categories of criteria: “Medical\r\nCondition of the Defendant,” “Age of the Defendant,” “Family Circumstances,” and\r\n“Other Reasons.”\r\nThe “Medical Condition of the Defendant” category has two prongs: one for defendants\r\nwith terminal illness, and one that applies to defendants with a debilitating condition.\r\nFor the first subcategory, the amendment clarifies that terminal illness means “a se-\r\nrious and advanced illness with an end of life trajectory,” and it explicitly states that\r\na “specific prognosis of life expectancy (i.e. a probability of death within a specific time\r\nperiod) is not required.” These changes respond to testimony and public comment on\r\nthe challenges associated with diagnosing terminal illness. In particular, while an end-\r\nof-life trajectory may be determined by medical professionals with some certainty, it is\r\nextremely difficult to determine death within a specific time period. For that reason,\r\nthe Commission concluded that requiring a specified prognosis (such as the 18-month\r\nprognosis in the Bureau of Prisons’ program statement) is unnecessarily restrictive\r\nboth in terms of the administrative review and the scope of eligibility for compassion-\r\nate release applications. For added clarity, the amendment also provides a non-exhaus-\r\ntive list of illnesses that may qualify as a terminal illness.\r\nFor the non-terminal medical category, the amendment provides three broad criteria\r\nto include defendants who are (i) suffering from a serious condition, (ii) suffering from\r\na serious functional or cognitive impairment, or (iii) experiencing deteriorating health\r\nbecause of the aging process, for whom the medical condition substantially diminishes\r\nthe defendant’s ability to provide self-care within a correctional facility and from which\r\nhe or she is not expected to recover. The primary change to this category is the addition\r\nof prong (II) regarding a serious functional or cognitive impairment. This additional\r\nprong is intended to include a wide variety of permanent, serious impairments and\r\ndisabilities, whether functional or cognitive, that make life in prison overly difficult for\r\ncertain inmates.\r\nAmendment 799\r\n136 ║ Supplement to Appendix C (November 1, 2016)\r\nThe amendment also adds an age-based category (“Age of the Defendant”) for eligibility\r\nin §1B1.13. This new category would apply if the defendant (i) is at least 65 years old,\r\n(ii) is experiencing a serious deterioration in health because of the aging process, and\r\n(iii) has served at least 10 years or 75 percent of his or her term of imprisonment\r\n(whichever is less). The age-based category resembles criteria in the Bureau of Prisons’\r\nprogram statement, but adds a limitation that the defendant must be experiencing\r\nseriously deteriorating health because of the aging process. The amendment also clar-\r\nifies that the time-served aspect should be applied with regard to “whichever is less,”\r\nan important distinction from the Bureau of Prisons’ criteria, which has limited appli-\r\ncation to only those elderly offenders serving significant terms of imprisonment. The\r\nCommission determined that 65 years should be the age for eligibility under the age-\r\nbased category after considering the Commission’s recidivism research, which finds\r\nthat inmates aged 65 years and older exhibit a very low rate of recidivism (13.3%) as\r\ncompared to other age groups. The Commission expects that the broadening of the\r\nmedical conditions categories, cited above, will lead to increased eligibility for inmates\r\nwho suffer from certain conditions or impairments, and who experience a diminished\r\nability to provide self-care in prison, regardless of their age.\r\nThe amendment also includes a “Family Circumstances” category for eligibility that\r\napplies to (i) the death or incapacitation of the caregiver of the defendant’s minor child,\r\nor (ii) the incapacitation of the defendant’s spouse or registered partner when the de-\r\nfendant would be the only available caregiver. The amendment deletes the require-\r\nment under prong (i) regarding the death or incapacitation of the “defendant’s only\r\nfamily member” caregiver, given the possibility that the existing caregiver may not be\r\nof family relation. The Commission also added prong (ii), which makes this category of\r\ncriteria consistent with similar considerations in the Bureau of Prisons’ program state-\r\nment.\r\nSecond, the amendment updates the Commentary in §1B1.13 to provide that an ex-\r\ntraordinary and compelling reason need not have been unforeseen at the time of sen-\r\ntencing in order to warrant a reduction. The Commission heard from stakeholders and\r\nmedical experts that the corresponding limitation in the Bureau of Prisons’ program\r\nstatement ignores the often precipitous decline in health or circumstances that can\r\noccur after imprisonment. The Commission determined that potential foreseeability at\r\nthe time of sentencing should not automatically preclude the defendant’s eligibility for\r\nearly release under §1B1.13.\r\nFinally, the amendment adds a new application note that encourages the Director of\r\nthe Bureau of Prisons to file a motion under 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(1)(A) if the defendant\r\nmeets any of the circumstances listed as “extraordinary and compelling reasons” in\r\n§1B1.13. The Commission heard testimony and received public comment concerning\r\nthe inefficiencies that exist within the Bureau of Prisons’ administrative review of com-\r\npassionate release applications, which can delay or deny release, even in cases where\r\nthe applicant appears to meet the criteria for eligibility. While only the Director of the\r\nBureau of Prisons has the statutory authority to file a motion for compassionate re-\r\nlease, the Commission finds that “the court is in a unique position to assess whether\r\nthe circumstances exist, and whether a reduction is warranted (and, if so, the amount\r\nof reduction), including the factors set forth 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a) and the criteria set\r\nforth in this policy statement, such as the defendant’s medical condition, the defend-\r\nant’s family circumstances, and whether the defendant is a danger to the safety of any\r\nother person or to the community.” The Commission’s policy statement is not legally\r\nbinding on the Bureau of Prisons and does not confer any rights on the defendant, but\r\nthe new commentary is intended to encourage the Director of the Bureau of Prisons to\r\nAmendment 800\r\nexercise his or her authority to file a motion under section 3582(c)(1)(A) when the cri-\r\nteria in this policy statement are met.\r\nThe amendment also adds to the Background that the Commission’s general policy-\r\nmaking authority at 28 U.S.C. § 994(a)(2) serves as an additional basis for this and\r\nother guidance set forth in §1B1.13, and the amendment changes the title of the policy\r\nstatement. These changes are clerical.","EffectiveDate":"Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2016."},{"Id":799,"Title":"Amendment 799","Text":"Section 2E3.1 is amended in subsection (a) by striking subsection (a)(2)\r\nas follows:\r\n“(2) 10, if the offense involved an animal fighting venture; or”;\r\nby redesignating subsections (a)(1) and (a)(3) as subsections (a)(2) and (a)(4), respec-\r\ntively; in subsection (a)(2) (as so redesignated) by striking “operation; or” and inserting\r\n“operation;”; by inserting before subsection (a)(2) (as so redesignated) the following\r\nnew subsection (a)(1):\r\n“(1) 16, if the offense involved an animal fighting venture, except as provided in\r\nsubdivision (3) below;”;\r\nand by inserting before subsection (a)(4) (as so redesignated) the following new subsec-\r\ntion (a)(3):\r\n“(3) 10, if the defendant was convicted under 7 U.S.C. § 2156(a)(2)(B); or”.\r\nThe Commentary to §2E3.1 captioned “Statutory Provisions” is amended by inserting\r\nafter “7 U.S.C. § 2156” the following: “(felony provisions only)”.\r\nThe Commentary to §2E3.1 captioned “Application Notes” is amended in Note 1 by\r\nstriking “: ‘Animal” and inserting “, ‘animal”;\r\nand in Note 2 by striking “If the offense involved extraordinary cruelty to an animal\r\nthat resulted in, for example, maiming or death to an animal, an upward departure\r\nmay be warranted.”, and inserting the following:\r\n“The base offense levels provided for animal fighting ventures in subsection (a)(1)\r\nand (a)(3) reflect that an animal fighting venture involves one or more violent fights\r\nbetween animals and that a defeated animal often is severely injured in the fight, dies\r\nas a result of the fight, or is killed afterward. Nonetheless, there may be cases in which\r\nthe offense level determined under this guideline substantially understates the seri-\r\nousness of the offense. In such a case, an upward departure may be warranted. For\r\nexample, an upward departure may be warranted if (A) the offense involved extraor-\r\ndinary cruelty to an animal beyond the violence inherent in such a venture (such as by\r\nkilling an animal in a way that prolongs the suffering of the animal); or (B) the offense\r\ninvolved animal fighting on an exceptional scale (such as an offense involving an unu-\r\nsually large number of animals).”.\r\nAmendment 800\r\n138 ║ Supplement to Appendix C (November 1, 2016)\r\nAppendix A (Statutory Index) is amended in the line referenced to 7 U.S.C. § 2156 by\r\ninserting after “§ 2156” the following: “(felony provisions only)”.","Reason":"REASON FOR AMENDMENT: This amendment responds to two legislative changes to the\r\nAnimal Welfare Act (the “Act”) (codified at 7 U.S.C. § 2156) made by Congress in 2008\r\nand 2014. First, in 2008, Congress amended the Act to increase the maximum term of\r\nimprisonment for offenses involving an animal fighting venture from three years to\r\nfive years. See Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008, Pub. L. No. 110–234,\r\n§ 14207(b), 122 Stat. 1461, 1462 (May 22, 2008). Second, in 2014, Congress again\r\namended the Act to create two new offenses – the offense of attending an animal fight\r\nand the offense of causing an individual under the age of 16 to attend an animal fight,\r\nwith respective statutory maximum terms of imprisonment of one and three years.\r\nSee Agricultural Act of 2014, Pub. L. 113–79, § 12308, 128 Stat. 990, 990 (Feb. 7, 2014).\r\nThe amendment makes several changes to §2E3.1 (Gambling Offenses, Animal\r\nFighting Offenses) to account for these legislative actions. The amendment is informed\r\nby extensive public comment, recent case law, and analysis of Commission data re-\r\ngarding the current penalties for animal fighting offenses.\r\nHigher Penalties for Animal Fighting Venture Offenses\r\nFirst, the amendment increases the base offense level for offenses involving an animal\r\nfighting venture from 10 to 16. This change reflects the increase in the statutory max-\r\nimum penalty from three to five years for offenses prohibited under 7 U.S.C.\r\n§ 2156(a)–(e). See 18 U.S.C. § 49 (containing the criminal penalties for violations of\r\nsection 2156). The Commission also determined that the increased base offense level\r\nbetter accounts for the cruelty and violence that is characteristic of these crimes, as\r\nreflected in the extensive public comment and testimony noting that a defeated animal\r\nis often severely injured or killed during or after a fight and that the animals used in\r\nthese crimes are commonly exposed to inhumane living conditions or other forms of\r\nneglect.\r\nIn making this change, the Commission was also informed by data evidencing a high\r\npercentage of above range sentences in these cases. During fiscal years 2011 through\r\n2014, almost one-third (31.0%) of the seventy-four offenders who received the base of-\r\nfense level of 10 under §2E3.1 received an above range sentence, compared to a na-\r\ntional above range rate of 2.0 percent for all offenders. For those animal fighting of-\r\nfenders sentenced above the range, the average extent of the upward departure was\r\nmore than twice the length of imprisonment at the high end of the guideline range,\r\nresulting in an average sentence of 18 months (and a median sentence of 16 months).\r\nComparably, the amended base offense level will result in a guideline range of 12 to\r\n18 months for the typical animal fighting venture offender who is in Criminal History\r\nCategory I and receives a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility under\r\n§3E1.1 (Acceptance of Responsibility). Additionally, for offenders in the higher crimi-\r\nnal history categories, the guideline range at base offense level 16 allows for applicable\r\nChapter Three increases while remaining within the statutory maximum.\r\nNew Offenses Relating to Attending an Animal Fighting Venture\r\nThe amendment also establishes a base offense level of 10 in §2E3.1 if the defendant\r\nwas convicted under section 2156(a)(2)(B) for causing an individual under 16 to attend\r\nan animal fighting venture. The Commission believes this level of punishment best\r\nreflects Congress’s intent in creating this new crime. A base offense level of 10 for this\r\nnew offense will result in a guideline range (before acceptance of responsibility) of 6 to\r\nAmendment 801\r\n12 months of imprisonment for offenders in Criminal History Category I, while allow-\r\ning for a guideline range approaching the three-year statutory maximum for offenders\r\nin higher criminal history categories. The Commission also noted that assigning a base\r\noffense level of 10 is consistent with the policy decision made by the Commission when\r\nit assigned a base offense level of 10 to an animal fighting crime in 2008, which, at that\r\ntime, also had a three-year statutory maximum penalty. See USSG App. C, amend. 721\r\n(effective November 1, 2008).\r\nLastly, the amendment establishes a base offense level of 6 for the new class A misde-\r\nmeanor of attending an animal fighting venture prohibited by section 2156(a)(2)(A) by\r\nincluding only the felony provisions of 7 U.S.C. §2156 in the Appendix A reference to\r\n§2E3.1. Consistent with other Class A misdemeanor offenses, this base offense level is\r\nestablished through application of §2X5.2 (Class A Misdemeanors (Not Covered by An-\r\nother Specific Offense Guideline)).\r\nDeparture Provision\r\nThe amendment also revises and expands the existing upward departure language in\r\ntwo ways.\r\nFirst, the amendment clarifies the circumstances in which an upward departure for\r\nexceptional cruelty may be warranted. As reflected in the revised departure provision,\r\nthe base offense levels provided for animal fighting ventures in subsections (a)(1)\r\nand (a)(3) reflect the fact that an animal fighting venture involves one or more violent\r\nfights between animals and that a defeated animal often is severely injured in the\r\nfight, dies as a result of the fight, or is killed afterward. The Commission heard testi-\r\nmony that in a typical dog fight, dogs puncture and tear at each other, until one animal\r\nis too injured to continue, and during a cock fight, roosters strike each other with their\r\nbeaks and with sharp blades that have been strapped to their legs, suffering punctured\r\nlungs, broken bones, and pierced eyes. Nonetheless, as informed by public comment\r\nand testimony, the Commission’s study indicates that some animal fighting offenses\r\ninvolve extraordinary cruelty to an animal beyond that which is common to such\r\ncrimes, such as killing an animal in a way that prolongs the suffering of the animal.\r\nThe Commission determined that such extraordinary cruelty may fall outside the\r\nheartland of conduct encompassed by the base offense level for animal fighting ven-\r\ntures and, therefore, that an upward departure may be warranted in those cases.\r\nSimilarly, the amendment expands the existing departure provision to include offenses\r\ninvolving animal fighting on an exceptional scale (such as offenses involving an unu-\r\nsually large number of animals) as another example of conduct that may warrant an\r\nupward departure. As with the example of extraordinary cruelty, the Commission de-\r\ntermined that the base offense level under the revised guideline may understate the\r\nseriousness of the offense in those cases.","EffectiveDate":"Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2016."},{"Id":800,"Title":"Amendment 800","Text":"Section 2G2.1 is amended in subsection (b)(3) by striking “If the offense\r\ninvolved distribution” and inserting “If the defendant knowingly engaged in distribu-\r\ntion”;\r\nAmendment 801\r\n140 ║ Supplement to Appendix C (November 1, 2016)\r\nand in subsection (b)(4) by inserting “(A)” before “sadistic or masochistic”, and by in-\r\nserting after “violence” the following: “; or (B) an infant or toddler”.\r\nThe Commentary to §2G2.1 captioned “Statutory Provisions” is amended by inserting\r\nat the end the following: “For additional statutory provision(s), see Appendix A (Stat-\r\nutory Index).”.\r\nThe Commentary to §2G2.1 captioned “Application Notes” is amended by redesignat-\r\ning Notes 3, 4, 5, and 6 as Notes 5, 6, 7, and 8, respectively, and by inserting after\r\nNote 2 the following new Notes 3 and 4:\r\n“3.

One issue generally arises under\r\nboth the child pornography production guideline and the child pornography distribu-\r\ntion guideline when the offense involves victims who are unusually young and vulner-\r\nable. The other two issues frequently arise when the offense involves a peer-to-peer\r\nfile-sharing program or network. These issues were noted by the Commission in\r\nits 2012 report to Congress on child pornography offenses. See United States Sentenc-\r\ning Commission, “Report to the Congress: Federal Child Pornography Offenses,”\r\nat 33–35 (2012).\r\nOffenses Involving Infants and Toddlers\r\nFirst, the amendment addresses differences among the circuits when cases involve in-\r\nfant and toddler victims. The production guideline at §2G2.1 (Sexually Exploiting a\r\nMinor by Production of Sexually Explicit Visual or Printed Material; Custodian Per-\r\nmitting Minor to Engage in Sexually Explicit Conduct; Advertisement for Minors to\r\nEngage in Production) provides a 4-level enhancement if the offense involved a minor\r\nwho had not attained the age of 12 years and a 2-level enhancement if the minor had\r\nnot attained the age of 16 years. See §2G2.1(b)(1)(A)–(B). The non-production guideline\r\nat §2G2.2 (Trafficking in Material Involving the Sexual Exploitation of a Minor; Re-\r\nceiving, Transporting, Shipping, Soliciting, or Advertising Material Involving the Sex-\r\nual Exploitation of a Minor; Possessing Material Involving the Sexual Exploitation of\r\na minor with Intent to Traffic; Possessing Material Involving the Sexual Exploitation\r\nof a Minor) provides a 2-level enhancement if the material involved a prepubescent\r\nminor or a minor who had not attained the age of 12 years. See §2G2.2(b)(2).\r\nA circuit conflict has arisen as to whether a defendant who receives an age enhance-\r\nment under §§2G2.1 and 2G2.2 may also receive a vulnerable victim adjustment at\r\n§3A1.1 (Hate Crime Motivation or Vulnerable Victim) when the victim is extremely\r\nyoung and vulnerable, such as an infant or toddler. Section 3A1.1(b)(1) provides for a\r\n2-level increase if the defendant knew or should have known that a victim was a “vul-\r\nnerable victim,” which is defined in the accompanying commentary as a victim “who is\r\nunusually vulnerable due to age, physical or mental condition, or who is otherwise\r\nparticularly susceptible to the criminal conduct.” See §3A1.1, comment. (n.2). The com-\r\nmentary also provides that the vulnerable victim adjustment does not apply if the fac-\r\ntor that makes the victim a “vulnerable victim,” such as age, is incorporated in the\r\noffense guidelines, “unless the victim was unusually vulnerable for reasons unrelated\r\nto age.” Id.\r\nThe Fifth and Ninth Circuits have held that it is permissible to apply both enhance-\r\nments in cases involving infant or toddler victims because their level of vulnerability\r\nis not fully incorporated in the offense guidelines. See United States v. Jenkins,\r\n712 F.3d 209, 214 (5th Cir. 2013); United States v. Wright, 373 F.3d 935, 943 (9th Cir.\r\n2004). These circuits have reasoned that although the victim’s small physical size and\r\nextreme vulnerability tend to correlate with age, such characteristics are not the same\r\nAmendment 801\r\nas compared to most children under 12 years. Jenkins, 712 F.3d at 214; Wright,\r\n373 F.3d at 942–43. The Fourth Circuit, by contrast, has held that the age enhance-\r\nment and vulnerable victim adjustment may not be simultaneously applied because\r\nthe child pornography guidelines fully address age-related factors. See United States\r\nv. Dowell, 771 F.3d 162, 175 (4th Cir. 2014). The Fourth Circuit reasoned that cognitive\r\ndevelopment or psychological susceptibility necessarily is related to age. Id.\r\nThe amendment resolves the circuit conflict by explicitly accounting for infant and tod-\r\ndler victims in the child pornography guidelines. Specifically, the amendment revises\r\n§§2G2.1 and 2G2.2 by adding a new basis for application of the “sadistic or masochistic”\r\nenhancement when the offense involves infants or toddlers. The amendment amends\r\n§2G2.1(b)(4) to provide for a 4-level increase “if the offense involved material that por-\r\ntrays (A) sadistic or masochistic conduct or other depictions of violence; or (B) an infant\r\nor toddler,” and amends §2G2.2(b)(4) to provide a 4-level increase “if the offense in-\r\nvolved material that portrays (A) sadistic or masochistic conduct or other depictions of\r\nviolence; or (B) sexual abuse or exploitation of an infant or toddler.” The accompanying\r\napplication note to each guideline provides that if subsection (b)(4)(B) applies, do not\r\napply the vulnerable victim adjustment in Chapter Three.\r\nThe amendment reflects the Commission’s view, based on testimony and public com-\r\nment, that child pornography offenses involving infants and toddlers warrant an en-\r\nhancement. Because application of the vulnerable victim adjustment necessarily relies\r\non a fact-specific inquiry, the Commission determined that expanding the “sadistic or\r\nmasochistic” enhancement (§§2G2.1(b)(4) and 2G2.2(b)(4)) to include infant and tod-\r\ndler victims would promote more consistent application of the child pornography guide-\r\nlines and reduce unwarranted sentencing disparities. In making its determination, the\r\nCommission was informed by case law indicating that most circuits have found depic-\r\ntions of the sexual abuse or exploitation of infants or toddlers involving penetration or\r\npain portray sadistic conduct. See, e.g., United States v. Hoey, 508 F.3d 687, 691\r\n(1st Cir. 2007) (“We agree with the many circuits which have found that images de-\r\npicting the sexual penetration of young and prepubescent children by adult males rep-\r\nresent conduct sufficiently likely to involve pain such as to support a finding that it is\r\ninherently ‘sadistic’ or similarly ‘violent’ . . . .”); United States v. Delmarle, 99 F.3d 80,\r\n83 (2d Cir. 1996) (“[S]ubjection of a young child to a sexual act that would have to be\r\npainful is excessively cruel and hence is sadistic . . . .”); United States v. Maurer,\r\n639 F.3d 72, 79 (3d Cir. 2011) (“[W]e join other circuits in holding that the application\r\nof §2G2.2(b)(4) is appropriate where an image depicts sexual activity involving a pre-\r\npubescent minor that would have caused pain to the minor.”); United States v. Bur-\r\ngess, 684 F.3d 445, 454 (4th Cir. 2012) (image depicting vaginal penetration of five-\r\nyear-old girl by adult male, which would “necessarily cause physical pain to the vic-\r\ntim,” qualified for sentencing enhancement under §2G2.2(b)); United States v. Lyck-\r\nman, 235 F.3d 234, 238–39 (5th Cir. 2000) (agreeing with the Second, Seventh, and\r\nEleventh Circuits that application of subsection (b)(4) is warranted when the image\r\ndepicts “the physical penetration of a young child by an adult male.”); United States v.\r\nGroenendal, 557 F.3d 419, 424–26 (6th Cir. 2009) (penetration of a prepubescent child\r\nby an adult male constitutes inherently sadistic conduct that justifies application of\r\n§2G2.2(b)(4)); United States v. Meyers, 355 F.3d 1040, 1043 (7th Cir. 2004) (finding\r\nvaginal intercourse between a prepubescent girl and an adult male sadistic); United\r\nStates v. Belflower, 390 F.3d 560, 562 (8th Cir. 2004) (images involving the anal pen-\r\netration of minor boy or girl adult male are per se sadistic or violent within the mean-\r\ning of subsection (b)(4)); United States v. Henderson, 649 F.3d 995 (9th Cir. 2010) (vag-\r\ninal penetration of prepubescent minor qualifies for (b)(4) enhancement); United\r\nStates v. Kimler, 335 F.3d 1132, 1143 (10th Cir. 2003) (finding no expert testimony\r\nnecessary for a sentence enhancement [(b)(4)] when the images depicted penetration\r\nAmendment 801\r\n144 ║ Supplement to Appendix C (November 1, 2016)\r\nof prepubescent children by adults); United States v. Bender, 290 F.3d 1279, 1286\r\n(11th Cir. 2002) (photograph was sadistic within the meaning of subsection (b)(4) when\r\nit depicts the “subjugation of a young child to a sexual act that would have to be pain-\r\nful”). The Commission intends the new enhancement to apply to any sexual images of\r\nan infant or toddler.\r\nThe Two and Five Level Distribution Enhancements\r\nNext, the amendment addresses differences among the circuits involving application\r\nof the tiered distribution enhancements in §2G2.2. Section 2G2.2(b)(3) provides for an\r\nincrease for distribution of child pornographic material ranging from 2 to 7 levels de-\r\npending on certain factors. See §2G2.2(b)(3)(A)–(F). The circuits have reached different\r\nconclusions regarding the mental state required for application of the 2-level enhance-\r\nment for “generic” distribution as compared to the 5-level enhancement for distribution\r\nnot for pecuniary gain. The circuit conflicts involving these two enhancements have\r\narisen frequently, although not exclusively, in cases involving the use of peer-to-peer\r\nfile-sharing programs or networks.\r\nPeer-to-Peer File-Sharing Programs\r\nThe Commission’s 2012 report to Congress discussed the use of file-sharing programs,\r\nsuch as Peer-to-Peer (“P2P”), in the context of cases involving distribution of child por-\r\nnography. See 2012 Report at 33–35, 48–62. Specifically, P2P is a software application\r\nthat enables computer users to share files easily over the Internet. These applications\r\ndo not require a central server or use of email. Rather, the file-sharing application\r\nallows two or more users to essentially have access each other’s computers and to di-\r\nrectly swap files from their computers. Some file-sharing programs require a user to\r\ndesignate files to be shared during the installation process, meaning that at the time\r\nof installation the user can “opt in” to share files, and the software will automatically\r\nscan the user’s computer and then compile a list of files to share. Other programs em-\r\nploy a default file-sharing setting, meaning the user can “opt out” of automatically\r\nsharing files by changing the default setting to limit which, if any, files are available\r\nfor sharing. Once the user has downloaded and set up the file-sharing software, the\r\nuser can begin searching for files shared on the connected network using search key-\r\nwords in the same way one regularly uses a search engine such as Google. Users may\r\nchoose to “opt in” for a variety of reasons, including, for example, to obtain faster down-\r\nload speeds, to have access to a greater range of material, or because the particular\r\nsite mandates sharing.\r\nThe 2-Level Distribution Enhancement\r\nThe circuits have reached different conclusions regarding whether application of the\r\n2-level distribution enhancement at §2G2.2(b)(3)(F) requires a mental state (mens\r\nrea), particularly in cases involving use of a file-sharing program or network. The Fifth,\r\nTenth, and Eleventh Circuits have held that the 2-level distribution enhancement ap-\r\nplies if the defendant used a file-sharing program, regardless of whether the defendant\r\ndid so purposefully, knowingly, or negligently. See, e.g., United States v. Baker,\r\n742 F.3d 618, 621 (5th Cir. 2014); United States v. Ray, 704 F.3d 1307, 1312 (10th Cir.\r\n2013); United States v. Creel, 783 F.3d 1357, 1360 (11th Cir. 2015). The Second,\r\nFourth, and Seventh Circuits have held that the 2-level distribution enhancement re-\r\nquires a showing that the defendant knew of the file-sharing properties of the program.\r\nSee, e.g., United States v. Baldwin, 743 F.3d 357, 361 (2d Cir. 2015) (requiring\r\nknowledge); United States v. Robinson, 714 F.3d 466, 468 (7th Cir. 2013) (knowledge);\r\nAmendment 801\r\nUnited States v. Layton, 564 F.3d 330, 335 (4th Cir. 2009) (knowledge or reckless dis-\r\nregard). The Eighth Circuit has held that knowledge is required, but knowledge may\r\nbe inferred from the fact that a file-sharing program was used, absent “concrete evi-\r\ndence” of ignorance. See United States v. Dodd, 598 F.3d 449, 452 (8th Cir. 2010). The\r\nSixth Circuit has held that there is a “presumption” that “users of file-sharing software\r\nunderstand others can access their files.” United States v. Conner, 521 Fed. App’x 493,\r\n499 (6th Cir. 2013); see also United States v. Abbring, 788 F.3d 565, 567 (6th Cir. 2015)\r\n(“the whole point of a file-sharing program is to share, sharing creates a transfer, and\r\ntransferring equals distribution”).\r\nThe amendment generally adopts the approach of the Second, Fourth, and Seventh\r\nCircuits. It amends §2G2.2(b)(3)(F) to provide that the 2-level distribution enhance-\r\nment applies if “the defendant knowingly engaged in distribution.” Based on testi-\r\nmony, public comment, and data analysis, the Commission determined that the 2-level\r\ndistribution enhancement is appropriate only in cases in which the defendant know-\r\ningly engaged in distribution. An accompanying application note clarifies that: “For\r\npurposes of subsection (b)(3)(F), the defendant ‘knowingly engaged in distribution’ if\r\nthe defendant (A) knowingly committed the distribution, (B) aided, abetted, counseled,\r\ncommanded, induced, procured, or willfully caused the distribution, or (C) conspired to\r\ndistribute.” Similar changes are made to the 2-level distribution enhancement at\r\n§2G2.1(b)(3) and the obscenity guideline, §2G3.1 (Importing, Mailing, or Transporting\r\nObscene Matter; Transferring Obscene Matter to a Minor; Misleading Domain Names),\r\nwhich contains a similarly tiered distribution enhancement.\r\nThe 5-Level Distribution Enhancement\r\nFinally, the amendment responds to differences among the circuits in applying the 5-\r\nlevel enhancement for distribution not for pecuniary gain at §2G2.2(b)(3)(B). While\r\ncourts generally agree that mere use of a file-sharing program or network, without\r\nmore, is insufficient for application of the 5-level distribution enhancement, the cir-\r\ncuits have taken distinct approaches with respect to the circumstances under which\r\nthe 5-level rather than the 2-level enhancement is appropriate in such circumstances.\r\nThe Fourth Circuit has held that the 5-level distribution enhancement applies when\r\nthe defendant (1) “knowingly made child pornography in his possession available to\r\nothers by some means”; and (2) did so “for the specific purpose of obtaining something\r\nof valuable consideration, such as more pornography.” United States v. McManus,\r\n734 F.3d 315, 319 (4th Cir. 2013). In contrast, while holding that the 5-level enhance-\r\nment applies when the defendant knew he was distributing child pornographic mate-\r\nrial in exchange for a thing of value, the Fifth Circuit has indicated that when the\r\ndefendant knowingly uses file-sharing software, the requirements for the 5-level en-\r\nhancement are generally satisfied. See United States v. Groce, 784 F.3d 291, 294\r\n(5th Cir. 2015).\r\nThe amendment revises §2G2.2(b)(3)(B) and commentary to clarify that the 5-level en-\r\nhancement applies “if the defendant distributed in exchange for any valuable consid-\r\neration.” The amendment further explains in the accompanying application note that\r\nthis means “the defendant agreed to an exchange with another person under which the\r\ndefendant knowingly distributed to that other person for the specific purpose of obtain-\r\ning something of valuable consideration from that other person, such as other child\r\npornographic material, preferential access to child pornographic material, or access to\r\na child.” The amendment makes parallel changes to the obscenity guideline at §2G3.1,\r\nwhich has a similar tiered distribution enhancement.\r\nAmendment 802\r\n146 ║ Supplement to Appendix C (November 1, 2016)\r\nAs with the 2-level distribution enhancement, the amendment resolves differences\r\namong the circuits in applying the 5-level distribution enhancement by clarifying the\r\nmental state required for distribution of child pornographic material for non-pecuniary\r\ngain, particularly when the case involves a file-sharing program or network. The Com-\r\nmission determined that the amendment is an appropriate way to account for the\r\nhigher level of culpability when the defendant had the specific purpose of distributing\r\nchild pornographic material to another person in exchange for valuable consideration.","EffectiveDate":"Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2016."},{"Id":801,"Title":"Amendment 801","Text":"Section 5B1.3 is amended in the heading by striking “Conditions—” and\r\ninserting “Conditions”;\r\nin subsections (a)(1) through (a)(8) by striking the initial letter of the first word in each\r\nsubsection and inserting the appropriate capital letter for the word, and by striking\r\nthe semicolon at the end of each subsection and inserting a period;\r\nin subsection (a)(6), as so amended, by inserting before the period at the end the fol-\r\nlowing: “.

Application of Subsection (a)(7)(A) and (B).—Some jurisdictions continue to\r\nregister sex offenders pursuant to the sex offender registry in place prior to\r\nJuly 27, 2006, the date of enactment of the Adam Walsh Act, which contained\r\nthe Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act. In such a jurisdiction, sub-\r\nsection (a)(7)(A) will apply. In a jurisdiction that has implemented the require-\r\nments of the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act, subsec-\r\ntion (a)(7)(B) will apply. (See 42 U.S.C. §§ 16911 and 16913.)”,\r\nand inserting the following:\r\n“1. Application of Subsection (c)(4).—Although the condition in subsection (c)(4)\r\nrequires the defendant to ‘answer truthfully’ the questions asked by the pro-\r\nbation officer, a defendant’s legitimate invocation of the Fifth Amendment\r\nprivilege against self-incrimination in response to a probation officer’s question\r\nshall not be considered a violation of this condition.”.","Reason":"REASON FOR AMENDMENT: This amendment is a result of the Commission’s multi-year\r\nreview of sentencing practices relating to federal probation and supervised release.\r\nAmendment 803\r\nThe amendment makes several changes to the guidelines and policy statements re-\r\nlated to conditions of probation, §5B1.3 (Conditions of Probation), and supervised re-\r\nlease, §5D1.3 (Conditions of Supervised Release).\r\nWhen imposing a sentence of probation or a sentence of imprisonment that includes a\r\nperiod of supervised release, the court is required to impose certain conditions of su-\r\npervision listed by statute. 18 U.S.C. §§ 3563(a) and 3583(d). Congress has also em-\r\npowered courts to impose additional conditions of probation and supervised release\r\nthat are reasonably related to statutory sentencing factors contained in 18 U.S.C.\r\n§ 3553(a), so long as those conditions “involve only such deprivations of liberty or prop-\r\nerty as are reasonably necessary for the purposes indicated in 3553(a)(2).” 18 U.S.C.\r\n§ 3563(b); see also 18 U.S.C. § 3583(d). Additional conditions of supervised release\r\nmust also be consistent with any pertinent policy statements issued by the Commis-\r\nsion. See 18 U.S.C. § 3583(d)(3).\r\nThe Commission is directed by its organic statute to promulgate policy statements on\r\nthe appropriate use of the conditions of probation and supervised release, see 28 U.S.C.\r\n§ 994(a)(2)(B), and has implemented this directive in §§5B1.3 and 5D1.3. The provi-\r\nsions follow a parallel structure, first setting forth those conditions of supervision that\r\nare required by statute in their respective subsections (a) and (b), and then providing\r\nguidance on discretionary conditions, which are categorized as “standard” conditions,\r\n“special” conditions, and “additional” special conditions, in subsections (c), (d), and (e),\r\nrespectively.\r\nIn a number of cases, defendants have raised objections (with varied degrees of suc-\r\ncess) to the conditions of supervised release and probation imposed upon them at the\r\ntime of sentencing. See, e.g., United States v. Munoz, 812 F.3d 809 (10th Cir. 2016);\r\nUnited States v. Kappes, 782 F.3d 828, 848 (7th Cir. 2015); United States v. Siegel,\r\n753 F.3d 705 (7th Cir. 2014); United States v. Bahr, 730 F.3d 963 (9th Cir. 2013);\r\nUnited States v. Maloney, 513 F.3d 350, 357–59 (3d Cir. 2008); United States v.\r\nSaechao, 418 F.3d 1073, 1081 (9th Cir. 2005). Challenges have been made on the basis\r\nthat certain conditions are vaguely worded, pose constitutional concerns, or have been\r\ncategorized as “standard” conditions in a manner that has led to their improper impo-\r\nsition upon particular offenders.\r\nThe amendment responds to many of the concerns raised in these challenges by revis-\r\ning, clarifying, and rearranging the conditions contained in §§5B1.3 and 5D1.3 in order\r\nto make them easier for defendants to understand and probation officers to enforce.\r\nMany of the challenged conditions are those laid out in the Judgment in a Criminal\r\nCase Form, AO245B, which are nearly identical to the conditions in §§5B1.3 and 5D1.3.\r\nThe amendment was supported by the Criminal Law Committee (CLC) of the Judicial\r\nConference of the United States. The CLC has long taken an active and ongoing role\r\nin developing, monitoring and recommending revisions to the condition of supervision,\r\nwhich represent the core supervision practices required by the federal supervision\r\nmodel. The changes in the amendment are consistent with proposed changes to the\r\nnational judgment form recently endorsed by the CLC and Administrative Office of the\r\nU.S. Courts, after an exhaustive review of those conditions aided by probation officers\r\nfrom throughout the country.\r\nAs part of this broader revision, the conditions in §§5B1.3 and 5D1.3 have been renum-\r\nbered. Where the specific conditions discussed below are identified by a guidelines pro-\r\nvision reference, that numeration is in reference to their pre-amendment order.\r\nAmendment 803\r\n170 ║ Supplement to Appendix C (November 1, 2016)\r\nCourt-Established Payment Schedules\r\nFirst, the amendment amends §§5B1.3(a)(6) and 5D1.3(a)(6) to set forth as a “manda-\r\ntory” condition that if there is a court-established payment schedule for making resti-\r\ntution or paying a special assessment, the defendant shall adhere to the schedule. Pre-\r\nviously, those conditions were classified as “standard.” As a conforming change, similar\r\nlanguage at §§5B1.3(c)(14) and 5D1.3(c)(14) is deleted. This change is made to more\r\nclosely adhere to the requirements of 18 U.S.C. § 3572(d).\r\nSex Offender Registration and Notification Act\r\nSecond, the amendment amends §§5B1.3(a)(9) and 5D1.3(a)(7) to clarify that, if the\r\ndefendant is required to register under the Sex Offender Registration and Notification\r\nAct (SORNA), the defendant shall comply with the requirements of the SORNA. Lan-\r\nguage in the guideline provisions and the accompanying commentary indicating that\r\nthe Act applies in some states and not in others is correspondingly deleted. After re-\r\nceiving testimony from the Department of Justice suggesting the current condition\r\ncould be misread, the Commission determined that the condition’s language should be\r\nsimplified and updated to unambiguously reflect that federal sex offender registration\r\nrequirements apply in all states.\r\nReporting to the Probation Officer\r\nThird, the amendment divides the initial and regular reporting requirements,\r\n§§5B1.3(a)(2) and 5D1.3(a)(2), into two more definite provisions. The amendment also\r\namends the conditions to require that the defendant report to the probation office in\r\nthe jurisdiction where he or she is authorized to reside, within 72 hours of release\r\nunless otherwise directed, and that the defendant must thereafter report to the proba-\r\ntion officer as instructed by the court or the probation officer.\r\nLeaving the Jurisdiction\r\nFourth, the amendment revises §§5B1.3(c)(1) and 5D1.3(c)(1), which prohibit defend-\r\nants from leaving the judicial district without permission, for clarity and to insert a\r\nmental state (mens rea) requirement that a defendant must not leave the district\r\n“knowingly.” Testimony received by the Commission has observed that a rule prohib-\r\niting a defendant from leaving the district without permission of the court or probation\r\nofficer may be unfairly applied to a defendant who unknowingly moves between dis-\r\ntricts. The Commission concluded that this change appropriately responds to that con-\r\ncern.\r\nAnswering Truthfully; Following Instructions\r\nFifth, the amendment divides §§5B1.3(c)(3) and 5D1.3(c)(3) into separate conditions\r\nwhich individually require the defendant to “answer truthfully” the questions of the\r\nprobation officer and to follow the instructions of the probation officer “related to the\r\nconditions of supervision.”\r\nThe amendment also adds commentary to clarify that a defendant’s legitimate invoca-\r\ntion of the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination in response to a pro-\r\nbation officer’s question shall not be considered a violation of the “answer truthfully”\r\ncondition. The Commission determined that this approach adequately addresses Fifth\r\nAmendment concerns raised by some courts, see, e.g., United States v. Kappes,\r\n782 F.3d 828, 848 (7th Cir. 2015) and United States v. Saechao, 418 F.3d 1073, 1081\r\nAmendment 803\r\n(9th Cir. 2005), while preserving the probation officer’s ability to adequately supervise\r\nthe defendant.\r\nResidence and Employment\r\nSixth, the amendment clarifies the standard conditions relating to a defendant’s resi-\r\ndence, §§5B1.3(c)(6) and 5D1.3(c)(6), and the requirement that the defendant work full\r\ntime, §§5B1.3(c)(5) and 5D1.3(c)(5). The revised conditions spell out in plain language\r\nthat the defendant must live at a place “approved by the probation officer,” and that\r\nthe defendant must work full time (at least 30 hours per week) at a lawful type of\r\nemployment — or seek to do so — unless excused by the probation officer. The defend-\r\nant must also notify the probation officer of changes in residence or employment at\r\nleast 10 days in advance of the change or, if this is not possible, within 72 hours of\r\nbecoming aware of a change. The Commission determined that these changes are ap-\r\npropriate to ensure that defendants are made aware of what will be required of them\r\nwhile under supervision. These requirements and associated benchmarks (e.g.,\r\n30 hours per week) are supported by testimony from the CLC as appropriate to meet\r\nsupervision needs.\r\nVisits by Probation Officer\r\nSeventh, the amendment amends the conditions requiring the defendant to permit the\r\nprobation officer to visit the defendant at any time, at home or elsewhere, and to permit\r\nthe probation officer to confiscate items prohibited by the defendant’s terms of release,\r\n§§5B1.3(c)(10) and 5D1.3(c)(10). The revision provides plain language notice to defend-\r\nants and guidance to probation officers.\r\nThe Seventh Circuit has criticized this condition as intrusive and not necessarily con-\r\nnected to the offense of conviction, see United States v. Kappes, 782 F.3d 828, 850–51\r\n(7th Cir. 2015) and United States v. Thompson, 777 F.3d 368, 379–80 (7th Cir. 2015),\r\nbut the Commission has determined that, in some circumstance, adequate supervision\r\nof defendants may require probation officers to have the flexibility to visit defendants\r\nat off-hours, at their workplaces, and without advance notice to the supervisee. For\r\nexample, some supervisees work overnight shifts and, in order to verify that they are\r\nin compliance with the condition of supervision requiring employment, a probation of-\r\nficer might have to visit them at their workplace very late in the evening.\r\nAssociation with Criminals\r\nEighth, the amendment revises and clarifies the conditions mandating that the de-\r\nfendant not associate with persons engaged in criminal activity or persons convicted\r\nof a felony unless granted permission to do so by the probation officer, §§5B1.3(c)(9)\r\nand 5D1.3(c)(9). As amended, the condition requires that the defendant must not “com-\r\nmunicate or interact with” any person whom the defendant “knows” to be engaged in\r\n“criminal activity” and prohibits the defendant from communicating or interacting\r\nwith those whom the defendant “knows” to have been “convicted of a felony” without\r\nadvance permission of the probation officer.\r\nThese revisions address concerns expressed by the Seventh Circuit that the condition\r\nis vague and lacks a mens rea requirement. See United States v. Kappes, 782 F.3d 828,\r\n848–49 (7th Cir. 2015); see also United States v. King, 608 F.3d 1122, 1128 (9th Cir.\r\n2010) (upholding the condition by interpreting it to have an implicit mens rea require-\r\nment). The revision adds an express mental state requirement and replaces the term\r\n“associate” with more definite language.\r\nAmendment 803\r\n172 ║ Supplement to Appendix C (November 1, 2016)\r\nArrested or Questioned by a Law Enforcement Officer\r\nNinth, the amendment makes clerical changes to the “standard” conditions requiring\r\nthat the defendant notify the probation officer after being arrested or questioned by a\r\nlaw enforcement officer. See §§5B1.3(11) and 5D1.3(11).\r\nFirearms and Dangerous Weapons\r\nTenth, the amendment reclassifies the “special” conditions which require that the de-\r\nfendant not possess a firearm or other dangerous weapon, §§5B1.3(d)(1) and\r\n5D1.3(d)(1), as “standard” conditions and clarifies those conditions. As amended, the\r\ndefendant must not “own, possess, or have access to” a firearm, ammunition, destruc-\r\ntive device, or dangerous weapon. After reviewing the testimony from the CLC and\r\nothers, the Commission determined that reclassifying this condition as a “standard”\r\ncondition will promote public safety and reduce safety risks to probation officers. The\r\namendment also defines “dangerous weapon” as “anything that was designed, or was\r\nmodified for, the specific purpose of causing bodily injury or death to another person,\r\nsuch as nunchakus or tasers.”\r\nActing as an Informant\r\nEleventh, the amendment rewords the “standard” condition at §§5B1.3(c)(12) and\r\n5D1.3(c)(12) requiring that the defendant not enter into an agreement to act as an\r\ninformant without permission of the court. The condition is revised to improve clarity.\r\nDuty to Notify of Risks Posed by the Defendant\r\nTwelfth, the amendment revises the conditions requiring the defendant, at the direc-\r\ntion of the probation officer, to notify others of risks the defendant may pose based on\r\nhis or her personal history or characteristics, §§5B1.3(c)(13) and 5D1.3(c)(13). As\r\namended, the condition provides that, if the probation officer determines that the de-\r\nfendant poses a risk to another person, the probation officer may require the defendant\r\nto tell the person about the risk and permits the probation officer to confirm that the\r\ndefendant has done so. The Commission determined that this revision is appropriate\r\nto address criticism by the Seventh Circuit regarding potential ambiguity in how the\r\ncondition is currently phrased. See United States v. Thompson, 777 F.3d 368, 379\r\n(7th Cir. 2015).\r\nSupport of Dependents\r\nThirteenth, the amendment clarifies and moves the dependent support requirement\r\nfrom the list of “standard” conditions, §§5B1.3(c)(4) and 5D1.3(c)(4), to the list of “spe-\r\ncial” conditions in subsection (d). As amended, the conditions require that, if the de-\r\nfendant has dependents, he or she must support those dependents; and if the defend-\r\nant is ordered to make child support payments, he or she must make the payments\r\nand comply with the other terms of the order.\r\nThese changes address concerns expressed by the Seventh Circuit that the current\r\ncondition — which requires a defendant to “support his or her dependents and meet\r\nother family responsibilities” — is vague and does apply to defendants who have no\r\ndependents. See United States v. Kappes, 782 F.3d 828, 849 (7th Cir. 2015) and United\r\nStates v. Thompson, 777 F.3d 368, 379–80 (7th Cir. 2015). The amendment uses\r\nplainer language to provide better notice to the defendant about what is required. The\r\nAmendment 804\r\nCommission determined that this condition need not apply to all defendants but only\r\nto those with dependents.\r\nAlcohol; Controlled Substances; Frequenting Places Where Controlled Sub-\r\nstances are Sold\r\nFourteenth, the standard conditions requiring that the defendant refrain from exces-\r\nsive use of alcohol, not possess or distribute controlled substances or paraphernalia,\r\nand not frequent places where controlled substances are illegally sold,\r\n§§5B1.3(c)(7)–(8) and 5D1.3(c)(7)–(8), have been deleted. The Commission determined\r\nthat these conditions are either best dealt with as special conditions or are redundant\r\nwith other conditions. Specifically, to account for the supervision needs of defendants\r\nwith alcohol abuse problems, a new special condition that the defendant “must not use\r\nor possess alcohol” has been added. The requirement that the defendant abstain from\r\nthe illegal use of controlled substances is covered by the “mandatory” conditions pro-\r\nhibiting commission of additional crimes and requiring substance abuse testing. Fi-\r\nnally, the prohibition on frequenting places where controlled substances are illegally\r\nsold is encompassed by the “standard” condition that defendants not associate with\r\nthose they know to be criminals or who are engaged in criminal activity.\r\nMaterial Change in Economic Circumstances (§5D1.3 Only)\r\nFinally, with respect to supervised release only, the “standard” condition requiring\r\nthat the defendant notify the probation officer of any material change in the defend-\r\nant’s economic circumstances that might affect the defendant’s ability to pay any un-\r\npaid amount of restitution, fines, or special assessments, §5D1.3(c)(15), is reclassified\r\nas a “special” condition in subsection (d). Testimony from the CLC and others indicated\r\nthat defendants on supervised release often have no outstanding restitution, fines, or\r\nspecial assessments remaining at the time of their release, rendering the condition\r\nsuperfluous in those cases. No change has been made to the parallel “mandatory” con-\r\ndition of probation at §5B1.3(a)(7).","EffectiveDate":"Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2016."},{"Id":802,"Title":"Amendment 802","Text":"Section 2K2.1 is amended in subsection (a)(8) by inserting “, or 18 U.S.C.\r\n§ 1715” before the period at the end.\r\nThe Commentary to §2K2.1 captioned “Statutory Provisions” is amended by inserting\r\nafter “(k)-(o),” the following: “1715,”.\r\nThe Commentary to §2M6.1 captioned “Application Notes” is amended in Note 1 by\r\nstriking “831(f)(2)” and inserting “831(g)(2)”, and by striking “831(f)(1)” and inserting\r\n“831(g)(1)”.\r\nThe Commentary to §2T1.6 captioned “Background” is amended by striking “The of-\r\nfense is a felony that is infrequently prosecuted.”.\r\nChapter Two, Part T, Subpart 2, is amended in the Introductory Commentary by strik-\r\ning “Because these offenses are no longer a major enforcement priority, no effort” and\r\ninserting “No effort”.\r\nAmendment 804\r\n174 ║ Supplement to Appendix C (November 1, 2016)\r\nSection 2T2.1 is amended by striking the Commentary captioned “Background” as fol-\r\nlows:\r\n“Background: The most frequently prosecuted conduct violating this section is operat-\r\ning an illegal still. 26 U.S.C. § 5601(a)(1).”.\r\nSection 2T2.2 is amended by striking the Commentary captioned “Background” as fol-\r\nlows:\r\n“Background: Prosecutions of this type are infrequent.”.\r\nAppendix A (Statutory Index) is amended by inserting after the line referenced to\r\n18 U.S.C. § 1712 the following:\r\n“18 U.S.C. § 1715 2K2.1”;\r\nby inserting after the line referenced to 18 U.S.C. § 2280 the following:\r\n“18 U.S.C. § 2280a 2A1.1, 2A1.2, 2A1.3, 2A1.4, 2A2.1, 2A2.2, 2A2.3, 2A6.1,\r\n2B1.1, 2B3.2, 2K1.3, 2K1.4, 2M5.2, 2M5.3, 2M6.1,\r\n2Q1.1, 2Q1.2, 2X1.1, 2X2.1, 2X3.1”;\r\nby inserting after the line referenced to 18 U.S.C. § 2281 the following:\r\n“18 U.S.C. § 2281a 2A1.1, 2A1.2, 2A1.3, 2A1.4, 2A2.1, 2A2.2, 2A2.3, 2A6.1,\r\n2B1.1, 2B3.2, 2K1.4, 2M6.1, 2Q1.1, 2Q1.2, 2X1.1”;\r\nand by inserting after the line referenced to 18 U.S.C. § 2332h the following:\r\n“18 U.S.C. § 2332i 2A6.1, 2K1.4, 2M2.1, 2M2.3, 2M6.1”.","Reason":"REASON FOR AMENDMENT: This amendment responds to recently enacted legislation\r\nand miscellaneous guideline application issues.\r\nUSA FREEDOM Act\r\nThe Uniting and Strengthening America by Fulfilling Rights and Ensuring Effective\r\nDiscipline Over Monitoring Act (“USA FREEDOM Act”) of 2015, Pub. L. 114–23\r\n(June 2, 2015), set forth changes to statutes related to maritime navigation and nu-\r\nclear terrorism and provided new and expanded criminal offenses to implement the\r\nUnited States’ obligations under certain provisions of four international conventions.\r\nThe USA FREEDOM Act also specified that the new crimes constitute “federal crimes\r\nof terrorism.” See 18 U.S.C. § 2332b(g)(5). The amendment responds to the USA FREE-\r\nDOM Act by referencing the new offenses in Appendix A (Statutory Index) to various\r\nChapter Two guidelines covering murder and assault, weapons, national security, and\r\nenvironmental offenses.\r\nFirst, the USA FREEDOM Act enacted 18 U.S.C. § 2280a (Violence against maritime\r\nnavigation and maritime transport involving weapons of mass destruction). Subsec-\r\ntions 2280a(a)(1)(A) and (a)(1)(B)(i) prohibit certain acts against maritime navigation\r\ncommitted in a manner that causes or is likely to cause death, serious injury, or dam-\r\nage, when the purpose of the conduct is to intimidate a population or to compel a gov-\r\nAmendment 804\r\nernment or international organization to do or abstain from doing any act. Subsec-\r\ntions 2280a(a)(1)(B)(ii)–(vi) prohibit certain other acts against maritime navigation.\r\nSubsection 2280a(a)(1)(C) prohibits transporting another person on board a ship know-\r\ning the person has committed a violation under 18 U.S.C. § 2280 (Violence against\r\nmaritime navigation) or certain subsections of section 2280a, or an offense under a\r\nlisted counterterrorism treaty. Subsection 2280a(a)(1)(D) prohibits injuring or killing\r\na person in connection with the commission of certain offenses under section 2280a.\r\nSubsection 2280a(a)(1)(E) prohibits attempts and conspiracies under the statute. The\r\npenalty for a violation of these subsections is a term of imprisonment for not more than\r\n20 years. If the death of a person results, the penalty is imprisonment for any term of\r\nyears or for life. Subsection 2280a(a)(2) prohibits threats to commit offenses under\r\nsubsection 2280a(a)(1)(A), with a penalty of imprisonment of up to five years.\r\nThe new offenses at section 2280a are referenced in Appendix A (Statutory Index) to\r\nthe following Chapter Two guidelines: §§2A1.1 (First Degree Murder); 2A1.2 (Second\r\nDegree Murder); 2A1.3 (Voluntary Manslaughter); 2A1.4 (Involuntary Manslaughter);\r\n2A2.1 (Assault with Intent to Commit Murder; Attempted Murder); 2A2.2 (Aggravated\r\nAssault); 2A2.3 (Assault); 2A6.1 (Threatening or Harassing Communications); 2B1.1\r\n(Fraud); 2B3.2 (Extortion); 2K1.3 (Unlawful Receipt, Possession, or Transportation of\r\nExplosive Materials; Prohibited Transactions Involving Explosive Materials); 2K1.4\r\n(Arson; Property Damage by Use of Explosives); 2M5.2 (Exportation of Arms, Muni-\r\ntions, or Military Equipment or Services Without Required Validated Export License);\r\n2M5.3 (Providing Material Support or Resources to Designated Foreign Terrorist Or-\r\nganizations or Specially Designated Global Terrorists, or For a Terrorist Purpose);\r\n2M6.1 (Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical Weapons, and Other Weapons of Mass De-\r\nstruction); 2Q1.1 (Knowing Endangerment Resulting From Mishandling Hazardous or\r\nToxic Substances, Pesticides or Other Pollutants); 2Q1.2 (Mishandling of Hazardous\r\nor Toxic Substances or Pesticides); 2X1.1 (Conspiracy); 2X2.1 (Aiding and Abetting);\r\nand 2X3.1 (Accessory After the Fact).\r\nSecond, the USA FREEDOM Act enacted 18 U.S.C. § 2281a (Additional offenses\r\nagainst maritime fixed platforms). Subsection 2281a(a)(1) prohibits certain acts that\r\noccur either on a fixed platform or to a fixed platform committed in a manner that may\r\ncause death, serious injury, or damage, when the purpose of the conduct is to intimi-\r\ndate a population or to compel a government or international organization to do or\r\nabstain from doing any act. The penalty for a violation of subsection 2281a(a)(1) is a\r\nterm of imprisonment for not more than 20 years. If the death of a person results, the\r\npenalty is imprisonment for any term of years or for life. Subsection 2281a(a)(2) pro-\r\nhibits threats to commit offenses under subsection 2281a(a)(1), and the penalty for a\r\nviolation of subsection 2281a(a)(2) is imprisonment of up to five years.\r\nThe new offenses at 18 U.S.C. § 2281a are referenced to §§2A1.1, 2A1.2, 2A1.3, 2A1.4,\r\n2A2.1, 2A2.2, 2A2.3, 2A6.1, 2B1.1, 2B3.2, 2K1.4, 2M6.1, 2Q1.1, 2Q1.2, and 2X1.1.\r\nThird, the USA FREEDOM Act enacted 18 U.S.C. § 2332i (Acts of nuclear terrorism).\r\nSection 2332i prohibits the possession or use of certain radioactive materials or devices\r\nwith the intent to cause death or serious bodily injury or to cause substantial damage\r\nto property or the environment, as well as threats to commit any such acts. The penalty\r\nfor a violation of section 2332i is imprisonment for any term of years or for life.\r\nThe new offenses at 18 U.S.C. § 2332i are referenced to §§2A6.1, 2K1.4, 2M2.1 (De-\r\nstruction of, or Production of Defective, War Material, Premises, or Utilities), 2M2.3\r\n(Destruction of, or Production of Defective, National Defense Material, Premises, or\r\nUtilities), and 2M6.1.\r\nAmendment 804\r\n176 ║ Supplement to Appendix C (November 1, 2016)\r\nThe amendment also makes clerical changes to Application Note 1 to §2M6.1 (Nuclear,\r\nBiological, and Chemical Weapons, and Other Weapons of Mass Destruction) to reflect\r\nthe redesignation of a section in the United States Code by the USA FREEDOM Act.\r\nThe three new statutes provide a wide range of elements – meaning that the statutes\r\ncan be violated in a large number of alternative ways. The Commission performed a\r\nsection-by-section analysis of the elements of the new statutes and identified the Chap-\r\nter Two offense guidelines that appear most analogous. As a result, the Commission\r\ndetermined that referencing the new statutes in Appendix A (Statutory Index) to a\r\nrange of guidelines will allow the courts to select the most appropriate guideline in\r\nlight of the nature of the conviction. For example, a reference to §2K1.4 (Arson; Prop-\r\nerty Damage by Use of Explosives) is provided to account for when the defendant is\r\nconvicted under section 2280a(a)(1)(A)(i) for the use of an explosive device on a ship in\r\na manner that causes or is likely to cause death or serious injury. See USSG App. A,\r\nIntroduction (Where the statute is referenced to more than one guideline section, the\r\ncourt is to “use the guideline most appropriate for the offense conduct charged in the\r\ncount of which the defendant was convicted.”). The Commission also found it persua-\r\nsive that other similar statutes are referenced in Appendix A to a similar list of Chap-\r\nter Two guidelines. Referencing these three new statutes in a manner consistent with\r\nthe treatment of existing related statutes is reasonable to achieve parity, and will lead\r\nto consistent application of the guidelines.\r\nFirearms As Nonmailable Items under 18 U.S.C. § 1715\r\nSection 1715 of title 18 of the United States Code (Firearms as nonmailable; regula-\r\ntions) makes it unlawful to deposit for mailing or delivery by the mails pistols, revolv-\r\ners, and other firearms capable of being concealed on the person, and the penalty for a\r\nviolation of this statute is a term of imprisonment up to two years. Section 1715 is not\r\nreferenced in Appendix A (Statutory Index). The amendment amends Appendix A to\r\nreference offenses under section 1715 to §2K2.1 (Unlawful Receipt, Possession, or\r\nTransportation of Firearms or Ammunition; Prohibited Transactions Involving Fire-\r\narms or Ammunition). The amendment also amends §2K2.1 to provide a base offense\r\nlevel of 6 under §2K2.1(a)(8) for convictions under section 1715.\r\nThe Commission received public comment suggesting that the lack of specific guidance\r\nfor section 1715 offenses caused unwarranted sentencing disparity. Commission data\r\nprovided further support for the need for an amendment to address this issue. Alt-\r\nhough the data indicated that courts routinely applied §2K2.1 to violations of sec-\r\ntion 1715, it also evidenced that courts were reaching different results in the base of-\r\nfense level applied. The Commission was persuaded by the data and public comment\r\nthat an Appendix A reference and corresponding changes to §2K2.1 would reduce those\r\nunwarranted sentencing disparities. The Commission determined that §2K2.1 is the\r\nmost analogous guideline for these types of firearms offenses. By providing an Appen-\r\ndix A reference for section 1715, the amendment ensures that §2K2.1 will be consist-\r\nently applied to these offenses. Moreover, the Commission decided that the accompa-\r\nnying changes to §2K2.1 will eliminate the disparate application of the base offense\r\nlevels in that guideline. The Commission selected the base offense level of 6 for these\r\noffenses because similar statutory provisions with similar penalties are referenced to\r\n§2K2.1(a)(8). The Commission concluded that referencing section 1715 will promote\r\nconsistency in application and avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities.\r\nAmendment 804\r\nBackground Commentary to §2T1.6 (Failing to Collect or Truthfully Account\r\nfor and Pay Over Tax)\r\nThe Background Commentary in §2T1.6 (Failing to Collect or Truthfully Account for\r\nand Pay Over Tax) states that “[t]he offense is a felony that is infrequently prosecuted.”\r\nSection 2T1.6 applies to violations of 26 U.S.C. § 7202 (Willful failure to collect or pay\r\nover tax) which requires employers to withhold from an employee’s paychecks money\r\nrepresenting the employee’s personal income and Social Security taxes. If an employer\r\nwillfully fails to collect, truthfully account for, or pay over such taxes, 26 U.S.C. § 7202\r\nprovides both civil and criminal remedies. The amendment makes a clerical change to\r\nthe Background Commentary to §2T1.6 to delete the statement that section 7202 of-\r\nfenses are infrequently prosecuted. The amendment makes additional clerical changes\r\nin the Introductory Commentary to Chapter Two, Part T, Subpart 2 (Alcohol and To-\r\nbacco Taxes), and the Background Commentary to §§2T2.1 (Non-Payment of Taxes)\r\nand 2T2.2 (Regulatory Offenses) which has similar language.\r\nThe amendment reflects public comment received by the Commission that indicated\r\nwhile the statement in the Background Commentary to §2T1.6 may have been accurate\r\nwhen the commentary was originally written in 1987, the number of prosecutions un-\r\nder section 7202 have since increased. Additionally, the Commission decided that re-\r\nmoving language characterizing the frequency of prosecutions for the tax offenses sen-\r\ntenced under §§2T1.6, 2T2.1, and 2T2.2 will remove the perception that the Commis-\r\nsion has taken a position regarding the relative frequency of prosecution of such of-\r\nfenses.","EffectiveDate":"Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2016."}]
