In determining whether the most recent tax assessment value is a<br />reasonable estimate of the fair market value, the court may consider, among<br />other factors, the recency of the tax assessment and the extent to which the<br />jurisdiction’s tax assessment practices reflect factors not relevant to fair mar-<br />ket value.”;<br />in Note 3(F) by adding at the end the following:<br />“(ix) Fraudulent Inflation or Deflation in Value of Securities or Commodities.—In a<br />case involving the fraudulent inflation or deflation in the value of a publicly<br />traded security or commodity, there shall be a rebuttable presumption that the<br />Amendment 761<br />2 ║ Supplement to Appendix C (November 1, 2016)<br />actual loss attributable to the change in value of the security or commodity is<br />the amount determined by—<br />(I) calculating the difference between the average price of the security or<br />commodity during the period that the fraud occurred and the average<br />price of the security or commodity during the 90-day period after the<br />fraud was disclosed to the market, and<br />(II) multiplying the difference in average price by the number of shares<br />outstanding.<br />In determining whether the amount so determined is a reasonable estimate of<br />the actual loss attributable to the change in value of the security or commodity,<br />the court may consider, among other factors, the extent to which the amount<br />so determined includes significant changes in value not resulting from the of-<br />fense (e.g., changes caused by external market forces, such as changed eco-<br />nomic circumstances, changed investor expectations, and new industry-spe-<br />cific or firm-specific facts, conditions, or events).”;<br />in Note 12(A) by adding at the end the following:<br />“(v) One or more of the criteria in clauses (i) through (iv) was likely to result from<br />the offense but did not result from the offense because of federal government<br />intervention, such as a ‘bailout’.”;<br />in Note 12(B)(ii) by adding at the end the following:<br />“(VII) One or more of the criteria in subclauses (I) through (VI) was likely to result<br />from the offense but did not result from the offense because of federal govern-<br />ment intervention, such as a ‘bailout’.”;<br />in Note 19(A)(iv) by inserting before the period at the end the following: “, such as a<br />risk of a significant disruption of a national financial market”;<br />and in Note 19(C) by adding after the first paragraph the following new paragraph:<br />“For example, a securities fraud involving a fraudulent statement made publicly to the<br />market may produce an aggregate loss amount that is substantial but diffuse, with<br />relatively small loss amounts suffered by a relatively large number of victims. In such<br />a case, the loss table in subsection (b)(1) and the victims table in subsection (b)(2) may<br />combine to produce an offense level that substantially overstates the seriousness of the<br />offense. If so, a downward departure may be warranted.”.<br />Section 2B1.4(b) is amended by striking “Characteristic” and inserting “Characteris-<br />tics”; and by adding at the end the following:<br />“(2) If the offense involved an organized scheme to engage in insider trading and<br />the offense level determined above is less than level 14, increase to level 14.”.<br />The Commentary to &#167;2B1.4 captioned “Application Note” is amended in the caption by<br />striking “Note” and inserting “Notes”; by redesignating Note 1 as Note 2 and inserting<br />before Note 2 (as so redesignated) the following:<br />Amendment 761<br />“1. Application of Subsection (b)(2).—For purposes of subsection (b)(2), an ‘orga-<br />nized scheme to engage in insider trading’ means a scheme to engage in insider<br />trading that involves considered, calculated, systematic, or repeated efforts to<br />obtain and trade on inside information, as distinguished from fortuitous or op-<br />portunistic instances of insider trading.<br />The following is a non-exhaustive list of factors that the court may consider in<br />determining whether the offense involved an organized scheme to engage in<br />insider trading:<br />(A) the number of transactions;<br />(B) the dollar value of the transactions;<br />(C) the number of securities involved;<br />(D) the duration of the offense;<br />(E) the number of participants in the scheme (although such a scheme may<br />exist even in the absence of more than one participant);<br />(F) the efforts undertaken to obtain material, nonpublic information;<br />(G) the number of instances in which material, nonpublic information was<br />obtained; and<br />(H) the efforts undertaken to conceal the offense.”;<br />in Note 2 (as so redesignated) by striking “only”; and by adding at the end the following<br />new paragraph:<br />“Furthermore, &#167;3B1.3 should be applied if the defendant’s employment in a position<br />that involved regular participation or professional assistance in creating, issuing, buy-<br />ing, selling, or trading securities or commodities was used to facilitate significantly the<br />commission or concealment of the offense. It would apply, for example, to a hedge fund<br />professional who regularly participates in securities transactions or to a lawyer who<br />regularly provides professional assistance in securities transactions, if the defendant’s<br />employment in such a position was used to facilitate significantly the commission or<br />concealment of the offense. It ordinarily would not apply to a position such as a clerical<br />worker in an investment firm, because such a position ordinarily does not involve spe-<br />cial skill. See &#167;3B1.3, comment. (n. 4).”.<br />The Commentary to &#167;2B1.4 captioned “Background” is amended by adding at the end<br />the following new paragraph:<br />“ Subsection (b)(2) implements the directive to the Commission in sec-<br />tion 1079A(a)(1)(A) of Public Law 111–203.”.</td><td>REASON FOR AMENDMENT: This amendment responds to the two directives to the Com-<br />mission in the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, Pub.<br />L. 111–203 (the “Act”). The first directive relates to securities fraud and similar of-<br />fenses, and the second directive relates to mortgage fraud and financial institution<br />fraud.<br />Amendment 761<br />4 ║ Supplement to Appendix C (November 1, 2016)<br />Securities Fraud and Similar Offenses<br />Section 1079A(a)(1)(A) of the Act directs the Commission to “review and, if appropriate,<br />amend” the guidelines and policy statements applicable to “persons convicted of of-<br />fenses relating to securities fraud or any other similar provision of law, in order to<br />reflect the intent of Congress that penalties for the offenses under the guidelines and<br />policy statements appropriately account for the potential and actual harm to the public<br />and the financial markets from the offenses.” Section 1079A(a)(1)(B) provides that in<br />promulgating any such amendment the Commission shall—<br />(i) ensure that the guidelines and policy statements, particularly section<br />2B1.1(b)(14) and section 2B1.1(b)(17) (and any successors thereto), re-<br />flect—<br />(I) the serious nature of the offenses described in subparagraph<br />(A);<br />(II) the need for an effective deterrent and appropriate punishment<br />to prevent the offenses; and<br />(III) the effectiveness of incarceration in furthering the objectives<br />described in subclauses (I) and (II);<br />(ii) consider the extent to which the guidelines appropriately account for<br />the potential and actual harm to the public and the financial markets<br />resulting from the offenses;<br />(iii) ensure reasonable consistency with other relevant directives and<br />guidelines and Federal statutes;<br />(iv) make any necessary conforming changes to guidelines; and<br />(v) ensure that the guidelines adequately meet the purposes of sentencing,<br />as set forth in section 3553(a)(2) of title 18, United States Code.<br />The amendment responds to this directive in two ways. First, the amendment amends<br />the fraud guideline, &#167;2B1.1 (Theft, Property Destruction, and Fraud), to provide a spe-<br />cial rule for determining actual loss in cases involving the fraudulent inflation or de-<br />flation in the value of a publicly traded security or commodity. Case law and comments<br />received by the Commission indicate that determinations of loss in cases involving se-<br />curities fraud and similar offenses are complex and that a variety of different methods<br />are in use, possibly resulting in unwarranted sentencing disparities.<br />The amendment amends &#167;2B1.1 to provide a special rule regarding how to calculate<br />actual loss in these types of cases. Specifically, the amendment creates a new Applica-<br />tion Note 3(F)(ix) which establishes a rebuttable presumption that “the actual loss at-<br />tributable to the change in value of the security or commodity is the amount deter-<br />mined by (I) calculating the difference between the average price of the security or<br />commodity during the period that the fraud occurred and the average price of the se-<br />curity or commodity during the 90-day period after the fraud was disclosed to the mar-<br />ket, and (II) multiplying the difference in average price by the number of shares out-<br />standing.” The special rule further provides that, “[i]n determining whether the<br />amount so determined is a reasonable estimate of the actual loss attributable to the<br />change in value of the security or commodity, the court may consider, among other<br />factors, the extent to which the amount so determined includes significant changes in<br />value not resulting from the offense (e.g., changes caused by external market forces,<br />Amendment 761<br />such as changed economic circumstances, changed investor expectations, and new in-<br />dustry-specific or firm-specific facts, conditions, or events).”<br />The special rule is based upon what is sometimes referred to as the “modified rescis-<br />sory method” and should ordinarily provide a “reasonable estimate of the loss” as re-<br />quired by Application Note 3(C). This special rule is intended to provide courts a work-<br />able and consistent formula for calculating loss that “resulted from the offense.”<br />See &#167;2B1.1, comment. (n.3(A)(i)). By averaging the stock price during the period in<br />which the fraud occurred and a set 90-day period after the fraud was discovered, the<br />special rule reduces the impact on the loss calculation of factors other than the fraud,<br />such as overall growth or decline in the price of the stock. See, e.g., United States v.<br />Bakhit, 218 F. Supp. 2d 1232 (C.D. Cal. 2002); United States v. Snyder, 291 F.3d 1291<br />(11th Cir. 2002); United States v. Brown, 595 F.3d 498 (3d Cir. 2010); see also 15 U.S.C.<br />&#167; 78u-4(e) (statutorily setting forth a similar method for loss calculation in the context<br />of private securities litigation). Furthermore, applying this special rule could “elimi-<br />nate[], or at least reduce[], the complexity, uncertainty, and expense inherent in at-<br />tempting to determine out-of-pocket losses on a case-by-case basis.” See United States<br />v. Grabske, 260 F. Supp. 2d. 866, 873–74 (N.D. Cal. 2002).<br />By applying a rebuttable presumption, however, the amendment also provides suffi-<br />cient flexibility for a court to consider the extent to which the amount determined un-<br />der the special rule includes significant changes in value not resulting from the offense<br />(e.g., changes caused by external market forces, such as changed economic circum-<br />stances, changed investor expectations, and new industry-specific or firm-specific<br />facts, conditions, or events).<br />The amendment also responds to the first directive by amending the insider trading<br />guideline, &#167;2B1.4 (Insider Trading). First, it provides a new specific offense character-<br />istic if the offense involved an “organized scheme to engage in insider trading.” In such<br />a case, the new specific offense characteristic provides a minimum offense level of 14.<br />The commentary is also amended to provide factors the court may consider in deter-<br />mining whether the new minimum offense level applies.<br />The amendment reflects the Commission’s view that a defendant who engages in con-<br />sidered, calculated, systematic, or repeated efforts to obtain and trade on inside infor-<br />mation (as opposed to fortuitous or opportunistic instances of insider trading) war-<br />rants, at minimum, a short but definite period of incarceration. Sentencing data indi-<br />cate that when a defendant engages in an organized insider trading scheme, the gain<br />from the offense ordinarily triggers an enhancement under &#167;2B1.4(b)(1) of sufficient<br />magnitude to result in a guideline range that requires a period of imprisonment. The<br />amendment, however, ensures that the guidelines require a period of incarceration<br />even in such a case involving relatively little gain.<br />The amendment also amends the commentary to &#167;2B1.4 to provide more guidance on<br />the applicability of &#167;3B1.3 (Abuse of Position of Trust or Use of Special Skill) in insider<br />trading cases. In particular, the new commentary in Application Note 2 provides that<br />&#167;3B1.3 should be applied if the defendant’s employment in a position that involved<br />regular participation or professional assistance in creating, issuing, buying, selling, or<br />trading securities or commodities was used to facilitate significantly the commission<br />or concealment of the offense. The commentary further provides examples of positions<br />that may qualify for the adjustment, including a hedge fund professional who regularly<br />participates in securities transactions or a lawyer who regularly provides professional<br />assistance in securities transactions. Individuals who occupy such positions possess<br />special knowledge regarding the financial markets and the rules prohibiting insider<br />Amendment 761<br />6 ║ Supplement to Appendix C (November 1, 2016)<br />trading, and generally are viewed as more culpable. See &#167;3B1.3, comment. (backg’d.).<br />The commentary also provides as an example of a position that would not qualify for<br />the adjustment in &#167;3B1.4 a clerical worker in an investment firm. Such a position or-<br />dinarily does not involve special skill and is not generally viewed as more culpable.<br />Mortgage Fraud and Financial Institution Fraud<br />Section 1079A(a)(2)(A) of the Act directs the Commission to “review and, if appropriate,<br />amend” the guidelines and policy statements applicable to “persons convicted of fraud<br />offenses relating to financial institutions or federally related mortgage loans and any<br />other similar provisions of law, to reflect the intent of Congress that the penalties for<br />the offenses under the guidelines and policy statements ensure appropriate terms of<br />imprisonment for offenders involved in substantial bank frauds or other frauds relat-<br />ing to financial institutions.” Section 1079A(a)(2)(B) of the Act provides that, in prom-<br />ulgating any such amendment, the Commission shall—<br />(i) ensure that the guidelines and policy statements reflect—<br />(I) the serious nature of the offenses described in subpara-<br />graph (A);<br />(II) the need for an effective deterrent and appropriate punishment<br />to prevent the offenses; and<br />(III) the effectiveness of incarceration in furthering the objectives<br />described in subclauses (I) and (II);<br />(ii) consider the extent to which the guidelines appropriately account for<br />the potential and actual harm to the public and the financial markets<br />resulting from the offenses;<br />(iii) ensure reasonable consistency with other relevant directives and<br />guidelines and Federal statutes;<br />(iv) make any necessary conforming changes to guidelines; and<br />(v) ensure that the guidelines adequately meet the purposes of sentencing,<br />as set forth in section 3553(a)(2) of title 18, United States Code.<br />The amendment responds to this directive in two ways.<br />First, the amendment adds language to the credits against loss rule, found in Applica-<br />tion Note 3(E) of the commentary to &#167;2B1.1. Application Note 3(E)(i) generally provides<br />that the determination of loss under subsection (b)(1) shall be reduced by the money<br />returned and the fair market value of the property returned and services rendered to<br />the victim before the offense was detected. In the context of a case involving collateral<br />pledged or otherwise provided by the defendant, Application Note 3(E)(ii) provides that<br />the loss to the victim shall be reduced by either “the amount the victim has recovered<br />at the time of sentencing from disposition of the collateral, or if the collateral has not<br />been disposed of by that time, the fair market value of the collateral at the time of<br />sentencing.”<br />The Commission received comment that, in cases involving mortgage fraud where the<br />collateral has not been disposed of by the time of sentencing, the fair market value of<br />Amendment 761<br />the collateral may be difficult to determine and may require frequent updating, espe-<br />cially in cases involving multiple properties. The comments further indicate that the<br />lack of a uniform process may result in unwarranted sentencing disparities.<br />The amendment responds to these concerns by establishing a new Application Note<br />3(E)(iii) applicable to fraud cases involving a mortgage loan where the underlying col-<br />lateral has not been disposed of by the time of sentencing. In such a case, new Appli-<br />cation Note 3(E)(iii) makes two changes to the calculation of credits against loss. First,<br />the note changes the date on which the fair market value of the collateral is deter-<br />mined, from the time of sentencing to the date on which the guilt of the defendant has<br />been established. This change is intended to avoid the need to reassess the fair market<br />value of such collateral on multiple occasions up to the date of sentencing. Second, it<br />establishes a rebuttable presumption that the most recent tax assessment value of the<br />collateral is a reasonable estimate of the fair market value. In determining whether<br />the tax assessment is a reasonable estimate of fair market value, the note further pro-<br />vides that the court may consider the recency of the tax assessment and the extent to<br />which the jurisdiction’s tax assessment practices reflect factors not relevant to fair<br />market value, among other factors.<br />By structuring the special rule in this manner, the amendment addresses the need to<br />provide a uniform practicable method for determining fair market value of undisposed<br />collateral while providing sufficient flexibility for courts to address differences among<br />jurisdictions regarding how closely the most recent tax assessment correlates to fair<br />market value. The Commission heard concerns, for example, that, in some jurisdic-<br />tions, the most recent tax assessment may be outdated or based upon factors, such as<br />the age or status of the homeowner, that have no correlation to fair market value.<br />The amendment also responds to the second directive by amending the commentary<br />regarding the application of &#167;2B1.1(b)(15)(B), which provides an enhancement of 4 lev-<br />els if the offense involved specific types of financial harms (e.g., jeopardizing a financial<br />institution or organization). This commentary, contained in Application Note 12 to<br />&#167;2B1.1, provides a non-exhaustive list of factors the court shall consider in determining<br />whether, as a result of the offense, the safety and soundness of a financial institution<br />or an organization that was a publicly traded company or that had more than 1,000 em-<br />ployees was substantially jeopardized. For example, in the context of financial institu-<br />tions, the court shall consider whether the financial institution became insolvent, was<br />forced to reduce benefits to pensioners or insureds, was unable on demand to refund<br />fully any deposit, payment, or investment, or was so depleted of its assets as to be<br />forced to merge with another institution. Similarly, in the context of a covered organi-<br />zation, the court shall consider whether the organization became insolvent or suffered<br />a substantial reduction in the value of its assets, filed for bankruptcy, suffered a sub-<br />stantial reduction in the value of its equity securities or its employee retirement ac-<br />counts, or substantially reduced its workforce or employee pension benefits.<br />The amendment amends Application Note 12 to add as a new consideration whether<br />one of the listed harms was likely to result from the offense, but did not result from<br />the offense because of federal government intervention, such as a “bailout.” This<br />amendment reflects the Commission’s intent that &#167;2B1.1(b)(15)(B) account for the risk<br />of harm from the defendant’s conduct and its view that a defendant should not avoid<br />the application of the enhancement because the harm that was otherwise likely to re-<br />sult from the offense conduct did not occur because of fortuitous federal government<br />intervention.<br />Amendment 762<br />8 ║ Supplement to Appendix C (November 1, 2016)<br />Departure Provisions<br />Finally, the amendment also responds to the Act’s directives by amending the depar-<br />ture provisions in &#167;2B1.1 to provide two examples of cases in which a departure may<br />be warranted.<br />First, the amendment amends Application Note 19(A)(iv), which provides that an up-<br />ward departure may be warranted if the offense created a risk of substantial loss be-<br />yond the loss determined for purposes of subsection (b)(1). The amendment adds “risk<br />of a significant disruption of a national financial market” as an example of such a risk.<br />This part of the amendment responds to the requirement in the Act to consider<br />whether the guidelines applicable to the offenses covered by the directives appropri-<br />ately “account for the potential and actual harm to the public and the financial mar-<br />kets[.]”<br />The amendment also amends Application Note 19(C), which provides that a downward<br />departure may be warranted if the offense level substantially overstates the serious-<br />ness of the offense, by adding an example of a case in which such a departure may be<br />appropriate. The example provides that “a securities fraud involving a fraudulent<br />statement made publicly to the market may produce an aggregate loss amount that is<br />substantial but diffuse, with relatively small loss amounts suffered by a relatively<br />large number of victims,” and that, “in such a case, the loss table in subsection (b)(1)<br />and the victims table in subsection (b)(2) may combine to produce an offense level that<br />substantially overstates the seriousness of the offense.” This part of the amendment<br />responds to concerns raised in comment and case law that the cumulative impact of<br />the loss table and the victims table may overstate the seriousness of the offense in<br />certain cases.</td><td>Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2012.</td></tr><tr><td class="n">762</td><td>Amendment 762</td><td>The Commentary to &#167;2D1.1 captioned “Application Notes” is amended in<br />Note 10(D) in the subdivision captioned “Cocaine and Other Schedule I and II Stimu-<br />lants (and their immediate precursors)” by inserting after the entry relating to N-N-<br />Dimethylamphetamine the following new entry:<br />“1 gm of N-Benzylpiperazine = 100 gm of marihuana”.</td><td>REASON FOR AMENDMENT: This amendment responds to concerns raised by the Second<br />Circuit Court of Appeals and others regarding the sentencing of offenders convicted of<br />offenses involving BZP (N-Benzylpiperazine), which is a Schedule I stimulant.<br />See United States v. Figueroa, 647 F.3d 466 (2d Cir. 2011). The amendment estab-<br />lishes a marijuana equivalency for BZP offenses in the Drug Equivalency Table pro-<br />vided in Application Note 10(D) in &#167;2D1.1 (Unlawful Manufacturing, Importing, Ex-<br />porting, or Trafficking (Including Possession with Intent to Commit These Offenses);<br />Attempt or Conspiracy). The marijuana equivalency established by the amendment<br />provides that 1 gram of BZP equals 100 grams of marijuana.<br />Prior to the amendment, the Drug Equivalency Table did not include a marijuana<br />equivalency for BZP. As a result, in offenses involving BZP, the court determined the<br />Amendment 763<br />base offense level using the marijuana equivalency of “the most closely related con-<br />trolled substance” referenced in &#167;2D1.1. See &#167;2D1.1, comment. (n. 5). In determining<br />the most closely related controlled substance, the commentary directs the court to con-<br />sider (1) whether the controlled substance not referenced in &#167;2D1.1 has a chemical<br />structure that is substantially similar to a controlled substance that is referenced in<br />&#167;2D1.1, (2) whether the controlled substance not referenced in &#167;2D1.1 has a stimulant,<br />depressant, or hallucinogenic effect similar to a controlled substance referenced in the<br />guideline, and (3) whether a lesser or greater quantity of the controlled substance not<br />referenced in &#167;2D1.1 is needed to produce a substantially similar effect as a controlled<br />substance that is referenced in &#167;2D1.1.<br />In applying these factors, courts have reached different conclusions regarding which<br />controlled substance referenced in &#167;2D1.1 is most closely related to BZP and have<br />therefore used different marijuana equivalencies in sentencing BZP offenders. The<br />Commission’s review of case law and sentencing data indicate that some district courts<br />have found that the controlled substance most closely related to BZP is amphetamine<br />and used the marijuana equivalency for amphetamine, see United States v. Major,<br />801 F. Supp. 2d 511, 514 (E.D. Va. 2011) (using the marijuana equivalency for amphet-<br />amine at full potency), while other district courts have found that the controlled sub-<br />stance most related to BZP is MDMA, but at varying potencies. See United States v.<br />Bennett, 659 F.3d 711, 715–16 (8th Cir. 2011) (affirming a district court’s use of the<br />marijuana equivalency for MDMA at full potency); United States v. Rose,<br />722 F. Supp. 2d 1286, 1289 (M.D. Ala. 2010) (concluding that BZP is most closely re-<br />lated to MDMA, but imposing a variance to reflect BZP’s reduced potency compared to<br />MDMA). The different findings of which controlled substance is the most closely re-<br />lated to BZP, and the application of different potencies of those controlled substances,<br />have resulted in courts imposing vastly different sentence lengths for the same con-<br />duct.<br />The Commission reviewed scientific literature and received expert testimony and com-<br />ment relating to BZP and concluded that BZP is a stimulant with pharmacologic prop-<br />erties similar to that of amphetamine, but is only one-tenth to one-twentieth as potent<br />as amphetamine, depending on the particular user’s history of drug abuse. Accord-<br />ingly, in order to promote uniformity in sentencing BZP offenders and to reflect the<br />best available scientific evidence, the amendment establishes a marijuana equivalency<br />of 1 gram of BZP equals 100 grams of marijuana. This corresponds to one-twentieth of<br />the marijuana equivalency for amphetamine, which is 1 gram of amphetamine equals<br />2 kilograms (or 2,000 grams) of marijuana.</td><td>Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2012.</td></tr><tr><td class="n">763</td><td>Amendment 763</td><td>Section 2D1.11 is amended in subsection (b) by adding at the end the<br />following:<br />“(6) If the defendant meets the criteria set forth in subdivisions (1)–(5) of subsec-<br />tion (a) of &#167;5C1.2 (Limitation on Applicability of Statutory Minimum Sentences<br />in Certain Cases), decrease by 2 levels.”.<br />The Commentary to 2D1.11 captioned “Application Notes” is amended by adding at<br />the end the following:<br />Amendment 763<br />10 ║ Supplement to Appendix C (November 1, 2016)<br />“9. Applicability of Subsection (b)(6).—The applicability of subsection (b)(6) shall<br />be determined without regard to the offense of conviction. If subsection (b)(6)<br />applies, &#167;5C1.2(b) does not apply. See &#167;5C1.2(b)(2)(requiring a minimum of-<br />fense level of level 17 if the ‘statutorily required minimum sentence is at least<br />five years’).”.</td><td>REASON FOR AMENDMENT: This amendment adds a new specific offense characteristic<br />at subsection (b)(6) of &#167;2D1.11 (Unlawfully Distributing, Importing, Exporting or Pos-<br />sessing a Listed Chemical; Attempt or Conspiracy) that provides a 2-level decrease if<br />the defendant meets the criteria set forth in subdivisions (1)–(5) of subsection (a) of<br />&#167;5C1.2 (Limitation on Applicability of Statutory Minimum Sentences in Certain Cases)<br />(commonly referred to as the “safety valve” criteria). The new specific offense charac-<br />teristic in &#167;2D1.11 parallels the existing 2-level decrease at subsection (b)(16) of<br />&#167;2D1.1(Unlawful Manufacturing, Importing, Exporting, or Trafficking (Including Pos-<br />session with Intent to Commit These Offenses); Attempt or Conspiracy).<br />The Commission in 1995 created the 2-level reduction in &#167;2D1.1 for offenders who meet<br />the safety valve criteria in response to a directive in section 80001 of the Violent Crime<br />Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, Pub. L. No. 103–322. Section 80001 pro-<br />vided an exception to otherwise applicable statutory minimum sentences for defend-<br />ants convicted of specified drug offenses and who meet the criteria specified in<br />18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(f)(1)–(5), and directed the Commission to promulgate guidelines to<br />carry out these purposes. The reduction in &#167;2D1.1 initially was limited to defendants<br />whose offense level was level 26 or greater, see USSG App. C, Amendment 515 (effec-<br />tive November 1, 1995), but was subsequently expanded to apply to offenders with an<br />offense level lower than level 26 to address proportionality concerns. See USSG App. C,<br />Amendment 624 (effective November 1, 2001). Specifically, the Commission deter-<br />mined that limiting the applicability of the reduction to defendants with an offense<br />level of level 26 or greater “is inconsistent with the general principles underlying the<br />two-level reduction . . . to provide lesser punishment for first time, nonviolent offend-<br />ers.” Id.<br />For similar reasons of proportionality, this amendment expands application of the<br />2-level reduction to offenses involving list I and list II chemicals sentenced under<br />&#167;2D1.11. List I chemicals are important to the manufacture of a controlled substance<br />and usually become part of the final product, while list II chemicals are generally used<br />as solvents, catalysts, and reagents. See USSG &#167;2D1.11, comment. (backg’d.). Sec-<br />tion 2D1.11 is generally structured to provide base offense levels that are tied to, but<br />less severe than, the base offense levels in &#167;2D1.1 for offenses involving the final prod-<br />uct. The Commission determined that adding the 2-level reduction for meeting the<br />safety valve criteria in &#167;2D1.11 would promote the proportionality the Commission has<br />intended to achieve between &#167;&#167;2D1.1 and 2D1.11.<br />The amendment also adds new commentary relating to the “safety valve” reduction in<br />&#167;2D1.11 that is consistent with the commentary relating to the “safety valve” reduction<br />in &#167;2D1.1. See USSG &#167;2D1.1, comment. (n. 21). The commentary makes clear that the<br />new 2-level reduction in &#167;2D1.11 applies regardless of the offense of conviction, and<br />that the minimum offense level of 17 in subsection (b) of &#167;5C1.2 (Limitation on Ap-<br />plicability of Statutory Minimum Sentences in Certain Cases) does not apply. Section<br />5C1.2(b) provides for an offense level not less than level 17 for defendants who meet<br />the criteria of subdivisions (1) – (5) of section (a) in &#167;5C1.2 and for whom the statutorily<br />required minimum sentence is at least 5 years. See USSG App. C, Amendment 624<br />(effective November 1, 2001). Since none of the offenses referenced to &#167;2D1.11 carries<br />Amendment 764<br />a statutory mandatory minimum, the minimum offense level of 17 at &#167;5C1.2(b) does<br />not affect application of the new 2-level reduction in &#167;2D1.11.</td><td>Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2012.</td></tr><tr><td class="n">764</td><td>Amendment 764</td><td>The Commentary to &#167;2L1.2 captioned “Application Notes” is amended in<br />Note 1(B)(vii) by inserting before the period at the end the following: “, but only if the<br />revocation occurred before the defendant was deported or unlawfully remained in the<br />United States”.</td><td>REASON FOR AMENDMENT: This amendment responds to a circuit conflict over the ap-<br />plication of the enhancements found at &#167;2L1.2(b)(1)(A) and (B) to a defendant who was<br />sentenced on two or more occasions for the same drug trafficking conviction (e.g., be-<br />cause of a revocation of probation, parole, or supervised release), such that there was<br />a sentence imposed before the defendant’s deportation, then an additional sentence<br />imposed after the deportation. The amendment resolves the conflict by amending the<br />definition of “sentence imposed” in Application Note 1(B)(vii) to &#167;2L1.2 (Unlawfully<br />Entering or Remaining in the United States) to state that the length of the sentence<br />imposed includes terms of imprisonment given upon revocation of probation, parole, or<br />supervised release, but “only if the revocation occurred before the defendant was de-<br />ported or unlawfully remained in the United States.”<br />Section 2L1.2(b)(1) generally reflects the Commission’s determination that both the<br />seriousness and the timing of the prior offense for which the defendant was deported<br />are relevant to assessing the defendant’s culpability for the illegal reentry offense. A<br />defendant who was deported after a conviction for a felony drug trafficking offense<br />receives an enhancement under either prong (A) or (B) of subsection (b)(1), depending<br />on the length of the sentence imposed. If the sentence imposed was more than<br />13 months, the defendant receives a 16-level enhancement to the base offense level<br />under prong (A). If the sentence imposed was 13 months or less, the defendant receives<br />a 12-level enhancement under prong (B). However, for defendants whose prior convic-<br />tions are remote in time and thus do not receive criminal history points, these enhance-<br />ments are reduced to 12 levels and 8 levels, respectively.<br />The majority of circuits that have considered the meaning of “sentence imposed” in this<br />context have held that the later, additional sentence imposed after deportation does<br />not lengthen the sentence imposed for purposes of the subsection (b)(1) enhancement.<br />See United States v. Bustillos-Pena, 612 F.3d 863 (5th Cir. 2010); United States v.<br />Lopez, 634 F.3d 948 (7th Cir. 2011); United States v. Rosales-Garcia, 667 F.3d 1348<br />(10th Cir. 2012); United States v. Guzman-Bera, 216 F.3d 1019 (11th Cir. 2000). Under<br />the majority approach, if the sentence imposed was 13 months or less before the de-<br />fendant was deported, and was only increased to more than 13 months after the de-<br />portation, the defendant is not subject to the enhancement in prong (A) because the<br />“sentence imposed” includes only the sentence imposed before the deportation. Under<br />this approach, such a defendant receives the enhancement in prong (B) instead.<br />The Second Circuit has reached the contrary conclusion, holding that defendants who<br />had their sentences increased to more than 13 months upon revocation after deporta-<br />Amendment 765<br />12 ║ Supplement to Appendix C (November 1, 2016)<br />tion are subject to the enhancement in prong (A) because the “sentence imposed” in-<br />cludes the additional revocation sentence imposed after deportation. See United States<br />v. Compres-Paulino, 393 F.3d 116 (2d Cir. 2004).<br />The amendment adopts the approach taken by the majority of circuits, with the result<br />that the term of imprisonment imposed upon revocation counts toward the calculation<br />of the offense level in &#167;2L1.2 only if it was imposed before the defendant was deported<br />or unlawfully remained in the United States. According to public comment and testi-<br />mony received by the Commission, and as courts have observed, the circumstances<br />under which persons are found present in this country and have their probation, pa-<br />role, or supervised release revoked for a prior offense vary widely. See Bustillos-Pena,<br />612 F.3d at 867–68 (describing differences among revocation proceedings). In some ju-<br />risdictions, the revocation is typically based on the offender’s illegal return, while in<br />others, the revocation is typically based on the offender’s committing an additional<br />crime. Furthermore, in some cases revocation proceedings commonly occur before the<br />offender is sentenced on the illegal reentry offense, while in other cases the revocation<br />occurs after the federal sentencing. See Rosales-Garcia, 667 F.3d at 1354 (observing<br />that considering post-deportation revocation sentences could result in disparities<br />based on the “happenstance” of whether that revocation occurred before or after the<br />prosecution for the illegal reentry offense). Therefore, assessing the seriousness of the<br />prior crime based on the sentence imposed before deportation should result in more<br />consistent application of the enhancements in &#167;2L1.2(b)(1)(A) and (B) and promote<br />uniformity in sentencing.</td><td>Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2012.</td></tr><tr><td class="n">765</td><td>Amendment 765</td><td>Section 2L2.2 is amended in subsection (b) by adding at the end the fol-<br />lowing:<br />“(4) (Apply the Greater):<br />(A) If the defendant committed any part of the instant offense to conceal<br />the defendant’s membership in, or authority over, a military, paramil-<br />itary, or police organization that was involved in a serious human<br />rights offense during the period in which the defendant was such a<br />member or had such authority, increase by 2 levels.

See 28 U.S.C. &#167; 509B(e).<br />2. Application of Minimum Offense Level in Subsection (b).—The minimum of-<br />fense level in subsection (b) is cumulative with any other provision in the<br />guidelines. For example, if death resulted and this factor was specifically in-<br />corporated into the Chapter Two offense guideline, the minimum offense level<br />in subsection (b) may also apply.<br />Background: This guideline covers a range of conduct considered to be serious human<br />rights offenses, including genocide, war crimes, torture, and the recruitment or use of<br />child soldiers. See generally 28 U.S.C. &#167; 509B(e).<br />Serious human rights offenses generally have a statutory maximum term of<br />imprisonment of 20 years, but if death resulted, a higher statutory maximum term of<br />imprisonment of any term of years or life applies. See 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1091(b), 2340A(a),<br />2442(b). For the offense of war crimes, a statutory maximum term of imprisonment of<br />any term of years or life always applies. See 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2441(a). For the offense of<br />incitement to genocide, the statutory maximum term of imprisonment is five years.<br />See 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1091(c).”.<br />Amendment 765<br />14 ║ Supplement to Appendix C (November 1, 2016)<br />Appendix A (Statutory Index) is amended by inserting after the line referenced to<br />18 U.S.C. &#167; 2425 the following:<br />“18 U.S.C. &#167; 2441 2X5.1”.</td><td>REASON FOR AMENDMENT: This amendment results from the Commission’s multi-year<br />review to ensure that the guidelines provide appropriate guidelines penalties for cases<br />involving human rights violations. This amendment addresses human rights violators<br />in two areas: defendants who are convicted of a human rights offense, and defendants<br />who are convicted of immigration or naturalization fraud to conceal the defendant’s<br />involvement, or possible involvement, in a human rights offense.<br />Serious Human Rights Offenses<br />First, the amendment addresses defendants whose instant offense of conviction is a<br />“serious human rights offense.” In the Human Rights Enforcement Act of 2009, Pub.<br />L. 111–122 (Dec. 22, 2009), Congress defined “serious human rights offenses” as “vio-<br />lations of Federal criminal laws relating to genocide, torture, war crimes, and the use<br />or recruitment of child soldiers under sections 1091, 2340, 2340A, 2441, and 2442 of<br />title 18, United States Code.” In that legislation, Congress authorized a new section<br />within the Department of Justice “with responsibility for the enforcement of laws<br />against suspected participants in [such] offenses.” That section was established the<br />following year, when the Human Rights and Special Prosecutions Section was created<br />in the Justice Department’s Criminal Division. Serious human rights offenses gener-<br />ally have a statutory maximum term of imprisonment of 20 years, but if death resulted,<br />a higher statutory maximum term of imprisonment of any term of years or life applies.<br />See 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1091(b), 2340A(a), 2442(b). For the offense of war crimes, a statutory<br />maximum term of imprisonment of any term of years or life always applies.<br />See 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2441(a). For the offense of incitement to genocide, the statutory maxi-<br />mum term of imprisonment is five years. See 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1091(c).<br />Serious human rights offenses can be committed in a variety of ways, including, for<br />example, assault, kidnapping, and murder. As a result, the guidelines generally have<br />addressed these offenses by referencing them to a number of different Chapter Two<br />offense guidelines, such as &#167;&#167;2A1.1 (First Degree Murder), 2A1.2 (Second Degree Mur-<br />der), 2A2.1 (Assault with Intent to Commit Murder; Attempted Murder), 2A2.2 (Ag-<br />gravated Assault) and 2A4.1 (Kidnapping, Abduction, Unlawful Restraint). In addi-<br />tion, certain of these Chapter Two offense guidelines use as a base offense level the<br />offense level from another guideline applicable to the underlying conduct (e.g., &#167;2H1.1<br />(Offenses Involving Individual Rights), which is the guideline to which genocide of-<br />fenses are referenced). The offense of committing a war crime in violation of 18 U.S.C.<br />&#167; 2441, however, has not been referenced to any guideline prior to this amendment.<br />The amendment amends Appendix A (Statutory Index) to reference these offenses to<br />&#167;2X5.1 (Other Felony Offenses). Section 2X5.1 addresses the variety of ways in which<br />a war crimes offense may be committed by generally directing the court to apply the<br />most analogous offense guideline.<br />The amendment also establishes a new Chapter Three adjustment at &#167;3A1.5 (Serious<br />Human Rights Offense) if the defendant was convicted of a serious human rights of-<br />fense. The new guideline provides two tiers of adjustments, corresponding to the dif-<br />fering statutory penalties that apply to such offenses. The adjustment generally pro-<br />vides a 4-level increase if the defendant was convicted of a serious human rights of-<br />Amendment 766<br />fense, and a minimum offense level of 37 if death resulted. If the defendant was con-<br />victed of an offense under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1091(c) for inciting genocide, however, the ad-<br />justment provides a 2-level increase in light of the lesser statutory maximum penalty<br />such offenses carry compared to the other offenses covered by this adjustment.<br />The new Chapter Three adjustment accounts for the particularly egregious nature of<br />serious human rights offenses while generally maintaining the proportionality pro-<br />vided by the various Chapter Two guidelines that cover such offenses.<br />Immigration Fraud<br />Second, the amendment addresses cases in which the offense of conviction is for immi-<br />gration or naturalization fraud and the defendant committed any part of the instant<br />offense to conceal the defendant’s involvement, or possible involvement, in a serious<br />human rights offense. These offenders are sentenced under &#167;2L2.2 (Fraudulently Ac-<br />quiring Documents Relating to Naturalization, Citizenship, or Legal Resident Status<br />for Own Use; False Personation or Fraudulent Marriage by Alien to Evade Immigra-<br />tion Law; Fraudulently Acquiring or Improperly Using a United States Passport). The<br />offenders covered by this amendment fall into two categories. In the first category are<br />defendants who concealed their connection to a military, paramilitary, or police organ-<br />ization that was involved in a serious human rights offense. In the second category are<br />defendants who concealed having participated in a serious human rights offense.<br />The amendment adds a new specific offense characteristic to &#167;2L2.2 at subsection (b)(4)<br />that contains two subparagraphs. Subparagraph (A) applies if the defendant commit-<br />ted any part of the instant offense to conceal the defendant’s membership in, or au-<br />thority over, a military, paramilitary, or police organization that was involved in a<br />serious human rights offense during the period in which the defendant was such a<br />member or had such authority, and provides a 2-level increase and a minimum offense<br />level of 13. Subparagraph (B) applies if the defendant committed any part of the in-<br />stant offense to conceal the defendant’s participation in a serious human rights offense,<br />and provides a 6-level increase if the offense was incitement to genocide, or a 10-level<br />increase and minimum offense level of 25 if the offense was any other serious human<br />rights offense. The amendment also adds an application note defining the terms “seri-<br />ous human rights offense” and “the offense of incitement to genocide.”<br />The new enhancement reflects the impact that such immigration fraud offenses can<br />have on the ability of immigration and naturalization authorities to make fully in-<br />formed decisions regarding the defendant’s immigration petition, application or other<br />request and is intended to ensure that the United States is not a safe haven for those<br />who have committed serious human rights offenses.</td><td>Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2012.</td></tr><tr><td class="n">766</td><td>Amendment 766</td><td>The Commentary to &#167;4A1.2 captioned “Application Notes” is amended in<br />Note 5 by striking “counted. Such offenses are not minor traffic infractions within the<br />meaning of &#167;4A1.2(c).” and inserting “always counted, without regard to how the of-<br />fense is classified. Paragraphs (1) and (2) of &#167;4A1.2(c) do not apply.”.<br />Amendment 766<br />16 ║ Supplement to Appendix C (November 1, 2016)</td><td>REASON FOR AMENDMENT: This amendment resolves differences among circuits regard-<br />ing when prior sentences for the misdemeanor offenses of driving while intoxicated<br />and driving under the influence (and any similar offenses by whatever name they are<br />known) are counted toward the defendant’s criminal history score.<br />Convictions for driving while intoxicated and similar offenses encompass a range of<br />offense conduct. For example, convictions for driving while intoxicated and similar of-<br />fenses can be classified as anything from traffic infractions to misdemeanors and felo-<br />nies, and they are subject to a broad spectrum of penalties (ranging from a fine to years<br />in custody for habitual offenders). When the prior offense is a felony, the sentence<br />clearly counts toward the defendant’s criminal history score because “[s]entences for<br />all felony offenses are counted.” See subsection (c) of &#167;4A1.2 (Definitions and Instruc-<br />tions for Computing Criminal History). However, when the prior sentence is for a mis-<br />demeanor or petty offense, circuits have taken different approaches, in part because of<br />language added to &#167;4A1.2(c)(1). See USSG App. C, Amendment 352 (effective Novem-<br />ber 1, 1990) (adding “careless or reckless driving” to the offenses listed in &#167;4A1.2(c)(1)).<br />When the prior sentence is a misdemeanor or petty offense, &#167;4A1.2(c) specifies that the<br />offense is counted, but with two exceptions, limited to cases in which the prior offense<br />is on (or similar to an offense that is on) either of two lists. On the first list are offenses<br />from “careless or reckless driving” to “trespassing.” In such a case, the sentence is<br />counted only if (A) the sentence was a term of probation of more than one year or a<br />term of imprisonment of at least 30 days, or (B) the prior offense was similar to the<br />instant offense. See &#167;4A1.2(c)(1). On the second list are offenses from “fish and game<br />violations” to “vagrancy.” In such a case, the sentence is never counted.<br />See &#167;4A1.2(c)(2).<br />Most circuits have held that driving while intoxicated convictions, including misde-<br />meanors and petty offenses, always count toward the criminal history score, without<br />exception, even if the offense met the criteria for either of the two lists. These circuits<br />have relied on Application Note 5 to &#167;4A1.2, which has provided:<br />Sentences for Driving While Intoxicated or Under the Influence.—Con-<br />victions for driving while intoxicated or under the influence (and simi-<br />lar offenses by whatever name they are known) are counted. Such of-<br />fenses are not minor traffic infractions within the meaning of<br />&#167;4A1.2(c).<br />See United States v. Pando, 545 F.3d 682, 683–85 (8th Cir. 2008) (holding that a con-<br />viction for driving while ability impaired was properly included in defendant’s criminal<br />history, and rejecting defendant’s argument that his offense was similar to careless or<br />reckless driving); United States v. Thornton, 444 F.3d 1163, 1165–67 (9th Cir. 2006)<br />(holding that driving with high blood alcohol level was properly included in defendant’s<br />criminal history, and rejecting defendant’s argument that his conviction was “similar”<br />to minor traffic infraction or public intoxication). See also United States v. LeBlanc,<br />45 F.3d 192, 195 (7th Cir. 1995) (“[A]pplication note [5] reflects the Sentencing Com-<br />mission’s conclusion ‘that driving while intoxicated offenses are of sufficient gravity to<br />merit inclusion in the defendant’s criminal history, however they might be classified<br />under state law.’ ”); United States v. Deigert, 916 F.2d 916, 918 (4th Cir. 1990) (holding<br />that defendant’s alcohol-related traffic offenses are counted under Application Note 5).<br />The Second Circuit took a different approach in United States v. Potes-Castillo,<br />638 F.3d 106 (2d Cir. 2011), holding that Application Note 5 could be read either (1) to<br />“mean that, like felonies, driving while ability impaired sentences are always counted,<br />Amendment 767<br />without possibility of exception” or (2) “as setting forth the direction that driving while<br />ability impaired sentences must not be treated as minor traffic infractions or local or-<br />dinance violations and excluded under section 4A1.2(c)(2).” Id. at 110–11. The Second<br />Circuit adopted the second reading and, accordingly, held that a prior sentence for<br />driving while ability impaired “should be treated like any other misdemeanor or petty<br />offense, except that they cannot be exempted under section 4A1.2(c)(2).” Id. at 113.<br />According to the Second Circuit, such a sentence can qualify for an exception, and<br />therefore not be counted, under the first list (e.g., if it was similar to “careless or reck-<br />less driving” and the other criteria for a first-list exception were met).<br />The amendment resolves the issue by amending Application Note 5 to clarify that con-<br />victions for driving while intoxicated and similar offenses are always counted, without<br />regard to how the offenses are classified. Further, the amendment states plainly that<br />paragraphs (1) and (2) of &#167;4A1.2(c) do not apply.<br />This amendment reflects the Commission’s view that convictions for driving while in-<br />toxicated and other similar offenses are sufficiently serious to always count toward a<br />defendant’s criminal history score. The amendment clarifies the Commission’s intent<br />and should result in more consistent calculation of criminal history scores among the<br />circuits.</td><td>Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2012.</td></tr><tr><td class="n">767</td><td>Amendment 767</td><td>Section 5G1.2 is amended in subsection (b) by striking “Except as other-<br />wise required by law (see &#167;5G1.1(a), (b)), the sentence imposed on each other count<br />shall be the total punishment as determined in accordance with Part D of Chapter<br />Three, and Part C of this Chapter.” and inserting “For all counts not covered by sub-<br />section (a), the court shall determine the total punishment and shall impose that total<br />punishment on each such count, except to the extent otherwise required by law.”.<br />The Commentary to &#167;5G1.2 captioned “Application Notes” is amended in Note 1, in the<br />first paragraph, by inserting before the period at the end of the first sentence the fol-<br />lowing: “and determining the defendant’s guideline range on the Sentencing Table in<br />Chapter Five, Part A (Sentencing Table)”; and<br />after the first paragraph, by inserting the following new paragraph:<br />“Note that the defendant’s guideline range on the Sentencing Table may be affected or<br />restricted by a statutorily authorized maximum sentence or a statutorily required min-<br />imum sentence not only in a single-count case, see &#167;5G1.1 (Sentencing on a Single<br />Count of Conviction), but also in a multiple-count case.

Application of Subsection (b).—<br />(A) In General.—Subsection (b) provides that, for all counts not covered by<br />subsection (a), the court shall determine the total punishment (i.e., the<br />combined length of the sentences to be imposed) and shall impose that<br />total punishment on each such count, except to the extent otherwise<br />Amendment 767<br />18 ║ Supplement to Appendix C (November 1, 2016)<br />required by law (such as where a statutorily required minimum sen-<br />tence or a statutorily authorized maximum sentence otherwise re-<br />quires).<br />(B) Effect on Guidelines Range of Mandatory Minimum or Statutory Max-<br />imum.—The defendant’s guideline range on the Sentencing Table may<br />be affected or restricted by a statutorily authorized maximum sentence<br />or a statutorily required minimum sentence not only in a single-count<br />case, see &#167;5G1.1, but also in a multiple-count case.<br />In particular, where a statutorily required minimum sentence on any<br />count is greater than the maximum of the applicable guideline range,<br />the statutorily required minimum sentence on that count shall be the<br />guideline sentence on all counts. See &#167;5G1.1(b). Similarly, where a<br />statutorily required minimum sentence on any count is greater than<br />the minimum of the applicable guideline range, the guideline range for<br />all counts is restricted by that statutorily required minimum sentence.<br />See &#167;5G1.1(c)(2) and accompanying Commentary.<br />However, where a statutorily authorized maximum sentence on a par-<br />ticular count is less than the minimum of the applicable guideline<br />range, the sentence imposed on that count shall not be greater than<br />the statutorily authorized maximum sentence on that count.<br />See &#167;5G1.1(a).<br />(C) Examples.—The following examples illustrate how subsection (b) ap-<br />plies, and how the restrictions in subparagraph (B) operate, when a<br />statutorily required minimum sentence is involved.<br />Defendant A and Defendant B are each convicted of the same four<br />counts. Counts 1, 3, and 4 have statutory maximums of 10 years,<br />20 years, and 2 years, respectively. Count 2 has a statutory maximum<br />of 30 years and a mandatory minimum of 10 years.<br />For Defendant A, the court determines that the final offense level is 19<br />and the defendant is in Criminal History Category I, which yields a<br />guideline range on the Sentencing Table of 30 to 37 months. Because<br />of the 10-year mandatory minimum on Count 2, however, Defendant<br />A’s guideline sentence is 120 months. See subparagraph (B), above. Af-<br />ter considering that guideline sentence, the court determines that the<br />appropriate ‘total punishment’ to be imposed on Defendant A is<br />120 months. Therefore, subsection (b) requires that the total punish-<br />ment of 120 months be imposed on each of Counts 1, 2, and 3. The sen-<br />tence imposed on Count 4 is limited to 24 months, because a statutory<br />maximum of 2 years applies to that particular count.<br />For Defendant B, in contrast, the court determines that the final of-<br />fense level is 30 and the defendant is in Criminal History Category II,<br />which yields a guideline range on the Sentencing Table of 108 to<br />135 months. Because of the 10-year mandatory minimum on Count 2,<br />however, Defendant B’s guideline range is restricted to 120 to<br />135 months. See subparagraph (B), above. After considering that re-<br />stricted guideline range, the court determines that the appropriate ‘to-<br />Amendment 767<br />tal punishment’ to be imposed on Defendant B is 130 months. There-<br />fore, subsection (b) requires that the total punishment of 130 months<br />be imposed on each of Counts 2 and 3. The sentences imposed on<br />Counts 1 and 4 are limited to 120 months (10 years) and 24 months<br />(2 years), respectively, because of the applicable statutory maximums.<br />(D) Special Rule on Resentencing.—In a case in which (i) the defendant’s<br />guideline range on the Sentencing Table was affected or restricted by<br />a statutorily required minimum sentence (as described in subpara-<br />graph (B)), (ii) the court is resentencing the defendant, and (iii) the<br />statutorily required minimum sentence no longer applies, the defend-<br />ant’s guideline range for purposes of the remaining counts shall be re-<br />determined without regard to the previous effect or restriction of the<br />statutorily required minimum sentence.”.</td><td>REASON FOR AMENDMENT: This amendment responds to an application issue regarding<br />the applicable guideline range in a case in which the defendant is sentenced on multi-<br />ple counts of conviction, at least one of which involves a mandatory minimum sentence<br />that is greater than the minimum of the otherwise applicable guideline range. The<br />issue arises under &#167;5G1.2 (Sentencing on Multiple Counts of Conviction) when at least<br />one count in a multiple-count case involves a mandatory minimum sentence that af-<br />fects the otherwise applicable guideline range. In such cases, circuits differ over<br />whether the guideline range is affected only for the count involving the mandatory<br />minimum or for all counts in the case.<br />The Fifth Circuit has held that, in such a case, the effect on the guideline range applies<br />to all counts in the case. See United States v. Salter, 241 F.3d 392, 395–96 (5th Cir.<br />2001). In that case, the guideline range on the Sentencing Table was 87 to 108 months,<br />but one of the three counts carried a mandatory minimum sentence of 10 years<br />(120 months), which resulted in a guideline sentence of 120 months. The Fifth Circuit<br />instructed the district court that the appropriate guideline sentence was 120 months<br />on each of the three counts.<br />The Ninth Circuit took a different approach in United States v. Evans-Martinez,<br />611 F.3d 635 (9th Cir. 2010), holding that, in such a case, “a mandatory minimum<br />sentence becomes the starting point for any count that carries a mandatory minimum<br />sentence higher than what would otherwise be the Guidelines sentencing range,” but<br />“[a]ll other counts . . . are sentenced based on the Guidelines sentencing range, regard-<br />less [of] the mandatory minimum sentences that apply to other counts.” See id. at 637.<br />The Ninth Circuit stated that it would be more “logical” to follow the Fifth Circuit’s<br />approach but “such logic is overcome by the precise language of the Sentencing Guide-<br />lines.” See id.<br />The District of Columbia Circuit appears to follow an approach similar to the Ninth<br />Circuit. See United States v. Kennedy, 133 F.3d 53, 60–61 (D.C. Cir. 1998) (one of two<br />counts carried a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment; district court treated life<br />imprisonment as the guidelines sentence for both counts; Court of Appeals reversed,<br />holding that the appropriate guidelines range for the other count was 262 to<br />327 months).<br />The amendment adopts the approach followed by the Fifth Circuit and makes three<br />changes to &#167;5G1.2. First, it amends &#167;5G1.2(b) to clarify that the court is to determine<br />the total punishment and impose that total punishment on each count, except to the<br />extent otherwise required by law.<br />Amendment 768<br />20 ║ Supplement to Appendix C (November 1, 2016)<br />Second, it amends the Commentary to clarify that the defendant’s guideline range in<br />a multiple-count case may be restricted by a mandatory minimum penalty or statutory<br />maximum penalty (i.e., a mandatory minimum may increase the bottom of the other-<br />wise applicable guideline range and a statutory maximum may decrease the top of the<br />otherwise applicable guideline range) in a manner similar to how the guideline range<br />in a single-count case may be restricted by a minimum or maximum penalty under<br />&#167;5G1.1 (Sentencing on a Single Count of Conviction). Specifically, it clarifies that when<br />any count involves a mandatory minimum that restricts the defendant’s guideline<br />range, the guideline range is restricted as to all counts. It also provides examples of<br />how these restrictions operate.<br />Third, it amends the commentary to clarify that in a case in which (1) a defendant’s<br />guideline range was affected or restricted by a mandatory minimum penalty, (2) the<br />court is resentencing the defendant, and (3) the mandatory minimum sentence no<br />longer applies, the court shall redetermine the defendant’s guideline range for pur-<br />poses of the remaining counts without regard to the mandatory minimum penalty.<br />These changes resolve the application issue by clarifying the manner in which the<br />Commission intended this guideline to operate, and by providing examples similar to<br />those used in training probation officers and judges. When there is only one count, the<br />guidelines provide a single guideline range, and that range may be restricted if a man-<br />datory minimum is involved, as described in &#167;5G1.1 (Sentencing on a Single Count of<br />Conviction). When there is more than one count, the guidelines also provide a single<br />guideline range, and that range also may be restricted if a mandatory minimum is<br />involved. These changes provide clarity and consistency for cases in which a manda-<br />tory minimum is present and are intended to ensure that sentencing courts resolve<br />multiple-count cases in a straightforward, logical manner, with a single guideline<br />range, a single set of findings and reasons, and a single set of departure and variance<br />considerations.</td><td>Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2012.</td></tr><tr><td class="n">768</td><td>Amendment 768</td><td>Chapter Five, Part K, Subpart 2 is amended by striking &#167;5K2.19 and its<br />accompanying commentary as follows:<br />“&#167;5K2.19. Post-Sentencing Rehabilitative Efforts (Policy Statement)<br />Post-sentencing rehabilitative efforts, even if exceptional, undertaken<br />by a defendant after imposition of a term of imprisonment for the in-<br />stant offense are not an appropriate basis for a downward departure<br />when resentencing the defendant for that offense. (Such efforts may<br />provide a basis for early termination of supervised release under<br />18 U.S.C. &#167; 3583(e)(1).)<br />Commentary<br />Background: The Commission has determined that post-sentencing rehabilitative<br />measures should not provide a basis for downward departure when resentencing a de-<br />fendant initially sentenced to a term of imprisonment because such a departure would<br />Amendment 769<br />(1) be inconsistent with the policies established by Congress under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3624(b)<br />and other statutory provisions for reducing the time to be served by an imprisoned<br />person; and (2) inequitably benefit only those who gain the opportunity to be resen-<br />tenced de novo.”.</td><td>REASON FOR AMENDMENT: The Commission’s policy statement at &#167;5K2.19 (Post-Sen-<br />tencing Rehabilitative Efforts) (Policy Statement) prohibits the consideration of post-<br />sentencing rehabilitative efforts as a basis for downward departure when resentencing<br />a defendant. Section 5K2.19 was promulgated in 2000 in response to a circuit conflict<br />regarding whether sentencing courts may consider such rehabilitative efforts while in<br />prison or on probation as a basis for downward departure at resentencing following an<br />appeal. See USSG App. C, Amendment 602 (effective November 1, 2000). This amend-<br />ment repeals &#167;5K2.19. The amendment responds to the Supreme Court’s decision in<br />Pepper v. United States, 131 S. Ct. 1229 (2011), which, in part relying on 18 U.S.C.<br />&#167; 3661, held among other things that “when a defendant’s sentence has been set aside<br />on appeal, a district court at resentencing may consider evidence of the defendant’s<br />postsentencing rehabilitation.” The amendment repeals the policy statement in light<br />of the Pepper decision.</td><td>Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2012.</td></tr><tr><td class="n">769</td><td>Amendment 769</td><td>Section 2P1.2 is amended in subsection (a)(3) by inserting after “cur-<br />rency,” the following: “a mobile phone or similar device,”.<br />The Commentary to &#167;2P1.2 captioned “Application Notes” is amended by redesignating<br />Notes 1 and 2 as Notes 2 and 3, respectively, and by inserting at the beginning the<br />following:<br />“1.

L.<br />111–225 (enacted August 10, 2010), which amended 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1791 (Providing or<br />possessing contraband in prison) to make it a class A misdemeanor to provide a mobile<br />phone or similar device to an inmate, or for an inmate to possess a mobile phone or<br />similar device. Offenses under section 1791 are referenced in Appendix A (Statutory<br />Index) to &#167;2P1.2 (Providing or Possessing Contraband in Prison). The penalty struc-<br />ture of section 1791 is based on the type of contraband involved, and the other class A<br />misdemeanors in section 1791 receive a base offense level of 6 in &#167;2P1.2. Under the<br />amendment, the class A misdemeanor in section 1791 that applies when the contra-<br />band is a cell phone will also receive a base offense level of 6 in &#167;2P1.2. This change<br />maintains the relationship between the penalty structures of the statute and the<br />guideline.<br />Prevent All Cigarette Trafficking Act of 2009<br />Second, the amendment responds to the Prevent All Cigarette Trafficking Act of 2009<br />(PACT Act), Pub. L. 111–154 (enacted March 31, 2010). The PACT Act made a series<br />of revisions to the Jenkins Act, 15 U.S.C. &#167; 375 et seq., which is one of several laws<br />governing the sale, shipment and taxation of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco.<br />The PACT Act raised the criminal penalty at 15 U.S.C. &#167; 377 for a knowing violation<br />of the Jenkins Act from a misdemeanor to a felony with a statutory maximum term of<br />imprisonment of 3 years. The amendment amends Appendix A (Statutory Index) to<br />reference section 377 offenses to &#167;2T2.1 (Non-Payment of Taxes) and &#167;2T2.2 (Regula-<br />tory Offenses). These two guidelines are the most analogous guidelines for a sec-<br />tion 377 offense because the offense may involve either non-payment of taxes or regu-<br />latory offenses. Accordingly, the amendment also amends the Commentary to &#167;&#167;2T2.1<br />Amendment 769<br />and 2T2.2 to add section 377 to their lists of statutory provisions. These lists indicate<br />that &#167;2T2.1 applies if the conduct constitutes non-payment, evasion, or attempted eva-<br />sion of taxes, and &#167;2T2.2 applies if the conduct is tantamount to a record-keeping vio-<br />lation rather than an effort to evade payment of taxes.<br />The PACT Act also created a new class A misdemeanor at 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1716E, prohib-<br />iting the knowing shipment of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco through the United<br />States mail. The amendment amends Appendix A (Statutory Index) to reference sec-<br />tion 1716E offenses to &#167;2T2.2. Section 2T2.2 is the most analogous guideline because<br />offenses under section 1716E are regulatory offenses.<br />Animal Crush Video Prohibition Act of 2010<br />Third, the amendment responds to the Animal Crush Video Prohibition Act of 2010,<br />Pub. L. 111–294 (enacted December 9, 2010), which substantially revised the criminal<br />offense at 18 U.S.C. &#167; 48 (Animal crush videos). Section 48 makes it a crime to create<br />or distribute an “animal crush video,” which is defined by the statute in a manner that<br />requires, among other things, that the depiction be obscene. The maximum term of<br />imprisonment for a section 48 offense is 7 years. The amendment amends Appendix A<br />(Statutory Index) to reference section 48 offenses to &#167;2G3.1 (Importing, Mailing, or<br />Transporting Obscene Matter; Transferring Obscene Matter to a Minor; Misleading<br />Domain Names). Section 2G3.1 is the most analogous guideline because obscenity is<br />an element of section 48 offenses.<br />Indian Arts and Crafts Amendments Act of 2010<br />Fourth, the amendment responds to the Indian Arts and Crafts Amendments Act of<br />2010, Pub. L. 111–211 (enacted July 29, 2010), which amended the criminal offense at<br />18 U.S.C. &#167; 1159 (Misrepresentation of Indian produced goods and services) to reduce<br />penalties for first offenders when the value of the goods involved is less than $1,000.<br />The maximum term of imprisonment under section 1159 had been 5 years for a first<br />offender and 15 years for a repeat offender. The Act retained this penalty structure,<br />except that the statutory maximum term of imprisonment for a first offender was re-<br />duced to 1 year in a case in which the value of the goods involved is less than $1,000.<br />The amendment amends Appendix A (Statutory Index) to reference section 1159 of-<br />fenses to &#167;2B1.1 (Theft, Property Destruction, and Fraud). Section 2B1.1 is the most<br />analogous guideline because an offense under section 1159 has elements of fraud and<br />deceit.<br />The amendment also addresses an existing offense, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1158 (Counterfeiting<br />Indian Arts and Crafts Board trade mark), which makes it a crime to counterfeit or<br />unlawfully affix a Government trademark used or devised by the Indian Arts and<br />Crafts Board or to make any false statement for the purpose of obtaining the use of<br />any such mark. The maximum term of imprisonment under section 1158 is 5 years for<br />a first offender and 15 years for a repeat offender. The amendment amends Appendix A<br />(Statutory Index) to reference section 1158 offenses to both &#167;&#167;2B1.1 and 2B5.3 (Crim-<br />inal Infringement of Copyright or Trademark). These two guidelines are the most anal-<br />ogous guidelines because an offense under section 1158 contains alternative sets of<br />elements, one of which involves trademark infringement and one of which involves<br />false statements.<br />Amendment 770<br />24 ║ Supplement to Appendix C (November 1, 2016)<br />Public Contracting Offenses<br />Finally, the amendment responds to Public Law 111–350 (enacted January 4, 2011),<br />which enacted certain laws relating to public contracts as a new positive-law title of<br />the Code — title 41, “Public Contracts.” As part of this codification, two criminal of-<br />fenses, 41 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 53 and 423(a)–(b), and their respective penalty provisions,<br />41 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 54 and 423(e), were given new title 41 section numbers: sections 8702 and<br />8707 for sections 53 and 54, respectively, and sections 2102 and 2105 for sec-<br />tions 423(a)–(b) and 423(e), respectively. The substantive offenses and their related<br />penalties did not change.

In General.—This section specifies the procedure for determining the specific<br />sentence to be formally imposed on each count in a multiple-count case. The<br />combined length of the sentences (‘total punishment’) is determined by the<br />court after determining the adjusted combined offense level and the Criminal<br />History Category and determining the defendant’s guideline range on the Sen-<br />tencing Table in Chapter Five, Part A (Sentencing Table).<br />Note that the defendant’s guideline range on the Sentencing Table may be af-<br />fected or restricted by a statutorily authorized maximum sentence or a statu-<br />torily required minimum sentence not only in a single-count case, see &#167;5G1.1<br />(Sentencing on a Single Count of Conviction), but also in a multiple-count case.<br />See Note 3, below.<br />Except as otherwise required by subsection (e) or any other law, the total pun-<br />ishment is to be imposed on each count and the sentences on all counts are to<br />be imposed to run concurrently to the extent allowed by the statutory maxi-<br />mum sentence of imprisonment for each count of conviction.<br />This section applies to multiple counts of conviction (A) contained in the same<br />indictment or information, or (B) contained in different indictments or infor-<br />mations for which sentences are to be imposed at the same time or in a consol-<br />idated proceeding.<br />Usually, at least one of the counts will have a statutory maximum adequate to<br />permit imposition of the total punishment as the sentence on that count. The<br />sentence on each of the other counts will then be set at the lesser of the total<br />punishment and the applicable statutory maximum, and be made to run con-<br />currently with all or part of the longest sentence. If no count carries an ade-<br />quate statutory maximum, consecutive sentences are to be imposed to the ex-<br />tent necessary to achieve the total punishment.”.<br />Section 5K2.0 is amended in subsection (d)(1) by striking “the last sentence of 5K2.12<br />(Coercion and Duress), and 5K2.19 (Post-Sentencing Rehabilitative Efforts)” and in-<br />serting “and the last sentence of 5K2.12 (Coercion and Duress)”.<br />Amendment 771</td><td>REASON FOR AMENDMENT: This amendment makes certain technical and conforming<br />changes to commentary in the Guidelines Manual.<br />First, it reorganizes the commentary to the drug trafficking guideline, &#167;2D1.1 (Unlaw-<br />ful Manufacturing, Importing, Exporting, or Trafficking (Including Possession with In-<br />tent to Commit These Offenses); Attempt or Conspiracy), so that the order of the ap-<br />plication notes better reflects the order of the guidelines provisions to which they re-<br />late. The amendment also makes stylistic changes to the Commentary to &#167;2D1.1, such<br />as by adding headings to certain application notes. To reflect the renumbering of ap-<br />plication notes in &#167;2D1.1, conforming changes are also made to the Commentary to<br />&#167;1B1.10 and &#167;2D1.6.<br />Second, it makes certain clerical and stylistic changes in connection with certain re-<br />cently promulgated amendments. See 77 Fed. Reg. 28226 (May 11, 2012). The clerical<br />and stylistic changes are as follows:<br />(1) Amendment 763 made revisions to &#167;2D1.11 (Unlawfully Distributing, Import-<br />ing, Exporting or Possessing a Listed Chemical; Attempt or Conspiracy). This<br />amendment reorganizes the commentary to &#167;2D1.11 so that the order of the<br />application notes better reflects the order of the guidelines provisions to which<br />they relate. The amendment also makes stylistic changes to the Commentary<br />to &#167;2D1.11 by adding headings to certain application notes.<br />(2) Amendment 767 made revisions to &#167;5G1.2 (Sentencing on Multiple Counts of<br />Conviction), including a revision to Application Note 1. However, the amenda-<br />tory instructions published in the Federal Register to implement those revi-<br />sions included an erroneous instruction. This amendment restates Application<br />Note 1 in its entirety to ensure that it conforms with the version of Application<br />Note 1 that appears in the unofficial, “reader-friendly” version of Amendment 7<br />that the Commission made available in May 2012.<br />(3) Amendment 768 repealed the policy statement at &#167;5K2.19 (Post-Sentencing<br />Rehabilitative Efforts). However, a reference to that policy statement is con-<br />tained in &#167;5K2.0 (Grounds for Departure). This amendment revises &#167;5K2.0 to<br />reflect the repeal of &#167;5K2.19.</td><td>Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2012.</td></tr><tr><td class="n">771</td><td>Amendment 771</td><td>Section 2B1.1(b) is amended by striking paragraph (5) as follows:<br />“(5) If the offense involved misappropriation of a trade secret and the defendant<br />knew or intended that the offense would benefit a foreign government, foreign<br />instrumentality, or foreign agent, increase by 2 levels.”;<br />by renumbering paragraphs (6) through (8) as (5) through (7); by renumbering para-<br />graphs (13) through (18) as (14) through (19); by inserting after paragraph (12) the<br />following:<br />Amendment 771<br />30 ║ Supplement to Appendix C (November 1, 2016)<br />“(13) (Apply the greater) If the offense involved misappropriation of a trade secret<br />and the defendant knew or intended—<br />(A) that the trade secret would be transported or transmitted out of the<br />United States, increase by 2 levels; or<br />(B) that the offense would benefit a foreign government, foreign instru-<br />mentality, or foreign agent, increase by 4 levels.<br />If subparagraph (B) applies and the resulting offense level is less than level 14,<br />increase to level 14.”; and<br />in paragraph (16) (as so renumbered) by striking “(b)(15)(B)” and inserting “(b)(16)(B)”.<br />The Commentary to &#167;2B1.1 captioned “Application Notes” is amended in Note 6 by<br />striking “(b)(7)” both places it appears and inserting “(b)(6)”; in Note 10 by striking<br />“(b)(13)” both places it appears and inserting “(b)(14)”; in Note 11 by striking<br />“(b)(15)(A)” both places it appears and inserting “(b)(16)(A)”; in Note 12 by striking<br />“(b)(15)(B)” and inserting “(b)(16)(B)”; in Note 12(A) by striking “(b)(15)(B)(i)” and in-<br />serting “(b)(16)(B)(i)”; in Note 12(B) by striking “(b)(15)(B)(ii)” and inserting<br />“(b)(16)(B)(ii)”; in Note 13 by striking “(b)(17)” both places it appears and inserting<br />“(b)(18)”; in Note 13(B) by striking “(b)(17)(A)(iii)” both places it appears and inserting<br />“(b)(18)(A)(iii)”, and by striking “(b)(15)(B)” both places it appears and inserting<br />“(b)(16)(B)”; in Note 14 by striking “(b)(18)” each place it appears and inserting<br />“(b)(19)”; and in Note 19(B) by striking “(b)(17)(A)(iii)” and inserting “(b)(18)(A)(iii)”.<br />The Commentary to &#167;2B1.1 captioned “Background” is amended by striking “(b)(6)”,<br />“(b)(8)”, “(b)(14)(B)”, “(b)(15)(A)”, “(b)(15)(B)(i)”, “(b)(16)”, “(b)(17)”, and “(b)(17)(B)” and<br />inserting “(b)(5)”, “(b)(7)”, “(b)(15)(B)”, “(b)(16)(A)”, “(b)(16)(B)(i)”, “(b)(17)”, “(b)(18)”,<br />and “(b)(18)(B)”, respectively; and by inserting before the paragraph that begins “Sub-<br />section (b)(15)(B)” (as so amended) the following:<br />“ Subsection (b)(13) implements the directive in section 3 of Public<br />Law 112–269.”.</td><td>REASON FOR AMENDMENT: This amendment responds to section 3 of the Foreign and<br />Economic Espionage Penalty Enhancement Act of 2012, Pub. L. 112–269 (enacted Jan-<br />uary 14, 2013), which contains a directive to the Commission regarding offenses in-<br />volving stolen trade secrets or economic espionage.<br />Section 3(a) of the Act directs the Commission to “review and, if appropriate, amend”<br />the guidelines “applicable to persons convicted of offenses relating to the transmission<br />or attempted transmission of a stolen trade secret outside of the United States or eco-<br />nomic espionage, in order to reflect the intent of Congress that penalties for such of-<br />fenses under the Federal sentencing guidelines and policy statements appropriately<br />reflect the seriousness of these offenses, account for the potential and actual harm<br />caused by these offenses, and provide adequate deterrence against such offenses.” Sec-<br />tion 3(b) of the Act states that, in carrying out the directive, the Commission shall<br />consider, among other things, whether the guidelines adequately address the simple<br />misappropriation of a trade secret; the transmission or attempted transmission of a<br />stolen trade secret outside of the United States; and the transmission or attempted<br />transmission of a stolen trade secret outside of the United States that is committed or<br />attempted to be committed for the benefit of a foreign government, foreign instrumen-<br />tality, or foreign agent.<br />Amendment 771<br />The offenses described in the directive may be prosecuted under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1831 (Eco-<br />nomic espionage), which requires that the defendant specifically intend or know that<br />the offense “will benefit any foreign government, foreign instrumentality, or foreign<br />agent,” and 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1832 (Theft of trade secrets), which does not require such spe-<br />cific intent or knowledge. The statutory maximum terms of imprisonment are 15 years<br />for a section 1831 offense and 10 years for a section 1832 offense. Both offenses are<br />referenced in Appendix A (Statutory Index) to &#167;2B1.1 (Theft, Property Destruction,<br />and Fraud).<br />In response to the directive, the amendment revises the existing specific offense char-<br />acteristic at &#167;2B1.1(b)(5), which provides an enhancement of two levels “[i]f the offense<br />involved misappropriation of a trade secret and the defendant knew or intended that<br />the offense would benefit a foreign government, foreign instrumentality, or foreign<br />agent,” in two ways. First, it broadens the scope of the enhancement to provide a 2-<br />level increase for trade secret offenses in which the defendant knew or intended that<br />the trade secret would be transported or transmitted out of the United States. Second,<br />it increases the severity of the enhancement to provide a 4-level enhancement and a<br />minimum offense level of 14 for trade secret offenses in which the defendant knew or<br />intended that the offense would benefit a foreign government, foreign instrumentality,<br />or foreign agent. The enhancement also is redesignated as subsection (b)(13).<br />In responding to the directive, the Commission consulted with individuals or groups<br />representing law enforcement, owners of trade secrets, victims of economic espionage<br />offenses, the United States Department of Justice, the United States Department of<br />Homeland Security, the United States Department of State, the Office of the United<br />States Trade Representative, the Federal Public and Community Defenders, and<br />standing advisory groups, among others. The Commission also considered relevant<br />data and literature.<br />The Commission received public comment and testimony that the transmission of sto-<br />len trade secrets outside of the United States creates significant obstacles to effective<br />investigation and prosecution and causes both increased harm to victims and more<br />general harms to the nation. With respect to the victim, civil remedies may not be<br />readily available or effective, and the transmission of a stolen trade secret outside of<br />the United States substantially increases the risk that the trade secret will be ex-<br />ploited by a foreign competitor. In contrast, the simple movement of a stolen trade<br />secret within a domestic multinational company (e.g., from a United States office to an<br />overseas office of the same company) may not pose the same risks or harms. More<br />generally, the Commission heard that foreign actors increasingly target United States<br />companies for trade secret theft and that such offenses pose a growing threat to the<br />nation’s global competitiveness, economic growth, and national security. Accordingly,<br />the Commission determined that a 2-level enhancement is warranted for cases in<br />which the defendant knew or intended that a stolen trade secret would be transported<br />or transmitted outside of the United States.<br />The Commission also received public comment and testimony that cases involving eco-<br />nomic espionage (i.e., trade secret offenses that benefit foreign governments or entities<br />under the substantial control of foreign governments) are particularly serious. In such<br />cases, the United States is unlikely to obtain a foreign government’s cooperation when<br />seeking relief for the victim, and offenders backed by a foreign government likely will<br />have significant financial resources to combat civil remedies. In addition, a foreign<br />government’s involvement increases the threat to the nation’s economic and national<br />security. Accordingly, the Commission determined that the existing enhancement for<br />Amendment 772<br />32 ║ Supplement to Appendix C (November 1, 2016)<br />economic espionage should be increased from 2 to 4 levels and that such offenses<br />should be subject to a minimum offense level of 14. This heightened enhancement is<br />consistent with the higher statutory maximum penalties and fines applicable to such<br />offenses and the Commission’s established treatment of economic espionage as a more<br />serious form of trade secret theft.<br />Consistent with the directive, the Commission also considered whether the guidelines<br />appropriately account for the simple misappropriation of a trade secret. The Commis-<br />sion determined that such offenses are adequately accounted for by existing provisions<br />in the Guidelines Manual, such as the loss table in &#167;2B1.1(b)(1), the sophisticated<br />means enhancement at &#167;2B1.1(b)(10), and the adjustment for abuse of position of trust<br />or use of special skill at &#167;3B1.3.</td><td>Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2013.</td></tr><tr><td class="n">772</td><td>Amendment 772</td><td>Section 2B1.1 is amended by inserting before paragraph (9) the following<br />new paragraph:<br />“(8) (Apply the greater) If—<br />(A) the offense involved conduct described in 18 U.S.C. &#167; 670, increase by<br />2 levels; or<br />(B) the offense involved conduct described in 18 U.S.C. &#167; 670, and the de-<br />fendant was employed by, or was an agent of, an organization in the<br />supply chain for the pre-retail medical product, increase by 4 levels.”;<br />The Commentary to &#167;2B1.1 captioned “Application Notes” is amended in Note 1 by<br />inserting after the paragraph that begins “ ‘Personal information’ means” the follow-<br />ing:<br />“ ‘Pre-retail medical product’ has the meaning given that term in 18 U.S.C. &#167; 670(e).”;<br />and by inserting after the paragraph that begins “ ‘Publicly traded company’ means”<br />the following:<br />“ ‘Supply chain’ has the meaning given that term in 18 U.S.C. &#167; 670(e).”;<br />in Note 3(F)(i) by striking “Note 9(A)” and inserting “Note 10(A)”; and<br />by renumbering Notes 7 through 19 as 8 through 20; by inserting after Note 6 the<br />following:<br />“7. Application of Subsection (b)(8)(B).—If subsection (b)(8)(B) applies, do not ap-<br />ply an adjustment under &#167;3B1.3 (Abuse of Position of Trust or Use of Special<br />Skill).”; and<br />in Note 20 (as so renumbered) by adding at the end of subparagraph (A)(ii) as the last<br />sentence the following: “Similarly, an upward departure would be warranted in a case<br />involving conduct described in 18 U.S.C. &#167; 670 if the offense resulted in serious bodily<br />Amendment 772<br />injury or death, including serious bodily injury or death resulting from the use of the<br />pre-retail medical product.”.<br />The Commentary to &#167;2B1.1 captioned “Background” is amended by inserting before<br />the paragraph that begins “Subsection (b)(9)(D)” the following:<br />“ Subsection (b)(8) implements the directive to the Commission in section 7 of<br />Public Law 112–186.”.<br />However, if &#167;2B1.1(b) already contains a paragraph (8) because the renumbering of<br />paragraphs by Amendment 771 has not taken effect, renumber the new paragraph<br />inserted into &#167;2B1.1(b) as paragraph (8A) rather than paragraph (8), and revise the<br />Commentary so that the new Note 7 inserted into the Application Notes and the new<br />paragraph inserted into the Background refer to subsection (b)(8A) rather than sub-<br />section (b)(8).<br />Appendix A (Statutory Index) is amended by inserting after the line referenced to<br />18 U.S.C. &#167; 669 the following:<br />“18 U.S.C. &#167; 670 2B1.1”.</td><td>REASON FOR AMENDMENT: This amendment responds to the Strengthening and Focus-<br />ing Enforcement to Deter Organized Stealing and Enhance Safety Act of 2012, Pub.<br />L. 112–186 (enacted October 5, 2012) (the “Act”), which addressed various offenses in-<br />volving “pre-retail medical products,” defined as “a medical product that has not yet<br />been made available for retail purchase by a consumer.” The Act created a new crimi-<br />nal offense at 18 U.S.C. &#167; 670 for theft of pre-retail medical products, increased statu-<br />tory penalties for certain related offenses when a pre-retail medical product is in-<br />volved, and contained a directive to the Commission.<br />New Offense at 18 U.S.C. &#167; 670<br />The new offense at section 670 makes it unlawful for any person in (or using any means<br />or facility of) interstate or foreign commerce to—<br />(1) embezzle, steal, or by fraud or deception obtain, or<br />knowingly and unlawfully take, carry away, or conceal<br />a pre-retail medical product;<br />(2) knowingly and falsely make, alter, forge, or counterfeit<br />the labeling or documentation (including documenta-<br />tion relating to origination or shipping) of a pre-retail<br />medical product;<br />(3) knowingly possess, transport, or traffic in a pre-retail<br />medical product that was involved in a violation of par-<br />agraph (1) or (2);<br />(4) with intent to defraud, buy, or otherwise obtain, a<br />pre-retail medical product that has expired or been sto-<br />len;<br />(5) with intent to defraud, sell, or distribute, a pre-retail<br />medical product that is expired or stolen; or<br />Amendment 772<br />34 ║ Supplement to Appendix C (November 1, 2016)<br />(6) attempt or conspire to violate any of paragraphs (1)<br />through (5).<br />The offense generally carries a statutory maximum term of imprisonment of three<br />years. If the offense is an “aggravated offense,” however, higher statutory maximum<br />terms of imprisonment are provided. The offense is an “aggravated offense” if—<br />(1) the defendant is employed by, or is an agent of, an or-<br />ganization in the supply chain for the pre-retail medi-<br />cal product; or<br />(2) the violation—<br />(A) involves the use of violence, force, or a threat of<br />violence or force;<br />(B) involves the use of a deadly weapon;<br />(C) results in serious bodily injury or death, includ-<br />ing serious bodily injury or death resulting<br />from the use of the medical product involved; or<br />(D) is subsequent to a prior conviction for an of-<br />fense under section 670.<br />Specifically, the higher statutory maximum terms of imprisonment are:<br />(1) Five years, if—<br />(A) the defendant is employed by, or is an agent of,<br />an organization in the supply chain for the pre-<br />retail medical product; or<br />(B) the violation (i) involves the use of violence,<br />force, or a threat of violence or force, (ii) in-<br />volves the use of a deadly weapon, or (iii) is sub-<br />sequent to a prior conviction for an offense un-<br />der section 670.<br />(2) 15 years, if the value of the medical products involved<br />in the offense is $5,000 or greater.<br />(3) 20 years, if both (1) and (2) apply.<br />(4) 30 years, if the offense results in serious bodily injury<br />or death, including serious bodily injury or death re-<br />sulting from the use of the medical product involved.<br />The amendment amends Appendix A (Statutory Index) to reference the new offense at<br />18 U.S.C. &#167; 670 to &#167;2B1.1 (Theft, Property Destruction, and Fraud). The Commission<br />concluded that &#167;2B1.1 is the appropriate guideline because the elements of the new<br />offense include theft or fraud.<br />Response to Directive<br />Section 7 of the Act directs the Commission to “review and, if appropriate, amend” the<br />federal sentencing guidelines and policy statements applicable to the new offense and<br />the related offenses “to reflect the intent of Congress that penalties for such offenses<br />Amendment 772<br />be sufficient to deter and punish such offenses, and appropriately account for the ac-<br />tual harm to the public from these offenses.” The amendment amends &#167;2B1.1 to ad-<br />dress offenses involving pre-retail medical products in two ways.<br />First, the amendment adds a new specific offense characteristic at &#167;2B1.1(b)(8) that<br />provides a two-pronged enhancement with an instruction to apply the greater.<br />Prong (A) provides a 2-level enhancement if the offense involved conduct described in<br />18 U.S.C. &#167; 670. Prong (B) provides a 4-level enhancement if the offense involved con-<br />duct described in 18 U.S.C. &#167; 670 and the defendant was employed by, or an agent of,<br />an organization in the supply chain for the pre-retail product. Accompanying this new<br />specific offense characteristic is new Commentary providing that, if prong (B) applies,<br />“do not apply an adjustment under &#167;3B1.3 (Abuse of Position of Trust or Use of Special<br />Skill).”<br />Based on public comment, testimony and sentencing data, the Commission concluded<br />that an enhancement differentiating fraud and theft offenses involving medical prod-<br />ucts from those involving other products is warranted by the additional risk such of-<br />fenses pose to public health and safety. In addition, such offenses undermine the pub-<br />lic’s confidence in the medical regulatory and distribution system. The Commission<br />also concluded that the risks and harms it identified would be present in any theft or<br />fraud offense involving a pre-retail medical product, regardless of the offense of con-<br />viction. Therefore application of the new specific offense characteristic is not limited to<br />offenses charged under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 670.<br />The amendment provides a 4-level enhancement for defendants who commit such of-<br />fenses while employed in the supply chain for the pre-retail medical product. Such<br />defendants are subject to an increased statutory maximum and the Commission deter-<br />mined that a heightened enhancement should apply to reflect the likelihood that the<br />defendant’s position in the supply chain facilitated the commission or concealment of<br />the offense. Defendants who receive the 4-level enhancement are not subject to the<br />adjustment at &#167;3B1.3 because the new enhancement adequately accounts for the con-<br />cerns covered by &#167;3B1.3. The Commission determined that existing specific offense<br />characteristics generally account for other aggravating factors included in the Act,<br />such as loss, use or threat of force, risk of death or serious bodily injury, and weapon<br />involvement, and therefore additional new specific offense characteristics are not nec-<br />essary. See, e.g., &#167;&#167;2B1.1(b)(1), (b)(3), and (b)(15) (as redesignated by the amendment).<br />Second, it amends the upward departure provisions in the Commentary to &#167;2B1.1 at<br />Application Note 19(A) to provide — as an example of a case in which an upward de-<br />parture would be warranted — a case “involving conduct described in 18 U.S.C. &#167; 670<br />if the offense resulted in serious bodily injury or death, including serious bodily injury<br />or death resulting from the use of the pre-retail medical product.” Public comment and<br />testimony indicated that &#167;2B1.1 may not adequately account for the harm created by<br />theft or fraud offenses involving pre-retail medical products when such serious bodily<br />injury or death actually occurs as a result of the offense. For example, some pre-retail<br />medical products are stolen as part of a scheme to re-sell them into the supply chain,<br />but if the products have not been properly stored in the interim, their subsequent use<br />can seriously injure the individual consumers who buy and use them. Thus, the amend-<br />ment expands the scope of the existing upward departure provision to address such<br />harms and to clarify that an upward departure is appropriate in such cases not only if<br />serious bodily injury or death occurred during the theft or fraud, but also if such seri-<br />ous bodily injury or death resulted from the victim’s use of a pre-retail medical product<br />that had previously been obtained by theft or fraud.<br />Amendment 773<br />36 ║ Supplement to Appendix C (November 1, 2016)<br />Finally, the amendment amends the Commentary to &#167;2B1.1 to provide relevant defi-<br />nitions and make other conforming changes.</td><td>Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2013.</td></tr><tr><td class="n">773</td><td>Amendment 773</td><td>Section 2B5.3(b) is amended by renumbering paragraph (5) as (6); by<br />inserting after paragraph (4) the following:<br />“(5) If the offense involved a counterfeit drug, increase by 2 levels.”; and<br />by inserting after paragraph (6) (as so renumbered) the following:<br />“(7) If the offense involved a counterfeit military good or service the use, malfunc-<br />tion, or failure of which is likely to cause (A) the disclosure of classified infor-<br />mation; (B) impairment of combat operations; or (C) other significant harm to<br />(i) a combat operation, (ii) a member of the Armed Forces, or (iii) national se-<br />curity, increase by 2 levels. If the resulting offense level is less than level 14,<br />increase to level 14.”.<br />The Commentary to &#167;2B5.3 captioned “Application Notes” is amended in Note 1 by<br />inserting after the paragraph that begins “ ‘Commercial advantage” the following:<br />“ ‘Counterfeit drug’ has the meaning given that term in 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2320(f)(6).<br />“ ‘Counterfeit military good or service’ has the meaning given that term in 18 U.S.C.<br />&#167; 2320(f)(4).”;<br />by renumbering Notes 3 and 4 as 4 and 5; by inserting after Note 2 the following:<br />“3.

In a case in which the offense involved a counterfeit<br />military good or service the use, malfunction, or failure of which is likely to<br />cause serious bodily injury or death, subsection (b)(6)(A) (conscious or reckless<br />risk of serious bodily injury or death) would apply.”; and<br />in Note 5 (as so renumbered) by adding at the end the following:<br />“(D) The offense resulted in death or serious bodily injury.”.<br />The Commentary to &#167;2B5.3 captioned “Background” is amended by inserting after the<br />paragraph that begins “Subsection (b)(1)” the following:<br />“ Subsection (b)(5) implements the directive to the Commission in section 717<br />of Public Law 112–144.”.<br />Appendix A (Statutory Index) is amended by striking the line referenced to 21 U.S.C.<br />&#167; 333(b) as follows:<br />“21 U.S.C. &#167; 333(b) 2N2.1”;<br />Amendment 773<br />and inserting the following:<br />“21 U.S.C. &#167; 333(b)(1)–(6) 2N2.1<br />21 U.S.C. &#167; 333(b)(7) 2N1.1”.</td><td>REASON FOR AMENDMENT: This amendment responds to two recent Acts that made<br />changes to 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2320 (Trafficking in counterfeit goods or services). One Act in-<br />creased penalties for offenses involving counterfeit military goods and services; the<br />other increased penalties for offenses involving counterfeit drugs and included a di-<br />rective to the Commission. The amendment also responds to recent statutory changes<br />to 21 U.S.C. &#167; 333 (Penalties for violations of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetics<br />Act) that increase penalties for offenses involving intentionally adulterated drugs.<br />Section 2320 and Counterfeit Military Goods and Services<br />First, the amendment responds to changes to section 2320 made by the National De-<br />fense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012, Pub. L. 112–81 (enacted December 31,<br />2011) (the “NDAA”). In general, section 2320 prohibits trafficking in goods or services<br />using a counterfeit mark, and provides a statutory maximum term of imprisonment of<br />10 years, or 20 years for a second or subsequent offense. If the offender knowingly or<br />recklessly causes or attempts to cause serious bodily injury or death, the statutory<br />maximum is increased to 20 years or any term of years or life, respectively. Offenses<br />under section 2320 are referenced in Appendix A (Statutory Index) to &#167;2B5.3 (Criminal<br />Infringement of Copyright or Trademark).<br />Section 818 of the NDAA amended section 2320 to add a new subsection (a)(3) that<br />prohibits trafficking in counterfeit military goods and services, the use, malfunction,<br />or failure of which is likely to cause serious bodily injury or death, the disclosure of<br />classified information, impairment of combat operations, or other significant harm to<br />a combat operation, a member of the Armed Forces, or national security. A “counterfeit<br />military good or service” is defined as a good or service that uses a counterfeit mark<br />and that (A) is falsely identified or labeled as meeting military specifications, or (B) is<br />intended for use in a military or national security application. See 18 U.S.C.<br />&#167; 2320(f)(4). An individual who commits an offense under subsection (a)(3) is subject<br />to a statutory maximum term of imprisonment of 20 years, or 30 years for a second or<br />subsequent offense. See 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2320(b)(3).<br />The legislative history of the NDAA indicates that Congress amended section 2320<br />because of concerns about national security and the protection of United States ser-<br />vicemen and women. After reviewing the legislative history, public comment, testi-<br />mony, and data, the Commission determined that an offense involving counterfeit mil-<br />itary goods and services that jeopardizes the safety of United States troops and com-<br />promises mission effectiveness warrants increased punishment.<br />Specifically, the amendment addresses offenses involving counterfeit military goods<br />and services by amending &#167;2B5.3 to create a new specific offense characteristic at sub-<br />section (b)(7). Subsection (b)(7) provides a 2-level enhancement and a minimum offense<br />level of 14 if the offense involves a counterfeit military good or service the use, mal-<br />function, or failure of which is likely to cause the disclosure of classified information,<br />impairment of combat operations, or other significant harm to a combat operation, a<br />member of the Armed Forces, or to national security. The Commission set the mini-<br />mum offense level at 14 so that it would be proportionate to the minimum offense level<br />Amendment 773<br />38 ║ Supplement to Appendix C (November 1, 2016)<br />in the enhancement for “conscious or reckless risk of death or serious bodily injury” at<br />subsection (b)(5)(A). That enhancement is moved from (b)(5)(A) to (b)(6)(A) by the<br />amendment.<br />Although section 2320(a)(3) includes offenses that are likely to cause “serious bodily<br />injury or death,” the new specific offense characteristic does not because the Commis-<br />sion determined that such risk of harm is adequately addressed by the existing en-<br />hancement for offenses involving the “conscious or reckless risk of death or serious<br />bodily injury.” Consistent with that approach, the amendment includes commentary<br />providing that the “other significant harm” specified in subsection (b)(7) does not in-<br />clude death or serious bodily injury and that &#167;2B5.3(b)(6)(A) would apply if the offense<br />involved a counterfeit military good or service the use, malfunction, or failure of which<br />is likely to cause serious bodily injury or death.<br />Section 2320 and Counterfeit Drugs<br />Second, the amendment responds to changes made by section 717 of the Food and Drug<br />Administration Safety and Innovation Act, Pub. L. 112–144 (enacted July 9, 2012) (the<br />“FDASIA”), which amended section 2320 to add a new subsection (a)(4) that prohibits<br />trafficking in a counterfeit drug. A “counterfeit drug” is a drug, as defined by section<br />201 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. &#167; 321), that uses a coun-<br />terfeit mark. See 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2320(f)(6). An individual who commits an offense under<br />subsection (a)(4) is subject to the same statutory maximum term of imprisonment as<br />for an offense involving a counterfeit military good or service — 20 years, or 30 years<br />for a second or subsequent offense. See 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2320(b)(3).<br />Section 717 of the FDASIA also contained a directive to the Commission to “review and<br />amend, if appropriate” the guidelines and policy statements applicable to persons con-<br />victed of an offense described in section 2320(a)(4) — i.e., offenses involving counterfeit<br />drugs — “in order to reflect the intent of Congress that such penalties be increased in<br />comparison to those currently provided by the guidelines and policy statements.”<br />See Pub. L. 112–144, &#167; 717(b)(1). In addition, section 717(b)(2) provides that, in re-<br />sponding to the directive, the Commission shall, among other things, ensure that the<br />guidelines reflect the serious nature of section 2320(a)(4) offenses and consider the<br />extent to which the guidelines account for the potential and actual harm to the public<br />resulting from such offenses.<br />After reviewing the legislative history of the FDASIA, public comment, testimony, and<br />data, the Commission determined that offenses involving counterfeit drugs involve a<br />threat to public safety and undermine the public’s confidence in the drug supply chain.<br />Furthermore, unlike many other goods covered by the infringement guideline, offenses<br />involving counterfeit drugs circumvent a regulatory scheme established to protect the<br />health and safety of the public. Accordingly, the amendment responds to the directive<br />by adding a new specific offense characteristic at &#167;2B5.3(b)(5) that provides a 2-level<br />enhancement if the offense involves a counterfeit drug.<br />Offenses Resulting in Death or Serious Bodily Injury<br />Third, the amendment amends the Commentary to &#167;2B5.3 to add a new upward de-<br />parture consideration if the offense resulted in death or serious bodily injury. The ad-<br />dition of this departure consideration recognizes the distinction between an offense<br />involving the risk of death or serious bodily injury and one in which death or serious<br />bodily injury actually results. Departures for these reasons are already authorized in<br />the guidelines, see &#167;&#167;5K2.1 (Death) (Policy Statement), 5K2.2 (Physical Injury) (Policy<br />Amendment 774<br />Statement), but the amendment is intended to heighten awareness of the availability<br />of a departure in such cases.<br />Section 333 and Offenses Involving Intentionally Adulterated Drugs<br />Finally, the amendment provides a statutory reference for the new offense at 21 U.S.C.<br />&#167; 333(b)(7) created by section 716 of the FDASIA. Section 333(b)(7) applies to any per-<br />son who knowingly and intentionally adulterates a drug such that the drug is adulter-<br />ated under certain provisions of 21 U.S.C. &#167; 351 and has a reasonable probability of<br />causing serious adverse health consequences or death to humans or animals. It pro-<br />vides a statutory maximum term of imprisonment of 20 years.<br />The amendment amends Appendix A (Statutory Index) to reference offenses under sec-<br />tion 333(b)(7) to &#167;2N1.1 (Tampering or Attempting to Tamper Involving Risk of Death<br />or Bodily Injury). The Commission concluded that offenses under section 333(b)(7) are<br />similar to tampering offenses under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1365 (Tampering with consumer prod-<br />ucts), which are referenced to &#167;2N1.1. In addition, the public health harms that Con-<br />gress intended to target in adulteration cases are similar to those targeted by viola-<br />tions of section 1365(a) and are best addressed under &#167;2N1.1.</td><td>Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2013.</td></tr><tr><td class="n">774</td><td>Amendment 774</td><td>The Commentary to &#167;2T1.1 captioned “Application Notes” is amended in<br />Note 1 by inserting “Tax Loss.—” at the beginning;<br />in Note 2 by inserting “Total Tax Loss Attributable to the Offense.—” at the beginning,<br />and by redesignating subdivisions (a) through (e) as (A) through (E);<br />by inserting after Note 2 the following:<br />“3.

These circuit courts generally rea-<br />son that, while a district court need not speculate about unclaimed deductions if the<br />defendant offers weak support, nothing in the guidelines prohibits a sentencing court<br />from considering evidence of unclaimed deductions where a defendant offers convinc-<br />ing proof. See United States v. Hoskins, 654 F.3d 1086, 1094 (10th Cir. 2011) (“[W]here<br />defendant offers convincing proof — where the court’s exercise is neither nebulous nor<br />complex — nothing in the Guidelines prohibits a sentencing court from considering<br />evidence of unclaimed deductions in analyzing a defendant’s estimate of the tax loss<br />suffered by the government.”); United States v. Martinez-Rios, 143 F.3d 662, 671<br />(2d Cir. 1998) (holding that “the sentencing court need not base its tax loss calculation<br />on gross unreported income if it can make a ‘more accurate determination’ of the in-<br />tended loss and that determination of the tax loss involves giving the defendant the<br />benefit of legitimate but unclaimed deductions”); United States v. Gordon, 291 F.3d<br />181, 187 (2d Cir. 2002) (applying Martinez-Rios, the court held that the district court<br />Amendment 774<br />erred when it refused to consider potential unclaimed deductions in its sentencing<br />analysis).<br />Six other circuit courts — the Fourth, Fifth, Seventh, Eighth, Ninth, and Eleventh —<br />have reached the opposite conclusion, directly or indirectly holding that a court may<br />not consider unclaimed deductions to reduce the tax loss. These circuit courts generally<br />reason that the “object of the [defendant’s] offense” is established by the amount stated<br />on the fraudulent return, and that courts should not be required to reconstruct the<br />defendant’s return based on speculation regarding the many hypothetical ways the<br />defendant could have completed the return. See United States v. Delfino, 510 F.3d 468,<br />473 (4th Cir. 2007) (“The law simply does not require the district court to engage in<br />[speculation as to what deductions would have been allowed], nor does it entitle the<br />Delfinos to the benefit of deductions they might have claimed now that they stand<br />convicted of tax evasion.”); United States v. Phelps, 478 F.3d 680, 682 (5th Cir. 2007)<br />(holding that the defendant could not reduce tax loss by taking a social security tax<br />deduction that he did not claim on the false return); United States v. Chavin, 316 F.3d<br />666, 677 (7th Cir. 2002) (“Here, the object of [the defendant]’s offense was the amount<br />by which he underreported and fraudulently stated his tax liability on his return; ref-<br />erence to other unrelated mistakes on the return such as unclaimed deductions tells<br />us nothing about the amount of loss to the government that his scheme intended to<br />create.”); United States v. Psihos, 683 F.3d 777, 781–82 (7th Cir. 2012) (following<br />Chavin in disallowing consideration of unclaimed deductions); United States v. Sher-<br />man, 372 F.App’x 668, 676–77 (8th Cir. 2010); United States v. Blevins, 542 F.3d 1200,<br />1203 (8th Cir. 2008) (declining to decide “whether an unclaimed tax benefit may ever<br />offset tax loss,” but finding the district court properly declined to reduce tax loss based<br />on taxpayers’ unclaimed deductions); United States v. Yip, 592 F.3d 1035, 1041<br />(9th Cir. 2010) (“We hold that &#167; 2T1.1 does not entitle a defendant to reduce the tax<br />loss charged to him by the amount of potentially legitimate, but unclaimed, deductions<br />even if those deductions are related to the offense.”); United States v. Clarke, 562 F.3d<br />1158, 1165 (11th Cir. 2009) (holding that the defendant was not entitled to a tax loss<br />calculation based on a filing status other than the one he actually used; “[t]he district<br />court did not err in computing the tax loss based on the fraudulent return Clarke ac-<br />tually filed, and not on the tax return Clarke could have filed but did not.”).<br />The amendment resolves the conflict by amending the Commentary to &#167;2T1.1 to es-<br />tablish a new application note regarding the consideration of unclaimed credits, de-<br />ductions, or exemptions in calculating a defendant’s tax loss. This amendment reflects<br />the Commission’s view that consideration of legitimate unclaimed credits, deductions,<br />or exemptions, subject to certain limitations and exclusions, is most consistent with<br />existing provisions regarding the calculation of tax loss in &#167;2T1.1. See, e.g., USSG<br />&#167;2T1.1, comment. (n.1) (“the guidelines contemplate that the court will simply make a<br />reasonable estimate based on the available facts”); USSG &#167;2T1.1, comment. (backg’d.)<br />(“a greater tax loss is obviously more harmful to the treasury and more serious than a<br />smaller one with otherwise similar characteristics”); USSG &#167;2T1.1, comment. (n.1) (al-<br />lowing a sentencing court to go beyond the presumptions set forth in the guideline if<br />“the government or defense provides sufficient information for a more accurate assess-<br />ment of the tax loss,” and providing “the court should use any method of determining<br />the tax loss that appears appropriate to reasonably calculate the loss that would have<br />resulted had the offense been successfully completed”).<br />The new application note first provides that courts should always account for the<br />standard deduction and personal and dependent exemptions to which the defendant<br />was entitled. The Commission received public comment and testimony that such de-<br />ductions and exemptions are commonly considered and accepted by the government<br />Amendment 774<br />42 ║ Supplement to Appendix C (November 1, 2016)<br />during the course of its investigation and during the course of plea negotiations. Con-<br />sistent with this standard practice, the Commission determined that accounting for<br />these generally undisputed and readily verifiable deductions and exemptions where<br />they are not previously claimed (most commonly where the offense involves a failure<br />to file a tax return) is appropriate.<br />The new application note further provides that courts should also account for any other<br />previously unclaimed credit, deduction, or exemption that is needed to ensure a rea-<br />sonable estimate of the tax loss, but only to the extent certain conditions are met. First,<br />the credit, deduction, or exemption must be one that was related to the tax offense and<br />could have been claimed at the time the tax offense was committed. This condition<br />reflects the Commission’s determination that a defendant should not be permitted to<br />invoke unforeseen or after-the-fact changes or characterizations — such as offsetting<br />losses that occur before or after the relevant tax year or substituting a more advanta-<br />geous depreciation method or filing status — to lower the tax loss. To permit a defend-<br />ant to optimize his return in this manner would unjustly reward defendants, and could<br />require unjustifiable speculation and complexity at the sentencing hearing.<br />Second, the otherwise unclaimed credit, deduction, or exemption must be reasonably<br />and practicably ascertainable. Consistent with the instruction in Application Note 1,<br />this condition reaffirms the Commission’s position that sentencing courts need only<br />make a reasonable estimate of tax loss. In this regard, the Commission recognized that<br />consideration of some unclaimed credits, deductions, or exemptions could require sen-<br />tencing courts to make unnecessarily complex tax determinations, and therefore con-<br />cluded that limiting consideration of unclaimed credits, deductions, or exemptions to<br />those that are reasonably and practicably ascertainable is appropriate.<br />Third, the defendant must present information to support the credit, deduction, or ex-<br />emption sufficiently in advance of sentencing to provide an adequate opportunity to<br />evaluate whether it has sufficient indicia of reliability to support its probable accuracy.<br />Consistent with the principles set forth in &#167;6A1.3 (Resolution of Disputed Factors)<br />(Policy Statement), this condition ensures that the parties have an adequate oppor-<br />tunity to present information relevant to the court’s consideration of any unclaimed<br />credits, deductions, or exemptions raised at sentencing.<br />In addition, the new application note provides that certain categories of credits, deduc-<br />tions, or exemptions shall not be considered by the court in any case. In particular,<br />“the court shall not account for payments to third parties made in a manner that en-<br />couraged or facilitated a separate violation of law (e.g., ‘under the table’ payments to<br />employees or expenses incurred to obstruct justice).” The Commission determined that<br />payments made in this manner result in additional harm to the tax system and the<br />legal system as a whole. Therefore, to use them to reduce the tax loss would unjustifi-<br />ably benefit the defendant and would result in a tax loss figure that understates the<br />seriousness of the offense and the culpability of the defendant.<br />Finally, the application note makes clear that the burden is on the defendant to estab-<br />lish any credit, deduction, or exemption permitted under this new application note by<br />a preponderance of the evidence, which is also consistent with the commentary in<br />&#167;6A1.3.</td><td>Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2013.</td></tr><tr><td class="n">775</td><td>Amendment 775</td><td>The Commentary to &#167;3E1.1 captioned “Application Notes” is amended in<br />Note 6 by adding at the end of the paragraph that begins “Because the Government”<br />the following as the last sentence: “The government should not withhold such a motion<br />based on interests not identified in &#167;3E1.1, such as whether the defendant agrees to<br />waive his or her right to appeal.”; and<br />by adding after the paragraph that begins “Because the Government” the following<br />new paragraph:<br />“If the government files such a motion, and the court in deciding whether to grant the<br />motion also determines that the defendant has assisted authorities in the investigation<br />or prosecution of his own misconduct by timely notifying authorities of his intention to<br />enter a plea of guilty, thereby permitting the government to avoid preparing for trial<br />and permitting the government and the court to allocate their resources efficiently, the<br />court should grant the motion.”.<br />The Commentary to &#167;3E1.1 captioned “Background” is amended in the paragraph that<br />begins “Section 401(g)” by striking “the last paragraph” and inserting “the first sen-<br />tence of the second paragraph”.</td><td>REASON FOR AMENDMENT: This amendment addresses two circuit conflicts involving<br />the guideline for acceptance of responsibility, &#167;3E1.1 (Acceptance of Responsibility). A<br />defendant who clearly demonstrates acceptance of responsibility for his offense re-<br />ceives a 2-level reduction under subsection (a) of &#167;3E1.1. The two circuit conflicts both<br />involve the circumstances under which the defendant is eligible for a third level of<br />reduction under subsection (b) of &#167;3E1.1. Subsection (b) provides:<br />(b) If the defendant qualifies for a decrease under subsection (a),<br />the offense level determined prior to the operation of subsec-<br />tion (a) is level 16 or greater, and upon motion of the govern-<br />ment stating that the defendant has assisted authorities in the<br />investigation or prosecution of his own misconduct by timely<br />notifying authorities of his intention to enter a plea of guilty,<br />thereby permitting the government to avoid preparing for trial<br />and permitting the government and the court to allocate their<br />resources efficiently, decrease the offense level by 1 additional<br />level.<br />The first circuit conflict involves the government’s discretion under subsection (b) and,<br />in particular, whether the government may withhold a motion based on an interest not<br />identified in &#167;3E1.1, such as the defendant’s refusal to waive his right to appeal. The<br />second conflict involves the court’s discretion under subsection (b) and, in particular,<br />whether the court may decline to apply the third level of reduction when the govern-<br />ment has moved for it.<br />These circuit conflicts are unusual in that they involve guideline and commentary pro-<br />visions that Congress directly amended. See section 401(g) of the Prosecutorial Reme-<br />dies and Other Tools to end the Exploitation of Children Today Act of 2003, Pub.<br />L. 108–21 (the “PROTECT Act”); see also USSG App. C, Amendment 649 (effective<br />April 30, 2003) (implementing amendments to the guidelines made directly by the<br />PROTECT Act). They also implicate a congressional directive to the Commission not<br />Amendment 775<br />44 ║ Supplement to Appendix C (November 1, 2016)<br />to “alter or repeal” the congressional amendments. See section 401(j)(4) of the PRO-<br />TECT Act. Accordingly, in considering these conflicts, the Commission has not only<br />reviewed public comment, sentencing data, case law, and the other types of infor-<br />mation it ordinarily considers, but has also studied the operation of &#167;3E1.1 before the<br />PROTECT Act, the congressional action to amend &#167;3E1.1, and the legislative history<br />of that congressional action.<br />The Government’s Discretion to Withhold the Motion<br />The first circuit conflict involves the government’s discretion under subsection (b) and,<br />in particular, whether the government may withhold a motion based on an interest not<br />identified in &#167;3E1.1, such as the defendant’s refusal to waive his right to appeal.<br />Several circuits have held that a defendant’s refusal to sign an appellate waiver is a<br />legitimate reason for the government to withhold a &#167;3E1.1(b) motion. See, e.g., United<br />States v. Johnson, 581 F.3d 994, 1002 (9th Cir. 2009) (holding that “allocation and<br />expenditure of prosecutorial resources for the purposes of defending an appeal is a<br />rational basis” for such refusal); United States v. Deberry, 576 F.3d 708, 711 (7th Cir.<br />2009) (holding that requiring the defendant to sign an appeal waiver would avoid “ex-<br />pense and uncertainty” on appeal); United States v. Newson, 515 F.3d 374, 378<br />(5th Cir. 2008) (holding that the government’s interests under &#167;3E1.1 encompass not<br />only the government’s time and effort at prejudgment stage but also at post-judgment<br />proceedings).<br />In contrast, the Fourth Circuit has held that a defendant’s refusal to sign an appellate<br />waiver is not a legitimate reason for the government to withhold a &#167;3E1.1(b) motion.<br />See United States v. Divens, 650 F.3d 343, 348 (4th Cir. 2011) (stating that “the text<br />of &#167;3E1.1(b) reveals a concern for the efficient allocation of trial resources, not appel-<br />late resources” [emphasis in original]); see also United States v. Davis, 714 F.3d 474,<br />476 (7th Cir. 2013) (Rovner, J., concurring) (“insisting that [the defendant] waive his<br />right to appeal before he may receive the maximum credit under the Guidelines for<br />accepting responsibility serves none of the interests identified in section 3E1.1”). The<br />majority in Davis called for the conflict to be resolved, stating: “Resolution of this con-<br />flict is the province of the Supreme Court or the Sentencing Commission.” Davis,<br />714 F.3d at 475 (per curiam). The Second Circuit, stating that the Fourth Circuit’s<br />reasoning in Divens applies “with equal force” to the defendant’s request for an evi-<br />dentiary hearing on sentencing issues, held that the government may not withhold a<br />&#167;3E1.1 motion based upon such a request. See United States v. Lee, 653 F.3d 170, 175<br />(2d Cir. 2011).<br />The PROTECT Act added Commentary to &#167;3E1.1 stating that “[b]ecause the Govern-<br />ment is in the best position to determine whether the defendant has assisted authori-<br />ties in a manner that avoids preparing for trial, an adjustment under subsection (b)<br />may only be granted upon a formal motion by the Government at the time of sentenc-<br />ing.” See &#167;3E1.1, comment. (n.6). The PROTECT Act also amended &#167;3E1.1(b) to pro-<br />vide that the government motion state, among other things, that the defendant’s noti-<br />fication of his intention to enter a plea of guilty permitted “the government to avoid<br />preparing for trial and . . . the government and the court to allocate their resources<br />efficiently . . . .”<br />In its study of the PROTECT Act, the Commission could discern no congressional in-<br />tent to allow decisions under &#167;3E1.1 to be based on interests not identified in &#167;3E1.1.<br />Furthermore, consistent with Divens and the concurrence in Davis, the Commission<br />determined that the defendant’s waiver of his or her right to appeal is an example of<br />Amendment 775<br />an interest not identified in &#167;3E1.1. Accordingly, this amendment adds an additional<br />sentence to the Commentary stating that “[t]he government should not withhold such<br />a motion based on interests not identified in &#167;3E1.1, such as whether the defendant<br />agrees to waive his or her right to appeal.”<br />The Court’s Discretion to Deny the Motion<br />The second conflict involves the court’s discretion under subsection (b) and, in partic-<br />ular, whether the court may decline to apply the third level of reduction when the<br />government has moved for it.<br />The Seventh Circuit has held that if the government makes the motion (and the other<br />two requirements of subsection (b) are met, i.e., the defendant qualifies for the 2-level<br />decrease and the offense level is level 16 or greater), the third level of reduction must<br />be awarded. See United States v. Mount, 675 F.3d 1052 (7th Cir. 2012).<br />In contrast, the Fifth Circuit has held that the district court retains discretion to deny<br />the motion. See United States v. Williamson, 598 F.3d 227, 230 (5th Cir. 2010). In<br />Williamson, the defendant was convicted after jury trial but successfully appealed. Af-<br />ter remand, he pled guilty to a lesser offense. The government moved for the third level<br />of reduction, but the court declined to grant it because “regardless of however much<br />additional trial preparation the government avoided through Williamson’s guilty plea<br />following remand, the preparation for the initial trial and the use of the court’s re-<br />sources for that trial meant that the &#167; 3E1.1(b) benefits to the government and the<br />court were not obtained.” Id. at 231. The Fifth Circuit affirmed, holding that the deci-<br />sion whether to grant the third level of reduction “is the district court’s — not the<br />government’s — even though the court may only do so on the government’s motion.”<br />Id. at 230.<br />This amendment amends the Commentary to &#167;3E1.1 by adding the following state-<br />ment: “If the government files such a motion, and the court in deciding whether to<br />grant the motion also determines that the defendant has assisted authorities in the<br />investigation or prosecution of his own misconduct by timely notifying authorities of<br />his intention to enter a plea of guilty, thereby permitting the government to avoid pre-<br />paring for trial and permitting the government and the court to allocate their resources<br />efficiently, the court should grant the motion.”<br />In its study of the PROTECT Act, the Commission could discern no congressional in-<br />tent to take away from the court its responsibility under &#167;3E1.1 to make its own de-<br />termination of whether the conditions were met. In particular, both the language<br />added to the Commentary by the PROTECT Act and the legislative history of the PRO-<br />TECT Act speak in terms of allowing the court discretion to “grant” the third level of<br />reduction. See USSG &#167;3E1.1, comment. (n.6) (stating that the third level of reduction<br />“may only be granted upon a formal motion by the Government”); H.R. Rep. No.<br />108–66, at 59 (2003) (Conf. Rep.) (stating that the PROTECT Act amendment would<br />“only allow courts to grant an additional third point reduction for ‘acceptance of re-<br />sponsibility’ upon motion of the government.”). In addition, the Commission observes<br />that one of the considerations in &#167;3E1.1(b) is whether the defendant’s actions permit-<br />ted the court to allocate its resources efficiently, and the court is in the best position to<br />make that determination. Accordingly, consistent with congressional intent, this<br />amendment recognizes that the court continues to have discretion to decide whether<br />to grant the third level of reduction.<br />Amendment 776<br />46 ║ Supplement to Appendix C (November 1, 2016)<br />Finally, and as mentioned above, the Commission in its study of the PROTECT Act<br />could discern no congressional intent to allow decisions under &#167;3E1.1 to be based on<br />interests not identified in &#167;3E1.1. For that reason, this amendment indicates that, if<br />the government has filed the motion and the court also determines that the circum-<br />stances identified in &#167;3E1.1 are present, the court should grant the motion.</td><td>Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2013.</td></tr><tr><td class="n">776</td><td>Amendment 776</td><td>The Commentary to &#167;5G1.3 captioned “Background” is amended by strik-<br />ing the following: “In a case in which a defendant is subject to an undischarged sen-<br />tence of imprisonment, the court generally has authority to impose an imprisonment<br />sentence on the current offense to run concurrently with or consecutively to the prior<br />undischarged term. 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3584(a). Exercise of that authority,”;<br />and inserting the following: “Federal courts generally ‘have discretion to select<br />whether the sentences they impose will run concurrently or consecutively with respect<br />to other sentences that they impose, or that have been imposed in other proceedings,<br />including state proceedings.’ See Setser v. United States, 132 S. Ct. 1463, 1468 (2012);<br />18 U.S.C. &#167; 3584(a). Federal courts also generally have discretion to order that the<br />sentences they impose will run concurrently with or consecutively to other state sen-<br />tences that are anticipated but not yet imposed. See Setser, 132 S. Ct. at 1468. Exercise<br />of that discretion,”.</td><td>REASON FOR AMENDMENT: This amendment responds to a recent Supreme Court deci-<br />sion that federal courts have discretion to order that the sentence run consecutively to<br />(or concurrently with) an anticipated, but not yet imposed, state sentence. See Setser<br />v. United States, 132 S. Ct. 1463, 1468 (2012).<br />The discretion recognized in Setser for anticipated state sentences is similar to the<br />discretion that federal courts have under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3584 for previously imposed sen-<br />tences. Under section 3584, a federal court imposing a sentence generally has discre-<br />tion to order that the sentence run consecutively to (or, in the alternative, concurrently<br />with) a term of imprisonment previously imposed but not yet discharged. See 18 U.S.C.<br />&#167; 3584(a). Section 5G1.3 (Imposition of a Sentence on a Defendant Subject to an Un-<br />discharged Term of Imprisonment) provides guidance to the court in determining<br />whether, and how, to use the discretion under section 3584, i.e., whether the sentence<br />should run consecutively to (or, in the alternative, concurrently with) the prior undis-<br />charged term of imprisonment.<br />The amendment amends the background commentary to &#167;5G1.3 to include a statement<br />that, in addition to the discretion provided by section 3584, federal courts also gener-<br />ally have discretion under Setser to order that the sentences they impose will run con-<br />secutively to or concurrently with other state sentences that are anticipated but not<br />yet imposed. Determining whether, and how, to use this discretion will depend on the<br />adequacy of the information available. See Setser, 132 S. Ct. at 1471 n.6 (“Of course, a<br />district court should exercise the power to impose anticipatory consecutive (or concur-<br />rent) sentences intelligently. In some situations, a district court may have inadequate<br />information and may forbear, but in other situations, that will not be the case.”). Add-<br />ing this statement to the guideline that applies to the court’s discretion under section<br />Amendment 777<br />3584 is intended to provide heightened awareness of the court’s similar discretion un-<br />der Setser.</td><td>Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2013.</td></tr><tr><td class="n">777</td><td>Amendment 777</td><td>The Commentary to &#167;2B1.1 captioned “Application Notes” is amended in<br />Note 15 (as renumbered by Amendment 772) by striking “1a(5)” both places it appears<br />and inserting “1a(11)”;

L. 112–95 (enacted February 14, 2012), which established a new<br />criminal offense at 18 U.S.C. &#167; 39A (Aiming a laser pointer at an aircraft). The offense<br />applies to whoever knowingly aims the beam of a laser pointer at an aircraft in the<br />special aircraft jurisdiction of the United States or at the flight path of such an aircraft.<br />The statutory maximum term of imprisonment is five years.<br />The amendment amends Appendix A (Statutory Index) to reference section 39A of-<br />fenses to &#167;2A5.2 (Interference with Flight Crew Member or Flight Attendant; Interfer-<br />ence with Dispatch, Navigation, Operation, or Maintenance of Mass Transportation<br />Vehicle). Section 2A5.2 is the most analogous guideline because the offense involves<br />interference with an aircraft in flight.<br />Restraining the Harassment of a Victim or Witness<br />Second, the amendment responds to section 3(a) of the Child Protection Act of 2012,<br />Pub. L. 112–206 (enacted December 7, 2012), which established a new offense at<br />18 U.S.C. &#167; 1514(c) that makes it a criminal offense to knowingly and intentionally<br />violate or attempt to violate an order issued under section 1514 (Civil action to restrain<br />harassment of a victim or witness). The new offense has a statutory maximum term of<br />imprisonment of five years.<br />The amendment amends Appendix A (Statutory Index) to reference section 1514(c)<br />offenses to &#167;2J1.2 (Obstruction of Justice). Section 2J1.2 is the most analogous guide-<br />line because the offense involves interference with judicial proceedings.<br />Restricted Buildings and Grounds<br />Third, the amendment responds to the Federal Restricted Buildings and Grounds Im-<br />provement Act of 2011, Pub. L. 112–98 (enacted March 8, 2012), which amended the<br />criminal offense at 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1752 (Restricted building or grounds). As so amended,<br />the statute defines “restricted buildings or grounds” to mean any restricted area (A) of<br />the White House or its grounds, or the Vice President’s official residence or its grounds;<br />(B) of a building or grounds where the President or other person protected by the<br />United States Secret Service is or will be temporarily visiting; or (C) of a building or<br />grounds restricted in conjunction with an event designated as a special event of na-<br />tional significance. The statute makes it a crime to enter or remain; to impede or dis-<br />rupt the orderly conduct of business or official functions; to obstruct or impede ingress<br />or egress; or to engage in any physical violence against any person or property. The<br />Act did not change the statutory maximum term of imprisonment, which is ten years<br />if the person used or carried a deadly or dangerous weapon or firearm or if the offense<br />results in significant bodily injury, and one year in any other case.<br />The amendment amends Appendix A (Statutory Index) to reference section 1752 of-<br />fenses to &#167;2A2.4 (Obstructing or Impeding Officers) and &#167;2B2.3 (Trespass). These<br />guidelines are most analogous because the elements of offenses under section 1752<br />involve either trespass at certain locations (i.e., locations permanently or temporarily<br />protected by the Secret Service) or interference with official business at such locations,<br />or both.<br />The amendment also amends &#167;2B2.3(b)(1) to ensure that a trespass under section 1752<br />provides a 4-level enhancement if the trespass occurred at the White House or the Vice<br />Amendment 777<br />50 ║ Supplement to Appendix C (November 1, 2016)<br />President’s official residence, or a 2-level enhancement if the trespass occurred at any<br />other location permanently or temporarily protected by the Secret Service. Sec-<br />tion 2B2.3(b)(1) provides a 2-level enhancement if the trespass occurred at locations<br />that involve a significant federal interest, such as nuclear facilities, airports, and sea-<br />ports. A trespass at a location protected by the Secret Service is no less serious than a<br />trespass at other locations that involve a significant federal interest and warrants an<br />equivalent enhancement of 2 levels. Section 2B2.3(b)(1) also provides a 2-level en-<br />hancement if the trespass occurred at a residence. A trespass at the residence of the<br />President or the Vice President is more serious and poses a greater risk of harm than<br />a trespass at an ordinary residence and warrants an enhancement of 4 levels.<br />Aviation Smuggling<br />Fourth, the amendment responds to the Ultralight Aircraft Smuggling Prevention Act<br />of 2012, Pub. L. 112–93 (enacted February 10, 2012), which amended the criminal of-<br />fense at 19 U.S.C. &#167; 1590 (Aviation smuggling) to clarify that the term “aircraft” in-<br />cludes ultralight aircraft and to cover attempts and conspiracies. Section 1590 makes<br />it unlawful for the pilot of an aircraft to transport merchandise, or for any individual<br />on board any aircraft to possess merchandise, knowing that the merchandise will be<br />introduced into the United States contrary to law. It is also unlawful for a person to<br />transfer merchandise between an aircraft and a vessel on the high seas or in the cus-<br />toms waters of the United States unlawfully. The Act did not change the statutory<br />maximum terms of imprisonment, which are 20 years if any of the merchandise in-<br />volved was a controlled substance, see &#167; 1590(d)(2), and five years otherwise,<br />see &#167; 1590(d)(1).<br />The amendment amends Appendix A (Statutory Index) to reference offenses under sec-<br />tion 1590(d)(1) to &#167;2T3.1 (Evading Import Duties or Restrictions (Smuggling); Receiv-<br />ing or Trafficking in Smuggled Property). In such cases, &#167;2T3.1 is the most analogous<br />guideline because the offense involves smuggling. The amendment also amends Ap-<br />pendix A (Statutory Index) to reference offenses under section 1590(d)(2) to &#167;2D1.1<br />(Unlawful Manufacturing, Importing, Exporting, or Trafficking (Including Possession<br />with Intent to Commit These Offenses); Attempt or Conspiracy). In such cases, &#167;2D1.1<br />is the most analogous guideline because controlled substances are involved in these<br />offenses.<br />Interaction Between Offense Guidelines in Chapter Two, Part J, and Certain<br />Adjustments in Chapter Three, Part C<br />Fifth, the amendment responds to an application issue that may arise in cases in which<br />the defendant is sentenced under an offense guideline in Chapter Two, Part J (Offenses<br />Involving the Administration of Justice) and the defendant may also be subject to an<br />adjustment under Chapter Three, Part C (Obstruction and Related Adjustments). Spe-<br />cifically, there are application notes in four Chapter Two, Part J guidelines that, it has<br />been argued, preclude the court from applying adjustments in Chapter Three, Part C.<br />See, e.g., United States v. Duong, 665 F.3d 364 (1st Cir. 2012) (observing that, “accord-<br />ing to the literal terms” of the application notes, an adjustment under Chapter Three,<br />Part C “ ‘does not apply,’ ” but “reject[ing] that premise”).<br />The amendment amends the relevant application notes in Chapter Two, Part J<br />(see &#167;&#167;2J1.2, comment. (n.2(A)); 2J1.3, comment. (n.2); 2J1.6, comment. (n.2); 2J1.9,<br />comment. (n.1)) to clarify the Commission’s intent that they restrict the court from<br />applying &#167;3C1.1 (Obstructing or Impeding the Administration of Justice) but do not<br />restrict the court from applying &#167;&#167;3C1.2, 3C1.3, and 3C1.4. These changes resolve the<br />Amendment 777<br />application issue consistent with Duong and promote clarity and consistency in the<br />application of these adjustments.<br />Export Offenses Under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 554<br />Sixth, the amendment broadens the range of guidelines to which export offenses under<br />18 U.S.C. &#167; 554 (Smuggling goods from the United States) are referenced. Section 554<br />makes it unlawful to export or send from the United States (or attempt to do so) any<br />merchandise, article, or object contrary to any law or regulation of the United States.<br />It also makes it unlawful to receive, conceal, buy, sell, or in any manner facilitate the<br />transportation, concealment, or sale of such merchandise, article, or object, prior to<br />exportation, knowing the same to be intended for exportation contrary to any law or<br />regulation of the United States. Offenses under section 554 have a statutory maximum<br />term of imprisonment of ten years, and they are referenced in Appendix A (Statutory<br />Index) to three guidelines: &#167;&#167;2B1.5 (Theft of, Damage to, or Destruction of, Cultural<br />Heritage Resources or Paleontological Resources; Unlawful Sale, Purchase, Exchange,<br />Transportation, or Receipt of Cultural Heritage Resources or Paleontological Re-<br />sources), 2M5.2 (Exportation of Arms, Munitions, or Military Equipment or Services<br />Without Required Validated Export License), and 2Q2.1 (Offenses Involving Fish,<br />Wildlife, and Plants).<br />The amendment amends Appendix A (Statutory Index) to add &#167;2M5.1 (Evasion of Ex-<br />port Controls; Financial Transactions with Countries Supporting International Ter-<br />rorism) to the list of guidelines to which offenses under section 554 are referenced. Not<br />all offenses under section 554 involve munitions, cultural resources, or wildlife, so a<br />reference to an additional guideline is warranted. For example, a section 554 offense<br />may be based on the export of ordinary commercial goods in violation of economic sanc-<br />tions or on the export of “dual-use” goods (i.e., goods that have both commercial and<br />military applications). For such cases, the additional reference to &#167;2M5.1 promotes<br />clarity and consistency in guideline application, and the penalty structure of &#167;2M5.1<br />provides appropriate distinctions between offenses that violate national security con-<br />trols and offenses that do not.<br />Technical and Stylistic Changes<br />Finally, the amendment makes certain technical and stylistic changes to the Guide-<br />lines Manual. First, it amends the Commentary to &#167;2B1.1 (Theft, Property Destruc-<br />tion, and Fraud) to provide updated references to the definitions contained in 7 U.S.C.<br />&#167; 1a, which were renumbered by Public Law 111–203 (enacted July 21, 2010). Second,<br />it amends the Notes to the Drug Quantity Table in &#167;2D1.1 (Unlawful Manufacturing,<br />Importing, Exporting, or Trafficking (Including Possession with Intent to Commit<br />These Offenses); Attempt or Conspiracy) to provide updated references to the defini-<br />tion of tetrahydrocannabinols contained in 21 C.F.R. &#167; 1308.11(d), which were renum-<br />bered by 75 Fed. Reg. 79296 (December 20, 2010). Third, it makes several stylistic<br />revisions in the Guidelines Manual to change “court martial” to “court-martial.” The<br />changes are not substantive.</td><td>Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2013.</td></tr><tr><td class="n">778</td><td>Amendment 778</td><td>The Commentary to &#167;1B1.8 captioned “Application Notes” is amended in<br />Note 3 by striking “(Inadmissibility of Pleas” and inserting “Pleas”.<br />The Commentary to &#167;2M3.1 captioned “Application Notes” is amended in Note 1 by<br />striking “12958” and inserting “13526”.<br />The Commentary to &#167;8B2.1 captioned “Background” is amended by striking<br />“805(a)(2)(5)” and inserting “805(a)(5)”.<br />The Commentary to &#167;8D1.2 captioned “Application Note” is amended in Note 1 by<br />striking “3561(b)” and inserting “3561(c)”.</td><td>REASON FOR AMENDMENT: This amendment makes certain technical changes to Com-<br />mentary in the Guidelines Manual.

Application of Subsection (c).—As stated in subsection (c), if the case involves<br />a statutorily required minimum sentence and the court had the authority to<br />impose a sentence below the statutorily required minimum sentence pursuant<br />to a government motion to reflect the defendant’s substantial assistance to au-<br />thorities, then for purposes of this policy statement the amended guideline<br />range shall be determined without regard to the operation of &#167;5G1.1 (Sentenc-<br />ing on a Single Count of Conviction) and &#167;5G1.2 (Sentencing on Multiple<br />Counts of Conviction). For example:<br />(A) Defendant A is subject to a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment<br />of 120 months. The original guideline range at the time of sentencing<br />Amendment 780<br />54 ║ Supplement to Appendix C (November 1, 2016)<br />was 135 to 168 months, which is entirely above the mandatory mini-<br />mum, and the court imposed a sentence of 101 months pursuant to a<br />government motion to reflect the defendant’s substantial assistance to<br />authorities. The court determines that the amended guideline range as<br />calculated on the Sentencing Table is 108 to 135 months. Ordinarily,<br />&#167;5G1.1 would operate to restrict the amended guideline range to 120<br />to 135 months, to reflect the mandatory minimum term of imprison-<br />ment. For purposes of this policy statement, however, the amended<br />guideline range remains 108 to 135 months.<br />To the extent the court considers it appropriate to provide a reduction<br />comparably less than the amended guideline range pursuant to sub-<br />section (b)(2)(B), Defendant A’s original sentence of 101 months<br />amounted to a reduction of approximately 25 percent below the mini-<br />mum of the original guideline range of 135 months. Therefore, an<br />amended sentence of 81 months (representing a reduction of approxi-<br />mately 25 percent below the minimum of the amended guideline range<br />of 108 months) would amount to a comparable reduction and may be<br />appropriate.<br />(B) Defendant B is subject to a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment<br />of 120 months. The original guideline range at the time of sentencing<br />(as calculated on the Sentencing Table) was 108 to 135 months, which<br />was restricted by operation of &#167;5G1.1 to a range of 120 to 135 months.<br />See &#167;5G1.1(c)(2). The court imposed a sentence of 90 months pursuant<br />to a government motion to reflect the defendant’s substantial assis-<br />tance to authorities. The court determines that the amended guideline<br />range as calculated on the Sentencing Table is 87 to 108 months. Ordi-<br />narily, &#167;5G1.1 would operate to restrict the amended guideline range<br />to precisely 120 months, to reflect the mandatory minimum term of<br />imprisonment. See &#167;5G1.1(b). For purposes of this policy statement,<br />however, the amended guideline range is considered to be 87 to<br />108 months (i.e., unrestricted by operation of &#167;5G1.1 and the statutory<br />minimum of 120 months).<br />To the extent the court considers it appropriate to provide a reduction<br />comparably less than the amended guideline range pursuant to sub-<br />section (b)(2)(B), Defendant B’s original sentence of 90 months<br />amounted to a reduction of approximately 25 percent below the original<br />guideline range of 120 months. Therefore, an amended sentence of<br />65 months (representing a reduction of approximately 25 percent be-<br />low the minimum of the amended guideline range of 87 months) would<br />amount to a comparable reduction and may be appropriate.”.<br />The Commentary to &#167;1B1.10 captioned “Background” is amended by striking “subsec-<br />tion (c)” both places such term appears and inserting “subsection (d)”.</td><td>REASON FOR AMENDMENT: This amendment clarifies an application issue that has<br />arisen with respect to &#167;1B1.10 (Reduction in Term of Imprisonment as a Result of<br />Amended Guideline Range) (Policy Statement). Circuits have conflicting interpreta-<br />tions of when, if at all, &#167;1B1.10 provides that a statutory minimum continues to limit<br />the amount by which a defendant’s sentence may be reduced under 18 U.S.C.<br />&#167; 3582(c)(2) when the defendant’s original sentence was below the statutory minimum<br />due to substantial assistance.<br />Amendment 780<br />This issue arises in two situations. First, there are cases in which the defendant’s orig-<br />inal guideline range was above the mandatory minimum but the defendant received a<br />sentence below the mandatory minimum pursuant to a government motion for sub-<br />stantial assistance. For example, consider a case in which the mandatory minimum<br />was 240 months, the original guideline range was 262 to 327 months, and the defend-<br />ant’s original sentence was 160 months, representing a 39 percent reduction for sub-<br />stantial assistance below the bottom of the guideline range. In a sentence reduction<br />proceeding pursuant to Amendment 750, the amended guideline range as determined<br />on the Sentencing Table is 168 to 210 months, but after application of the “trumping”<br />mechanism in &#167;5G1.1 (Sentencing on a Single Count of Conviction), the mandatory<br />minimum sentence of 240 months is the guideline sentence. See &#167;5G1.1(b). Section<br />1B1.10(b)(2)(B) provides that such a defendant may receive a comparable 39 percent<br />reduction from the bottom of the amended guideline range, but circuits are split over<br />what to use as the bottom of the range.<br />The Eighth Circuit has taken the view that the bottom of the amended guideline range<br />in such a case would be 240 months, i.e., the guideline sentence that results after ap-<br />plication of the “trumping” mechanism in &#167;5G1.1. See United States v. Golden,<br />709 F.3d 1229, 1231–33 (8th Cir. 2013). In contrast, the Seventh Circuit has taken the<br />view that the bottom of the amended guideline range in such a case would be<br />168 months, i.e., the bottom of the amended range as determined by the Sentencing<br />Table, without application of the “trumping” mechanism in &#167;5G1.1. See United States<br />v. Wren, 706 F.3d 861, 863 (7th Cir. 2013). Each circuit found support for its view in<br />an Eleventh Circuit decision, United States v. Liberse, 688 F.3d 1198 (11th Cir. 2012),<br />which also discussed this issue.<br />Second, there are cases in which the defendant’s original guideline range as deter-<br />mined by the Sentencing Table was, at least in part, below the mandatory minimum,<br />and the defendant received a sentence below the mandatory minimum pursuant to a<br />government motion for substantial assistance. In these cases, the “trumping” mecha-<br />nism in &#167;5G1.1 operated at the original sentence to restrict the guideline range to be<br />no less than the mandatory minimum. For example, consider a case in which the orig-<br />inal Sentencing Table guideline range was 140 to 175 months but the mandatory min-<br />imum was 240 months, resulting (after operation of &#167;5G1.1) in a guideline sentence of<br />240 months. The defendant’s original sentence was 96 months, representing a 60 per-<br />cent reduction for substantial assistance below the statutory and guideline minimum.<br />In a sentence reduction proceeding, the amended Sentencing Table guideline range is<br />110 to 137 months, resulting (after operation of &#167;5G1.1) in a guideline sentence of<br />240 months. Section 1B1.10(b)(2)(B) provides that such a defendant may receive a re-<br />duction from the bottom of the amended guideline range, but circuits are split over<br />what to use as the bottom of the range.<br />The Eleventh Circuit, the Sixth Circuit, and the Second Circuit have taken the view<br />that the bottom of the amended range in such a case would remain 240 months, i.e., the<br />guideline sentence that results after application of the “trumping” mechanism in<br />&#167;5G1.1. See United States v. Glover, 686 F.3d 1203, 1208 (11th Cir. 2012); United<br />States v. Joiner, 727 F.3d 601 (6th Cir. 2013); United States v. Johnson, 732 F.3d 109<br />(2d Cir. 2013). Under these decisions, the defendant in the example would have an<br />original range of 240 months and an amended range of 240 months, and would not be<br />eligible for any reduction because the range has not been lowered. In contrast, the<br />Third Circuit and the District of Columbia Circuit have taken the view that the bottom<br />Amendment 781<br />56 ║ Supplement to Appendix C (November 1, 2016)<br />of the amended range in such a case would be 110 months, i.e., the bottom of the Sen-<br />tencing Table guideline range. See United States v. Savani, 733 F.3d 56, 66–7 (3d Cir.<br />2013); In re Sealed Case, 722 F.3d 361, 369–70 (D.C. Cir. 2013).<br />The amendment generally adopts the approach of the Third Circuit in Savani and the<br />District of Columbia Circuit in In re Sealed Case. It amends &#167;1B1.10 to specify that, if<br />the case involves a statutorily required minimum sentence and the court had the au-<br />thority to impose a sentence below the statutorily required minimum sentence pursu-<br />ant to a government motion to reflect the defendant’s substantial assistance to author-<br />ities, then for purposes of &#167;1B1.10 the amended guideline range shall be determined<br />without regard to the operation of &#167;5G1.1 and &#167;5G1.2. The amendment also adds a<br />new application note with examples.<br />This clarification ensures that defendants who provide substantial assistance to the<br />government in the investigation and prosecution of others have the opportunity to re-<br />ceive the full benefit of a reduction that accounts for that assistance. See USSG App. C.<br />Amend 759 (Reason for Amendment). As the Commission noted in the reason for that<br />amendment: “The guidelines and the relevant statutes have long recognized that de-<br />fendants who provide substantial assistance are differently situated than other de-<br />fendants and should be considered for a sentence below a guideline or statutory mini-<br />mum even when defendants who are otherwise similar (but did not provide substantial<br />assistance) are subject to a guideline or statutory minimum. Applying this principle<br />when the guideline range has been reduced and made available for retroactive appli-<br />cation under section 3582(c)(2) appropriately maintains this distinction and furthers<br />the purposes of sentencing.” Id.</td><td>Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2014.</td></tr><tr><td class="n">781</td><td>Amendment 781</td><td>Section 2A2.2(b) is amended by redesignating paragraphs (4) through (6)<br />as paragraphs (5) through (7), respectively; and by inserting after paragraph (3) the<br />following new paragraph (4):<br />“(4) If the offense involved strangling, suffocating, or attempting to strangle or suf-<br />focate a spouse, intimate partner, or dating partner, increase by 3 levels.<br />However, the cumulative adjustments from application of subdivisions (2), (3),<br />and (4) shall not exceed 12 levels.”.<br />The Commentary to &#167;2A2.2 captioned “Statutory Provisions” is amended by inserting<br />after “113(a)(2), (3), (6),” the following: “(8),”.<br />The Commentary to &#167;2A2.2 captioned “Application Notes” is amended in Note 1 by<br />striking “or (C)” and inserting “(C) strangling, suffocating, or attempting to strangle or<br />suffocate; or (D)”; and by adding at the end the following new paragraphs:<br />“ ‘Strangling’ and ‘suffocating’ have the meaning given those terms in 18 U.S.C. &#167; 113.<br />‘Spouse,’ ‘intimate partner,’ and ‘dating partner’ have the meaning given those terms<br />in 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2266.”;<br />Amendment 781<br />and in Note 4 by striking “(b)(6)” and inserting “(b)(7)”.<br />The Commentary to &#167;2A2.2 captioned “Background” is amended in the first paragraph<br />by striking “minor assaults” and inserting “other assaults”; by striking the comma af-<br />ter “serious bodily injury” and inserting a semicolon; and by striking the comma after<br />“cause bodily injury” and inserting “; strangling, suffocating, or attempting to strangle<br />or suffocate;”;<br />and in the paragraph that begins “Subsection” by striking “(b)(6)” both places it ap-<br />pears and inserting “(b)(7)”.<br />Section 2A2.3 is amended in the heading by striking “Minor Assault” and inserting<br />“Assault”.<br />Section 2A2.3(b)(1) is amended by inserting after “substantial bodily injury to” the fol-<br />lowing: “a spouse, intimate partner, or dating partner, or”.<br />The Commentary to &#167;2A2.3 captioned “Statutory Provisions” is amended by inserting<br />after “112,” the following: “113(a)(4), (5), (7),”.<br />The Commentary to &#167;2A2.3 captioned “Application Notes” is amended in Note 1 by<br />striking “ ‘Minor assault’ means a misdemeanor assault, or a felonious assault not cov-<br />ered by &#167;2A2.2 (Aggravated Assault).” and inserting the following new paragraph:<br />“ ‘Spouse,’ ‘intimate partner,’ and ‘dating partner’ have the meaning given those terms<br />in 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2266.”.<br />The Commentary to &#167;2A2.3 captioned “Background” is amended by striking “Minor<br />assault and battery are covered by this section.” and inserting the following: “This sec-<br />tion applies to misdemeanor assault and battery and to any felonious assault not cov-<br />ered by &#167;2A2.2 (Aggravated Assault).”.<br />Section 2A6.2(b)(1) is amended by striking “(C)” and inserting “(C) strangling, suffo-<br />cating, or attempting to strangle or suffocate; (D)”; by striking “(D) a pattern” and in-<br />serting “(E) a pattern”; and by striking “these aggravating factors” and inserting “sub-<br />divisions (A), (B), (C), (D), or (E)”.<br />The Commentary to &#167;2A6.2 captioned “Application Notes” is amended in Note 1 by<br />striking the paragraph referenced to “Stalking” as follows:<br />“ ‘Stalking’ means (A) traveling with the intent to kill, injure, harass, or intimidate<br />another person and, in the course of, or as a result of, such travel, placing the person<br />in reasonable fear of death or serious bodily injury to that person or an immediate<br />family member of that person; or (B) using the mail or any facility of interstate or<br />foreign commerce to engage in a course of conduct that places that person in reasonable<br />fear of the death of, or serious bodily injury to, that person or an immediate family<br />member of that person.

L.<br />No. 113–4 (March 7, 2013), which provided new and expanded criminal offenses and<br />increased penalties for certain crimes pertaining to assault, sexual abuse, stalking,<br />domestic violence, and human trafficking.<br />The Act established new assault offenses and enhanced existing assault offenses at<br />18 U.S.C. &#167; 113 (Assaults within maritime and territorial jurisdiction). In general, sec-<br />tion 113 sets forth a range of penalties for assaults within the special maritime and<br />territorial jurisdiction of the United States. The legislative history of the Act indicates<br />that Congress intended many of these changes to allow federal prosecutors to address<br />domestic violence against Native American women more effectively. Such violence of-<br />ten occurs in a series of incidents of escalating seriousness.<br />First, the amendment responds to changes in sections 113(a)(1) and (a)(2). Sec-<br />tion 113(a)(1) prohibits assault with intent to commit murder, and the Act amended it<br />to also prohibit assault with intent to commit a violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2241 (Aggra-<br />vated sexual abuse) or 2242 (Sexual abuse), with a statutory maximum term of impris-<br />onment of 20 years. Section 113(a)(2) prohibits assault with intent to commit any fel-<br />ony except murder, and prior to the Act had also excluded assault with intent to com-<br />mit a violation of Chapter 109A, including sections 2241, 2242, 2243 (Sexual abuse of<br />a minor or ward) and 2244 (Abusive sexual contact), with a statutory maximum term<br />of imprisonment of 10 years. The Act amended section 113(a)(2) to prohibit assault<br />with intent to commit any felony except murder or a violation of section 2241 or 2242.<br />The effect of the statutory change is that an assault with intent to commit a violation<br />of section 2243 or 2244 may now be prosecuted under section 113(a)(2). Offenses under<br />section 2241 and 2242 are referenced to &#167;2A3.1 (Criminal Sexual Abuse; Attempt to<br />Commit Criminal Sexual Abuse), and offenses under section 2243 and 2244 are refer-<br />enced to &#167;&#167;2A3.2 (Criminal Sexual Abuse of a Minor Under the Age of Sixteen Years<br />(Statutory Rape) or Attempt to Commit Such Acts); 2A3.3 (Criminal Sexual Abuse of<br />a Ward or Attempt to Commit Such Acts); and 2A3.4 (Abusive Sexual Contact or At-<br />tempt to Commit Abusive Sexual Contact).<br />The amendment amends Appendix A (Statutory Index) to reference the expanded of-<br />fense conduct prohibited by 18 U.S.C. &#167; 113(a)(1) to &#167;2A3.1 and to reference the ex-<br />panded offense conduct prohibited by 18 U.S.C. &#167; 113(a)(2) to &#167;&#167;2A3.2, 2A3.3, and<br />2A3.4. The Commission concluded that an assault offense committed with the intent<br />to commit a sexual abuse offense is analogous to, and in some cases more serious than,<br />an attempted sexual abuse offense under Chapter 109A, and the criminal sexual abuse<br />guidelines which apply to attempted sexual abuse offenses were therefore appropriate<br />for this conduct.<br />Amendment 781<br />60 ║ Supplement to Appendix C (November 1, 2016)<br />Second, the Act increased the statutory maximum penalty for violations of 18 U.S.C.<br />&#167; 113(a)(4) from six months to one year of imprisonment. Section 113(a)(4) prohibits<br />an assault by striking, beating, or wounding. Because the crime had been categorized<br />as a Class B misdemeanor, Appendix A did not previously include a reference for sec-<br />tion 113(a)(4). The amendment adds such a reference to &#167;2A2.3 (Assault). The Com-<br />mission determined that &#167;2A2.3 will provide appropriate punishment that is con-<br />sistent with the statutory maximum term of imprisonment, while sufficiently address-<br />ing the possible levels of bodily harm that may result to victims in individual cases of<br />assault by striking, beating, or wounding.<br />Third, the Act expanded 18 U.S.C. &#167; 113(a)(7), which prohibits assaults resulting in<br />substantial bodily injury to an individual who has not attained the age of sixteen years,<br />to also apply to assaults resulting in substantial bodily injury to a spouse, intimate<br />partner, or dating partner, and provides a statutory maximum term of imprisonment<br />of five years. Offenses under section 113(a)(7) are referenced in Appendix A to &#167;2A2.3<br />(Assault). The amendment broadened the scope of &#167;2A2.3(b)(1)(B), which provides a<br />4-level enhancement if the offense resulted in substantial bodily injury to an individual<br />under the age of sixteen years, to also provide a 4-level enhancement if the offense<br />resulted in substantial bodily injury to a spouse, intimate partner, or dating partner.<br />The Commission determined that because the expanded assaultive conduct of a victim<br />of domestic violence has the same statutory maximum term of imprisonment, the same<br />enhancement was warranted as for assaults of individuals under the age of sixteen<br />resulting in substantial bodily injury.<br />Fourth, the Act created a new section 113(a)(8) in title 18, which prohibits the assault<br />of a spouse, intimate partner, or dating partner by strangulation, suffocation, or at-<br />tempting to strangle or suffocate, with a statutory maximum term of imprisonment of<br />ten years. After reviewing legislative history, public comment, testimony at a public<br />hearing on February 13, 2014, and data, the Commission determined that strangula-<br />tion and suffocation of a spouse, intimate partner, or dating partner represents a sig-<br />nificant harm not addressed by existing guidelines and specific offense characteristics.<br />Comment and testimony that the Commission received indicated that strangulation<br />and suffocation in the domestic violence context is serious conduct that warrants en-<br />hanced punishment regardless of whether it results in a provable injury that would<br />lead to a bodily injury enhancement; this conduct harms victims physically and psy-<br />chologically and can be a predictor of future serious or lethal violence. Testimony and<br />data also indicated that cases of strangulation and suffocation often involve other bod-<br />ily injury to a victim separate from the strangulation and suffocation. Congress specif-<br />ically addressed strangulation and suffocation in the domestic violence context, and<br />testimony and data indicated that almost all cases involving this conduct occur in that<br />context and that strangulation and suffocation is most harmful in such cases.<br />Accordingly, the amendment amends Appendix A to reference section 113(a)(8) to<br />&#167;2A2.2 (Aggravated Assault) and amends the Commentary to &#167;2A2.2 to provide that<br />the term “aggravated assault” includes an assault involving strangulation, suffocation,<br />or an attempt to strangle or suffocate. The amendment amends &#167;2A2.2 to provide a<br />3-level enhancement at &#167;2A2.2(b)(4) for strangling, suffocating, or attempting to stran-<br />gle or suffocate a spouse, intimate partner, or dating partner. The amendment also<br />provides that the cumulative impact of the enhancement for use of a weapon at<br />&#167;2A2.2(b)(2), bodily injury at &#167;2A2.2(b)(3), and strangulation or suffocation at<br />&#167;2A2.2(b)(4) is capped at 12 levels. The Commission determined that the cap would<br />assure that these three specific offense characteristics, which data suggests co-occur<br />Amendment 781<br />frequently, will enhance the ultimate sentence without leading to an excessively severe<br />result.<br />Although the amendment refers section 113(a)(8) offenses to &#167;2A2.2, it also amends<br />&#167;2A6.2 (Stalking or Domestic Violence) to address cases involving strangulation, suf-<br />focation, or attempting to strangle or suffocate, as a conforming change. The amend-<br />ment adds strangulation and suffocation as a new aggravating factor at &#167;2A6.2(b)(1),<br />which results in a 2-level enhancement, or in a 4-level enhancement if it applies in<br />conjunction with another aggravating factor such as bodily injury or the use of a<br />weapon.<br />Fifth, the amendment removes the term “minor assault” from the Guidelines Manual.<br />Misdemeanor assaults and other felonious assaults are referenced to &#167;2A2.3, which<br />prior to this amendment was titled “Minor Assault.” Informed by public comment, the<br />Commission determined that use of the term “minor” is inconsistent with the severity<br />of the underlying crimes and does a disservice to the victims and communities affected.<br />Therefore, the amendment changes the title of &#167;2A2.3 to “Assault,” and it removes<br />other references to “minor assault” from the Background and Commentary sections of<br />&#167;&#167;2A2.2 and 2A2.3. This is a stylistic change that does not affect the application of<br />&#167;2A2.3.<br />Sixth, the amendment amended the Commentary to &#167;5D1.1 (Imposition of a Term of<br />Supervised Release) to provide additional guidance on the imposition of supervised<br />release for domestic violence and stalking offenders. The amendment describes the<br />statutory requirements pursuant to 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3583(a) if a defendant is convicted for<br />the first time of a domestic violence offense as defined in 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3561(b). Under<br />section 3583, a term of supervised release is required, and the defendant is also re-<br />quired to attend an approved rehabilitation program if one is available within a<br />50-mile radius from the defendant’s residence.<br />The Commission received public comment and testimony that supervised release<br />should be recommended in every case of domestic violence and stalking, and the Com-<br />mission’s sentencing data showed that in more than ninety percent of the cases sen-<br />tenced under &#167;2A6.2, supervised release was imposed. Based on this comment, testi-<br />mony, and data, the amendment amends the Commentary to &#167;5D1.1 to provide that in<br />any other case involving either a domestic violence or a stalking offense, it is “highly<br />recommended” that a term of supervised release be imposed.<br />Seventh, the amendment responds to changes made by the Act amending the federal<br />statutes related to stalking and domestic violence. For the crimes of interstate domes-<br />tic violence (18 U.S.C. &#167; 2261), stalking (18 U.S.C. &#167; 2261A), and interstate violation<br />of a protective order (18 U.S.C. &#167; 2262), the Act expanded the scope of each offense to<br />provide that a defendant’s mere presence in a special maritime or territorial jurisdic-<br />tion is sufficient for purposes of satisfying the jurisdictional element of the crimes. The<br />Act also revised the prohibited conduct set forth in section 2261A to now include stalk-<br />ing with intent to “intimidate” the victim, and it added the use of an “electronic com-<br />munication service” or “electronic communication system” as prohibited means of com-<br />mitting the crime.<br />The amendment updates the definition of “stalking” in &#167;2A6.2 to reflect these changes<br />by tying the definition to the conduct described in 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2261A. The Commission<br />determined that such a change would simplify the application of &#167;2A6.2, while also<br />ensuring that the definition of stalking remains consistent with any future statutory<br />changes.<br />Amendment 781<br />62 ║ Supplement to Appendix C (November 1, 2016)<br />Eighth, the Act amended 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1375a (Regulation of international marriage bro-<br />kers) by reorganizing existing offenses and increasing the statutory maximum term of<br />imprisonment for knowing violations of the regulations concerning marriage brokers<br />from one year to five years. The Act also added a new criminal provision for “knowingly<br />and with intent to defraud another person outside of the United States in order to<br />recruit, solicit, entice, or induce that person into entering a dating or matrimonial re-<br />lationship,” making false or fraudulent representations regarding the background in-<br />formation required to be provided to an international marriage brokers. The new of-<br />fense has a statutory maximum term of imprisonment of one year. The amendment<br />referenced this new offense in Appendix A to &#167;2B1.1 (Larceny, Embezzlement, and<br />Other Forms of Theft; Offenses Involving Stolen Property; Property Damage or De-<br />struction; Fraud and Deceit; Forgery; Offenses involving Altered or Counterfeit Instru-<br />ments Other than Counterfeit Bearer Obligations of the United States). The Commis-<br />sion concluded that &#167;2B1.1 is the appropriate guideline because the elements of the<br />new offense include fraud and deceit. The amendment also amended Appendix A by<br />revising the other criminal subsections, which continue to be referred to &#167;2H3.1 (In-<br />terception of Communications; Eavesdropping; Disclosure of Certain Private or Pro-<br />tected Information), to accord with the reorganization of the statute.<br />Ninth, the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act, passed as part of the<br />Act, included a provision expanding subsection (c) of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2423 (Transportation<br />of minors), which had previously prohibited U.S. citizens or permanent residents who<br />traveled abroad from engaging in illicit sexual conduct. After the Act, the same prohi-<br />bition now also applies to those individuals who reside temporarily or permanently in<br />a foreign country and engage in such conduct. Section 2423 contains four offenses, set<br />forth in subsections (a) through (d), each of which prohibits sexual conduct with mi-<br />nors. Prior to the amendment, Appendix A referenced sections 2423(a) and 2423(b) to<br />&#167;2G1.3 (Commercial Sex Act or Prohibited Sexual Conduct with a Minor; Transporta-<br />tion of Minors; Travel to Engage in Commercial Sex or Prohibited Sexual Conduct with<br />a Minor; Sex Trafficking of Children), but provided no reference for sections 2423(c) or<br />2423(d), which prohibits arranging, inducing, procuring, or facilitating the travel of a<br />person for illicit sexual conduct, for the purpose of commercial advantage or financial<br />gain. Both subsections (c) and (d) provide a 30 year statutory maximum term of im-<br />prisonment.<br />The amendment adds references in Appendix A for 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2423(c) and (d). Based<br />on the seriousness of the prohibited conduct, the severity of the penalties, and the vul-<br />nerability of the victims involved, the Commission concluded that 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2423(c)<br />and (d) should also be referenced in Appendix A to &#167;2G1.3.<br />Tenth, the Act created a new Class A misdemeanor offense at 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1597 prohib-<br />iting the knowing destruction, concealment, confiscation or possession of an actual or<br />purported passport or other immigration documents of another individual if done in<br />the course of violating or with the intent to violate 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1351, relating to fraud<br />in foreign labor contracting, or 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1324, relating to bringing in or harboring<br />certain aliens. The new offense also prohibits this conduct if it is done in order to,<br />without lawful authority, maintain, prevent, or restrict the labor or services of the in-<br />dividual, and the knowing obstruction, attempt to obstruct, or interference with or pre-<br />vention of the enforcement of section 1597. Section 1597 has a statutory maximum<br />term of imprisonment of one year.<br />The amendment references this misdemeanor offense to &#167;2X5.2 (Class A Misdemean-<br />ors (Not Covered by Another Specific Offense Guideline)). This reference comports with<br />Amendment 782<br />the Commission’s intent when it promulgated &#167;2X5.2, as stated in Amendment 685<br />(effective November 1, 2006), that the Commission will reference new Class A misde-<br />meanor offenses either to &#167;2X5.2 or to another, more specific Chapter Two guideline,<br />if appropriate. The Commission determined that with a base offense level of 6, &#167;2X5.2<br />covers the range of sentencing possibilities that are available for defendants convicted<br />of this offense, regardless of their criminal history. The Commission may consider ref-<br />erencing section 1597 to another substantive guideline in the future after more infor-<br />mation becomes available regarding the type of conduct that constitutes the typical<br />violation and the aggravating or mitigating factors that may apply.<br />Finally, the amendment removes from Appendix A the guideline references for two<br />jurisdictional statutes in title 18 related to crimes committed within Indian country.<br />Section 1152, also known as the General Crimes Act, grants federal jurisdiction for<br />federal offenses committed by non-Indians within Indian country. Section 1153, also<br />known as the Major Crimes Act, grants federal jurisdiction over Indians who commit<br />certain enumerated offenses within Indian country. The Act expanded section 1153 to<br />include any felony assault under section 113. Because sections 1152 and 1153 are<br />simply jurisdictional statutes that do not provide substantive offenses, the Commission<br />determined there is no need for Appendix A to provide a guidelines reference for those<br />statutes.</td><td>Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2014.</td></tr><tr><td class="n">782</td><td>Amendment 782</td><td>Section 2D1.1(c) is amended by striking paragraph (17);

Attempt or Conspiracy) incorporate<br />the statutory mandatory minimum penalties for such offenses.<br />When Congress passed the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986, Pub. L. 99–570, the Commis-<br />sion responded by generally incorporating the statutory mandatory minimum sen-<br />tences into the guidelines and extrapolating upward and downward to set guideline<br />sentencing ranges for all drug quantities. The quantity thresholds in the Drug Quan-<br />tity Table were set so as to provide base offense levels corresponding to guideline<br />ranges that were slightly above the statutory mandatory minimum penalties. Accord-<br />ingly, offenses involving drug quantities that trigger a five-year statutory minimum<br />were assigned a base offense level (level 26) corresponding to a sentencing guideline<br />range of 63 to 78 months for a defendant in Criminal History Category I (a guideline<br />range that exceeds the five-year statutory minimum for such offenses by at least three<br />months). Similarly, offenses that trigger a ten-year statutory minimum were assigned<br />a base offense level (level 32) corresponding to a sentencing guideline range of 121 to<br />151 months for a defendant in Criminal History Category I (a guideline range that<br />exceeds the ten-year statutory minimum for such offenses by at least one month). The<br />base offense levels for drug quantities above and below the mandatory minimum<br />threshold quantities were extrapolated upward and downward to set guideline sen-<br />tencing ranges for all drug quantities, see &#167;2D1.1, comment. (backg’d.), with a mini-<br />mum base offense level of 6 and a maximum base offense level of 38 for most drug<br />types.<br />This amendment changes how the applicable statutory mandatory minimum penalties<br />are incorporated into the Drug Quantity Table while maintaining consistency with<br />such penalties. See 28 U.S.C. &#167; 994(b)(1) (providing that each sentencing range must<br />be “consistent with all pertinent provisions of title 18, United States Code”);<br />see also 28 U.S.C. &#167; 994(a) (providing that the Commission shall promulgate guide-<br />lines and policy statements “consistent with all pertinent provisions of any Federal<br />statute”).<br />Specifically, the amendment reduces by two levels the offense levels assigned to the<br />quantities that trigger the statutory mandatory minimum penalties, resulting in cor-<br />responding guideline ranges that include the mandatory minimum penalties. Accord-<br />ingly, offenses involving drug quantities that trigger a five-year statutory minimum<br />are assigned a base offense level of 24 (51 to 63 months at Criminal History Category I,<br />which includes the five-year (60 month) statutory minimum for such offenses), and<br />offenses involving drug quantities that trigger a ten-year statutory minimum are as-<br />signed a base offense level of 30 (97 to 121 months at Criminal History Category I,<br />Amendment 782<br />which includes the ten-year (120 month) statutory minimum for such offenses). Of-<br />fense levels for quantities above and below the mandatory minimum threshold quan-<br />tities similarly are adjusted downward by two levels, except that the minimum base<br />offense level of 6 and the maximum base offense level of 38 for most drug types is<br />retained, as are previously existing minimum and maximum base offense levels for<br />particular drug types.<br />The amendment also makes parallel changes to the quantity tables in &#167;2D1.11 (Un-<br />lawfully Distributing, Importing, Exporting or Possessing a Listed Chemical; Attempt<br />or Conspiracy), which apply to offenses involving chemical precursors of controlled sub-<br />stances. Section 2D1.11 is generally structured to provide offense levels that are tied<br />to, but less severe than, the base offense levels in &#167;2D1.1 for offenses involving the<br />final product.<br />In considering this amendment, the Commission held a hearing on March 13, 2014,<br />and heard expert testimony from the Executive Branch, including the Attorney Gen-<br />eral and the Director of the Federal Bureau of Prisons, defense practitioners, state and<br />local law enforcement, and interested community representatives. The Commission<br />also received substantial written public comment, including from the Federal judici-<br />ary, members of Congress, academicians, community organizations, law enforcement<br />groups, and individual members of the public.<br />The Commission determined that setting the base offense levels slightly above the<br />mandatory minimum penalties is no longer necessary to achieve its stated purpose.<br />Previously, the Commission has stated that “[t]he base offense levels are set at guide-<br />line ranges slightly higher than the mandatory minimum levels [levels 26 and 32] to<br />permit some downward adjustment for defendants who plead guilty or otherwise coop-<br />erate with authorities.” However, changes in the law and recent experience with simi-<br />lar reductions in base offense levels for crack cocaine offenses indicate that setting the<br />base offense levels above the mandatory minimum penalties is no longer necessary to<br />provide adequate incentives to plead guilty or otherwise cooperate with authorities.<br />In 1994, after the initial selection of levels 26 and 32, Congress enacted the “safety<br />valve” provision, which applies to certain non-violent drug defendants and allows the<br />court, without a government motion, to impose a sentence below a statutory mandatory<br />minimum penalty if the court finds, among other things, that the defendant “has truth-<br />fully provided to the Government all information and evidence the defendant has con-<br />cerning the offense or offenses that were part of the same course of conduct or of a<br />common scheme or plan.” See 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(f). The guidelines incorporate the<br />“safety valve” at &#167;5C1.2 (Limitation on Applicability of Statutory Minimum Sentences<br />in Certain Cases) and, furthermore, provide a 2-level reduction if the defendant meets<br />the “safety valve” criteria. See &#167;2D1.1(b)(16).<br />These statutory and guideline provisions, which are unrelated to the guideline range’s<br />relationship to the mandatory minimum, provide adequate incentive to plead guilty.<br />Commission data indicate that defendants charged with a mandatory minimum pen-<br />alty in fact are more likely to plead guilty if they qualify for the “safety valve” than if<br />they do not. In fiscal year 2012, drug trafficking defendants charged with a mandatory<br />minimum penalty had a plea rate of 99.6 percent if they qualified for the “safety valve”<br />and a plea rate of 93.9 percent if they did not.<br />Recent experience with similar reductions in the base offense levels for crack cocaine<br />offenses indicates that the amendment should not negatively affect the rates at which<br />Amendment 782<br />72 ║ Supplement to Appendix C (November 1, 2016)<br />offenders plead guilty or otherwise cooperate with authorities. Similar to this amend-<br />ment, the Commission in 2007 amended the Drug Quantity Table for cocaine base<br />(“crack” cocaine) so that the quantities that trigger mandatory minimum penalties<br />were assigned base offense levels 24 and 30, rather than 26 and 32. See USSG App. C,<br />Amendment 706 (effective November 1, 2007). In 2010, in implementing the emergency<br />directive in section 8 of the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010, Pub. L. 111–220, the Commis-<br />sion moved crack cocaine offenses back to a guideline penalty structure based on lev-<br />els 26 and 32.<br />During the period when crack cocaine offenses had a guideline penalty structure based<br />on levels 24 and 30, the overall rates at which crack cocaine defendants pled guilty<br />remained stable. Specifically, in the fiscal year before the 2007 amendment took effect,<br />the plea rate for crack cocaine defendants was 93.1 percent. In the two fiscal years<br />after the 2007 amendment took effect, the plea rates for such defendants were 95.2 per-<br />cent and 94.0 percent, respectively. For those same fiscal years, the overall rates at<br />which crack cocaine defendants received substantial assistance departures under<br />&#167;5K1.1 (Substantial Assistance to Authorities) were 27.8 percent in the fiscal year be-<br />fore the 2007 amendment took effect and 25.3 percent and 25.6 percent in the two fiscal<br />years after the 2007 amendment took effect. This recent experience indicates that this<br />amendment, which is similar in nature to the 2007 crack cocaine amendment, should<br />not negatively affect the willingness of defendants to plead guilty or otherwise cooper-<br />ate with authorities. See 28 U.S.C. &#167; 991(b) (specifying that sentencing policies are to<br />“reflect, to the extent practicable, advancement in knowledge of human behavior as it<br />relates to the criminal justice process”).<br />The amendment also reflects the fact that the guidelines now more adequately differ-<br />entiate among drug trafficking offenders than when the Drug Quantity Table was ini-<br />tially established. Since the initial selection of offense levels 26 and 32, the guidelines<br />have been amended many times — often in response to congressional directives — to<br />provide a greater emphasis on the defendant’s conduct and role in the offense rather<br />than on drug quantity. The version of &#167;2D1.1 in the original 1987 Guidelines Manual<br />contained a single specific offense characteristic: a 2-level enhancement if a firearm or<br />other dangerous weapon was possessed. Section 2D1.1 in effect at the time of this<br />amendment contains fourteen enhancements and three downward adjustments (in-<br />cluding the “mitigating role cap” provided in subsection (a)(5)). These numerous ad-<br />justments, both increasing and decreasing offense levels based on specific conduct, re-<br />duce the need to rely on drug quantity in setting the guideline penalties for drug traf-<br />ficking offenders as a proxy for culpability, and the amendment permits these adjust-<br />ments to differentiate among offenders more effectively.<br />The amendment was also motived by the significant overcapacity and costs of the Fed-<br />eral Bureau of Prisons. The Sentencing Reform Act directs the Commission to ensure<br />that the sentencing guidelines are “formulated to minimize the likelihood that the Fed-<br />eral prison population will exceed the capacity of the Federal prisons.” See 28 U.S.C.<br />&#167; 994(g). Reducing the federal prison population and the costs of incarceration has be-<br />come an urgent consideration. The Commission observed that the federal prisons are<br />now 32 percent overcapacity, and drug trafficking offenders account for approximately<br />50 percent of the federal prison population (100,114 of 199,810 inmates as of Octo-<br />ber 26, 2013, for whom the Commission could determine the offense of conviction).<br />Spending on federal prisons exceeds $6 billion a year, or more than 25 percent of the<br />entire budget for the Department of Justice. The Commission received testimony from<br />the Department of Justice and others that spending on federal prisons is now crowding<br />out resources available for federal prosecutors and law enforcement, aid to state and<br />Amendment 783<br />local law enforcement, crime victim services, and crime prevention programs, all of<br />which promote public safety.<br />In response to these concerns, the Commission considered the amendment an appro-<br />priate step toward alleviating the overcapacity of the federal prisons. Based on an<br />analysis of the 24,968 offenders sentenced under &#167;2D1.1 in fiscal year 2012, the Com-<br />mission estimates the amendment will affect the sentences of 17,457 — or 69.9 percent<br />— of drug trafficking offenders sentenced under &#167;2D1.1, and their average sentence<br />will be reduced by 11 months — or 17.7 percent — from 62 months to 51 months. The<br />Commission estimates these sentence reductions will correspond to a reduction in the<br />federal prison population of approximately 6,500 inmates within five years after its<br />effective date.<br />The Commission carefully weighed public safety concerns and, based on past experi-<br />ence, existing statutory and guideline enhancements, and expert testimony, concluded<br />that the amendment should not jeopardize public safety. In particular, the Commission<br />was informed by its studies that compared the recidivism rates for offenders who were<br />released early as a result of retroactive application of the Commission’s 2007 crack<br />cocaine amendment with a control group of offenders who served their full terms of<br />imprisonment. See USSG App. C, Amendment 713 (effective March 3, 2008). The Com-<br />mission detected no statistically significant difference in the rates of recidivism for the<br />two groups of offenders after two years, and again after five years. This study suggests<br />that modest reductions in drug penalties such as those provided by the amendment<br />will not increase the risk of recidivism.<br />Furthermore, existing statutory enhancements, such as those available under<br />18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c), and guideline enhancements for offenders who possess firearms,<br />use violence, have an aggravating role in the offense, or are repeat or career offenders,<br />ensure that the most dangerous or serious offenders will continue to receive appropri-<br />ately severe sentences. In addition, the Drug Quantity Table as amended still provides<br />a base offense level of 38 for offenders who traffic the greatest quantities of most drug<br />types and, therefore, sentences for these offenders will not be reduced. Similarly, the<br />Drug Quantity Table as amended maintains minimum base offense levels that pre-<br />clude sentences of straight probation for drug trafficking offenders with small quanti-<br />ties of most drug types.<br />Finally, the Commission relied on testimony from the Department of Justice that the<br />amendment would not undermine public safety or law enforcement initiatives. To the<br />contrary, the Commission received testimony from several stakeholders that the<br />amendment would permit resources otherwise dedicated to housing prisoners to be<br />used to reduce overcrowding, enhance programming designed to reduce the risk of re-<br />cidivism, and to increase law enforcement and crime prevention efforts, thereby en-<br />hancing public safety.</td><td>Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2014.</td></tr><tr><td class="n">783</td><td>Amendment 783</td><td>Section 2D1.1(b) is amended by redesignating paragraphs (14) through<br />(16) as paragraphs (15) through (17), respectively; and by inserting after para-<br />graph (13) the following new paragraph (14):<br />Amendment 783<br />74 ║ Supplement to Appendix C (November 1, 2016)<br />“(14) If (A) the offense involved the cultivation of marihuana on state or federal land<br />or while trespassing on tribal or private land; and (B) the defendant receives<br />an adjustment under &#167;3B1.1 (Aggravating Role), increase by 2 levels.”.<br />The Commentary to &#167;2D1.1 captioned “Application Notes” is amended in Note 16 by<br />striking “(b)(14)(D)” and inserting “(b)(15)(D)”; by redesignating Notes 19 through 26<br />as Notes 20 through 27, respectively; and by inserting after Note 18 the following new<br />Note 19:<br />“19.

The amendment adds a new specific offense<br />characteristic at subsection (b)(14) of &#167;2D1.1 (Unlawful Manufacturing, Importing, Ex-<br />porting or Trafficking (Including Possession with Intent to Commit These Offenses);<br />Attempt or Conspiracy). The new specific offense characteristic provides an increase of<br />two levels if the defendant receives an adjustment under &#167;3B1.1 (Aggravating Role)<br />Amendment 784<br />and the offense involved the cultivation of marihuana on state or federal land or while<br />trespassing on tribal or private land.<br />The amendment responds to concerns raised by federal and local elected officials, law<br />enforcement groups, trade groups, environmental advocacy groups and others, espe-<br />cially in areas of the country where unlawful outdoor marihuana cultivation is occur-<br />ring with increasing frequency. The concerns included the fact that such operations<br />typically involve acts such as clearing existing vegetation, diverting natural water<br />sources for irrigation, using potentially harmful chemicals, killing wild animals, and<br />leaving trash and debris at the site. The concerns also included the risk to public safety<br />of marihuana cultivation operations on federal or state land or while trespassing on<br />tribal or private land. Additionally, when an operation is located on public land or on<br />private land without the owner’s permission, the operation deprives the public or the<br />owner of lawful access to and use of the land.<br />Accordingly, this amendment provides an increase of two levels when a marihuana<br />cultivation operation is located on state or federal land or while trespassing on tribal<br />or private land, but only applies to defendants who received an adjustment under<br />&#167;3B1.1 (Aggravating Role). These defendants are more culpable and have greater de-<br />cision-making authority in the operation. The amendment also adds commentary in<br />&#167;2D1.1 at Application Note 19 clarifying that, consistent with ordinary guideline oper-<br />ation, the new increase may be applied cumulatively with the existing enhancement<br />at subsection (b)(13)(A) of &#167;2D1.1, which applies if an offense involved certain conduct<br />relating to hazardous or toxic substances or waste.</td><td>Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2014.</td></tr><tr><td class="n">784</td><td>Amendment 784</td><td>Section 2K2.1(c)(1) is amended by inserting after “firearm or ammuni-<br />tion” both places it appears the following: “cited in the offense of conviction”.<br />The Commentary to &#167;2K2.1 captioned “Application Notes” is amended in Note 14 by<br />striking “ ‘In Connection With’.—” and inserting “Application of Subsections (b)(6)(B)<br />and (c)(1).—”;<br />in Note 14(A) by adding at the end the following: “However, subsection (c)(1) contains<br />the additional requirement that the firearm or ammunition be cited in the offense of<br />conviction.”;<br />in Note 14(B) by striking “application of subsections (b)(6)(B) and (c)(1)” and inserting<br />“application of subsections (b)(6)(B) and, if the firearm was cited in the offense of con-<br />viction, (c)(1)”;<br />and by adding at the end of Note 14 the following:<br />“(E) Relationship Between the Instant Offense and the Other Offense.—In deter-<br />mining whether subsections (b)(6)(B) and (c)(1) apply, the court must consider<br />the relationship between the instant offense and the other offense, consistent<br />with relevant conduct principles.

Defendant A’s offense of<br />conviction is for unlawfully possessing a shotgun on October 15. The<br />court determines that, on the preceding February 10, Defendant A<br />used the shotgun in connection with a robbery. Ordinarily, under these<br />circumstances, subsection (b)(6)(B) applies, and the cross reference in<br />subsection (c)(1) also applies if it results in a greater offense level.<br />Ordinarily, the unlawful possession of the shotgun on February 10 will<br />be ‘part of the same course of conduct or common scheme or plan’ as<br />the unlawful possession of the same shotgun on October 15.<br />See &#167;1B1.3(a)(2) and accompanying commentary (including, in partic-<br />ular, the factors discussed in Application Note 9 to &#167;1B1.3). The use of<br />the shotgun ‘in connection with’ the robbery is relevant conduct be-<br />cause it is a factor specified in subsections (b)(6)(B) and (c)(1).<br />See &#167;1B1.3(a)(4) (‘any other information specified in the applicable<br />guideline’).<br />(ii) Firearm Not Cited in the Offense of Conviction. Defendant B’s offense<br />of conviction is for unlawfully possessing a shotgun on October 15. The<br />court determines that, on the preceding February 10, Defendant B un-<br />lawfully possessed a handgun (not cited in the offense of conviction)<br />and used the handgun in connection with a robbery.<br />Subsection (b)(6)(B). In determining whether subsection (b)(6)(B) ap-<br />plies, the threshold question for the court is whether the two unlawful<br />possession offenses (the shotgun on October 15 and the handgun on<br />February 10) were ‘part of the same course of conduct or common<br />scheme or plan’. See &#167;1B1.3(a)(2) and accompanying commentary (in-<br />cluding, in particular, the factors discussed in Application Note 9 to<br />&#167;1B1.3).<br />If they were, then the handgun possession offense is relevant conduct<br />to the shotgun possession offense, and the use of the handgun ‘in con-<br />nection with’ the robbery is relevant conduct because it is a factor spec-<br />ified in subsection (b)(6)(B). See &#167;1B1.3(a)(4) (‘any other information<br />specified in the applicable guideline’). Accordingly, subsection (b)(6)(B)<br />applies.<br />On the other hand, if the court determines that the two unlawful pos-<br />session offenses were not ‘part of the same course of conduct or common<br />scheme or plan,’ then the handgun possession offense is not relevant<br />conduct to the shotgun possession offense and subsection (b)(6)(B) does<br />not apply.<br />Subsection (c)(1). Under these circumstances, the cross reference in<br />subsection (c)(1) does not apply, because the handgun was not cited in<br />the offense of conviction.”.<br />Amendment 784</td><td>REASON FOR AMENDMENT: This amendment addresses cases in which the defendant is<br />convicted of a firearms offense (in particular, being a felon in possession of a firearm)<br />and also possessed a firearm in connection with another offense, such as robbery or<br />attempted murder.<br />In such a case, the defendant is sentenced under the firearms guideline, &#167;2K2.1 (Un-<br />lawful Receipt, Possession, or Transportation of Firearms or Ammunition; Prohibited<br />Transactions Involving Firearms or Ammunition). If the defendant possessed any fire-<br />arm in connection with another felony offense, subsection (b)(6)(B) provides a 4-level<br />enhancement and a minimum offense level of 18. If the defendant possessed any fire-<br />arm in connection with another offense, subsection (c)(1) provides a cross reference to<br />the offense guideline applicable to the other offense, if it results in a higher offense<br />level. (For example, if the defendant possessed any firearm in connection with a rob-<br />bery, a cross reference to the robbery guideline may apply.)<br />This amendment is a result of the Commission’s review of the operation of subsections<br />(b)(6)(B) and (c)(1). The review was prompted in part because circuits have been fol-<br />lowing a range of approaches in determining whether these provisions apply. Several<br />circuits have taken the view that subsections (b)(6)(B) and (c)(1) apply only if the other<br />offense is a “groupable” offense under &#167;3D1.2(d). See, e.g., United States v. Horton,<br />693 F.3d 463, 478–79 (4th Cir. 2012) (felon in possession used a firearm in connection<br />with a murder, but the cross reference does not apply because murder is not “groupa-<br />ble”); United States v. Settle, 414 F.3d 629, 632–33 (6th Cir. 2005) (attempted murder);<br />United States v. Jones, 313 F.3d 1019, 1023 n.3 (7th Cir. 2002) (murder); United States<br />v. Williams, 431 F.3d 767, 772–73 &amp; n.9 (11th Cir. 2005) (aggravated assault).<br />But see United States v. Kulick, 629 F.3d 165, 170 (3d Cir. 2010) (felon in possession<br />used a firearm in connection with extortion; the cross reference may apply even though<br />extortion is not “groupable”); United States v. Gonzales, 996 F.2d 88, 92 n.6 (5th Cir.<br />1993) (relevant conduct principles do not restrict the application of subsec-<br />tion (b)(6)(B)); United States v. Outley, 348 F.3d 476 (5th Cir. 2003) (relevant conduct<br />principles do not restrict the application of subsection (c)(1)).<br />The amendment clarifies how relevant conduct principles operate in determining<br />whether subsections (b)(6)(B) and (c)(1) apply. Subsections (b)(6)(B) and (c)(1) are not<br />intended to apply only when the other felony offense is a “groupable” offense. Such an<br />approach would result in unwarranted disparities, with defendants who possess a fire-<br />arm in connection with a “groupable” offense (such as a drug offense) being subject to<br />higher penalties than defendants who possess a firearm in connection with a “non-<br />groupable” offense (such as murder or robbery). Instead, the central question for the<br />court in these cases is whether the defendant’s two firearms offenses — the firearms<br />offense of conviction, and his unlawful possession of a firearm in connection with the<br />other felony offense — were “part of the same course of conduct or common scheme or<br />plan.” See &#167;1B1.3(a)(2). The amendment adds examples to the commentary to clarify<br />how relevant conduct principles are intended to operate in this context.<br />The amendment also responds to concerns regarding the impact of subsection (c)(1),<br />particularly in cases in which the defendant was convicted of unlawfully possessing a<br />firearm on one occasion but was found to have possessed a different firearm on another<br />occasion in connection with another, more serious, offense. Because unlawfully pos-<br />sessing a firearm is an offense based on a status (i.e., being a felon) that can continue<br />for many years, the cross reference at subsection (c)(1) may, in effect, expose such a<br />defendant to the highest offense level of any crime he may have committed at any time,<br />regardless of its connection to the instant offense.<br />Amendment 785<br />78 ║ Supplement to Appendix C (November 1, 2016)<br />While relevant conduct principles provide a limitation on the scope of subsection (c)(1)<br />(and, as discussed above, this amendment clarifies how those principles operate in this<br />context), the Commission determined that a further limitation on the scope of subsec-<br />tion (c)(1) is appropriate. Specifically, the instant offense and the other offense must<br />be related to each other by, at a minimum, having an identifiable firearm in common.<br />Accordingly, the amendment revises the cross reference so that it applies only to the<br />particular firearm or firearms cited in the offense of conviction.</td><td>Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2014.</td></tr><tr><td class="n">785</td><td>Amendment 785</td><td>The Commentary to &#167;2L1.1 captioned “Application Notes” is amended in<br />Note 5 after “vehicle” by striking the comma and inserting a semicolon; after “vessel”<br />by striking “, or” and inserting a semicolon; and after “inhumane condition” by insert-<br />ing the following: “; or guiding persons through, or abandoning persons in, a dangerous<br />or remote geographic area without adequate food, water, clothing, or protection from<br />the elements”.</td><td>REASON FOR AMENDMENT: This amendment accounts for the risks of death, injury,<br />starvation, dehydration, or exposure that aliens potentially face when transported<br />through dangerous and remote geographical areas, e.g., along the southern border of<br />the United States.<br />Section 2L1.1 (Smuggling, Transporting, or Harboring an Unlawful Alien) currently<br />has an enhancement at subsection (b)(6), which provides for a 2-level increase and a<br />minimum offense level of 18, for intentionally or recklessly creating a substantial risk<br />of death or serious bodily injury to another person. The Commentary for subsec-<br />tion (b)(6), Application Note 5, explains that &#167;2L1.1(b)(6) may apply to a “wide variety<br />of conduct” and provides as examples “transporting persons in the trunk or engine<br />compartment of a motor vehicle, carrying substantially more passengers than the<br />rated capacity of a motor vehicle or vessel, or harboring persons in a crowded, danger-<br />ous, or inhumane condition.”<br />One case that illustrates the concerns addressed in this amendment is United States<br />v. Mateo Garza, 541 F.3d 290 (5th Cir. 2008), in which the Fifth Circuit held that the<br />reckless endangerment enhancement at &#167;2L1.1(b)(6) does not per se apply to trans-<br />porting aliens through the South Texas brush country, and must instead be applied<br />based on the specific facts presented to the court. The Fifth Circuit emphasized that it<br />is not enough to say, as the district court had, that traversing an entire geographical<br />region is inherently dangerous, but that it must be dangerous on the facts presented<br />to and used by the district court. The Fifth Circuit identified such pertinent facts from<br />its prior case law as the length of the journey, the temperature, whether the aliens<br />were provided food and water and allowed rest periods, and whether the aliens suffered<br />injuries and death. See, e.g., United States v. Garcia-Guerrero, 313 F.3d 892 (5th Cir.<br />2002). Additional facts that have supported the enhancement include: whether the al-<br />iens were abandoned en route, the time of year during which the journey took place,<br />the distance traveled, and whether the aliens were adequately clothed for the journey.<br />See, e.g., United States v. Chapa, 362 Fed. App’x 411 (5th Cir. 2010); United States v.<br />De Jesus-Ojeda, 515 F.3d 434 (5th Cir. 2008); United States v. Hernandez-Pena,<br />267 Fed. App’x 367 (5th Cir. 2008); United States v. Rodriguez-Cruz, 255 F.3d 1054<br />(9th Cir. 2001).<br />Amendment 786<br />The amendment adds to Application Note 5 the following new example of the conduct<br />to which &#167;2L1.1(b)(6) could apply: “or guiding persons through, or abandoning persons<br />in, a dangerous or remote geographic area without adequate food, water, clothing, or<br />protection from the elements.” The Commission determined that this new example will<br />clarify application of subsection (b)(6), highlight the potential risks in these types of<br />cases, provide guidance for the courts to determine whether to apply the enhancement,<br />and promote uniformity in sentencing by providing factors to consider when determin-<br />ing whether to apply &#167;2L1.1(b)(6).</td><td>Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2014.</td></tr><tr><td class="n">786</td><td>Amendment 786</td><td>The Commentary to &#167;5D1.2 captioned “Application Notes” is amended in<br />Note 1, in the paragraph that begins “ ‘Sex offense’ means”, in subparagraph (A), by<br />striking “(ii) chapter 109B of such title;”, and by redesignating clauses (iii) through (vi)<br />as clauses (ii) through (v), respectively; in subparagraph (B) by striking “(vi)” and in-<br />serting “(v)”; and by adding at the end as the last sentence the following: “Such term<br />does not include an offense under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2250 (Failure to register).”.<br />The Commentary to &#167;5D1.2 captioned “Application Notes” is amended by adding at the<br />end the following new Note 6:<br />“6. Application of Subsection (c).—Subsection (c) specifies how a statutorily re-<br />quired minimum term of supervised release may affect the minimum term of<br />supervised release provided by the guidelines.<br />For example, if subsection (a) provides a range of two years to five years, but<br />the relevant statute requires a minimum term of supervised release of three<br />years and a maximum term of life, the term of supervised release provided by<br />the guidelines is restricted by subsection (c) to three years to five years. Simi-<br />larly, if subsection (a) provides a range of two years to five years, but the rele-<br />vant statute requires a minimum term of supervised release of five years and<br />a maximum term of life, the term of supervised release provided by the guide-<br />lines is five years.<br />The following example illustrates the interaction of subsections (a) and (c)<br />when subsection (b) is also involved. In this example, subsection (a) provides a<br />range of two years to five years; the relevant statute requires a minimum term<br />of supervised release of five years and a maximum term of life; and the offense<br />is a sex offense under subsection (b). The effect of subsection (b) is to raise the<br />maximum term of supervised release from five years (as provided by subsec-<br />tion (a)) to life, yielding a range of two years to life. The term of supervised<br />release provided by the guidelines is then restricted by subsection (c) to five<br />years to life. In this example, a term of supervised release of more than five<br />years would be a guideline sentence. In addition, subsection (b) contains a pol-<br />icy statement recommending that the maximum — a life term of supervised<br />release — be imposed.”.</td><td>REASON FOR AMENDMENT: This amendment resolves a circuit conflict and a related<br />guideline application issue about the calculation of terms of supervised release. The<br />Amendment 786<br />80 ║ Supplement to Appendix C (November 1, 2016)<br />circuit conflict involves defendants sentenced under statutes providing for mandatory<br />minimum terms of supervised release, while the application issue relates specifically<br />to defendants convicted of failure to register as a sex offender, in violation of 18 U.S.C.<br />&#167; 2250.<br />The guideline term of supervised release is determined by &#167;5D1.2 (Term of Supervised<br />Release). Section 5D1.2(a) sets forth general rules for determining the guideline term<br />of supervised release, based on the statutory classification of the offense.<br />See &#167;5D1.2(a)(1)–(3); 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3559 (sentencing classification of offenses). For cer-<br />tain terrorism-related and sex offenses, &#167;5D1.2(b) operates to replace the top end of<br />the guideline term calculated under subsection (a) with a life term of supervised re-<br />lease. In the case of a “sex offense,” as defined by Application Note 1 to &#167;5D1.2, a policy<br />statement recommends that a life term of supervised release be imposed.<br />See &#167;5D1.2(b), p.s. Finally, &#167;5D1.2(c) states that “the term of supervised release im-<br />posed shall be not less than any statutorily required term of supervised release.”<br />When a Statutory Minimum Term of Supervised Release Applies<br />First, there appear to be differences among the circuits in how to calculate the guide-<br />line term of supervised release when there is a statutory minimum term of supervised<br />release. These cases involve the meaning of subsection (c) and its interaction with sub-<br />section (a).<br />The Seventh Circuit has held that when there is a statutory minimum term of super-<br />vised release, the statutory minimum term becomes the bottom of the guideline range<br />(replacing the bottom of the term provided by (a)) and, if the statutory minimum equals<br />or exceeds the top of the guideline term provided by subsection (a), the guideline<br />“range” becomes a single point at the statutory minimum. United States v. Gibbs,<br />578 F.3d 694, 695 (7th Cir. 2009). Thus, if subsection (a) provides a range of three to<br />five years, but the statute provides a range of five years to life, the “range” is precisely<br />five years. Gibbs involved a drug offense for which 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(b) required a su-<br />pervised release term of five years to life. See also United States v. Goodwin, 717 F.3d<br />511, 519–20 (7th Cir. 2013) (applying Gibbs to a case involving a failure to register for<br />which 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3583(k) required a supervised release term of five years to life).<br />These cases are in tension with the approach of the Eighth Circuit in United States v.<br />Deans, 590 F.3d 907, 911 (8th Cir. 2010). In Deans, the range calculated under sub-<br />section (a) was two to three years of supervised release. However, the relevant statute,<br />21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(b)(1)(C), provided a range of three years to life. Under the Seventh<br />Circuit’s approach in Gibbs, the guideline “range” would be precisely three years. With-<br />out reference to Gibbs, the Eighth Circuit in Deans indicated that the statutory re-<br />quirement “trumps” subsection (a), and the guideline range becomes the statutory<br />range — three years to life. 590 F.3d at 911. Thus, the district court’s imposition of five<br />years of supervised release “was neither an upward departure nor procedural er-<br />ror.” Id.<br />The amendment adopts the approach of the Seventh Circuit in Gibbs and Goodwin.<br />The amendment provides a new Application Note and examples explaining that, under<br />subsection (c), a statutorily required minimum term of supervised release operates to<br />restrict the low end of the guideline term of supervised release.<br />The Commission determined that this resolution was most consistent with its statu-<br />tory obligation to determine the “appropriate length” of supervised release terms, and<br />with how a statutory minimum term of imprisonment operates to restrict the range of<br />Amendment 786<br />imprisonment provided by the guidelines. See 28 U.S.C. &#167; 994(a)(1)(c); USSG<br />&#167;5G1.1(a). This outcome is also consistent with the Commission’s 2010 report on su-<br />pervised release, which found that most supervised release violations occur in the first<br />year after release from incarceration. See U.S. Sentencing Comm’n, Federal Offenders<br />Sentenced to Supervised Release, at 63 &amp; n. 265 (July 2010). If an offender shows<br />non-compliance during the initial term of supervised release, the court may extend the<br />term of supervision up to the statutory maximum, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3583(e)(2).<br />When the Defendant is Convicted of Failure to Register as a Sex Offender<br />Second, there are differences among the circuits over how to calculate the guideline<br />range of supervised release when a defendant is convicted, under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2250, of<br />failing to register as a sex offender. That offense carries a statutory minimum term of<br />supervised release of at least five years, with a term up to life permitted. See 18 U.S.C.<br />&#167; 3583(k).<br />There is an application issue about when, if at all, such an offense is a “sex offense” for<br />purposes of subsection (b) of &#167;5D1.2. If a failure to register is a sex offense, then sub-<br />section (b) specifically provides for a term of supervised release of anywhere from the<br />minimum provided by subsection (a) to the maximum provided by statute (i.e., life),<br />and a policy statement contained within subsection (b) recommends that the maximum<br />be imposed. See &#167;5D1.2(b), p.s. Another effect of the determination is that, if failure to<br />register is a “sex offense,” the guidelines recommend that special conditions of super-<br />vised release also be imposed, such as participating in a sex offender monitoring pro-<br />gram and submitting to warrantless searches. See &#167;5D1.3(d)(7).<br />Application Note 1 defines “sex offense” to mean, among other things, “an offense, per-<br />petrated against a minor, under” chapter 109B of title 18 (the only section of which is<br />Section 2250). Circuits have reached different conclusions about the effect of this defi-<br />nition.<br />The Seventh Circuit has held that a failure to register can never be a “sex offense”<br />within the meaning of Note 1. United States v. Goodwin, 717 F.3d 511, 518–20 (7th Cir.<br />2013); see also United States v. Segura, 747 F.3d 323, 329 (5th Cir. 2014) (agreeing<br />with Goodwin). The court in Goodwin reasoned that there is no specific victim of a<br />failure to register, and therefore a failure to register is never “perpetrated against a<br />minor” and can never be a “sex offense” — rendering the definition’s inclusion of of-<br />fenses under chapter 109B “surplusage.” 717 F.3d at 518. In an unpublished opinion,<br />the Second Circuit has determined that a failure to register was not a “sex offense.”<br />See United States v. Herbert, 428 Fed. App’x 37 (2d Cir. 2011). In both cases, the gov-<br />ernment argued for these outcomes, confessing error below.<br />There are unpublished decisions in other circuits that have reached different results,<br />without discussion. In those cases, the defendant had a prior sex offense against a<br />minor, and the circuit court determined that the failure to register was a “sex offense.”<br />See United States v. Zeiders, 440 Fed. App’x 699, 701 (11th Cir. 2011); United States<br />v. Nelson, 400 Fed. App’x 781 (4th Cir. 2010).<br />The Commission agrees with the Seventh Circuit that failure to register is not an of-<br />fense that is “perpetrated against a minor.” In addition, expert testimony and research<br />reviewed by the Commission indicated that commission of a failure-to-register offense<br />is not correlated with sex offense recidivism. The amendment resolves the application<br />Amendment 787<br />82 ║ Supplement to Appendix C (November 1, 2016)<br />issue by amending the commentary to &#167;5D1.2 to clarify that offenses under Sec-<br />tion 2250 are not “sex offenses.”</td><td>Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2014.</td></tr><tr><td class="n">787</td><td>Amendment 787</td><td>The Commentary to &#167;2L1.2 captioned “Application Notes” is amended by<br />redesignating Note 8 as Note 9 and by inserting after Note 7 the following new Note 8:<br />“8.

In such a case, the court may consider whether a depar-<br />ture is appropriate to reflect all or part of the time served in state custody, from<br />the time immigration authorities locate the defendant until the service of the<br />federal sentence commences, that the court determines will not be credited to<br />the federal sentence by the Bureau of Prisons. Any such departure should be<br />fashioned to achieve a reasonable punishment for the instant offense.<br />Such a departure should be considered only in cases where the departure is<br />not likely to increase the risk to the public from further crimes of the defend-<br />ant. In determining whether such a departure is appropriate, the court should<br />consider, among other things, (A) whether the defendant engaged in additional<br />criminal activity after illegally reentering the United States; (B) the serious-<br />ness of any such additional criminal activity, including (1) whether the defend-<br />ant used violence or credible threats of violence or possessed a firearm or other<br />dangerous weapon (or induced another person to do so) in connection with the<br />criminal activity, (2) whether the criminal activity resulted in death or serious<br />bodily injury to any person, and (3) whether the defendant was an organizer,<br />leader, manager, or supervisor of others in the criminal activity; and (C) the<br />seriousness of the defendant’s other criminal history.”.<br />The Commentary to &#167;2X5.1 captioned “Application Notes” is amended in Note 1 by<br />inserting after “&#167;5G1.3 (Imposition of a Sentence on a Defendant Subject to an Undis-<br />charged Term of Imprisonment” the following: “or Anticipated State Term of Impris-<br />onment”.<br />Section 5G1.3 is amended in the heading by inserting after “Imposition of a Sentence<br />on a Defendant Subject to an Undischarged Term of Imprisonment” the following:<br />“or Anticipated State Term of Imprisonment”.<br />Section 5G1.3 is amended in subsection (b) by striking “and that was the basis for an<br />increase in the offense level for the instant offense under Chapter Two (Offense Con-<br />duct) or Chapter Three (Adjustments)”; by redesignating subsection (c) as (d); and by<br />inserting after subsection (b) the following new subsection (c):<br />“(c) If subsection (a) does not apply, and a state term of imprisonment is antici-<br />pated to result from another offense that is relevant conduct to the instant<br />offense of conviction under the provisions of subsections (a)(1), (a)(2), or (a)(3)<br />Amendment 787<br />of &#167;1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct), the sentence for the instant offense shall be im-<br />posed to run concurrently to the anticipated term of imprisonment.”.<br />The Commentary to &#167;5G1.3 captioned “Application Notes” is amended in Note 2(A) by<br />striking “(i)” and by striking “; and (ii) has resulted in an increase in the Chapter Two<br />or Three offense level for the instant offense”;<br />in Note 2(B) by striking “increased the Chapter Two or Three offense level for the in-<br />stant offense but”;<br />by redesignating Notes 3 and 4 as Notes 4 and 5, respectively, and inserting after<br />Note 2 the following new Note 3:<br />“3.

In such a case, where the<br />other offense is relevant conduct to the instant offense of conviction under the<br />provisions of subsections (a)(1), (a)(2), or (a)(3) of &#167;1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct),<br />the sentence for the instant offense shall be imposed to run concurrently to the<br />anticipated term of imprisonment.”;<br />and in Note 4 (as so redesignated), in the heading, by striking “(c)” and inserting “(d)”;<br />in each of subparagraphs (A), (B), (C), and (D) by striking “(c)” each place such term<br />appears and inserting “(d)”; and in subparagraph (E) by striking “subsection (c)” both<br />places such term appears and inserting “subsection (d)”, and by striking “&#167;5G1.3 (c)”<br />and inserting “&#167;5G1.3(d)”.<br />Section 5K2.23 is amended by inserting after “Imposition of a Sentence on a Defendant<br />Subject to Undischarged Term of Imprisonment” the following: “or Anticipated Term<br />of Imprisonment”.</td><td>REASON FOR AMENDMENT: This multi-part amendment addresses certain cases in<br />which the defendant is subject to another term of imprisonment, such as an undis-<br />charged term of imprisonment or an anticipated term of imprisonment. The guideline<br />generally applicable to undischarged terms of imprisonment is &#167;5G1.3 (Imposition of<br />a Sentence on a Defendant Subject to an Undischarged Term of Imprisonment).<br />Section 5G1.3 identifies three categories of cases in which a federal defendant is also<br />subject to an undischarged term of imprisonment. First, there are cases in which the<br />federal offense was committed while the defendant was serving the undischarged term<br />of imprisonment (including work release, furlough, or escape status). In these cases,<br />the federal sentence is to be imposed consecutively to the remainder of the undis-<br />charged term of imprisonment. See &#167;5G1.3(a). Second, assuming subsection (a) does<br />not apply, there are cases in which the conduct involved in the undischarged term of<br />imprisonment is related to the conduct involved in the federal offense — specifically,<br />the offense for which the defendant is serving an undischarged term of imprisonment<br />is relevant conduct under subsections (a)(1), (a)(2), or (a)(3) of &#167;1B1.3 (Relevant Con-<br />duct) — and was the basis for an increase in the offense level under Chapter Two or<br />Chapter Three. In these cases, the court is directed to adjust the federal sentence to<br />account for the time already served on the undischarged term of imprisonment (if the<br />Bureau of Prisons will not itself provide credit for that time already served) and is<br />further directed to run the federal sentence concurrently with the remainder of the<br />sentence for the undischarged term of imprisonment. See &#167;5G1.3(b). Finally, in all<br />Amendment 787<br />84 ║ Supplement to Appendix C (November 1, 2016)<br />other cases involving an undischarged state term of imprisonment, the court may im-<br />pose the federal sentence concurrently, partially concurrently, or consecutively, to<br />achieve a reasonable punishment for the federal offense. See &#167;5G1.3(c), p.s.<br />Within the category of cases covered by subsection (b), where the conduct involved in<br />the undischarged term of imprisonment is related to the federal offense conduct, the<br />Commission considered whether the benefit of subsection (b) should continue to be<br />limited to cases in which the offense conduct related to the undischarged term of im-<br />prisonment resulted in a Chapter Two or Three increase. The Commission determined<br />that this limitation added complexity to the guidelines and may lead to unwarranted<br />disparities. For example, a federal drug trafficking defendant who is serving an undis-<br />charged state term of imprisonment for a small amount of a controlled substance that<br />is relevant conduct to the federal offense may not receive the benefit of subsection (b)<br />because the amount of the controlled substance may not be sufficient to increase the<br />offense level under Chapter Two. In contrast, a federal drug trafficking defendant who<br />is serving an undischarged state term of imprisonment for a large amount of a con-<br />trolled substance that is relevant conduct to the federal offense may be more likely to<br />receive the benefit of subsection (b) because the amount of the controlled substance<br />may be more likely to increase the offense level under Chapter Two. The amendment<br />amends &#167;5G1.3(b) to require a court to adjust the sentence and impose concurrent sen-<br />tences in any case in which the prior offense is relevant conduct under the provisions<br />of &#167;1B1.3(a)(1), (a)(2), or (a)(3), regardless of whether the conduct from the prior offense<br />formed the basis for a Chapter Two or Chapter Three increase. The Commission deter-<br />mined that this amendment will simplify the operation of &#167;5G1.3(b) and will also ad-<br />dress concerns that the requirement that the relevant conduct increase the offense<br />level under Chapters Two or Three is somewhat arbitrary.<br />Second, the amendment addresses cases in which there is an anticipated, but not yet<br />imposed, state term of imprisonment that is relevant conduct to the instant offense of<br />conviction under the provisions of subsections (a)(1), (a)(2), or (a)(3) of &#167;1B1.3 (Relevant<br />Conduct). This amendment creates a new subsection (c) at &#167;5G1.3 that directs the court<br />to impose the sentence for the instant federal offense to run concurrently with the an-<br />ticipated but not yet imposed period of imprisonment if &#167;5G1.3(a) does not apply.<br />This amendment is a further response to the Supreme Court’s decision in Setser v.<br />United States, 132 S. Ct. 1463 (2012). Last year, the Commission amended the Back-<br />ground Commentary to &#167;5G1.3 to provide heightened awareness of the court’s author-<br />ity under Setser. See USSG App. C, Amend. 776 (effective November 1, 2013). In Set-<br />ser, the Supreme Court held that a federal sentencing court has the authority to order<br />that a federal term of imprisonment run concurrent with, or consecutive to, an antici-<br />pated but not yet imposed state sentence. This amendment reflects the Commission’s<br />determination that the concurrent sentence benefits of subsection (b) of &#167;5G1.3 should<br />be available not only in cases in which the state sentence has already been imposed at<br />the time of federal sentencing (as subsection (b) provides), but also in cases in which<br />the state sentence is anticipated but has not yet been imposed, as long as the other<br />criteria in subsection (b) are satisfied (i.e., the state offense is relevant conduct under<br />subsections (a)(1), (a)(2), or (a)(3) of &#167;1B1.3, and subsection (a) of &#167;5G1.3 does not ap-<br />ply). By requiring courts to impose a concurrent sentence in these cases, the amend-<br />ment reduces disparities between defendants whose state sentences have already been<br />imposed and those whose state sentences have not yet been imposed. The amendment<br />also promotes certainty and consistency.<br />Third, the amendment addresses certain cases in which the defendant is an alien and<br />is subject to an undischarged term of imprisonment. The amendment provides a new<br />Amendment 788<br />departure provision in &#167;2L1.2 (Unlawfully Entering or Remaining in the United<br />States) for cases in which the defendant is located by immigration authorities while<br />the defendant is in state custody, whether pre- or post- conviction, for a state offense<br />unrelated to the federal illegal reentry offense. In such a case, the time served is not<br />covered by an adjustment under &#167;5G1.3(b) and, accordingly, is not covered by a depar-<br />ture under &#167;5K2.23 (Discharged Terms of Imprisonment). The new departure provi-<br />sion states that, in such a case, the court may consider whether a departure is appro-<br />priate to reflect all or part of the time served in state custody for the unrelated offense,<br />from the time federal immigration authorities locate the defendant until the service of<br />the federal sentence commences, that the court determines will not be credited to the<br />federal sentence by the Bureau of Prisons. The new departure provision also sets forth<br />factors for the court to consider in determining whether to provide such a departure,<br />and states that a departure should be considered only if the departure will not increase<br />the risk to the public from further crimes of the defendant.<br />This amendment addresses concerns that the amount of time a defendant serves in<br />state custody after being located by immigration authorities may be somewhat arbi-<br />trary. Several courts have recognized a downward departure to account for the delay<br />between when the defendant is “found” by immigration authorities and when the de-<br />fendant is brought into federal custody. See, e.g., United States v. Sanchez-Rodriguez,<br />161 F.3d 556, 563–64 (9th Cir. 1998) (affirming downward departure on the basis that,<br />because of the delay in proceeding with the illegal reentry case, the defendant lost the<br />opportunity to serve a greater portion of his state sentence concurrently with his illegal<br />reentry sentence); United States v. Barrera-Saucedo, 385 F.3d 533, 537 (5th Cir. 2004)<br />(holding that “it is permissible for a sentencing court to grant a downward departure<br />to an illegal alien for all or part of time served in state custody from the time immigra-<br />tion authorities locate the defendant until he is taken into federal custody”); see also<br />United States v. Los Santos, 283 F.3d 422, 428–29 (2d Cir. 2002) (departure appropri-<br />ate if the delay was either in bad faith or unreasonable). The amendment provides<br />guidance to the courts in the determination of an appropriate sentence in such a case.</td><td>Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2014.</td></tr><tr><td class="n">788</td><td>Amendment 788</td><td>Section 1B1.10, as amended by Amendment 780, is further amended in<br />subsection (d) by striking “and” and by inserting “, and 782 (subject to subsection<br />(e)(1))” before the period at the end;<br />and by adding at the end the following new subsection (e):<br />“(e) Special Instruction.—<br />(1) The court shall not order a reduced term of imprisonment based on<br />Amendment 782 unless the effective date of the court’s order is Novem-<br />ber 1, 2015, or later.”.<br />The Commentary to 1B1.10 captioned “Application Notes”, as amended by Amend-<br />ment 780, is further amended by redesignating Notes 6 and 7 as Notes 7 and 8, respec-<br />tively;<br />and by inserting after Note 5 the following new Note 6:<br />Amendment 788<br />86 ║ Supplement to Appendix C (November 1, 2016)<br />“6. Application to Amendment 782.—As specified in subsection (d) and (e)(1),<br />Amendment 782 (generally revising the Drug Quantity Table and chemical<br />quantity tables across drug and chemical types) is covered by this policy state-<br />ment only in cases in which the order reducing the defendant’s term of impris-<br />onment has an effective date of November 1, 2015, or later.<br />A reduction based on retroactive application of Amendment 782 that does not<br />comply with the requirement that the order take effect on November 1, 2015,<br />or later is not consistent with this policy statement and therefore is not author-<br />ized under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3582(c)(2).<br />Subsection (e)(1) does not preclude the court from conducting sentence reduc-<br />tion proceedings and entering orders under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3582(c)(2) and this pol-<br />icy statement before November 1, 2015, provided that any order reducing the<br />defendant’s term of imprisonment has an effective date of November 1, 2015,<br />or later.”.</td><td>REASON FOR AMENDMENT: This amendment expands the listing in &#167;1B1.10(d) to imple-<br />ment the directive in 28 U.S.C. &#167; 994(u) with respect to guideline amendments that<br />may be considered for retroactive application. The Commission has determined that<br />Amendment 782, subject to the limitation in new &#167;1B1.10(e) delaying the effective date<br />of sentence reduction orders until November 1, 2015, should be applied retroactively.<br />Amendment 782 reduced by two levels the offense levels assigned to the quantities<br />that trigger the statutory mandatory minimum penalties in &#167;2D1.1, and made parallel<br />changes to &#167;2D1.11. Under the applicable standards set forth in the background com-<br />mentary to &#167;1B1.10, the Commission considers the following factors, among others:<br />(1) the purpose of the amendment, (2) the magnitude of the change in the guideline<br />range made by the amendment, and (3) the difficulty of applying the amendment ret-<br />roactively. See &#167;1B1.10, comment. (backg’d.). Applying those standards to Amend-<br />ment 782, the Commission determined that, among other factors:<br />(1) The purposes of the amendment are to reflect the Commission’s determination<br />that setting the base offense levels above mandatory minimum penalties is no<br />longer necessary and that a reduction would be an appropriate step toward<br />alleviating the overcapacity of the federal prisons. See 28 U.S.C. &#167; 994(g) (re-<br />quiring the Commission to formulate guidelines to “minimize the likelihood<br />that the Federal prison population will exceed the capacity of the Federal pris-<br />ons”).<br />(2) The number of cases potentially involved is large, and the magnitude of the<br />change in the guideline range is significant. The Commission determined that<br />an estimated 46,000 offenders may benefit from retroactive application of<br />Amendment 782 subject to the limitation in &#167;1B1.10(e), and the average sen-<br />tence reduction would be approximately 18 percent.<br />(3) The administrative burdens of applying Amendment 782 retroactively are sig-<br />nificant but manageable given the one-year delay in the effective date, which<br />allows courts and agencies more time to prepare. This determination was in-<br />formed by testimony at the Commission’s June 10, 2014 public hearing on ret-<br />roactivity and by other public comment received by the Commission.<br />Amendment 789<br />The Commission determined that public safety, among other factors, requires a limi-<br />tation on retroactive application of Amendment 782. In light of the large number of<br />cases potentially involved, the Commission determined that the agencies of the federal<br />criminal justice system responsible for the offenders’ reentry into society need time to<br />prepare, and to help the offenders prepare, for that reentry. For example, the Bureau<br />of Prisons has the responsibility under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3624(c) to ensure, to the extent<br />practicable, that the defendant will spend a portion of his or her term of imprisonment<br />under conditions that will afford the defendant a reasonable opportunity to adjust to<br />and prepare for his or her reentry into the community. The Commission received tes-<br />timony indicating that some offenders released pursuant to earlier retroactive guide-<br />line amendments had been released without having had this opportunity. In addition,<br />for many of the defendants potentially involved, their sentence includes a term of su-<br />pervised release after imprisonment. The judiciary and its probation officers will have<br />the responsibility under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3624(e) to supervise those defendants when they<br />are released by the Bureau of Prisons. The Commission received testimony from the<br />Criminal Law Committee of the Judicial Conference of the United States that a delay<br />would permit courts and probation offices to prepare to effectively supervise this in-<br />creased number of defendants.<br />The Commission concluded that a one-year delay in the effective date of any orders<br />granting sentence reductions under Amendment 782 is needed (1) to give courts ade-<br />quate time to obtain and review the information necessary to make an individualized<br />determination in each case of whether a sentence reduction is appropriate, (2) to en-<br />sure that, to the extent practicable, all offenders who are to be released have the op-<br />portunity to participate in reentry programs and transitional services, such as place-<br />ment in halfway houses, while still in the custody of the Bureau of Prisons, which in-<br />creases their likelihood of successful reentry to society and thereby promotes public<br />safety, and (3) to permit those agencies that will be responsible for offenders after their<br />release to prepare for the increased responsibility. Therefore, the Commission added a<br />Special Instruction at subsection (e) providing that a reduced term of imprisonment<br />based on retroactive application of Amendment 782 shall not be ordered unless the<br />effective date of the court’s order is November 1, 2015, or later. An application note<br />clarifies that this special instruction does not preclude the court from conducting sen-<br />tence reduction proceedings before November 1, 2015, as long as any order reducing<br />the defendant’s term of imprisonment has an effective date of November 1, 2015, or<br />later. As a result, offenders cannot be released from custody pursuant to retroactive<br />application of Amendment 782 before November 1, 2015.<br />In addition, public safety will be considered in every case because &#167;1B1.10 requires the<br />court, in determining whether and to what extent a reduction in the defendant’s term<br />of imprisonment is warranted, to consider the nature and seriousness of the danger to<br />any person or the community that may be posed by such a reduction. See &#167;1B1.10,<br />comment. (n.1(B)(ii)).</td><td>Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2014.</td></tr><tr><td class="n">789</td><td>Amendment 789</td><td>Section 1B1.3(a)(1)(B) is amended by striking “all reasonably foreseeable<br />acts and omissions of others in furtherance of the jointly undertaken criminal activity,”<br />and inserting the following:<br />“ all acts and omissions of others that were—<br />Amendment 790<br />(i) within the scope of the jointly undertaken criminal activity,<br />(ii) in furtherance of that criminal activity, and<br />(iii) reasonably foreseeable in connection with that criminal activity;”.<br />The Commentary to &#167;1B1.3 captioned “Application Notes” is amended by striking<br />Note 2 as follows:<br />“2. A ‘jointly undertaken criminal activity’ is a criminal plan, scheme, endeavor,<br />or enterprise undertaken by the defendant in concert with others, whether or<br />not charged as a conspiracy.<br />In the case of a jointly undertaken criminal activity, subsection (a)(1)(B) pro-<br />vides that a defendant is accountable for the conduct (acts and omissions) of<br />others that was both:<br />(A) in furtherance of the jointly undertaken criminal activity; and<br />(B) reasonably foreseeable in connection with that criminal activity.<br />Because a count may be worded broadly and include the conduct of many par-<br />ticipants over a period of time, the scope of the criminal activity jointly under-<br />taken by the defendant (the ‘jointly undertaken criminal activity’) is not nec-<br />essarily the same as the scope of the entire conspiracy, and hence relevant con-<br />duct is not necessarily the same for every participant. In order to determine<br />the defendant’s accountability for the conduct of others under subsec-<br />tion (a)(1)(B), the court must first determine the scope of the criminal activity<br />the particular defendant agreed to jointly undertake (i.e., the scope of the spe-<br />cific conduct and objectives embraced by the defendant’s agreement). The con-<br />duct of others that was both in furtherance of, and reasonably foreseeable in<br />connection with, the criminal activity jointly undertaken by the defendant is<br />relevant conduct under this provision. The conduct of others that was not in<br />furtherance of the criminal activity jointly undertaken by the defendant, or<br />was not reasonably foreseeable in connection with that criminal activity, is not<br />relevant conduct under this provision.<br />In determining the scope of the criminal activity that the particular defendant<br />agreed to jointly undertake (i.e., the scope of the specific conduct and objectives<br />embraced by the defendant’s agreement), the court may consider any explicit<br />agreement or implicit agreement fairly inferred from the conduct of the defend-<br />ant and others.<br />Note that the criminal activity that the defendant agreed to jointly undertake,<br />and the reasonably foreseeable conduct of others in furtherance of that crimi-<br />nal activity, are not necessarily identical. For example, two defendants agree<br />to commit a robbery and, during the course of that robbery, the first defendant<br />assaults and injures a victim. The second defendant is accountable for the as-<br />sault and injury to the victim (even if the second defendant had not agreed to<br />the assault and had cautioned the first defendant to be careful not to hurt an-<br />yone) because the assaultive conduct was in furtherance of the jointly under-<br />taken criminal activity (the robbery) and was reasonably foreseeable in con-<br />nection with that criminal activity (given the nature of the offense).<br />Amendment 790<br />90 ║ Supplement to Appendix C (November 1, 2016)<br />With respect to offenses involving contraband (including controlled sub-<br />stances), the defendant is accountable for all quantities of contraband with<br />which he was directly involved and, in the case of a jointly undertaken criminal<br />activity, all reasonably foreseeable quantities of contraband that were within<br />the scope of the criminal activity that he jointly undertook.<br />The requirement of reasonable foreseeability applies only in respect to the con-<br />duct (i.e., acts and omissions) of others under subsection (a)(1)(B). It does not<br />apply to conduct that the defendant personally undertakes, aids, abets, coun-<br />sels, commands, induces, procures, or willfully causes; such conduct is ad-<br />dressed under subsection (a)(1)(A).<br />A defendant’s relevant conduct does not include the conduct of members of a<br />conspiracy prior to the defendant joining the conspiracy, even if the defendant<br />knows of that conduct (e.g., in the case of a defendant who joins an ongoing<br />drug distribution conspiracy knowing that it had been selling two kilograms of<br />cocaine per week, the cocaine sold prior to the defendant joining the conspiracy<br />is not included as relevant conduct in determining the defendant’s offense<br />level). The Commission does not foreclose the possibility that there may be<br />some unusual set of circumstances in which the exclusion of such conduct may<br />not adequately reflect the defendant’s culpability; in such a case, an upward<br />departure may be warranted.<br />Illustrations of Conduct for Which the Defendant is Accountable<br />(a) Acts and omissions aided or abetted by the defendant<br />(1) Defendant A is one of ten persons hired by Defendant B to off-<br />load a ship containing marihuana. The off-loading of the ship<br />is interrupted by law enforcement officers and one ton of mari-<br />huana is seized (the amount on the ship as well as the amount<br />off-loaded). Defendant A and the other off-loaders are arrested<br />and convicted of importation of marihuana. Regardless of the<br />number of bales he personally unloaded, Defendant A is ac-<br />countable for the entire one-ton quantity of marihuana. De-<br />fendant A aided and abetted the off-loading of the entire ship-<br />ment of marihuana by directly participating in the off-loading<br />of that shipment (i.e., the specific objective of the criminal ac-<br />tivity he joined was the off-loading of the entire shipment).<br />Therefore, he is accountable for the entire shipment under sub-<br />section (a)(1)(A) without regard to the issue of reasonable fore-<br />seeability. This is conceptually similar to the case of a defend-<br />ant who transports a suitcase knowing that it contains a con-<br />trolled substance and, therefore, is accountable for the con-<br />trolled substance in the suitcase regardless of his knowledge or<br />lack of knowledge of the actual type or amount of that con-<br />trolled substance.<br />In certain cases, a defendant may be accountable for particular<br />conduct under more than one subsection of this guideline. As<br />noted in the preceding paragraph, Defendant A is accountable<br />for the entire one-ton shipment of marihuana under subsec-<br />tion (a)(1)(A). Defendant A also is accountable for the entire<br />Amendment 790<br />one-ton shipment of marihuana on the basis of subsec-<br />tion (a)(1)(B) (applying to a jointly undertaken criminal activ-<br />ity). Defendant A engaged in a jointly undertaken criminal ac-<br />tivity (the scope of which was the importation of the shipment<br />of marihuana). A finding that the one-ton quantity of mari-<br />huana was reasonably foreseeable is warranted from the na-<br />ture of the undertaking itself (the importation of marihuana by<br />ship typically involves very large quantities of marihuana).<br />The specific circumstances of the case (the defendant was one<br />of ten persons off-loading the marihuana in bales) also support<br />this finding. In an actual case, of course, if a defendant’s ac-<br />countability for particular conduct is established under one<br />provision of this guideline, it is not necessary to review alter-<br />native provisions under which such accountability might be es-<br />tablished.<br />(b) Acts and omissions aided or abetted by the defendant; requirement<br />that the conduct of others be in furtherance of the jointly undertaken<br />criminal activity and reasonably foreseeable<br />(1) Defendant C is the getaway driver in an armed bank robbery<br />in which $15,000 is taken and a teller is assaulted and injured.<br />Defendant C is accountable for the money taken under subsec-<br />tion (a)(1)(A) because he aided and abetted the act of taking the<br />money (the taking of money was the specific objective of the<br />offense he joined). Defendant C is accountable for the injury to<br />the teller under subsection (a)(1)(B) because the assault on the<br />teller was in furtherance of the jointly undertaken criminal ac-<br />tivity (the robbery) and was reasonably foreseeable in connec-<br />tion with that criminal activity (given the nature of the of-<br />fense).<br />As noted earlier, a defendant may be accountable for particular<br />conduct under more than one subsection. In this example, De-<br />fendant C also is accountable for the money taken on the basis<br />of subsection (a)(1)(B) because the taking of money was in fur-<br />therance of the jointly undertaken criminal activity (the rob-<br />bery) and was reasonably foreseeable (as noted, the taking of<br />money was the specific objective of the jointly undertaken crim-<br />inal activity).<br />(c) Requirement that the conduct of others be in furtherance of the jointly<br />undertaken criminal activity and reasonably foreseeable; scope of the<br />criminal activity<br />(1) Defendant D pays Defendant E a small amount to forge an en-<br />dorsement on an $800 stolen government check. Unknown to<br />Defendant E, Defendant D then uses that check as a down pay-<br />ment in a scheme to fraudulently obtain $15,000 worth of mer-<br />chandise. Defendant E is convicted of forging the $800 check<br />and is accountable for the forgery of this check under subsec-<br />tion (a)(1)(A). Defendant E is not accountable for the $15,000<br />because the fraudulent scheme to obtain $15,000 was not in<br />Amendment 790<br />92 ║ Supplement to Appendix C (November 1, 2016)<br />furtherance of the criminal activity he jointly undertook with<br />Defendant D (i.e., the forgery of the $800 check).<br />(2) Defendants F and G, working together, design and execute a<br />scheme to sell fraudulent stocks by telephone. Defendant F<br />fraudulently obtains $20,000. Defendant G fraudulently ob-<br />tains $35,000. Each is convicted of mail fraud. Defendants F<br />and G each are accountable for the entire amount ($55,000).<br />Each defendant is accountable for the amount he personally<br />obtained under subsection (a)(1)(A). Each defendant is ac-<br />countable for the amount obtained by his accomplice under<br />subsection (a)(1)(B) because the conduct of each was in further-<br />ance of the jointly undertaken criminal activity and was rea-<br />sonably foreseeable in connection with that criminal activity.<br />(3) Defendants H and I engaged in an ongoing marihuana impor-<br />tation conspiracy in which Defendant J was hired only to help<br />off-load a single shipment. Defendants H, I, and J are included<br />in a single count charging conspiracy to import marihuana. De-<br />fendant J is accountable for the entire single shipment of ma-<br />rihuana he helped import under subsection (a)(1)(A) and any<br />acts and omissions in furtherance of the importation of that<br />shipment that were reasonably foreseeable (see the discussion<br />in example (a)(1) above). He is not accountable for prior or sub-<br />sequent shipments of marihuana imported by Defendants H<br />or I because those acts were not in furtherance of his jointly<br />undertaken criminal activity (the importation of the single<br />shipment of marihuana).<br />(4) Defendant K is a wholesale distributor of child pornography.<br />Defendant L is a retail-level dealer who purchases child por-<br />nography from Defendant K and resells it, but otherwise oper-<br />ates independently of Defendant K. Similarly, Defendant M is<br />a retail-level dealer who purchases child pornography from De-<br />fendant K and resells it, but otherwise operates independently<br />of Defendant K. Defendants L and M are aware of each other’s<br />criminal activity but operate independently. Defendant N is<br />Defendant K’s assistant who recruits customers for Defend-<br />ant K and frequently supervises the deliveries to Defend-<br />ant K’s customers. Each defendant is convicted of a count<br />charging conspiracy to distribute child pornography. Defend-<br />ant K is accountable under subsection (a)(1)(A) for the entire<br />quantity of child pornography sold to Defendants L and M. De-<br />fendant N also is accountable for the entire quantity sold to<br />those defendants under subsection (a)(1)(B) because the entire<br />quantity was within the scope of his jointly undertaken crimi-<br />nal activity and reasonably foreseeable. Defendant L is ac-<br />countable under subsection (a)(1)(A) only for the quantity of<br />child pornography that he purchased from Defendant K be-<br />cause the scope of his jointly undertaken criminal activity is<br />limited to that amount. For the same reason, Defendant M is<br />accountable under subsection (a)(1)(A) only for the quantity of<br />child pornography that he purchased from Defendant K.<br />Amendment 790<br />(5) Defendant O knows about her boyfriend’s ongoing drug-traf-<br />ficking activity, but agrees to participate on only one occasion<br />by making a delivery for him at his request when he was ill.<br />Defendant O is accountable under subsection (a)(1)(A) for the<br />drug quantity involved on that one occasion. Defendant O is<br />not accountable for the other drug sales made by her boyfriend<br />because those sales were not in furtherance of her jointly un-<br />dertaken criminal activity (i.e., the one delivery).<br />(6) Defendant P is a street-level drug dealer who knows of other<br />street-level drug dealers in the same geographic area who sell<br />the same type of drug as he sells. Defendant P and the other<br />dealers share a common source of supply, but otherwise oper-<br />ate independently. Defendant P is not accountable for the<br />quantities of drugs sold by the other street-level drug dealers<br />because he is not engaged in a jointly undertaken criminal ac-<br />tivity with them. In contrast, Defendant Q, another street-level<br />drug dealer, pools his resources and profits with four other<br />street-level drug dealers. Defendant Q is engaged in a jointly<br />undertaken criminal activity and, therefore, he is accountable<br />under subsection (a)(1)(B) for the quantities of drugs sold by<br />the four other dealers during the course of his joint undertak-<br />ing with them because those sales were in furtherance of the<br />jointly undertaken criminal activity and reasonably foreseea-<br />ble in connection with that criminal activity.<br />(7) Defendant R recruits Defendant S to distribute 500 grams of<br />cocaine. Defendant S knows that Defendant R is the prime fig-<br />ure in a conspiracy involved in importing much larger quanti-<br />ties of cocaine. As long as Defendant S’s agreement and conduct<br />is limited to the distribution of the 500 grams, Defendant S is<br />accountable only for that 500 gram amount (under subsec-<br />tion (a)(1)(A)), rather than the much larger quantity imported<br />by Defendant R.<br />(8) Defendants T, U, V, and W are hired by a supplier to backpack<br />a quantity of marihuana across the border from Mexico into the<br />United States. Defendants T, U, V, and W receive their indi-<br />vidual shipments from the supplier at the same time and coor-<br />dinate their importation efforts by walking across the border<br />together for mutual assistance and protection. Each defendant<br />is accountable for the aggregate quantity of marihuana trans-<br />ported by the four defendants. The four defendants engaged in<br />a jointly undertaken criminal activity, the object of which was<br />the importation of the four backpacks containing marihuana<br />(subsection (a)(1)(B)), and aided and abetted each other’s ac-<br />tions (subsection (a)(1)(A)) in carrying out the jointly under-<br />taken criminal activity. In contrast, if Defendants T, U, V,<br />and W were hired individually, transported their individual<br />shipments at different times, and otherwise operated inde-<br />pendently, each defendant would be accountable only for the<br />quantity of marihuana he personally transported (subsec-<br />tion (a)(1)(A)). As this example illustrates, in cases involving<br />contraband (including controlled substances), the scope of the<br />Amendment 790<br />94 ║ Supplement to Appendix C (November 1, 2016)<br />jointly undertaken criminal activity (and thus the accountabil-<br />ity of the defendant for the contraband that was the object of<br />that jointly undertaken activity) may depend upon whether, in<br />the particular circumstances, the nature of the offense is more<br />appropriately viewed as one jointly undertaken criminal activ-<br />ity or as a number of separate criminal activities.”;<br />by redesignating Notes 3 through 10 as Notes 5 through 12, respectively, and inserting<br />the following new Notes 2, 3, and 4:<br />“2. Accountability Under More Than One Provision.—In certain cases, a defend-<br />ant may be accountable for particular conduct under more than one subsection<br />of this guideline. If a defendant’s accountability for particular conduct is estab-<br />lished under one provision of this guideline, it is not necessary to review alter-<br />native provisions under which such accountability might be established.<br />3. Jointly Undertaken Criminal Activity (Subsection (a)(1)(B)).—<br />(A) In General.—A ‘jointly undertaken criminal activity’ is a criminal plan,<br />scheme, endeavor, or enterprise undertaken by the defendant in con-<br />cert with others, whether or not charged as a conspiracy.<br />In the case of a jointly undertaken criminal activity, subsec-<br />tion (a)(1)(B) provides that a defendant is accountable for the conduct<br />(acts and omissions) of others that was:<br />(i) within the scope of the jointly undertaken criminal activity;<br />(ii) in furtherance of that criminal activity; and<br />(iii) reasonably foreseeable in connection with that criminal activ-<br />ity.<br />The conduct of others that meets all three criteria set forth in subdivi-<br />sions (i) through (iii) (i.e., ‘within the scope,’ ‘in furtherance,’ and ‘rea-<br />sonably foreseeable’) is relevant conduct under this provision. How-<br />ever, when the conduct of others does not meet any one of the criteria<br />set forth in subdivisions (i) through (iii), the conduct is not relevant<br />conduct under this provision.<br />(B) Scope.—Because a count may be worded broadly and include the con-<br />duct of many participants over a period of time, the scope of the ‘jointly<br />undertaken criminal activity’ is not necessarily the same as the scope<br />of the entire conspiracy, and hence relevant conduct is not necessarily<br />the same for every participant. In order to determine the defendant’s<br />accountability for the conduct of others under subsection (a)(1)(B), the<br />court must first determine the scope of the criminal activity the partic-<br />ular defendant agreed to jointly undertake (i.e., the scope of the specific<br />conduct and objectives embraced by the defendant’s agreement). In do-<br />ing so, the court may consider any explicit agreement or implicit agree-<br />ment fairly inferred from the conduct of the defendant and others. Ac-<br />cordingly, the accountability of the defendant for the acts of others is<br />limited by the scope of his or her agreement to jointly undertake the<br />particular criminal activity. Acts of others that were not within the<br />Amendment 790<br />scope of the defendant’s agreement, even if those acts were known or<br />reasonably foreseeable to the defendant, are not relevant conduct un-<br />der subsection (a)(1)(B).<br />In cases involving contraband (including controlled substances), the<br />scope of the jointly undertaken criminal activity (and thus the account-<br />ability of the defendant for the contraband that was the object of that<br />jointly undertaken activity) may depend upon whether, in the particu-<br />lar circumstances, the nature of the offense is more appropriately<br />viewed as one jointly undertaken criminal activity or as a number of<br />separate criminal activities.<br />A defendant’s relevant conduct does not include the conduct of mem-<br />bers of a conspiracy prior to the defendant joining the conspiracy, even<br />if the defendant knows of that conduct (e.g., in the case of a defendant<br />who joins an ongoing drug distribution conspiracy knowing that it had<br />been selling two kilograms of cocaine per week, the cocaine sold prior<br />to the defendant joining the conspiracy is not included as relevant con-<br />duct in determining the defendant’s offense level). The Commission<br />does not foreclose the possibility that there may be some unusual set<br />of circumstances in which the exclusion of such conduct may not ade-<br />quately reflect the defendant’s culpability; in such a case, an upward<br />departure may be warranted.<br />(C) In Furtherance.—The court must determine if the conduct (acts and<br />omissions) of others was in furtherance of the jointly undertaken crim-<br />inal activity.<br />(D) Reasonably Foreseeable.—The court must then determine if the con-<br />duct (acts and omissions) of others that was within the scope of, and in<br />furtherance of, the jointly undertaken criminal activity was reasonably<br />foreseeable in connection with that criminal activity.<br />Note that the criminal activity that the defendant agreed to jointly un-<br />dertake, and the reasonably foreseeable conduct of others in further-<br />ance of that criminal activity, are not necessarily identical. For exam-<br />ple, two defendants agree to commit a robbery and, during the course<br />of that robbery, the first defendant assaults and injures a victim. The<br />second defendant is accountable for the assault and injury to the victim<br />(even if the second defendant had not agreed to the assault and had<br />cautioned the first defendant to be careful not to hurt anyone) because<br />the assaultive conduct was within the scope of the jointly undertaken<br />criminal activity (the robbery), was in furtherance of that criminal ac-<br />tivity (the robbery), and was reasonably foreseeable in connection with<br />that criminal activity (given the nature of the offense).<br />With respect to offenses involving contraband (including controlled<br />substances), the defendant is accountable under subsection (a)(1)(A)<br />for all quantities of contraband with which he was directly involved<br />and, in the case of a jointly undertaken criminal activity under subsec-<br />tion (a)(1)(B), all quantities of contraband that were involved in trans-<br />actions carried out by other participants, if those transactions were<br />Amendment 790<br />96 ║ Supplement to Appendix C (November 1, 2016)<br />within the scope of, and in furtherance of, the jointly undertaken crim-<br />inal activity and were reasonably foreseeable in connection with that<br />criminal activity.<br />The requirement of reasonable foreseeability applies only in respect to<br />the conduct (i.e., acts and omissions) of others under subsec-<br />tion (a)(1)(B). It does not apply to conduct that the defendant person-<br />ally undertakes, aids, abets, counsels, commands, induces, procures, or<br />willfully causes; such conduct is addressed under subsection (a)(1)(A).<br />4. Illustrations of Conduct for Which the Defendant is Accountable under Sub-<br />sections (a)(1)(A) and (B).—<br />(A) Acts and omissions aided or abetted by the defendant.—<br />(i) Defendant A is one of ten persons hired by Defendant B to off-<br />load a ship containing marihuana. The off-loading of the ship<br />is interrupted by law enforcement officers and one ton of mari-<br />huana is seized (the amount on the ship as well as the amount<br />off-loaded). Defendant A and the other off-loaders are arrested<br />and convicted of importation of marihuana. Regardless of the<br />number of bales he personally unloaded, Defendant A is ac-<br />countable for the entire one-ton quantity of marihuana. De-<br />fendant A aided and abetted the off-loading of the entire ship-<br />ment of marihuana by directly participating in the off-loading<br />of that shipment (i.e., the specific objective of the criminal ac-<br />tivity he joined was the off-loading of the entire shipment).<br />Therefore, he is accountable for the entire shipment under sub-<br />section (a)(1)(A) without regard to the issue of reasonable fore-<br />seeability. This is conceptually similar to the case of a defend-<br />ant who transports a suitcase knowing that it contains a con-<br />trolled substance and, therefore, is accountable for the con-<br />trolled substance in the suitcase regardless of his knowledge or<br />lack of knowledge of the actual type or amount of that con-<br />trolled substance.<br />In certain cases, a defendant may be accountable for particular<br />conduct under more than one subsection of this guideline. As<br />noted in the preceding paragraph, Defendant A is accountable<br />for the entire one-ton shipment of marihuana under subsec-<br />tion (a)(1)(A). Defendant A also is accountable for the entire<br />one-ton shipment of marihuana on the basis of subsec-<br />tion (a)(1)(B) (applying to a jointly undertaken criminal activ-<br />ity). Defendant A engaged in a jointly undertaken criminal ac-<br />tivity and all three criteria of subsection (a)(1)(B) are met.<br />First, the conduct was within the scope of the criminal activity<br />(the importation of the shipment of marihuana). Second, the<br />off-loading of the shipment of marihuana was in furtherance of<br />the criminal activity, as described above. And third, a finding<br />that the one-ton quantity of marihuana was reasonably fore-<br />seeable is warranted from the nature of the undertaking itself<br />(the importation of marihuana by ship typically involves very<br />large quantities of marihuana). The specific circumstances of<br />the case (the defendant was one of ten persons off-loading the<br />Amendment 790<br />marihuana in bales) also support this finding. In an actual<br />case, of course, if a defendant’s accountability for particular<br />conduct is established under one provision of this guideline, it<br />is not necessary to review alternative provisions under which<br />such accountability might be established. See Application<br />Note 2.<br />(B) Acts and omissions aided or abetted by the defendant; acts and omis-<br />sions in a jointly undertaken criminal activity.—<br />(i) Defendant C is the getaway driver in an armed bank robbery<br />in which $15,000 is taken and a teller is assaulted and injured.<br />Defendant C is accountable for the money taken under subsec-<br />tion (a)(1)(A) because he aided and abetted the act of taking the<br />money (the taking of money was the specific objective of the<br />offense he joined). Defendant C is accountable for the injury to<br />the teller under subsection (a)(1)(B) because the assault on the<br />teller was within the scope and in furtherance of the jointly<br />undertaken criminal activity (the robbery), and was reasonably<br />foreseeable in connection with that criminal activity (given the<br />nature of the offense).<br />As noted earlier, a defendant may be accountable for particular<br />conduct under more than one subsection. In this example, De-<br />fendant C also is accountable for the money taken on the basis<br />of subsection (a)(1)(B) because the taking of money was within<br />the scope and in furtherance of the jointly undertaken criminal<br />activity (the robbery), and was reasonably foreseeable (as<br />noted, the taking of money was the specific objective of the<br />jointly undertaken criminal activity).<br />(C) Requirements that the conduct of others be within the scope of the<br />jointly undertaken criminal activity, in furtherance of that criminal ac-<br />tivity, and reasonably foreseeable.—<br />(i) Defendant D pays Defendant E a small amount to forge an en-<br />dorsement on an $800 stolen government check. Unknown to<br />Defendant E, Defendant D then uses that check as a down pay-<br />ment in a scheme to fraudulently obtain $15,000 worth of mer-<br />chandise. Defendant E is convicted of forging the $800 check<br />and is accountable for the forgery of this check under subsec-<br />tion (a)(1)(A). Defendant E is not accountable for the $15,000<br />because the fraudulent scheme to obtain $15,000 was not<br />within the scope of the jointly undertaken criminal activity<br />(i.e., the forgery of the $800 check).<br />(ii) Defendants F and G, working together, design and execute a<br />scheme to sell fraudulent stocks by telephone. Defendant F<br />fraudulently obtains $20,000. Defendant G fraudulently ob-<br />tains $35,000. Each is convicted of mail fraud. Defendants F<br />and G each are accountable for the entire amount ($55,000).<br />Each defendant is accountable for the amount he personally<br />obtained under subsection (a)(1)(A). Each defendant is ac-<br />countable for the amount obtained by his accomplice under<br />Amendment 790<br />98 ║ Supplement to Appendix C (November 1, 2016)<br />subsection (a)(1)(B) because the conduct of each was within the<br />scope of the jointly undertaken criminal activity (the scheme to<br />sell fraudulent stocks), was in furtherance of that criminal ac-<br />tivity, and was reasonably foreseeable in connection with that<br />criminal activity.<br />(iii) Defendants H and I engaged in an ongoing marihuana impor-<br />tation conspiracy in which Defendant J was hired only to help<br />off-load a single shipment. Defendants H, I, and J are included<br />in a single count charging conspiracy to import marihuana. De-<br />fendant J is accountable for the entire single shipment of ma-<br />rihuana he helped import under subsection (a)(1)(A) and any<br />acts and omissions of others related to the importation of that<br />shipment on the basis of subsection (a)(1)(B) (see the discussion<br />in example (A)(i) above). He is not accountable for prior or sub-<br />sequent shipments of marihuana imported by Defendants H<br />or I because those acts were not within the scope of his jointly<br />undertaken criminal activity (the importation of the single<br />shipment of marihuana).<br />(iv) Defendant K is a wholesale distributor of child pornography.<br />Defendant L is a retail-level dealer who purchases child por-<br />nography from Defendant K and resells it, but otherwise oper-<br />ates independently of Defendant K. Similarly, Defendant M is<br />a retail-level dealer who purchases child pornography from De-<br />fendant K and resells it, but otherwise operates independently<br />of Defendant K. Defendants L and M are aware of each other’s<br />criminal activity but operate independently. Defendant N is<br />Defendant K’s assistant who recruits customers for Defend-<br />ant K and frequently supervises the deliveries to Defend-<br />ant K’s customers. Each defendant is convicted of a count<br />charging conspiracy to distribute child pornography. Defend-<br />ant K is accountable under subsection (a)(1)(A) for the entire<br />quantity of child pornography sold to Defendants L and M. De-<br />fendant N also is accountable for the entire quantity sold to<br />those defendants under subsection (a)(1)(B) because the entire<br />quantity was within the scope of his jointly undertaken crimi-<br />nal activity (to distribute child pornography with Defend-<br />ant K), in furtherance of that criminal activity, and reasonably<br />foreseeable. Defendant L is accountable under subsec-<br />tion (a)(1)(A) only for the quantity of child pornography that he<br />purchased from Defendant K because he is not engaged in a<br />jointly undertaken criminal activity with the other defendants.<br />For the same reason, Defendant M is accountable under sub-<br />section (a)(1)(A) only for the quantity of child pornography that<br />he purchased from Defendant K.<br />(v) Defendant O knows about her boyfriend’s ongoing drug-traf-<br />ficking activity, but agrees to participate on only one occasion<br />by making a delivery for him at his request when he was ill.<br />Defendant O is accountable under subsection (a)(1)(A) for the<br />drug quantity involved on that one occasion. Defendant O is<br />not accountable for the other drug sales made by her boyfriend<br />Amendment 790<br />because those sales were not within the scope of her jointly un-<br />dertaken criminal activity (i.e., the one delivery).<br />(vi) Defendant P is a street-level drug dealer who knows of other<br />street-level drug dealers in the same geographic area who sell<br />the same type of drug as he sells. Defendant P and the other<br />dealers share a common source of supply, but otherwise oper-<br />ate independently. Defendant P is not accountable for the<br />quantities of drugs sold by the other street-level drug dealers<br />because he is not engaged in a jointly undertaken criminal ac-<br />tivity with them. In contrast, Defendant Q, another street-level<br />drug dealer, pools his resources and profits with four other<br />street-level drug dealers. Defendant Q is engaged in a jointly<br />undertaken criminal activity and, therefore, he is accountable<br />under subsection (a)(1)(B) for the quantities of drugs sold by<br />the four other dealers during the course of his joint undertak-<br />ing with them because those sales were within the scope of the<br />jointly undertaken criminal activity, in furtherance of that<br />criminal activity, and reasonably foreseeable in connection<br />with that criminal activity.<br />(vii) Defendant R recruits Defendant S to distribute 500 grams of<br />cocaine. Defendant S knows that Defendant R is the prime fig-<br />ure in a conspiracy involved in importing much larger quanti-<br />ties of cocaine. As long as Defendant S’s agreement and conduct<br />is limited to the distribution of the 500 grams, Defendant S is<br />accountable only for that 500 gram amount (under subsec-<br />tion (a)(1)(A)), rather than the much larger quantity imported<br />by Defendant R. Defendant S is not accountable under subsec-<br />tion (a)(1)(B) for the other quantities imported by Defendant R<br />because those quantities were not within the scope of his jointly<br />undertaken criminal activity (i.e., the 500 grams).<br />(viii) Defendants T, U, V, and W are hired by a supplier to backpack<br />a quantity of marihuana across the border from Mexico into the<br />United States. Defendants T, U, V, and W receive their indi-<br />vidual shipments from the supplier at the same time and coor-<br />dinate their importation efforts by walking across the border<br />together for mutual assistance and protection. Each defendant<br />is accountable for the aggregate quantity of marihuana trans-<br />ported by the four defendants. The four defendants engaged in<br />a jointly undertaken criminal activity, the object of which was<br />the importation of the four backpacks containing marihuana<br />(subsection (a)(1)(B)), and aided and abetted each other’s ac-<br />tions (subsection (a)(1)(A)) in carrying out the jointly under-<br />taken criminal activity (which under subsection (a)(1)(B) were<br />also in furtherance of, and reasonably foreseeable in connection<br />with, the criminal activity). In contrast, if Defendants T, U, V,<br />and W were hired individually, transported their individual<br />shipments at different times, and otherwise operated inde-<br />pendently, each defendant would be accountable only for the<br />quantity of marihuana he personally transported (subsec-<br />tion (a)(1)(A)). As this example illustrates, the scope of the<br />jointly undertaken criminal activity may depend upon<br />Amendment 791<br />100 ║ Supplement to Appendix C (November 1, 2016)<br />whether, in the particular circumstances, the nature of the of-<br />fense is more appropriately viewed as one jointly undertaken<br />criminal activity or as a number of separate criminal activities.<br />See Application Note 3(B).”.<br />The Commentary to &#167;2K2.1 captioned “Application Notes” is amended in Note 14(E)<br />by striking “Application Note 9” both places such term appears and inserting “Appli-<br />cation Note 11”.<br />The Commentary to &#167;2X3.1 captioned “Application Notes” is amended in Note 1 by<br />striking “Application Note 10” and inserting “Application Note 12”.<br />The Commentary to &#167;2X4.1 captioned “Application Notes” is amended in Note 1 by<br />striking “Application Note 10” and inserting “Application Note 12”.</td><td>REASON FOR AMENDMENT: This amendment is a result of the Commission’s effort to<br />clarify the use of relevant conduct in offenses involving multiple participants.<br />The amendment makes clarifying revisions to &#167;1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct (Factors that<br />Determine the Guideline Range)). It restructures the guideline and its commentary to<br />set out more clearly the three-step analysis the court applies in determining whether<br />a defendant is accountable for the conduct of others in a jointly undertaken criminal<br />activity under &#167;1B1.3(a)(1)(B). The three-step analysis requires that the court (1) iden-<br />tify the scope of the jointly undertaken criminal activity; (2) determine whether the<br />conduct of others in the jointly undertaken criminal activity was in furtherance of that<br />criminal activity; and (3) determine whether the conduct of others was reasonably fore-<br />seeable in connection with that criminal activity.<br />Prior to this amendment, the “scope” element of the three-step analysis was identified<br />in the commentary to &#167;1B1.3 but was not included in the text of the guideline itself.<br />This amendment makes clear that, under the “jointly undertaken criminal activity”<br />provision, a defendant is accountable for the conduct of others in a jointly undertaken<br />criminal activity if the conduct meets all three criteria of the three-step analysis. This<br />amendment is not intended as a substantive change in policy.</td><td>Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2015.</td></tr><tr><td

tables<br />in &#167;&#167;2B1.1 (Theft, Property, Destruction, and Fraud), 2B2.1 (Burglary), 2B3.1 (Rob-<br />bery), 2R1.1 (Bid-Rigging, Price-Fixing or Market-Allocation Agreements Among Com-<br />petitors), 2T4.1 (Tax Table), 5E1.2 (Fines for Individual Defendants), and 8C2.4 (Base<br />Fine) to account for inflation. The amendment adjusts the amounts in each of the seven<br />monetary tables using a specific multiplier derived from the Consumer Price In-<br />dex (CPI), and then rounds—<br /> amounts greater than $100,000,000 to the nearest multiple of $50,000,000;<br /> amounts greater than $10,000,000 to the nearest multiple of $5,000,000;<br /> amounts greater than $1,000,000 to the nearest multiple of $500,000;<br /> amounts greater than $100,000 to the nearest multiple of $50,000;<br /> amounts greater than $10,000 to the nearest multiple of $5,000;<br /> amounts greater than $1,000 to the nearest multiple of $500; and<br /> amounts of $1,000 or less to the nearest multiple of $50.<br />In addition, the amendment includes conforming changes to other Chapter Two guide-<br />lines that refer to the monetary tables.<br />Congress has generally mandated that agencies in the executive branch adjust the civil<br />monetary penalties they impose to account for inflation using the CPI. See 28 U.S.C.<br />&#167; 2461 note (Federal Civil Penalties Inflationary Adjustment Act of 1990). Although<br />the Commission’s work does not involve civil monetary penalties, it does establish ap-<br />propriate criminal sentences for categories of offenses and offenders, including appro-<br />priate amounts for criminal fines. While some of the monetary values in the Chapter<br />Two guidelines have been revised since they were originally established in 1987, none<br />of the tables has been specifically revised to account for inflation.<br />Due to inflationary changes, there has been a gradual decrease in the value of the<br />dollar over time. As a result, monetary losses in current offenses reflect, to some de-<br />gree, a lower degree of harm and culpability than did equivalent amounts when the<br />monetary tables were established or last substantively amended. Similarly, the fine<br />levels recommended by the guidelines are lower in value than when they were last<br />Amendment 792<br />108 ║ Supplement to Appendix C (November 1, 2016)<br />adjusted, and therefore, do not have the same sentencing impact as a similar fine in<br />the past. Based on its analysis and widespread support for inflationary adjustments<br />expressed in public comment, the Commission concluded that aligning the above mon-<br />etary tables with modern dollar values is an appropriate step at this time.<br />The amendment adjusts each table based on inflationary changes since the year each<br />monetary table was last substantially amended:<br /> Loss table in &#167;2B1.1 and tax table in &#167;2T4.1: adjusting for inflation from 2001<br />($1.00 in 2001 = $1.34 in 2014);<br /> Loss tables in &#167;&#167;2B2.1 and 2B3.1 and fine table for individual defendants at<br />&#167;5E1.2(c)(3): adjusting for inflation from 1989 ($1.00 in 1989 = $1.91 in 2014);<br /> Volume of Commerce table in &#167;2R1.1: adjusting for inflation from 2005 ($1.00<br />in 2005 = $1.22 in 2014); and<br /> Fine table for organizational defendants at &#167;8C2.4(d): adjusting for inflation<br />from 1991 ($1.00 in 1991 = $1.74 in 2014).<br />Adjusting from the last substantive amendment year appropriately accounts for the<br />Commission’s previous work in revising these tables at various times. Although not<br />specifically focused on inflationary issues, previous Commissions engaged in careful<br />examination (and at times, a wholesale rewriting) of the monetary tables and ulti-<br />mately included monetary and enhancement levels that it considered appropriate at<br />that time. The Commission estimates that this amendment would result in the Bureau<br />of Prisons having approximately 224 additional prison beds available at the end of the<br />first year after implementation, and approximately 956 additional prison beds availa-<br />ble at the end of its fifth year of implementation.<br />Finally, the amendment adds a special instruction to both &#167;&#167;5E1.2 and 8C2.4 providing<br />that, for offenses committed prior to November 1, 2015, the court shall use the fine<br />provisions that were in effect on November 1, 2014, rather than the fine provisions as<br />amended for inflation. This addition responds to concerns expressed in public comment<br />that changes to the fine tables might create ex post facto problems. It ensures that an<br />offender whose offense level is calculated under the current Guidelines Manual is not<br />subject to the inflated fine provisions if his or her offense was committed prior to No-<br />vember 1, 2015. Such guidance is similar to that provided in the commentary to &#167;5E1.3<br />(Special Assessment) relating to the amount of the special assessment to be imposed<br />in a given case.</td><td>Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2015.</td></tr><tr><td class="n">791</td><td>Amendment 791</td><td>Section 2B1.1 is amended in subsection (b)(2) by striking the following:<br />“ (Apply the greatest) If the offense—<br />(A) (i) involved 10 or more victims; or (ii) was committed through mass-<br />marketing, increase by 2 levels;<br />Amendment 792<br />(B) involved 50 or more victims, increase by 4 levels; or<br />(C) involved 250 or more victims, increase by 6 levels.”,<br />and inserting the following:<br />“ (Apply the greatest) If the offense—<br />(A) (i) involved 10 or more victims; (ii) was committed through mass-mar-<br />keting; or (iii) resulted in substantial financial hardship to one or more<br />victims, increase by 2 levels;<br />(B) resulted in substantial financial hardship to five or more victims, in-<br />crease by 4 levels; or<br />(C) resulted in substantial financial hardship to 25 or more victims, in-<br />crease by 6 levels.”;<br />in subsection (b)(10)(C) by inserting after “the offense otherwise involved sophisticated<br />means” the following: “and the defendant intentionally engaged in or caused the con-<br />duct constituting sophisticated means”;<br />and in subsection (b)(16)(B) by inserting “or” at the end of subdivision (i), and by strik-<br />ing “; or (iii) substantially endangered the solvency or financial security of 100 or more<br />victims”.<br />The Commentary to &#167;2B1.1 captioned “Application Notes” is amended in Note 3(A)(ii)<br />by striking “(I) means the pecuniary harm that was intended to result from the offense;<br />and” and inserting “(I) means the pecuniary harm that the defendant purposely sought<br />to inflict; and”;<br />in Note 3(F)(ix) by striking “there shall be a rebuttable presumption that the actual<br />loss attributable to the change in value of the security or commodity is the amount<br />determined by—” and inserting “the court in determining loss may use any method<br />that is appropriate and practicable under the circumstances.

This<br />amendment is a result of the Commission’s multi-year study of &#167;2B1.1 and related<br />guidelines, and follows extensive data collection and analysis relating to economic of-<br />fenses and offenders. Using this Commission data, combined with legal analysis and<br />public comment, the Commission identified a number of specific areas where changes<br />were appropriate.<br />Victims Table<br />First, the amendment revises the victims table in &#167;2B1.1(b)(2) to specifically incorpo-<br />rate substantial financial hardship to victims as a factor in sentencing economic crime<br />offenders. As amended, the first tier of the victims table provides for a 2-level enhance-<br />ment where the offense involved 10 or more victims or mass-marketing, or if the of-<br />fense resulted in substantial financial hardship to one or more victims. The 4-level<br />enhancement applies if the offense resulted in substantial financial hardship to five or<br />more victims, and the 6-level enhancement applies if the offense resulted in substan-<br />tial financial hardship to 25 or more victims. As a conforming change, the special rule<br />in Application Note 4(C)(ii)(I), pertaining to theft of undelivered mail, is also revised<br />to refer to 10 rather than 50 victims.<br />In addition, the amendment adds a non-exhaustive list of factors for courts to consider<br />in determining whether the offense caused substantial financial hardship. These fac-<br />tors include: becoming insolvent; filing for bankruptcy; suffering substantial loss of a<br />retirement, education, or other savings or investment fund; making substantial<br />changes to employment; making substantial changes to living arrangements; or suf-<br />fering substantial harm to the victim’s ability to obtain credit. Two conforming changes<br />are also included. First, one factor — substantial harm to ability to obtain credit —<br />was previously included in Application Note 20(A)(vi) as a potential departure consid-<br />eration. The amendment removes this language from the Application Note. Second,<br />the amendment deletes subsection (b)(16)(B)(iii), which provided for an enhancement<br />where an offense substantially endangered the solvency or financial security of 100 or<br />more victims.<br />The Commission continues to believe that the number of victims is a meaningful meas-<br />ure of the harm and scope of an offense and can be indicative of its seriousness. It is<br />for this reason that the amended victims table maintains the 2-level enhancement for<br />offenses that involve 10 or more victims or mass marketing. However, the revisions to<br />Amendment 792<br />the victims table also reflect the Commission’s conclusion that the guideline should<br />place greater emphasis on the extent of harm that particular victims suffer as a result<br />of the offense. Consistent with the Commission’s overall goal of focusing more on victim<br />harm, the revised victims table ensures that an offense that results in even one victim<br />suffering substantial financial harm receives increased punishment, while also lessen-<br />ing the cumulative impact of loss and the number of victims, particularly in high-loss<br />cases.<br />Intended Loss<br />Second, the amendment revises the commentary at &#167;2B1.1, Application Note 3(A)(ii),<br />which has defined intended loss as “pecuniary harm that was intended to result from<br />the offense.” In interpreting this provision, courts have expressed some disagreement<br />as to whether a subjective or an objective inquiry is required. Compare United States<br />v. Manatau, 647 F.3d 1048 (10th Cir. 2011) (holding that a subjective inquiry is re-<br />quired), United States v. Diallo, 710 F.3d 147, 151 (3d Cir. 2013) (“To make this deter-<br />mination, we look to the defendant’s subjective expectation, not to the risk of loss to<br />which he may have exposed his victims.”), United States v. Confredo, 528 F.3d 143,<br />152 (2d Cir. 2008) (remanding for consideration of whether defendant had “proven a<br />subjective intent to cause a loss of less than the aggregate amount” of fraudulent<br />loans), and United States v. Sanders, 343 F.3d 511, 527 (5th Cir. 2003) (“our case law<br />requires the government prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant<br />had the subjective intent to cause the loss that is used to calculate his offense level”),<br />with United States v. Innarelli, 524 F.3d 286, 291 (1st Cir. 2008) (“we focus our loss<br />inquiry for purposes of determining a defendant’s offense level on the objectively rea-<br />sonable expectation of a person in his position at the time he perpetrated the fraud,<br />not on his subjective intentions or hopes”) and United States v. Lane, 323 F.3d 568,<br />590 (7th Cir. 2003) (“The determination of intended loss under the Sentencing Guide-<br />lines therefore focuses on the conduct of the defendant and the objective financial risk<br />to victims caused by that conduct”).<br />The amendment adopts the approach taken by the Tenth Circuit by revising the com-<br />mentary in Application Note 3(A)(ii) to provide that intended loss means the pecuniary<br />harm that “the defendant purposely sought to inflict.” The amendment reflects the<br />Commission’s continued belief that intended loss is an important factor in economic<br />crime offenses, but also recognizes that sentencing enhancements predicated on in-<br />tended loss, rather than losses that have actually accrued, should focus more specifi-<br />cally on the defendant’s culpability.<br />Sophisticated Means<br />Third, the amendment narrows the focus of the specific offense characteristic at<br />&#167;2B1.1(b)(10)(C) to cases in which the defendant intentionally engaged in or caused<br />conduct constituting sophisticated means. Prior to the amendment, the enhancement<br />applied if “the offense otherwise involved sophisticated means.” Based on this lan-<br />guage, courts had applied this enhancement on the basis of the sophistication of the<br />overall scheme without a determination of whether the defendant’s own conduct was<br />“sophisticated.” See, e.g., United States v. Green, 648 F.3d 569, 576 (7th Cir. 2011);<br />United States v. Bishop-Oyedepo, 480 Fed. App’x 431, 433–34 (7th Cir. 2012); United<br />States v. Jenkins-Watt, 574 F.3d 950, 965 (8th Cir. 2009). The Commission concluded<br />that basing the enhancement on the defendant’s own intentional conduct better re-<br />flects the defendant’s culpability and will appropriately minimize application of this<br />enhancement to less culpable offenders.<br />Amendment 793<br />112 ║ Supplement to Appendix C (November 1, 2016)<br />Fraud on the Market<br />Finally, the amendment revises the special rule at Application Note 3(F)(ix) relating<br />to the calculation of loss in cases involving the fraudulent inflation or deflation in the<br />value of a publicly traded security or commodity. When this special rule was added to<br />the guidelines, it established a rebuttable presumption that the specified loss calcula-<br />tion methodology provides a reasonable estimate of the actual loss in such cases. As<br />amended, the method provided in the special rule is no longer the presumed starting<br />point for calculating loss in these cases. Instead, the revised special rule states that<br />the provided method is one method that courts may consider, but that courts, in deter-<br />mining loss, are free to use any method that is appropriate and practicable under the<br />circumstances. This amendment reflects the Commission’s view that the most appro-<br />priate method to determine a reasonable estimate of loss will often vary in these highly<br />complex and fact-intensive cases.<br />This amendment, in combination with related revisions to the mitigating role guideline<br />at &#167;3B1.2 (Mitigating Role), reflects the Commission’s overall goal of focusing the eco-<br />nomic crime guideline more on qualitative harm to victims and individual offender<br />culpability.</td><td>Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2015.</td></tr><tr><td class="n">792</td><td>Amendment 792</td><td>Section 2D1.1(c) is amended in each of subdivisions (5), (6), (7), (8), and<br />(9) by striking the lines referenced to Schedule III Hydrocodone;<br />and in each of subdivisions (10), (11), (12), (13), (14), (15), (16), and (17) by striking the<br />lines referenced to Schedule III Hydrocodone, and in the lines referenced to Schedule<br />III substances (except Ketamine or Hydrocodone) by striking “or Hydrocodone”.<br />The annotation to &#167;2D1.1(c) captioned “Notes to Drug Quantity Table” is amended in<br />Note (B) in the last paragraph by striking “The term ‘Oxycodone (actual)’ refers” and<br />inserting “The terms ‘Hydrocodone (actual)’ and ‘Oxycodone (actual)’ refer”.<br />The Commentary to &#167;2D1.1 captioned “Application Notes” is amended in Note 8(D),<br />under the heading relating to Schedule I or II Opiates, by striking the line referenced<br />to Hydrocodone/Dihydrocodeinone and inserting the following:<br />“ 1 gm of Hydrocodone (actual) = 6700 gm of marihuana”;<br />in the heading relating to Schedule III Substances (except ketamine and hydrocodone)<br />by striking “and hydrocodone” both places such term appears;<br />and in the heading relating to Schedule III Hydrocodone by striking the heading and<br />subsequent paragraphs as follows:<br />“ Schedule III Hydrocodone****<br />1 unit of Schedule III hydrocodone = 1 gm of marihuana<br />Amendment 793<br />****Provided, that the combined equivalent weight of all Schedule III sub-<br />stances (except ketamine), Schedule IV substances (except flunitrazepam), and<br />Schedule V substances shall not exceed 2,999.99 kilograms of marihuana.”;<br />and in Note 27(C) by inserting after “methamphetamine,” the following: “hydroco-<br />done,”.</td><td>REASON FOR AMENDMENT: This amendment changes the way the primary drug traf-<br />ficking guideline calculates a defendant’s drug quantity in cases involving hydrocodone<br />in response to recent administrative actions by the Food and Drug Administration and<br />the Drug Enforcement Administration. The amendment adopts a marihuana equiva-<br />lency for hydrocodone (1 gram equals 6700 grams of marihuana) based on the weight<br />of the hydrocodone alone.<br />In 2013 and 2014, the Food and Drug Administration approved several new pharma-<br />ceuticals containing hydrocodone which can contain up to twelve times as much hydro-<br />codone in a single pill than was previously available. Separately, in October 2014, the<br />Drug Enforcement Administration moved certain commonly-prescribed pharmaceuti-<br />cals containing hydrocodone from the less-restricted Schedule III to the more-re-<br />stricted Schedule II. Among other things, the scheduling doubled the statutory maxi-<br />mum term of imprisonment available for trafficking in the pharmaceuticals that were<br />previously controlled under Schedule III from 10 years to 20 years. The change also<br />rendered obsolete the entries in the Drug Quantity Table and Drug Equivalency Table<br />in &#167;2D1.1 (Unlawful Manufacturing, Importing, Exporting, or Trafficking (Including<br />Possession with Intent to Commit These Offenses); Attempt or Conspiracy) that set a<br />marihuana equivalency for the pharmaceuticals that were previously controlled under<br />Schedule III.<br />As a result of these administrative actions, all pharmaceuticals that include hydroco-<br />done are now subject to the same statutory penalties. There is wide variation in the<br />amount of hydrocodone available in these pharmaceuticals and in the amount of other<br />ingredients (such as binders, coloring, acetaminophen, etc.) they contain. This varia-<br />tion raises significant proportionality issues within &#167;2D1.1, where drug quantity for<br />hydrocodone offenses has previously been calculated based on the weight of the entire<br />substance that contains hydrocodone or on the number of pills. Neither of these calcu-<br />lations directly took into account the amount of actual hydrocodone in the pills.<br />The amendment addresses these changed circumstances by setting a new marihuana<br />equivalency for hydrocodone based on the weight of the hydrocodone alone. Without<br />this change, defendants with less actual hydrocodone could have received a higher<br />guideline range than those with more hydrocodone because pills with less hydrocodone<br />can sometimes contain more non-hydrocodone ingredients, leading the lower-dose pills<br />to weigh more.<br />In setting the marihuana equivalency, the Commission considered: potency of the<br />drug, medical use of the drug, and patterns of abuse and trafficking, such as prevalence<br />of abuse, consequences of misuse including death or serious bodily injury from use, and<br />incidence of violence associated with its trafficking. The Commission noted that the<br />Drug Enforcement Administration’s rescheduling decision relied in part on the close<br />relationship between hydrocodone and oxycodone, a similar and commonly-prescribed<br />drug that was already controlled under Schedule II. Scientific literature, public com-<br />ment, and testimony supported the conclusion that the potency, medical use, and pat-<br />terns of abuse and trafficking of hydrocodone are very similar to oxycodone. In partic-<br />ular, the Commission heard testimony from abuse liability specialists and reviewed<br />Amendment 794<br />114 ║ Supplement to Appendix C (November 1, 2016)<br />scientific literature indicating that, in studies conducted under standards established<br />by the Food and Drug Administration for determining the abuse liability of a particular<br />drug, the potencies of hydrocodone and oxycodone when abused are virtually identical,<br />even though some physicians who prescribe the two drugs in a clinical setting might<br />not prescribe them in equal doses. Public comment indicated that both hydrocodone<br />and oxycodone are among the top ten drugs most frequently encountered by law en-<br />forcement and that their methods of diversion and rates of diversion per kilogram of<br />available drug are similar. Public comment and review of the scientific literature also<br />indicated that the users of the two drugs share similar characteristics, and that some<br />users may use them interchangeably, a situation which may become more common as<br />the more powerful pharmaceuticals recently approved by the Food and Drug Admin-<br />istration become available.<br />Based on proportionality considerations and the Commission’s assessment that, for<br />purposes of the drug guideline, hydrocodone and oxycodone should be treated equiva-<br />lently, the amendment adopts a marihuana equivalency for hydrocodone (actual) that<br />is the same as the existing equivalency for oxycodone (actual): 1 gram equals<br />6,700 grams of marihuana.</td><td>Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2015.</td></tr><tr><td class="n">793</td><td>Amendment 793</td><td>The Commentary to &#167;3B1.2 captioned “Application Notes” is amended in<br />Note 3(A) by inserting after “that makes him substantially less culpable than the av-<br />erage participant” the following: “in the criminal activity”, by striking “concerted” and<br />inserting “the”, by striking “is not precluded from consideration for” each place such<br />term appears and inserting “may receive”, by striking “role” both places such term<br />appears and inserting “participation”, and by striking “personal gain from a fraud of-<br />fense and who had limited knowledge” and inserting “personal gain from a fraud of-<br />fense or who had limited knowledge”;<br />in Note 3(C) by inserting at the end the following new paragraphs:<br />“ In determining whether to apply subsection (a) or (b), or an intermediate ad-<br />justment, the court should consider the following non-exhaustive list of factors:<br />(i) the degree to which the defendant understood the scope and structure<br />of the criminal activity;<br />(ii) the degree to which the defendant participated in planning or organiz-<br />ing the criminal activity;<br />(iii) the degree to which the defendant exercised decision-making authority<br />or influenced the exercise of decision-making authority;<br />(iv) the nature and extent of the defendant’s participation in the commis-<br />sion of the criminal activity, including the acts the defendant per-<br />formed and the responsibility and discretion the defendant had in per-<br />forming those acts;<br />Amendment 794<br />(v) the degree to which the defendant stood to benefit from the criminal<br />activity.<br />For example, a defendant who does not have a proprietary interest in the crim-<br />inal activity and who is simply being paid to perform certain tasks should be<br />considered for an adjustment under this guideline.<br />The fact that a defendant performs an essential or indispensable role in the<br />criminal activity is not determinative.

The Commission conducted a review of cases involving low-<br />level offenders, analyzed case law, and considered public comment and testimony.<br />Overall, the study found that mitigating role is applied inconsistently and more spar-<br />ingly than the Commission intended. In drug cases, the Commission’s study confirmed<br />that mitigating role is applied inconsistently to drug defendants who performed simi-<br />lar low-level functions (and that rates of application vary widely from district to dis-<br />trict). For example, application of mitigating role varies along the southwest border,<br />with a low of 14.3 percent of couriers and mules receiving the mitigating role adjust-<br />ment in one district compared to a high of 97.2 percent in another. Moreover, among<br />drug defendants who do receive mitigating role, there are differences from district to<br />district in application rates of the 2-, 3-, and 4-level adjustments. In economic crime<br />cases, the study found that the adjustment was often applied in a limited fashion. For<br />example, the study found that courts often deny mitigating role to otherwise eligible<br />defendants if the defendant was considered “integral” to the successful commission of<br />the offense.<br />This amendment provides additional guidance to sentencing courts in determining<br />whether a mitigating role adjustment applies. Specifically, it addresses a circuit con-<br />flict and other case law that may be discouraging courts from applying the adjustment<br />in otherwise appropriate circumstances. It also provides a non-exhaustive list of fac-<br />tors for the court to consider in determining whether an adjustment applies and, if so,<br />the amount of the adjustment.<br />Section 3B1.2 provides an adjustment of 2, 3, or 4 levels for a defendant who plays a<br />part in committing the offense that makes him or her “substantially less culpable than<br />the average participant.” However, there are differences among the circuits about what<br />determining the “average participant” requires. The Seventh and Ninth Circuits have<br />concluded that the “average participant” means only those persons who actually par-<br />ticipated in the criminal activity at issue in the defendant’s case, so that the defend-<br />ant’s relative culpability is determined only by reference to his or her co-participants<br />in the case at hand. See, e.g., United States v. Benitez, 34 F.3d 1489, 1498 (9th Cir.<br />1994); United States v. Cantrell, 433 F.3d 1269, 1283 (9th Cir. 2006); United States v.<br />DePriest, 6 F.3d 1201, 1214 (7th Cir. 1993). The First and Second Circuits have con-<br />cluded that the “average participant” also includes “the universe of persons participat-<br />ing in similar crimes.” See United States v. Santos, 357 F.3d 136, 142 (1st Cir. 2004);<br />see also United States v. Rahman, 189 F.3d 88, 159 (2d Cir. 1999). Under this latter<br />Amendment 794<br />116 ║ Supplement to Appendix C (November 1, 2016)<br />approach, courts will ordinarily consider the defendant’s culpability relative both to<br />his co-participants and to the typical offender.<br />The amendment generally adopts the approach of the Seventh and Ninth Circuits, re-<br />vising the commentary to specify that, when determining mitigating role, the defend-<br />ant is to be compared with the other participants “in the criminal activity.” Focusing<br />the court’s attention on the individual defendant and the other participants is more<br />consistent with the other provisions of Chapter Three, Part B. See, e.g., &#167;3B1.2 (the<br />adjustment is based on “the defendant’s role in the offense”); &#167;3B1.2, comment. (n.3(C))<br />(a determination about mitigating role “is heavily dependent upon the facts of the par-<br />ticular case”); Ch. 3, Pt. B, intro. comment. (the determination about mitigating role<br />“is to be made on the basis of all conduct within the scope of &#167;1B1.3 (Relevant Con-<br />duct)”).<br />Next, the amendment addresses cases in which the defendant was “integral” or “indis-<br />pensable” to the commission of the offense. Public comment suggested, and a review of<br />case law confirmed, that in some cases a defendant may be denied a mitigating role<br />adjustment solely because he or she was “integral” or “indispensable” to the commis-<br />sion of the offense. See, e.g., United States v. Skinner, 690 F.3d 772, 783–84 (6th Cir.<br />2012) (a “defendant who plays a lesser role in a criminal scheme may nonetheless fail<br />to qualify as a minor participant if his role was indispensible or critical to the success<br />of the scheme”); United States v. Panaigua-Verdugo, 537 F.3d 722, 725 (7th Cir. 2008)<br />(defendant “played an integral part in the transactions and therefore did not deserve<br />a minor participant reduction”); United States v. Deans, 590 F.3d 907, 910 (8th Cir.<br />2010) (“Numerous decisions have upheld the denial of minor role adjustments to de-<br />fendants who . . . play a critical role”); United States v. Carter, 971 F.2d 597, 600<br />(10th Cir. 1992) (because defendant was “indispensible to the completion of the crimi-<br />nal activity . . . to debate which one is less culpable than the others . . . is akin to the<br />old argument over which leg of a three-legged stool is the most important leg.”). How-<br />ever, a finding that the defendant was essential to the offense does not alter the re-<br />quirement, expressed in Note 3(A), that the court must assess the defendant’s culpa-<br />bility relative to the average participant in the offense. Accordingly, the amendment<br />revises the commentary to emphasize that “the fact that a defendant performs an es-<br />sential or indispensable role in the criminal activity is not determinative” and that<br />such a defendant may receive a mitigating role adjustment, if he or she is otherwise<br />eligible.<br />The amendment also revises two paragraphs in Note 3(A) that illustrate how mitigat-<br />ing role interacts with relevant conduct principles in &#167;1B1.3. Specifically, the illustra-<br />tions provide that certain types of defendants are “not precluded from consideration<br />for” a mitigating role adjustment. The amendment revises these paragraphs to state<br />that these types of defendants “may receive” a mitigating role adjustment. The Com-<br />mission determined that the double-negative tone (“not precluded”) may have had the<br />unintended effect of discouraging courts from applying the mitigating role adjustment<br />in otherwise appropriate circumstances.<br />Finally, the amendment provides a non-exhaustive list of factors for the court to con-<br />sider in determining whether to apply a mitigating role adjustment and, if so, the<br />amount of the adjustment. The factors direct the court to consider the degree to which<br />the defendant understood the scope and structure of the criminal activity, participated<br />in planning or organizing the criminal activity, and exercised decision-making author-<br />ity, as well as the acts the defendant performed and the degree to which he or she stood<br />to benefit from the criminal activity. The Commission was persuaded by public com-<br />ment and a detailed review of cases involving low-level offenders, particularly in fraud<br />Amendment 795<br />cases, that providing a list of factors will give the courts a common framework for de-<br />termining whether to apply a mitigating role adjustment (and, if so, the amount of the<br />adjustment) and will help promote consistency.<br />The amendment further provides, as an example, that a defendant who does not have<br />a proprietary interest in the criminal activity and who is simply being paid to perform<br />certain tasks should be considered for a mitigating role adjustment.</td><td>Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2015.</td></tr><tr><td class="n">794</td><td>Amendment 794</td><td>The Commentary to &#167;2L1.2 captioned “Application Notes” is amended in<br />Note 4(B) by striking “not counted as a single sentence” and inserting “not treated as<br />a single sentence”.<br />Section 4A1.1(e) is amended by striking “such sentence was counted as a single sen-<br />tence” and inserting “such sentence was treated as a single sentence”.<br />The Commentary to &#167;4A1.1 captioned “Application Notes” is amended in Note 5 by<br />striking “are counted as a single sentence” and inserting “are treated as a single sen-<br />tence”; and by striking “are counted as a single prior sentence” and inserting “are<br />treated as a single prior sentence”.<br />Section 4A1.2(a)(2) is amended by striking “those sentences are counted separately or<br />as a single sentence” and inserting “those sentences are counted separately or treated<br />as a single sentence”; by striking “Count any prior sentence” and inserting “Treat any<br />prior sentence”; and by striking “if prior sentences are counted as a single sentence”<br />and inserting “if prior sentences are treated as a single sentence”.<br />The Commentary to &#167;4A1.2 captioned “Application Notes” is amended in Note 3 by<br />redesignating Note 3 as Note 3(B), and by inserting at the beginning the following:<br />“ Application of ‘Single Sentence’ Rule (Subsection (a)(2)).—<br />(A) Predicate Offenses.—In some cases, multiple prior sentences are<br />treated as a single sentence for purposes of calculating the criminal<br />history score under &#167;4A1.1(a), (b), and (c). However, for purposes of de-<br />termining predicate offenses, a prior sentence included in the single<br />sentence should be treated as if it received criminal history points, if it<br />independently would have received criminal history points. Therefore,<br />an individual prior sentence may serve as a predicate under the career<br />offender guideline (see &#167;4B1.2(c)) or other guidelines with predicate of-<br />fenses, if it independently would have received criminal history points.<br />However, because predicate offenses may be used only if they are<br />counted “separately” from each other (see &#167;4B1.2(c)), no more than one<br />prior sentence in a given single sentence may be used as a predicate<br />offense.<br />For example, a defendant’s criminal history includes one robbery con-<br />viction and one theft conviction.

Because this particular robbery met the def-<br />inition of a felony crime of violence and independently would have re-<br />ceived 2 criminal history points under &#167;4A1.1(b), it may serve as a<br />predicate under the career offender guideline.<br />Note, however, that if the sentences in the example above were im-<br />posed thirteen years ago, the robbery independently would have re-<br />ceived no criminal history points under &#167;4A1.1(b), because it was not<br />imposed within ten years of the defendant’s commencement of the in-<br />stant offense. See &#167;4A1.2(e)(2). Accordingly, it may not serve as a pred-<br />icate under the career offender guideline.”;<br />and in Note 3(B) (as so redesignated) by striking “Counting multiple prior sentences<br />as a single sentence” and inserting “Treating multiple prior sentences as a single sen-<br />tence”; and by striking “and the resulting sentences were counted as a single sentence”<br />and inserting “and the resulting sentences were treated as a single sentence”.<br />The Commentary to &#167;4B1.2 captioned “Application Notes” is amended in Note 1 by<br />striking “the sentences for the two prior convictions will be counted as a single sen-<br />tence” and inserting “the sentences for the two prior convictions will be treated as a<br />single sentence”.</td><td>REASON FOR AMENDMENT: This amendment responds to a circuit conflict regarding the<br />meaning of the “single sentence” rule, set forth in subsection (a)(2) of &#167;4A1.2 (Defini-<br />tions and Instructions for Computing Criminal History), and its implications for the<br />career offender guideline and other guidelines that provide sentencing enhancements<br />for predicate offenses.<br />When the defendant’s criminal history includes two or more prior sentences that meet<br />certain criteria specified in &#167;4A1.2(a)(2), those prior sentences are counted as a “single<br />sentence” rather than separately. Generally, this operates to reduce the cumulative<br />impact of prior sentences in determining a defendant’s criminal history score. Courts,<br />however, are divided over whether this “single sentence” rule also causes certain prior<br />convictions that ordinarily would qualify as predicate offenses under the career of-<br />fender guideline to be disqualified from serving as predicate offenses. See &#167;4B1.2 (Def-<br />initions of Terms Used in Section 4B1.1), comment. (n.3).<br />In 2010, in King v. United States, the Eighth Circuit held that when two or more prior<br />sentences are treated as a single sentence under the guidelines, all the criminal history<br />points attributable to the single sentence are assigned to only one of the prior sentences<br />— specifically, the one that was the longest. King, 595 F.3d 844, 852 (8th Cir. 2010).<br />Accordingly, only that prior sentence may be considered a predicate offense for pur-<br />poses of the career offender guideline. Id. at 849, 852.<br />In 2014, in United States v. Williams, a panel of the Sixth Circuit considered and re-<br />jected King, because it permitted the defendant to “evade career offender status be-<br />cause he committed more crimes.” Williams, 753 F.3d 626, 639 (6th Cir. 2014) (empha-<br />sis in original). See also United States v. Cornog, 945 F.2d 1504, 1506 n.3 (11th Cir.<br />1991) (“It would be illogical . . . to ignore a conviction for a violent felony just because<br />it happened to be coupled with a nonviolent felony conviction having a longer sen-<br />tence.”).<br />Amendment 796<br />After the Williams decision, a different panel of the Eighth Circuit agreed with the<br />Sixth Circuit’s analysis but was not in a position to overrule the earlier panel’s decision<br />in King. See Donnell v. United States, 765 F.3d 817, 820 (8th Cir. 2014). The Eighth<br />Circuit has applied the analysis from King to a case involving the firearms guideline<br />and to a case in which the prior sentences were consecutive rather than concurrent.<br />See, e.g., Pierce v. United States, 686 F.3d 529, 533 n.3 (8th Cir. 2012) (firearms);<br />United States v. Parker, 762 F.3d 801, 808 (8th Cir. 2014) (consecutive sentences). This<br />issue has also been addressed by other courts, some which have followed the Sixth<br />Circuit’s approach in Williams. See, e.g., United States v. Carr, 2013 WL 4855341<br />(N.D. Ga. 2013); United States v. Agurs, 2014 WL 3735584 (W.D. Pa., July 28, 2014).<br />Other decisions have been consistent with the Eighth Circuit’s approach in King.<br />See, e.g., United States v. Santiago, 387 F. App’x 223 (3d Cir. 2010); United States v.<br />McQueen, 2014 WL 3749215 (E.D. Wash., July 28, 2014).<br />The amendment generally follows the Sixth Circuit’s approach in Williams. It amends<br />the commentary to &#167;4A1.2 to provide that, for purposes of determining predicate of-<br />fenses, a prior sentence included in a single sentence should be treated as if it received<br />criminal history points if it independently would have received criminal history points.<br />It also provides examples, including an example to illustrate the potential impact of<br />the applicable time periods prescribed in &#167;4A1.2(e). Finally, &#167;&#167;4A1.1 (Criminal History<br />Category) and 4A1.2 are revised stylistically so that sentences “counted” as a single<br />sentence are referred to instead as sentences “treated” as a single sentence.<br />The amendment ensures that those defendants who have committed more crimes, in<br />addition to a predicate offense, remain subject to enhanced penalties under certain<br />guidelines such as the career offender guideline. Conversely, by clarifying how the sin-<br />gle sentence rule interacts with the time limits set forth in &#167;4A1.2(e), the amendment<br />provides that when a prior sentence was so remote in time that it does not inde-<br />pendently receive criminal history points, it cannot serve as a predicate offense.</td><td>Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2015.</td></tr><tr><td class="n">795</td><td>Amendment 795</td><td>The Commentary to &#167;1B1.11 captioned “Background” is amended by<br />striking “144 S.

Upward Departure for Burglary Involving Violence.—There may be cases in<br />which a burglary involves violence, but does not qualify as a ‘crime of violence’<br />as defined in &#167;4B1.2(a) and, as a result, the defendant does not receive a higher<br />offense level or higher Criminal History Category that would have applied if<br />Amendment 798<br />the burglary qualified as a ‘crime of violence.’ In such a case, an upward depar-<br />ture may be appropriate.”.</td><td>REASON FOR AMENDMENT: This amendment is a result of the Commission’s multi-year<br />study of statutory and guideline definitions relating to the nature of a defendant’s prior<br />conviction (e.g., “crime of violence,” “aggravated felony,” “violent felony,” “drug traf-<br />ficking offense,” and “felony drug offense”) and the impact of such definitions on the<br />relevant statutory and guideline provisions (e.g., career offender, illegal reentry, and<br />armed career criminal). As part of this study, the Commission considered feedback<br />from the field, including conducting a roundtable discussion on these topics and con-<br />sidering the varying case law interpreting these statutory and guideline definitions.<br />In particular, the Commission has received extensive comment, and is aware of nu-<br />merous court opinions, expressing a view that the definition of “crime of violence” is<br />complex and unclear. The amendment is informed by this public comment and case<br />law, as well as the Supreme Court’s recent decision in Johnson v. United States,<br />135 S. Ct. 2551 (2015), regarding the statutory definition of “violent felony” in<br />18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(e) (commonly referred to as the “Armed Career Criminal Act” or<br />“ACCA”). While not addressing the guidelines, that decision has given rise to signifi-<br />cant litigation regarding the guideline definition of “crime of violence.” Finally, the<br />Commission analyzed a range of sentencing data, including a study of the sentences<br />relative to the guidelines for the career offender guidelines. See U.S. Sent’g Comm’n,<br />Quick Facts: Career Offenders (Nov. 2015) (highlighting the decreasing rate of within<br />range guideline sentences (27.5% in fiscal year 2014), which has been coupled with<br />increasing rates of government (45.6%) and non-government sponsored below range<br />sentences (25.9%)).<br />The amendment makes several changes to the definition of “crime of violence” at<br />&#167;4B1.2 (Definitions of Terms Used in Section 4B1.1), which, prior to this amendment,<br />was defined as any offense under federal or state law, punishable by imprisonment for<br />a term exceeding one year, that<br />● has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force<br />against the person of another (“force clause” or “elements clause”),<br />see &#167;4B1.2(a)(1);<br />● is murder, manslaughter, kidnapping, aggravated assault, forcible sex of-<br />fenses, robbery, arson, extortion, extortionate extension of credit, burglary of a<br />dwelling, or involves the use of explosives (“enumerated offenses”),<br />see &#167;4B1.2(a)(2) and comment. (n.1); or<br />● otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical<br />injury to another (“residual clause”), see &#167;4B1.2(a)(2).<br />The “crime of violence” definition at &#167;4B1.2 is used to trigger increased sentences un-<br />der several provisions in the Guidelines Manual, the most significant of which is<br />&#167;4B1.1 (Career Offender). See also &#167;&#167;2K1.3, 2K2.1, 2S1.1, 4A1.1(e), 7B1.1. The career<br />offender guideline implements a directive to the Commission set forth at 28 U.S.C.<br />&#167; 994(h), which in turn identifies offenders for whom the guidelines must provide in-<br />creased punishment. Tracking the criteria set forth in section 994(h), the Commission<br />implemented the directive by identifying a defendant as a career offender if (1) the<br />defendant was at least eighteen years old at the time he or she committed the instant<br />offense of conviction; (2) the instant offense is a felony that is a crime of violence or a<br />controlled substance offense, and (3) the defendant has at least two prior felony con-<br />victions of either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense. Where these<br />criteria are met, the directive at section 994(h), and therefore &#167;4B1.1, provides for sig-<br />nificantly higher sentences under the guidelines, such that the guideline range is “at<br />Amendment 798<br />128 ║ Supplement to Appendix C (November 1, 2016)<br />or near the maximum [term of imprisonment] authorized.” Commission data shows<br />that application of &#167;4B1.1 resulted in an increased final offense level, an increased<br />Criminal History Category, or both for 91.3 percent of defendants sentenced under the<br />career offender guideline in fiscal year 2014. See U.S. Sent’g Comm’n, Quick Facts:<br />Career Offenders (Nov. 2015) (46.3% of career offenders received an increase in both<br />final offense level (from an average of 23 levels to 31 levels) and criminal history cate-<br />gory (from an average of category IV to category VI); 32.6% had just a higher final<br />offense level (from an average of 23 levels to 30 levels); and 12.4% had just a higher<br />Criminal History Category (from an average of category IV to category VI)).<br />Residual Clause<br />First, the amendment deletes the “residual clause” at &#167;4B1.2(a)(2). Prior to the amend-<br />ment, the term “crime of violence” in &#167;4B1.2 included any offense that “otherwise in-<br />volves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.”<br />In Johnson, the Supreme Court considered an identical residual clause relating to the<br />statutory definition of “violent felony” in the Armed Career Criminal Act. The Court<br />held that using the “residual clause” to classify an offense as a “violent felony” violated<br />due process because the clause was unconstitutionally vague. See Johnson, 135 S. Ct.<br />at 2563. While the Supreme Court in Johnson did not consider or address the sentenc-<br />ing guidelines, significant litigation has ensued regarding whether the Supreme<br />Court’s holding in Johnson should also apply to the residual clause in &#167;4B1.2. Compare<br />United States v. Matchett, 802 F.3d 1185 (11th Cir. 2015) (rejecting the argument that<br />the residual clause in &#167;4B1.2 is unconstitutionally vague in light of Johnson) and<br />United States v. Wilson, 622 F. App’x 393, 405 n.51 (5th Cir. 2015) (in considering the<br />applicability of Johnson, noting “[o]ur case law indicates that a defendant cannot bring<br />a vagueness challenge against a Sentencing Guideline”), with United States v. Taylor,<br />803 F.3d 931 (8th Cir. 2015) (finding that previous circuit precedent holding that the<br />guidelines cannot be unconstitutionally vague because they do not proscribe conduct<br />is doubtful after Johnson); United States v. Madrid, 805 F.3d 1204, 1211 (10th Cir.<br />2015) (holding that that the residual clause of &#167;4B1.2(a)(2) is void for vagueness);<br />United States v. Harbin, 610 F. App’x 562 (6th Cir. 2015) (finding that defendant is<br />entitled to the same relief as offenders sentenced under the residual clause of the<br />ACCA); and United States v. Townsend, 638 F. App’x 172, 177–78 (3d Cir. 2015) (re-<br />manding for resentencing in light of the government’s concession that, pursuant to<br />Johnson, the defendant should not have been sentenced as a career offender).<br />The Commission determined that the residual clause at &#167;4B1.2 implicates many of the<br />same concerns cited by the Supreme Court in Johnson, and, as a matter of policy,<br />amends &#167;4B1.2(a)(2) to strike the clause. Removing the residual clause has the ad-<br />vantage of alleviating the considerable application difficulties associated with that<br />clause, as expressed by judges, probation officers, and litigants. Furthermore, remov-<br />ing the clause will alleviate some of the ongoing litigation and uncertainty resulting<br />from the Johnson decision.<br />List of Enumerated Offenses<br />With the deletion of the residual clause under subsection (a)(2), there are two remain-<br />ing components of the “crime of violence” definition – the “elements clause” and the<br />“enumerated offenses clause.” The “elements clause” set forth in subsection (a)(1) re-<br />mains unchanged by the amendment. Thus, any offense under federal or state law,<br />punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, qualifies as a “crime of<br />violence” if it has as an element the use, or attempted use, or threatened use of physical<br />Amendment 798<br />force against the person of another. Importantly, such an offense may, but need not,<br />be specifically enumerated in subsection (a)(2) to qualify as a crime of violence.<br />The “enumerated offense clause” identifies specific offenses that qualify as crimes of<br />violence. In applying this clause, courts compare the elements of the predicate offense<br />of conviction with the elements of the enumerated offense in its “generic, contemporary<br />definition.” As has always been the case, such offenses qualify as crimes of violence<br />regardless of whether the offense expressly has as an element the use, attempted use,<br />or threatened use of physical force against the person of another. While most of the<br />offenses on the enumerated list under &#167;4B1.2(a)(2) remain the same, the amendment<br />does revise the list in a number of ways to focus on the most dangerous repeat offend-<br />ers. The revised list is based on the Commission’s consideration of public hearing tes-<br />timony, a review of extensive public comment, and an examination of sentencing data<br />relating to the risk of violence in these offenses and the recidivism rates of career of-<br />fenders. Additionally, the Commission’s revisions to the enumerated list also consider<br />and reflect the fact that offenses not specifically enumerated will continue to qualify<br />as a crime of violence if they satisfy the elements clause.<br />As amended, the enumerated offenses include murder, voluntary manslaughter, kid-<br />napping, aggravated assault, forcible sex offenses, robbery, arson, extortion, or the use<br />or unlawful possession of a firearm described in 26 U.S.C. &#167; 5845(a) or explosive ma-<br />terial as defined in 18 U.S.C. &#167; 841(c). For easier application, all enumerated offenses<br />are now included in the guideline at &#167;4B1.2; prior to the amendment, the list was set<br />forth in both &#167;4B1.2(a)(2) and the commentary at Application Note 1.<br />Manslaughter, which is currently enumerated in Application Note 1, is revised to in-<br />clude only voluntary manslaughter. While Commission analysis indicates that it is<br />rare for involuntary manslaughter to be identified as a predicate for the career offender<br />guideline, this change provides that only voluntary manslaughter should be consid-<br />ered. This is also consistent with the fact that involuntary manslaughter generally<br />would not have qualified as a crime of violence under the “residual clause.” See Begay<br />v. United States, 553 U.S. 137 (2008) (limiting crimes covered by the ACCA residual<br />clause to those roughly similar in kind and degree of risk posed as the enumerated<br />offenses, which typically involve “purposeful, violent, and aggressive conduct”).<br />The amendment deletes “burglary of a dwelling” from the list of enumerated offenses.<br />In implementing this change, the Commission considered that (1) burglary offenses<br />rarely result in physical violence, (2) “burglary of a dwelling” is rarely the instant of-<br />fense of conviction or the determinative predicate for purposes of triggering higher<br />penalties under the career offender guideline, and (3) historically, career offenders<br />have rarely been rearrested for a burglary offense after release. The Commission con-<br />sidered several studies and analyses in reaching these conclusions.<br />First, several recent studies demonstrate that most burglaries do not involve physical<br />violence. See Bureau of Justice Statistics, National Crime Victimization Survey, Vic-<br />timization During Household Burglary (Sept. 2010) (finding that a household member<br />experienced some form of violent victimization in 7% of all household burglaries<br />from 2003 to 2007); Richard S. Culp et al., Is Burglary a Crime of Violence?<br />An Analysis of National Data 1998–2007, at 29 (2015), available at<br />https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/grants/248651.pdf (concluding that 7.6% of burgla-<br />ries between 1998 and 2007 resulted in actual violence or threats of violence, while<br />actual physical injury was reported in only 2.7% of all burglaries); see also United<br />States Department of Justice, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Uniform Crime Report,<br />Crime in the United States (2014) (classifying burglary as a “property crime” rather<br />Amendment 798<br />130 ║ Supplement to Appendix C (November 1, 2016)<br />than a “violent crime”). Second, based upon an analysis of offenders sentenced in fiscal<br />year 2014, the Commission estimates that removing “burglary of a dwelling” as an<br />enumerated offense in &#167;4B1.2(a)(2) will reduce the overall proportion of offenders who<br />qualify as a career offender by less than three percentage points. The Commission fur-<br />ther estimates that removing the enumerated offense would result in only about five<br />percent of offenders sentenced under USSG &#167;2K2.1 (Unlawful Receipt, Possession, or<br />Transportation of Firearms or Ammunition; Prohibited Transactions Involving Fire-<br />arms or Ammunition) receiving a lower base offense level than would currently apply.<br />Finally, a Commission analysis of recidivism rates for career offenders released during<br />calendar years 2004 through 2006 indicates that about five percent of such offenders<br />were rearrested for a burglary offense during the eight years after their release.<br />In reaching this conclusion, the Commission also considered that courts have struggled<br />with identifying a uniform contemporary, generic definition of “burglary of dwelling.”<br />In particular, circuits have disagreed regarding whether the requirement in Taylor v.<br />United States, 495 U.S. 575, 598 (1990), that the burglary be of a “building or other<br />structure” applies in addition to the guidelines’ requirement that the burglary be of a<br />“dwelling.” Compare United States v. Henriquez, 757 F.3d 144, 148–49 (4th Cir. 2014);<br />United States v. McFalls, 592 F.3d 707 (6th Cir. 2010); United States v. Wenner,<br />351 F.3d 969 (9th Cir. 2003) with United States v. Ramirez, 708 F.3d 295, 301 (1st Cir.<br />2013); United States v. Murillo-Lopez, 444 F.3d 337, 340 (5th Cir. 2006); United States<br />v. Rivera-Oros, 590 F.3d 1123 (10th Cir. 2009); United States v. McClenton, 53 F.3d<br />584 (3d Cir. 1995); United States v. Graham, 982 F.2d 315 (8th Cir. 1992).<br />Although “burglary of a dwelling” is deleted as an enumerated offense, the amendment<br />adds an upward departure provision to &#167;4B1.2 to address the unusual case in which<br />the instant offense or a prior felony conviction was any burglary offense involving vio-<br />lence that did not otherwise qualify as a “crime of violence.” This departure provision<br />allows courts to consider all burglary offenses, as opposed to just burglaries of a dwell-<br />ing, and reflects the Commission’s determination that courts should consider an up-<br />ward departure where a defendant would have received a higher offense level, higher<br />Criminal History Category, or both (e.g., where the defendant would have been a ca-<br />reer offender) if such burglary had qualified as a “crime of violence.”<br />Finally, the amendment adds offenses that involve the “use or unlawful possession of<br />a firearm described in 26 U.S.C. &#167; 5845(a) or an explosive material as defined in<br />18 U.S.C. &#167; 841(c)” to the enumerated list at &#167;4B1.2(a)(2). This addition is consistent<br />with long-standing commentary in &#167;4B1.2 categorically identifying possession of a fire-<br />arm described in 26 U.S.C. &#167; 5845(a) as a “crime of violence,” and therefore maintains<br />the status quo. The Commission continues to believe that possession of these types of<br />weapons (e.g., a sawed-off shotgun or sawed-off rifle, silencer, bomb, or machine gun)<br />inherently presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another person. Addi-<br />tionally, inclusion as an enumerated offense reflects Congress’s determination that<br />such weapons are inherently dangerous and, when possessed unlawfully, serve only<br />violent purposes. See also USSG App. C, amend. 674 (effective Nov. 1, 2004) (expand-<br />ing the definition of “crime of violence” in Application Note 1 to &#167;4B1.2 to include un-<br />lawful possession of any firearm described in 26 U.S.C. &#167; 5845(a)).<br />Enumerated Offense Definitions<br />The amendment also adds definitions for the enumerated offenses of forcible sex of-<br />fense and extortion. The amended guideline, however, continues to rely on existing<br />case law for purposes of defining the remaining enumerated offenses. The Commission<br />Amendment 798<br />determined that adding several new definitions could result in new litigation, and that<br />it was instead best not to disturb the case law that has developed over the years.<br />As amended, “forcible sex offense” includes offenses with an element that consent to<br />the conduct is not given or is not legally valid, such as where consent to the conduct is<br />involuntary, incompetent, or coerced. Consistent with the definition in &#167;2L1.2 (Unlaw-<br />fully Entering or Remaining in the United States), this addition reflects the Commis-<br />sion’s determination that certain forcible sex offenses which do not expressly include<br />as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the<br />person of another should nevertheless constitute “crimes of violence” under &#167;4B1.2.<br />See also USSG App. C, amend. 722 (effective Nov. 1, 2008) (clarifying the scope of the<br />term “forcible sex offense” as that term is used in the definition of “crime of violence”<br />in &#167;2L1.2, Application Note 1(B)(iii)).<br />The new commentary also provides that the offenses of sexual abuse of a minor and<br />statutory rape are included only if the sexual abuse of a minor or statutory rape was<br />(A) an offense described in 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2241(c), or (B) an offense under state law that<br />would have been an offense under section 2241(c) if the offense had occurred within<br />the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States. This addition<br />makes clear that the term “forcible sex offense” in &#167;4B1.2 includes sexual abuse of a<br />minor and statutory rape where certain specified elements are present.<br />“Extortion” is defined as “obtaining something of value from another by the wrongful<br />use of (i) force, (ii) fear of physical injury, or (iii) threat of physical injury.” Under case<br />law existing at the time of this amendment, courts generally defined extortion as “ob-<br />taining something of value from another with his consent induced by the wrongful use<br />of force, fear, or threats” based on the Supreme Court’s holding in United States v.<br />Nardello, 393 U.S. 286, 290 (1969) (defining “extortion” for purposes of the Hobbs Act).<br />Consistent with the Commission’s goal of focusing the career offender and related en-<br />hancements on the most dangerous offenders, the amendment narrows the generic<br />definition of extortion by limiting the offense to those having an element of force or an<br />element of fear or threats “of physical injury,” as opposed to non-violent threats such<br />as injury to reputation.<br />Departure Provision at &#167;4B1.1<br />Finally, the amendment adds a downward departure provision in &#167;4B1.1 for cases in<br />which one or both of the defendant’s “two prior felony convictions” is based on an of-<br />fense that is classified as a misdemeanor at the time of sentencing for the instant fed-<br />eral offense.<br />An offense (whether a “crime of violence” or a “controlled substance offense”) is deemed<br />to be a “felony” for purposes of the career offender guideline if it is punishable by im-<br />prisonment for a term exceeding one year. This definition captures some state offenses<br />that are punishable by more than a year of imprisonment, but are in fact classified by<br />the state as misdemeanors. Such statutes are found, for example, in Colorado, Iowa,<br />Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, and Vermont.<br />The Commission determined that the application of the career offender guideline<br />where one or both of the defendant’s “two prior felony convictions” is an offense that is<br />classified as a misdemeanor may result in a guideline range that substantially<br />overrepresents the seriousness of the defendant’s criminal history or substantially<br />overstates the seriousness of the instant offense. While recognizing the importance of<br />maintaining a uniform and consistent definition of the term “felony” in the guidelines,<br />Amendment 799<br />132 ║ Supplement to Appendix C (November 1, 2016)<br />the Commission determined that it is also appropriate for a court to consider the seri-<br />ousness of the prior offenses (as reflected in the classification assigned by the convict-<br />ing jurisdiction) in deciding whether the significant increases under the career offender<br />guideline are appropriate. Such consideration is consistent with the structure used by<br />Congress in the context of the Armed Career Criminal Act. See 18 U.S.C. &#167; 921(a)(20)<br />(providing, for purposes of Chapter 44 of Title 18, that “crime punishable by imprison-<br />ment for a term exceeding one year” does not include a State offense classified as a<br />misdemeanor and punishable by two years or less). It is also consistent with the court’s<br />obligation to account for the “nature and circumstances of the offense and the history<br />and characteristics of the defendant.” See 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(a)(1).</td><td>Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is August 1, 2016.</td></tr><tr><td class="n">798</td><td>Amendment 798</td><td>Section 1B1.13 is amended in the heading by striking “as a Result of<br />Motion by Director of Bureau of Prisons” and inserting “Under 18 U.S.C.<br />&#167; 3582(c)(1)(A)”.<br />The Commentary to &#167;1B1.13 captioned “Application Notes” is amended in Note 1 by<br />striking the heading as follows: “Application of Subdivision (1)(A).—”; by striking<br />Note 1(A) as follows:<br />“(A) Extraordinary and Compelling Reasons.—Provided the defendant meets the<br />requirements of subdivision (2), extraordinary and compelling reasons exist<br />under any of the following circumstances:<br />(i) The defendant is suffering from a terminal illness.<br />(ii) The defendant is suffering from a permanent physical or medical con-<br />dition, or is experiencing deteriorating physical or mental health be-<br />cause of the aging process, that substantially diminishes the ability of<br />the defendant to provide self-care within the environment of a correc-<br />tional facility and for which conventional treatment promises no sub-<br />stantial improvement.<br />(iii) The death or incapacitation of the defendant’s only family member ca-<br />pable of caring for the defendant’s minor child or minor children.<br />(iv) As determined by the Director of the Bureau of Prisons, there exists in<br />the defendant’s case an extraordinary and compelling reason other<br />than, or in combination with, the reasons described in subdivisions (i),<br />(ii), and (iii).”;<br />by redesignating Notes 1(B) and 2 as Notes 3 and 5, respectively, and inserting before<br />Note 3 (as so redesignated) the following new Notes 1 and 2:<br />“1.

The Commission encourages the<br />Director of the Bureau of Prisons to file such a motion if the defendant meets<br />any of the circumstances set forth in Application Note 1. The court is in a<br />unique position to determine whether the circumstances warrant a reduction<br />(and, if so, the amount of reduction), after considering the factors set forth<br />18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(a) and the criteria set forth in this policy statement, such as<br />the defendant’s medical condition, the defendant’s family circumstances, and<br />whether the defendant is a danger to the safety of any other person or to the<br />community.<br />This policy statement shall not be construed to confer upon the defendant any<br />right not otherwise recognized in law.”.<br />The Commentary to &#167;1B1.13 captioned “Background” is amended by striking “This<br />policy statement implements 28 U.S.C. &#167; 994(t).” and inserting the following:<br />“The Commission is required by 28 U.S.C. &#167; 994(a)(2) to develop general policy state-<br />ments regarding application of the guidelines or other aspects of sentencing that in the<br />view of the Commission would further the purposes of sentencing (18 U.S.C.<br />&#167; 3553(a)(2)), including, among other things, the appropriate use of the sentence mod-<br />ification provisions set forth in 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3582(c). In doing so, the Commission is<br />authorized by 28 U.S.C. &#167; 994(t) to ‘describe what should be considered extraordinary<br />and compelling reasons for sentence reduction, including the criteria to be applied and<br />a list of specific examples.’ This policy statement implements 28 U.S.C. &#167; 994(a)(2)<br />and (t).”.</td><td>REASON FOR AMENDMENT: This amendment is a result of the Commission’s review of<br />the policy statement pertaining to “compassionate release” at &#167;1B1.13 (Reduction in<br />Term of Imprisonment as a Result of Motion by Director of Bureau of Prisons). The<br />amendment broadens certain eligibility criteria and encourages the Director of the Bu-<br />reau of Prisons to file a motion for compassionate release when “extraordinary and<br />compelling reasons” exist.<br />Section 3582(c)(1)(A) of title 18, United States Code, authorizes a federal court, upon<br />motion of the Director of the Bureau of Prisons, to reduce the term of imprisonment of<br />a defendant if “extraordinary and compelling reasons” warrant such a reduction or the<br />defendant is at least 70 years of age and meets certain other criteria. Such a reduction<br />must be consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Com-<br />mission. See 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3582(c)(1)(A); see also 28 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 992(a)(2) (stating that the<br />Commission shall promulgate general policy statements regarding “the sentence mod-<br />ification provisions set forth in section[] . . . 3582(c) of title 18”); and 994(t) (stating<br />that the Commission, in promulgating any such policy statements, “shall describe<br />what should be considered extraordinary and compelling reasons for sentence reduc-<br />tion, including the criteria to be applied and a list of specific examples”). In turn, the<br />Commission promulgated the policy statement at &#167;1B1.13, which defines “extraordi-<br />nary and compelling reasons” for compassionate release.<br />The Bureau of Prisons has developed its own criteria for the implementation of sec-<br />tion 3582(c)(1)(A). See U.S. Department of Justice, Federal Bureau of Prisons, Com-<br />passionate Release/Reduction in Sentence: Procedures for Implementation of 18 U.S.C.<br />&#167;&#167; 3582(c)(1)(A) and 4205(g) (Program Statement 5050.49, CN-1). Under its program<br />Amendment 799<br />statement, a sentence reduction may be based on the defendant’s medical circum-<br />stances (e.g., a terminal or debilitating medical condition; see 5050.49(3)(a)–(b)) or on<br />certain non-medical circumstances (e.g., an elderly defendant, the death or incapacita-<br />tion of the family member caregiver of an inmate’s minor child, or the incapacitation<br />of the defendant’s spouse or registered partner when the inmate would be the only<br />available caregiver; see 5050.49(4),(5),(6)).<br />The Commission has conducted an in-depth review of this topic, including considera-<br />tion of Bureau of Prisons data documenting lengthy review of compassionate release<br />applications and low approval rates, as well as two reports issued by the Department<br />of Justice Office of the Inspector General that are critical of the Bureau of Prisons’<br />implementation of its compassionate release program. See U.S. Department of Justice,<br />Office of the Inspector General, The Federal Bureau of Prisons’ Compassionate Release<br />Program, I-2013-006 (April 2013); U.S. Department of Justice, Office of the Inspector<br />General, The Impact of the Aging Inmate Population on the Federal Bureau of Prisons,<br />E-15-05 (May 2015). In February 2016, the Commission held a public hearing on com-<br />passionate release and received testimony from witnesses and experts about the need<br />to broaden the criteria for eligibility, to add guidance to the medical criteria, and to<br />remove other administrative hurdles that limit the availability of compassionate re-<br />lease for otherwise eligible defendants.<br />The amendment revises &#167;1B1.13 in several ways. First, the amendment broadens the<br />Commission’s guidance on what should be considered “extraordinary and compelling<br />reasons” for compassionate release. It provides four categories of criteria: “Medical<br />Condition of the Defendant,” “Age of the Defendant,” “Family Circumstances,” and<br />“Other Reasons.”<br />The “Medical Condition of the Defendant” category has two prongs: one for defendants<br />with terminal illness, and one that applies to defendants with a debilitating condition.<br />For the first subcategory, the amendment clarifies that terminal illness means “a se-<br />rious and advanced illness with an end of life trajectory,” and it explicitly states that<br />a “specific prognosis of life expectancy (i.e. a probability of death within a specific time<br />period) is not required.” These changes respond to testimony and public comment on<br />the challenges associated with diagnosing terminal illness. In particular, while an end-<br />of-life trajectory may be determined by medical professionals with some certainty, it is<br />extremely difficult to determine death within a specific time period. For that reason,<br />the Commission concluded that requiring a specified prognosis (such as the 18-month<br />prognosis in the Bureau of Prisons’ program statement) is unnecessarily restrictive<br />both in terms of the administrative review and the scope of eligibility for compassion-<br />ate release applications. For added clarity, the amendment also provides a non-exhaus-<br />tive list of illnesses that may qualify as a terminal illness.<br />For the non-terminal medical category, the amendment provides three broad criteria<br />to include defendants who are (i) suffering from a serious condition, (ii) suffering from<br />a serious functional or cognitive impairment, or (iii) experiencing deteriorating health<br />because of the aging process, for whom the medical condition substantially diminishes<br />the defendant’s ability to provide self-care within a correctional facility and from which<br />he or she is not expected to recover. The primary change to this category is the addition<br />of prong (II) regarding a serious functional or cognitive impairment. This additional<br />prong is intended to include a wide variety of permanent, serious impairments and<br />disabilities, whether functional or cognitive, that make life in prison overly difficult for<br />certain inmates.<br />Amendment 799<br />136 ║ Supplement to Appendix C (November 1, 2016)<br />The amendment also adds an age-based category (“Age of the Defendant”) for eligibility<br />in &#167;1B1.13. This new category would apply if the defendant (i) is at least 65 years old,<br />(ii) is experiencing a serious deterioration in health because of the aging process, and<br />(iii) has served at least 10 years or 75 percent of his or her term of imprisonment<br />(whichever is less). The age-based category resembles criteria in the Bureau of Prisons’<br />program statement, but adds a limitation that the defendant must be experiencing<br />seriously deteriorating health because of the aging process. The amendment also clar-<br />ifies that the time-served aspect should be applied with regard to “whichever is less,”<br />an important distinction from the Bureau of Prisons’ criteria, which has limited appli-<br />cation to only those elderly offenders serving significant terms of imprisonment. The<br />Commission determined that 65 years should be the age for eligibility under the age-<br />based category after considering the Commission’s recidivism research, which finds<br />that inmates aged 65 years and older exhibit a very low rate of recidivism (13.3%) as<br />compared to other age groups. The Commission expects that the broadening of the<br />medical conditions categories, cited above, will lead to increased eligibility for inmates<br />who suffer from certain conditions or impairments, and who experience a diminished<br />ability to provide self-care in prison, regardless of their age.<br />The amendment also includes a “Family Circumstances” category for eligibility that<br />applies to (i) the death or incapacitation of the caregiver of the defendant’s minor child,<br />or (ii) the incapacitation of the defendant’s spouse or registered partner when the de-<br />fendant would be the only available caregiver. The amendment deletes the require-<br />ment under prong (i) regarding the death or incapacitation of the “defendant’s only<br />family member” caregiver, given the possibility that the existing caregiver may not be<br />of family relation. The Commission also added prong (ii), which makes this category of<br />criteria consistent with similar considerations in the Bureau of Prisons’ program state-<br />ment.<br />Second, the amendment updates the Commentary in &#167;1B1.13 to provide that an ex-<br />traordinary and compelling reason need not have been unforeseen at the time of sen-<br />tencing in order to warrant a reduction. The Commission heard from stakeholders and<br />medical experts that the corresponding limitation in the Bureau of Prisons’ program<br />statement ignores the often precipitous decline in health or circumstances that can<br />occur after imprisonment. The Commission determined that potential foreseeability at<br />the time of sentencing should not automatically preclude the defendant’s eligibility for<br />early release under &#167;1B1.13.<br />Finally, the amendment adds a new application note that encourages the Director of<br />the Bureau of Prisons to file a motion under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3582(c)(1)(A) if the defendant<br />meets any of the circumstances listed as “extraordinary and compelling reasons” in<br />&#167;1B1.13. The Commission heard testimony and received public comment concerning<br />the inefficiencies that exist within the Bureau of Prisons’ administrative review of com-<br />passionate release applications, which can delay or deny release, even in cases where<br />the applicant appears to meet the criteria for eligibility. While only the Director of the<br />Bureau of Prisons has the statutory authority to file a motion for compassionate re-<br />lease, the Commission finds that “the court is in a unique position to assess whether<br />the circumstances exist, and whether a reduction is warranted (and, if so, the amount<br />of reduction), including the factors set forth 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(a) and the criteria set<br />forth in this policy statement, such as the defendant’s medical condition, the defend-<br />ant’s family circumstances, and whether the defendant is a danger to the safety of any<br />other person or to the community.” The Commission’s policy statement is not legally<br />binding on the Bureau of Prisons and does not confer any rights on the defendant, but<br />the new commentary is intended to encourage the Director of the Bureau of Prisons to<br />Amendment 800<br />exercise his or her authority to file a motion under section 3582(c)(1)(A) when the cri-<br />teria in this policy statement are met.<br />The amendment also adds to the Background that the Commission’s general policy-<br />making authority at 28 U.S.C. &#167; 994(a)(2) serves as an additional basis for this and<br />other guidance set forth in &#167;1B1.13, and the amendment changes the title of the policy<br />statement. These changes are clerical.</td><td>Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2016.</td></tr><tr><td class="n">799</td><td>Amendment 799</td><td>Section 2E3.1 is amended in subsection (a) by striking subsection (a)(2)<br />as follows:<br />“(2) 10, if the offense involved an animal fighting venture; or”;<br />by redesignating subsections (a)(1) and (a)(3) as subsections (a)(2) and (a)(4), respec-<br />tively; in subsection (a)(2) (as so redesignated) by striking “operation; or” and inserting<br />“operation;”; by inserting before subsection (a)(2) (as so redesignated) the following<br />new subsection (a)(1):<br />“(1) 16, if the offense involved an animal fighting venture, except as provided in<br />subdivision (3) below;”;<br />and by inserting before subsection (a)(4) (as so redesignated) the following new subsec-<br />tion (a)(3):<br />“(3) 10, if the defendant was convicted under 7 U.S.C. &#167; 2156(a)(2)(B); or”.<br />The Commentary to &#167;2E3.1 captioned “Statutory Provisions” is amended by inserting<br />after “7 U.S.C. &#167; 2156” the following: “(felony provisions only)”.<br />The Commentary to &#167;2E3.1 captioned “Application Notes” is amended in Note 1 by<br />striking “: ‘Animal” and inserting “, ‘animal”;<br />and in Note 2 by striking “If the offense involved extraordinary cruelty to an animal<br />that resulted in, for example, maiming or death to an animal, an upward departure<br />may be warranted.”, and inserting the following:<br />“The base offense levels provided for animal fighting ventures in subsection (a)(1)<br />and (a)(3) reflect that an animal fighting venture involves one or more violent fights<br />between animals and that a defeated animal often is severely injured in the fight, dies<br />as a result of the fight, or is killed afterward. Nonetheless, there may be cases in which<br />the offense level determined under this guideline substantially understates the seri-<br />ousness of the offense. In such a case, an upward departure may be warranted. For<br />example, an upward departure may be warranted if (A) the offense involved extraor-<br />dinary cruelty to an animal beyond the violence inherent in such a venture (such as by<br />killing an animal in a way that prolongs the suffering of the animal); or (B) the offense<br />involved animal fighting on an exceptional scale (such as an offense involving an unu-<br />sually large number of animals).”.<br />Amendment 800<br />138 ║ Supplement to Appendix C (November 1, 2016)<br />Appendix A (Statutory Index) is amended in the line referenced to 7 U.S.C. &#167; 2156 by<br />inserting after “&#167; 2156” the following: “(felony provisions only)”.</td><td>REASON FOR AMENDMENT: This amendment responds to two legislative changes to the<br />Animal Welfare Act (the “Act”) (codified at 7 U.S.C. &#167; 2156) made by Congress in 2008<br />and 2014. First, in 2008, Congress amended the Act to increase the maximum term of<br />imprisonment for offenses involving an animal fighting venture from three years to<br />five years. See Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008, Pub. L. No. 110–234,<br />&#167; 14207(b), 122 Stat. 1461, 1462 (May 22, 2008). Second, in 2014, Congress again<br />amended the Act to create two new offenses – the offense of attending an animal fight<br />and the offense of causing an individual under the age of 16 to attend an animal fight,<br />with respective statutory maximum terms of imprisonment of one and three years.<br />See Agricultural Act of 2014, Pub. L. 113–79, &#167; 12308, 128 Stat. 990, 990 (Feb. 7, 2014).<br />The amendment makes several changes to &#167;2E3.1 (Gambling Offenses, Animal<br />Fighting Offenses) to account for these legislative actions. The amendment is informed<br />by extensive public comment, recent case law, and analysis of Commission data re-<br />garding the current penalties for animal fighting offenses.<br />Higher Penalties for Animal Fighting Venture Offenses<br />First, the amendment increases the base offense level for offenses involving an animal<br />fighting venture from 10 to 16. This change reflects the increase in the statutory max-<br />imum penalty from three to five years for offenses prohibited under 7 U.S.C.<br />&#167; 2156(a)–(e). See 18 U.S.C. &#167; 49 (containing the criminal penalties for violations of<br />section 2156). The Commission also determined that the increased base offense level<br />better accounts for the cruelty and violence that is characteristic of these crimes, as<br />reflected in the extensive public comment and testimony noting that a defeated animal<br />is often severely injured or killed during or after a fight and that the animals used in<br />these crimes are commonly exposed to inhumane living conditions or other forms of<br />neglect.<br />In making this change, the Commission was also informed by data evidencing a high<br />percentage of above range sentences in these cases. During fiscal years 2011 through<br />2014, almost one-third (31.0%) of the seventy-four offenders who received the base of-<br />fense level of 10 under &#167;2E3.1 received an above range sentence, compared to a na-<br />tional above range rate of 2.0 percent for all offenders. For those animal fighting of-<br />fenders sentenced above the range, the average extent of the upward departure was<br />more than twice the length of imprisonment at the high end of the guideline range,<br />resulting in an average sentence of 18 months (and a median sentence of 16 months).<br />Comparably, the amended base offense level will result in a guideline range of 12 to<br />18 months for the typical animal fighting venture offender who is in Criminal History<br />Category I and receives a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility under<br />&#167;3E1.1 (Acceptance of Responsibility). Additionally, for offenders in the higher crimi-<br />nal history categories, the guideline range at base offense level 16 allows for applicable<br />Chapter Three increases while remaining within the statutory maximum.<br />New Offenses Relating to Attending an Animal Fighting Venture<br />The amendment also establishes a base offense level of 10 in &#167;2E3.1 if the defendant<br />was convicted under section 2156(a)(2)(B) for causing an individual under 16 to attend<br />an animal fighting venture. The Commission believes this level of punishment best<br />reflects Congress’s intent in creating this new crime. A base offense level of 10 for this<br />new offense will result in a guideline range (before acceptance of responsibility) of 6 to<br />Amendment 801<br />12 months of imprisonment for offenders in Criminal History Category I, while allow-<br />ing for a guideline range approaching the three-year statutory maximum for offenders<br />in higher criminal history categories. The Commission also noted that assigning a base<br />offense level of 10 is consistent with the policy decision made by the Commission when<br />it assigned a base offense level of 10 to an animal fighting crime in 2008, which, at that<br />time, also had a three-year statutory maximum penalty. See USSG App. C, amend. 721<br />(effective November 1, 2008).<br />Lastly, the amendment establishes a base offense level of 6 for the new class A misde-<br />meanor of attending an animal fighting venture prohibited by section 2156(a)(2)(A) by<br />including only the felony provisions of 7 U.S.C. &#167;2156 in the Appendix A reference to<br />&#167;2E3.1. Consistent with other Class A misdemeanor offenses, this base offense level is<br />established through application of &#167;2X5.2 (Class A Misdemeanors (Not Covered by An-<br />other Specific Offense Guideline)).<br />Departure Provision<br />The amendment also revises and expands the existing upward departure language in<br />two ways.<br />First, the amendment clarifies the circumstances in which an upward departure for<br />exceptional cruelty may be warranted. As reflected in the revised departure provision,<br />the base offense levels provided for animal fighting ventures in subsections (a)(1)<br />and (a)(3) reflect the fact that an animal fighting venture involves one or more violent<br />fights between animals and that a defeated animal often is severely injured in the<br />fight, dies as a result of the fight, or is killed afterward. The Commission heard testi-<br />mony that in a typical dog fight, dogs puncture and tear at each other, until one animal<br />is too injured to continue, and during a cock fight, roosters strike each other with their<br />beaks and with sharp blades that have been strapped to their legs, suffering punctured<br />lungs, broken bones, and pierced eyes. Nonetheless, as informed by public comment<br />and testimony, the Commission’s study indicates that some animal fighting offenses<br />involve extraordinary cruelty to an animal beyond that which is common to such<br />crimes, such as killing an animal in a way that prolongs the suffering of the animal.<br />The Commission determined that such extraordinary cruelty may fall outside the<br />heartland of conduct encompassed by the base offense level for animal fighting ven-<br />tures and, therefore, that an upward departure may be warranted in those cases.<br />Similarly, the amendment expands the existing departure provision to include offenses<br />involving animal fighting on an exceptional scale (such as offenses involving an unu-<br />sually large number of animals) as another example of conduct that may warrant an<br />upward departure. As with the example of extraordinary cruelty, the Commission de-<br />termined that the base offense level under the revised guideline may understate the<br />seriousness of the offense in those cases.</td><td>Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2016.</td></tr><tr><td class="n">800</td><td>Amendment 800</td><td>Section 2G2.1 is amended in subsection (b)(3) by striking “If the offense<br />involved distribution” and inserting “If the defendant knowingly engaged in distribu-<br />tion”;<br />Amendment 801<br />140 ║ Supplement to Appendix C (November 1, 2016)<br />and in subsection (b)(4) by inserting “(A)” before “sadistic or masochistic”, and by in-<br />serting after “violence” the following: “; or (B) an infant or toddler”.<br />The Commentary to &#167;2G2.1 captioned “Statutory Provisions” is amended by inserting<br />at the end the following: “For additional statutory provision(s), see Appendix A (Stat-<br />utory Index).”.<br />The Commentary to &#167;2G2.1 captioned “Application Notes” is amended by redesignat-<br />ing Notes 3, 4, 5, and 6 as Notes 5, 6, 7, and 8, respectively, and by inserting after<br />Note 2 the following new Notes 3 and 4:<br />“3.

One issue generally arises under<br />both the child pornography production guideline and the child pornography distribu-<br />tion guideline when the offense involves victims who are unusually young and vulner-<br />able. The other two issues frequently arise when the offense involves a peer-to-peer<br />file-sharing program or network. These issues were noted by the Commission in<br />its 2012 report to Congress on child pornography offenses. See United States Sentenc-<br />ing Commission, “Report to the Congress: Federal Child Pornography Offenses,”<br />at 33–35 (2012).<br />Offenses Involving Infants and Toddlers<br />First, the amendment addresses differences among the circuits when cases involve in-<br />fant and toddler victims. The production guideline at &#167;2G2.1 (Sexually Exploiting a<br />Minor by Production of Sexually Explicit Visual or Printed Material; Custodian Per-<br />mitting Minor to Engage in Sexually Explicit Conduct; Advertisement for Minors to<br />Engage in Production) provides a 4-level enhancement if the offense involved a minor<br />who had not attained the age of 12 years and a 2-level enhancement if the minor had<br />not attained the age of 16 years. See &#167;2G2.1(b)(1)(A)–(B). The non-production guideline<br />at &#167;2G2.2 (Trafficking in Material Involving the Sexual Exploitation of a Minor; Re-<br />ceiving, Transporting, Shipping, Soliciting, or Advertising Material Involving the Sex-<br />ual Exploitation of a Minor; Possessing Material Involving the Sexual Exploitation of<br />a minor with Intent to Traffic; Possessing Material Involving the Sexual Exploitation<br />of a Minor) provides a 2-level enhancement if the material involved a prepubescent<br />minor or a minor who had not attained the age of 12 years. See &#167;2G2.2(b)(2).<br />A circuit conflict has arisen as to whether a defendant who receives an age enhance-<br />ment under &#167;&#167;2G2.1 and 2G2.2 may also receive a vulnerable victim adjustment at<br />&#167;3A1.1 (Hate Crime Motivation or Vulnerable Victim) when the victim is extremely<br />young and vulnerable, such as an infant or toddler. Section 3A1.1(b)(1) provides for a<br />2-level increase if the defendant knew or should have known that a victim was a “vul-<br />nerable victim,” which is defined in the accompanying commentary as a victim “who is<br />unusually vulnerable due to age, physical or mental condition, or who is otherwise<br />particularly susceptible to the criminal conduct.” See &#167;3A1.1, comment. (n.2). The com-<br />mentary also provides that the vulnerable victim adjustment does not apply if the fac-<br />tor that makes the victim a “vulnerable victim,” such as age, is incorporated in the<br />offense guidelines, “unless the victim was unusually vulnerable for reasons unrelated<br />to age.” Id.<br />The Fifth and Ninth Circuits have held that it is permissible to apply both enhance-<br />ments in cases involving infant or toddler victims because their level of vulnerability<br />is not fully incorporated in the offense guidelines. See United States v. Jenkins,<br />712 F.3d 209, 214 (5th Cir. 2013); United States v. Wright, 373 F.3d 935, 943 (9th Cir.<br />2004). These circuits have reasoned that although the victim’s small physical size and<br />extreme vulnerability tend to correlate with age, such characteristics are not the same<br />Amendment 801<br />as compared to most children under 12 years. Jenkins, 712 F.3d at 214; Wright,<br />373 F.3d at 942–43. The Fourth Circuit, by contrast, has held that the age enhance-<br />ment and vulnerable victim adjustment may not be simultaneously applied because<br />the child pornography guidelines fully address age-related factors. See United States<br />v. Dowell, 771 F.3d 162, 175 (4th Cir. 2014). The Fourth Circuit reasoned that cognitive<br />development or psychological susceptibility necessarily is related to age. Id.<br />The amendment resolves the circuit conflict by explicitly accounting for infant and tod-<br />dler victims in the child pornography guidelines. Specifically, the amendment revises<br />&#167;&#167;2G2.1 and 2G2.2 by adding a new basis for application of the “sadistic or masochistic”<br />enhancement when the offense involves infants or toddlers. The amendment amends<br />&#167;2G2.1(b)(4) to provide for a 4-level increase “if the offense involved material that por-<br />trays (A) sadistic or masochistic conduct or other depictions of violence; or (B) an infant<br />or toddler,” and amends &#167;2G2.2(b)(4) to provide a 4-level increase “if the offense in-<br />volved material that portrays (A) sadistic or masochistic conduct or other depictions of<br />violence; or (B) sexual abuse or exploitation of an infant or toddler.” The accompanying<br />application note to each guideline provides that if subsection (b)(4)(B) applies, do not<br />apply the vulnerable victim adjustment in Chapter Three.<br />The amendment reflects the Commission’s view, based on testimony and public com-<br />ment, that child pornography offenses involving infants and toddlers warrant an en-<br />hancement. Because application of the vulnerable victim adjustment necessarily relies<br />on a fact-specific inquiry, the Commission determined that expanding the “sadistic or<br />masochistic” enhancement (&#167;&#167;2G2.1(b)(4) and 2G2.2(b)(4)) to include infant and tod-<br />dler victims would promote more consistent application of the child pornography guide-<br />lines and reduce unwarranted sentencing disparities. In making its determination, the<br />Commission was informed by case law indicating that most circuits have found depic-<br />tions of the sexual abuse or exploitation of infants or toddlers involving penetration or<br />pain portray sadistic conduct. See, e.g., United States v. Hoey, 508 F.3d 687, 691<br />(1st Cir. 2007) (“We agree with the many circuits which have found that images de-<br />picting the sexual penetration of young and prepubescent children by adult males rep-<br />resent conduct sufficiently likely to involve pain such as to support a finding that it is<br />inherently ‘sadistic’ or similarly ‘violent’ . . . .”); United States v. Delmarle, 99 F.3d 80,<br />83 (2d Cir. 1996) (“[S]ubjection of a young child to a sexual act that would have to be<br />painful is excessively cruel and hence is sadistic . . . .”); United States v. Maurer,<br />639 F.3d 72, 79 (3d Cir. 2011) (“[W]e join other circuits in holding that the application<br />of &#167;2G2.2(b)(4) is appropriate where an image depicts sexual activity involving a pre-<br />pubescent minor that would have caused pain to the minor.”); United States v. Bur-<br />gess, 684 F.3d 445, 454 (4th Cir. 2012) (image depicting vaginal penetration of five-<br />year-old girl by adult male, which would “necessarily cause physical pain to the vic-<br />tim,” qualified for sentencing enhancement under &#167;2G2.2(b)); United States v. Lyck-<br />man, 235 F.3d 234, 238–39 (5th Cir. 2000) (agreeing with the Second, Seventh, and<br />Eleventh Circuits that application of subsection (b)(4) is warranted when the image<br />depicts “the physical penetration of a young child by an adult male.”); United States v.<br />Groenendal, 557 F.3d 419, 424–26 (6th Cir. 2009) (penetration of a prepubescent child<br />by an adult male constitutes inherently sadistic conduct that justifies application of<br />&#167;2G2.2(b)(4)); United States v. Meyers, 355 F.3d 1040, 1043 (7th Cir. 2004) (finding<br />vaginal intercourse between a prepubescent girl and an adult male sadistic); United<br />States v. Belflower, 390 F.3d 560, 562 (8th Cir. 2004) (images involving the anal pen-<br />etration of minor boy or girl adult male are per se sadistic or violent within the mean-<br />ing of subsection (b)(4)); United States v. Henderson, 649 F.3d 995 (9th Cir. 2010) (vag-<br />inal penetration of prepubescent minor qualifies for (b)(4) enhancement); United<br />States v. Kimler, 335 F.3d 1132, 1143 (10th Cir. 2003) (finding no expert testimony<br />necessary for a sentence enhancement [(b)(4)] when the images depicted penetration<br />Amendment 801<br />144 ║ Supplement to Appendix C (November 1, 2016)<br />of prepubescent children by adults); United States v. Bender, 290 F.3d 1279, 1286<br />(11th Cir. 2002) (photograph was sadistic within the meaning of subsection (b)(4) when<br />it depicts the “subjugation of a young child to a sexual act that would have to be pain-<br />ful”). The Commission intends the new enhancement to apply to any sexual images of<br />an infant or toddler.<br />The Two and Five Level Distribution Enhancements<br />Next, the amendment addresses differences among the circuits involving application<br />of the tiered distribution enhancements in &#167;2G2.2. Section 2G2.2(b)(3) provides for an<br />increase for distribution of child pornographic material ranging from 2 to 7 levels de-<br />pending on certain factors. See &#167;2G2.2(b)(3)(A)–(F). The circuits have reached different<br />conclusions regarding the mental state required for application of the 2-level enhance-<br />ment for “generic” distribution as compared to the 5-level enhancement for distribution<br />not for pecuniary gain. The circuit conflicts involving these two enhancements have<br />arisen frequently, although not exclusively, in cases involving the use of peer-to-peer<br />file-sharing programs or networks.<br />Peer-to-Peer File-Sharing Programs<br />The Commission’s 2012 report to Congress discussed the use of file-sharing programs,<br />such as Peer-to-Peer (“P2P”), in the context of cases involving distribution of child por-<br />nography. See 2012 Report at 33–35, 48–62. Specifically, P2P is a software application<br />that enables computer users to share files easily over the Internet. These applications<br />do not require a central server or use of email. Rather, the file-sharing application<br />allows two or more users to essentially have access each other’s computers and to di-<br />rectly swap files from their computers. Some file-sharing programs require a user to<br />designate files to be shared during the installation process, meaning that at the time<br />of installation the user can “opt in” to share files, and the software will automatically<br />scan the user’s computer and then compile a list of files to share. Other programs em-<br />ploy a default file-sharing setting, meaning the user can “opt out” of automatically<br />sharing files by changing the default setting to limit which, if any, files are available<br />for sharing. Once the user has downloaded and set up the file-sharing software, the<br />user can begin searching for files shared on the connected network using search key-<br />words in the same way one regularly uses a search engine such as Google. Users may<br />choose to “opt in” for a variety of reasons, including, for example, to obtain faster down-<br />load speeds, to have access to a greater range of material, or because the particular<br />site mandates sharing.<br />The 2-Level Distribution Enhancement<br />The circuits have reached different conclusions regarding whether application of the<br />2-level distribution enhancement at &#167;2G2.2(b)(3)(F) requires a mental state (mens<br />rea), particularly in cases involving use of a file-sharing program or network. The Fifth,<br />Tenth, and Eleventh Circuits have held that the 2-level distribution enhancement ap-<br />plies if the defendant used a file-sharing program, regardless of whether the defendant<br />did so purposefully, knowingly, or negligently. See, e.g., United States v. Baker,<br />742 F.3d 618, 621 (5th Cir. 2014); United States v. Ray, 704 F.3d 1307, 1312 (10th Cir.<br />2013); United States v. Creel, 783 F.3d 1357, 1360 (11th Cir. 2015). The Second,<br />Fourth, and Seventh Circuits have held that the 2-level distribution enhancement re-<br />quires a showing that the defendant knew of the file-sharing properties of the program.<br />See, e.g., United States v. Baldwin, 743 F.3d 357, 361 (2d Cir. 2015) (requiring<br />knowledge); United States v. Robinson, 714 F.3d 466, 468 (7th Cir. 2013) (knowledge);<br />Amendment 801<br />United States v. Layton, 564 F.3d 330, 335 (4th Cir. 2009) (knowledge or reckless dis-<br />regard). The Eighth Circuit has held that knowledge is required, but knowledge may<br />be inferred from the fact that a file-sharing program was used, absent “concrete evi-<br />dence” of ignorance. See United States v. Dodd, 598 F.3d 449, 452 (8th Cir. 2010). The<br />Sixth Circuit has held that there is a “presumption” that “users of file-sharing software<br />understand others can access their files.” United States v. Conner, 521 Fed. App’x 493,<br />499 (6th Cir. 2013); see also United States v. Abbring, 788 F.3d 565, 567 (6th Cir. 2015)<br />(“the whole point of a file-sharing program is to share, sharing creates a transfer, and<br />transferring equals distribution”).<br />The amendment generally adopts the approach of the Second, Fourth, and Seventh<br />Circuits. It amends &#167;2G2.2(b)(3)(F) to provide that the 2-level distribution enhance-<br />ment applies if “the defendant knowingly engaged in distribution.” Based on testi-<br />mony, public comment, and data analysis, the Commission determined that the 2-level<br />distribution enhancement is appropriate only in cases in which the defendant know-<br />ingly engaged in distribution. An accompanying application note clarifies that: “For<br />purposes of subsection (b)(3)(F), the defendant ‘knowingly engaged in distribution’ if<br />the defendant (A) knowingly committed the distribution, (B) aided, abetted, counseled,<br />commanded, induced, procured, or willfully caused the distribution, or (C) conspired to<br />distribute.” Similar changes are made to the 2-level distribution enhancement at<br />&#167;2G2.1(b)(3) and the obscenity guideline, &#167;2G3.1 (Importing, Mailing, or Transporting<br />Obscene Matter; Transferring Obscene Matter to a Minor; Misleading Domain Names),<br />which contains a similarly tiered distribution enhancement.<br />The 5-Level Distribution Enhancement<br />Finally, the amendment responds to differences among the circuits in applying the 5-<br />level enhancement for distribution not for pecuniary gain at &#167;2G2.2(b)(3)(B). While<br />courts generally agree that mere use of a file-sharing program or network, without<br />more, is insufficient for application of the 5-level distribution enhancement, the cir-<br />cuits have taken distinct approaches with respect to the circumstances under which<br />the 5-level rather than the 2-level enhancement is appropriate in such circumstances.<br />The Fourth Circuit has held that the 5-level distribution enhancement applies when<br />the defendant (1) “knowingly made child pornography in his possession available to<br />others by some means”; and (2) did so “for the specific purpose of obtaining something<br />of valuable consideration, such as more pornography.” United States v. McManus,<br />734 F.3d 315, 319 (4th Cir. 2013). In contrast, while holding that the 5-level enhance-<br />ment applies when the defendant knew he was distributing child pornographic mate-<br />rial in exchange for a thing of value, the Fifth Circuit has indicated that when the<br />defendant knowingly uses file-sharing software, the requirements for the 5-level en-<br />hancement are generally satisfied. See United States v. Groce, 784 F.3d 291, 294<br />(5th Cir. 2015).<br />The amendment revises &#167;2G2.2(b)(3)(B) and commentary to clarify that the 5-level en-<br />hancement applies “if the defendant distributed in exchange for any valuable consid-<br />eration.” The amendment further explains in the accompanying application note that<br />this means “the defendant agreed to an exchange with another person under which the<br />defendant knowingly distributed to that other person for the specific purpose of obtain-<br />ing something of valuable consideration from that other person, such as other child<br />pornographic material, preferential access to child pornographic material, or access to<br />a child.” The amendment makes parallel changes to the obscenity guideline at &#167;2G3.1,<br />which has a similar tiered distribution enhancement.<br />Amendment 802<br />146 ║ Supplement to Appendix C (November 1, 2016)<br />As with the 2-level distribution enhancement, the amendment resolves differences<br />among the circuits in applying the 5-level distribution enhancement by clarifying the<br />mental state required for distribution of child pornographic material for non-pecuniary<br />gain, particularly when the case involves a file-sharing program or network. The Com-<br />mission determined that the amendment is an appropriate way to account for the<br />higher level of culpability when the defendant had the specific purpose of distributing<br />child pornographic material to another person in exchange for valuable consideration.</td><td>Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2016.</td></tr><tr><td class="n">801</td><td>Amendment 801</td><td>Section 5B1.3 is amended in the heading by striking “Conditions—” and<br />inserting “Conditions”;<br />in subsections (a)(1) through (a)(8) by striking the initial letter of the first word in each<br />subsection and inserting the appropriate capital letter for the word, and by striking<br />the semicolon at the end of each subsection and inserting a period;<br />in subsection (a)(6), as so amended, by inserting before the period at the end the fol-<br />lowing: “.

In a jurisdiction that has implemented the require-<br />ments of the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act, subsec-<br />tion (a)(7)(B) will apply. (See 42 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 16911 and 16913.)”,<br />and inserting the following:<br />“1. Application of Subsection (c)(4).—Although the condition in subsection (c)(4)<br />requires the defendant to ‘answer truthfully’ the questions asked by the pro-<br />bation officer, a defendant’s legitimate invocation of the Fifth Amendment<br />privilege against self-incrimination in response to a probation officer’s question<br />shall not be considered a violation of this condition.”.</td><td>REASON FOR AMENDMENT: This amendment is a result of the Commission’s multi-year<br />review of sentencing practices relating to federal probation and supervised release.<br />Amendment 803<br />The amendment makes several changes to the guidelines and policy statements re-<br />lated to conditions of probation, &#167;5B1.3 (Conditions of Probation), and supervised re-<br />lease, &#167;5D1.3 (Conditions of Supervised Release).<br />When imposing a sentence of probation or a sentence of imprisonment that includes a<br />period of supervised release, the court is required to impose certain conditions of su-<br />pervision listed by statute. 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 3563(a) and 3583(d). Congress has also em-<br />powered courts to impose additional conditions of probation and supervised release<br />that are reasonably related to statutory sentencing factors contained in 18 U.S.C.<br />&#167; 3553(a), so long as those conditions “involve only such deprivations of liberty or prop-<br />erty as are reasonably necessary for the purposes indicated in 3553(a)(2).” 18 U.S.C.<br />&#167; 3563(b); see also 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3583(d). Additional conditions of supervised release<br />must also be consistent with any pertinent policy statements issued by the Commis-<br />sion. See 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3583(d)(3).<br />The Commission is directed by its organic statute to promulgate policy statements on<br />the appropriate use of the conditions of probation and supervised release, see 28 U.S.C.<br />&#167; 994(a)(2)(B), and has implemented this directive in &#167;&#167;5B1.3 and 5D1.3. The provi-<br />sions follow a parallel structure, first setting forth those conditions of supervision that<br />are required by statute in their respective subsections (a) and (b), and then providing<br />guidance on discretionary conditions, which are categorized as “standard” conditions,<br />“special” conditions, and “additional” special conditions, in subsections (c), (d), and (e),<br />respectively.<br />In a number of cases, defendants have raised objections (with varied degrees of suc-<br />cess) to the conditions of supervised release and probation imposed upon them at the<br />time of sentencing. See, e.g., United States v. Munoz, 812 F.3d 809 (10th Cir. 2016);<br />United States v. Kappes, 782 F.3d 828, 848 (7th Cir. 2015); United States v. Siegel,<br />753 F.3d 705 (7th Cir. 2014); United States v. Bahr, 730 F.3d 963 (9th Cir. 2013);<br />United States v. Maloney, 513 F.3d 350, 357–59 (3d Cir. 2008); United States v.<br />Saechao, 418 F.3d 1073, 1081 (9th Cir. 2005). Challenges have been made on the basis<br />that certain conditions are vaguely worded, pose constitutional concerns, or have been<br />categorized as “standard” conditions in a manner that has led to their improper impo-<br />sition upon particular offenders.<br />The amendment responds to many of the concerns raised in these challenges by revis-<br />ing, clarifying, and rearranging the conditions contained in &#167;&#167;5B1.3 and 5D1.3 in order<br />to make them easier for defendants to understand and probation officers to enforce.<br />Many of the challenged conditions are those laid out in the Judgment in a Criminal<br />Case Form, AO245B, which are nearly identical to the conditions in &#167;&#167;5B1.3 and 5D1.3.<br />The amendment was supported by the Criminal Law Committee (CLC) of the Judicial<br />Conference of the United States. The CLC has long taken an active and ongoing role<br />in developing, monitoring and recommending revisions to the condition of supervision,<br />which represent the core supervision practices required by the federal supervision<br />model. The changes in the amendment are consistent with proposed changes to the<br />national judgment form recently endorsed by the CLC and Administrative Office of the<br />U.S. Courts, after an exhaustive review of those conditions aided by probation officers<br />from throughout the country.<br />As part of this broader revision, the conditions in &#167;&#167;5B1.3 and 5D1.3 have been renum-<br />bered. Where the specific conditions discussed below are identified by a guidelines pro-<br />vision reference, that numeration is in reference to their pre-amendment order.<br />Amendment 803<br />170 ║ Supplement to Appendix C (November 1, 2016)<br />Court-Established Payment Schedules<br />First, the amendment amends &#167;&#167;5B1.3(a)(6) and 5D1.3(a)(6) to set forth as a “manda-<br />tory” condition that if there is a court-established payment schedule for making resti-<br />tution or paying a special assessment, the defendant shall adhere to the schedule. Pre-<br />viously, those conditions were classified as “standard.” As a conforming change, similar<br />language at &#167;&#167;5B1.3(c)(14) and 5D1.3(c)(14) is deleted. This change is made to more<br />closely adhere to the requirements of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3572(d).<br />Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act<br />Second, the amendment amends &#167;&#167;5B1.3(a)(9) and 5D1.3(a)(7) to clarify that, if the<br />defendant is required to register under the Sex Offender Registration and Notification<br />Act (SORNA), the defendant shall comply with the requirements of the SORNA. Lan-<br />guage in the guideline provisions and the accompanying commentary indicating that<br />the Act applies in some states and not in others is correspondingly deleted. After re-<br />ceiving testimony from the Department of Justice suggesting the current condition<br />could be misread, the Commission determined that the condition’s language should be<br />simplified and updated to unambiguously reflect that federal sex offender registration<br />requirements apply in all states.<br />Reporting to the Probation Officer<br />Third, the amendment divides the initial and regular reporting requirements,<br />&#167;&#167;5B1.3(a)(2) and 5D1.3(a)(2), into two more definite provisions. The amendment also<br />amends the conditions to require that the defendant report to the probation office in<br />the jurisdiction where he or she is authorized to reside, within 72 hours of release<br />unless otherwise directed, and that the defendant must thereafter report to the proba-<br />tion officer as instructed by the court or the probation officer.<br />Leaving the Jurisdiction<br />Fourth, the amendment revises &#167;&#167;5B1.3(c)(1) and 5D1.3(c)(1), which prohibit defend-<br />ants from leaving the judicial district without permission, for clarity and to insert a<br />mental state (mens rea) requirement that a defendant must not leave the district<br />“knowingly.” Testimony received by the Commission has observed that a rule prohib-<br />iting a defendant from leaving the district without permission of the court or probation<br />officer may be unfairly applied to a defendant who unknowingly moves between dis-<br />tricts. The Commission concluded that this change appropriately responds to that con-<br />cern.<br />Answering Truthfully; Following Instructions<br />Fifth, the amendment divides &#167;&#167;5B1.3(c)(3) and 5D1.3(c)(3) into separate conditions<br />which individually require the defendant to “answer truthfully” the questions of the<br />probation officer and to follow the instructions of the probation officer “related to the<br />conditions of supervision.”<br />The amendment also adds commentary to clarify that a defendant’s legitimate invoca-<br />tion of the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination in response to a pro-<br />bation officer’s question shall not be considered a violation of the “answer truthfully”<br />condition. The Commission determined that this approach adequately addresses Fifth<br />Amendment concerns raised by some courts, see, e.g., United States v. Kappes,<br />782 F.3d 828, 848 (7th Cir. 2015) and United States v. Saechao, 418 F.3d 1073, 1081<br />Amendment 803<br />(9th Cir. 2005), while preserving the probation officer’s ability to adequately supervise<br />the defendant.<br />Residence and Employment<br />Sixth, the amendment clarifies the standard conditions relating to a defendant’s resi-<br />dence, &#167;&#167;5B1.3(c)(6) and 5D1.3(c)(6), and the requirement that the defendant work full<br />time, &#167;&#167;5B1.3(c)(5) and 5D1.3(c)(5). The revised conditions spell out in plain language<br />that the defendant must live at a place “approved by the probation officer,” and that<br />the defendant must work full time (at least 30 hours per week) at a lawful type of<br />employment — or seek to do so — unless excused by the probation officer. The defend-<br />ant must also notify the probation officer of changes in residence or employment at<br />least 10 days in advance of the change or, if this is not possible, within 72 hours of<br />becoming aware of a change. The Commission determined that these changes are ap-<br />propriate to ensure that defendants are made aware of what will be required of them<br />while under supervision. These requirements and associated benchmarks (e.g.,<br />30 hours per week) are supported by testimony from the CLC as appropriate to meet<br />supervision needs.<br />Visits by Probation Officer<br />Seventh, the amendment amends the conditions requiring the defendant to permit the<br />probation officer to visit the defendant at any time, at home or elsewhere, and to permit<br />the probation officer to confiscate items prohibited by the defendant’s terms of release,<br />&#167;&#167;5B1.3(c)(10) and 5D1.3(c)(10). The revision provides plain language notice to defend-<br />ants and guidance to probation officers.<br />The Seventh Circuit has criticized this condition as intrusive and not necessarily con-<br />nected to the offense of conviction, see United States v. Kappes, 782 F.3d 828, 850–51<br />(7th Cir. 2015) and United States v. Thompson, 777 F.3d 368, 379–80 (7th Cir. 2015),<br />but the Commission has determined that, in some circumstance, adequate supervision<br />of defendants may require probation officers to have the flexibility to visit defendants<br />at off-hours, at their workplaces, and without advance notice to the supervisee. For<br />example, some supervisees work overnight shifts and, in order to verify that they are<br />in compliance with the condition of supervision requiring employment, a probation of-<br />ficer might have to visit them at their workplace very late in the evening.<br />Association with Criminals<br />Eighth, the amendment revises and clarifies the conditions mandating that the de-<br />fendant not associate with persons engaged in criminal activity or persons convicted<br />of a felony unless granted permission to do so by the probation officer, &#167;&#167;5B1.3(c)(9)<br />and 5D1.3(c)(9). As amended, the condition requires that the defendant must not “com-<br />municate or interact with” any person whom the defendant “knows” to be engaged in<br />“criminal activity” and prohibits the defendant from communicating or interacting<br />with those whom the defendant “knows” to have been “convicted of a felony” without<br />advance permission of the probation officer.<br />These revisions address concerns expressed by the Seventh Circuit that the condition<br />is vague and lacks a mens rea requirement. See United States v. Kappes, 782 F.3d 828,<br />848–49 (7th Cir. 2015); see also United States v. King, 608 F.3d 1122, 1128 (9th Cir.<br />2010) (upholding the condition by interpreting it to have an implicit mens rea require-<br />ment). The revision adds an express mental state requirement and replaces the term<br />“associate” with more definite language.<br />Amendment 803<br />172 ║ Supplement to Appendix C (November 1, 2016)<br />Arrested or Questioned by a Law Enforcement Officer<br />Ninth, the amendment makes clerical changes to the “standard” conditions requiring<br />that the defendant notify the probation officer after being arrested or questioned by a<br />law enforcement officer. See &#167;&#167;5B1.3(11) and 5D1.3(11).<br />Firearms and Dangerous Weapons<br />Tenth, the amendment reclassifies the “special” conditions which require that the de-<br />fendant not possess a firearm or other dangerous weapon, &#167;&#167;5B1.3(d)(1) and<br />5D1.3(d)(1), as “standard” conditions and clarifies those conditions. As amended, the<br />defendant must not “own, possess, or have access to” a firearm, ammunition, destruc-<br />tive device, or dangerous weapon. After reviewing the testimony from the CLC and<br />others, the Commission determined that reclassifying this condition as a “standard”<br />condition will promote public safety and reduce safety risks to probation officers. The<br />amendment also defines “dangerous weapon” as “anything that was designed, or was<br />modified for, the specific purpose of causing bodily injury or death to another person,<br />such as nunchakus or tasers.”<br />Acting as an Informant<br />Eleventh, the amendment rewords the “standard” condition at &#167;&#167;5B1.3(c)(12) and<br />5D1.3(c)(12) requiring that the defendant not enter into an agreement to act as an<br />informant without permission of the court. The condition is revised to improve clarity.<br />Duty to Notify of Risks Posed by the Defendant<br />Twelfth, the amendment revises the conditions requiring the defendant, at the direc-<br />tion of the probation officer, to notify others of risks the defendant may pose based on<br />his or her personal history or characteristics, &#167;&#167;5B1.3(c)(13) and 5D1.3(c)(13). As<br />amended, the condition provides that, if the probation officer determines that the de-<br />fendant poses a risk to another person, the probation officer may require the defendant<br />to tell the person about the risk and permits the probation officer to confirm that the<br />defendant has done so. The Commission determined that this revision is appropriate<br />to address criticism by the Seventh Circuit regarding potential ambiguity in how the<br />condition is currently phrased. See United States v. Thompson, 777 F.3d 368, 379<br />(7th Cir. 2015).<br />Support of Dependents<br />Thirteenth, the amendment clarifies and moves the dependent support requirement<br />from the list of “standard” conditions, &#167;&#167;5B1.3(c)(4) and 5D1.3(c)(4), to the list of “spe-<br />cial” conditions in subsection (d). As amended, the conditions require that, if the de-<br />fendant has dependents, he or she must support those dependents; and if the defend-<br />ant is ordered to make child support payments, he or she must make the payments<br />and comply with the other terms of the order.<br />These changes address concerns expressed by the Seventh Circuit that the current<br />condition — which requires a defendant to “support his or her dependents and meet<br />other family responsibilities” — is vague and does apply to defendants who have no<br />dependents. See United States v. Kappes, 782 F.3d 828, 849 (7th Cir. 2015) and United<br />States v. Thompson, 777 F.3d 368, 379–80 (7th Cir. 2015). The amendment uses<br />plainer language to provide better notice to the defendant about what is required. The<br />Amendment 804<br />Commission determined that this condition need not apply to all defendants but only<br />to those with dependents.<br />Alcohol; Controlled Substances; Frequenting Places Where Controlled Sub-<br />stances are Sold<br />Fourteenth, the standard conditions requiring that the defendant refrain from exces-<br />sive use of alcohol, not possess or distribute controlled substances or paraphernalia,<br />and not frequent places where controlled substances are illegally sold,<br />&#167;&#167;5B1.3(c)(7)–(8) and 5D1.3(c)(7)–(8), have been deleted. The Commission determined<br />that these conditions are either best dealt with as special conditions or are redundant<br />with other conditions. Specifically, to account for the supervision needs of defendants<br />with alcohol abuse problems, a new special condition that the defendant “must not use<br />or possess alcohol” has been added. The requirement that the defendant abstain from<br />the illegal use of controlled substances is covered by the “mandatory” conditions pro-<br />hibiting commission of additional crimes and requiring substance abuse testing. Fi-<br />nally, the prohibition on frequenting places where controlled substances are illegally<br />sold is encompassed by the “standard” condition that defendants not associate with<br />those they know to be criminals or who are engaged in criminal activity.<br />Material Change in Economic Circumstances (&#167;5D1.3 Only)<br />Finally, with respect to supervised release only, the “standard” condition requiring<br />that the defendant notify the probation officer of any material change in the defend-<br />ant’s economic circumstances that might affect the defendant’s ability to pay any un-<br />paid amount of restitution, fines, or special assessments, &#167;5D1.3(c)(15), is reclassified<br />as a “special” condition in subsection (d). Testimony from the CLC and others indicated<br />that defendants on supervised release often have no outstanding restitution, fines, or<br />special assessments remaining at the time of their release, rendering the condition<br />superfluous in those cases. No change has been made to the parallel “mandatory” con-<br />dition of probation at &#167;5B1.3(a)(7).</td><td>Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2016.</td></tr><tr><td class="n">802</td><td>Amendment 802</td><td>Section 2K2.1 is amended in subsection (a)(8) by inserting “, or 18 U.S.C.<br />&#167; 1715” before the period at the end.<br />The Commentary to &#167;2K2.1 captioned “Statutory Provisions” is amended by inserting<br />after “(k)-(o),” the following: “1715,”.<br />The Commentary to &#167;2M6.1 captioned “Application Notes” is amended in Note 1 by<br />striking “831(f)(2)” and inserting “831(g)(2)”, and by striking “831(f)(1)” and inserting<br />“831(g)(1)”.<br />The Commentary to &#167;2T1.6 captioned “Background” is amended by striking “The of-<br />fense is a felony that is infrequently prosecuted.”.<br />Chapter Two, Part T, Subpart 2, is amended in the Introductory Commentary by strik-<br />ing “Because these offenses are no longer a major enforcement priority, no effort” and<br />inserting “No effort”.<br />Amendment 804<br />174 ║ Supplement to Appendix C (November 1, 2016)<br />Section 2T2.1 is amended by striking the Commentary captioned “Background” as fol-<br />lows:<br />“Background: The most frequently prosecuted conduct violating this section is operat-<br />ing an illegal still. 26 U.S.C. &#167; 5601(a)(1).”.<br />Section 2T2.2 is amended by striking the Commentary captioned “Background” as fol-<br />lows:<br />“Background: Prosecutions of this type are infrequent.”.<br />Appendix A (Statutory Index) is amended by inserting after the line referenced to<br />18 U.S.C. &#167; 1712 the following:<br />“18 U.S.C. &#167; 1715 2K2.1”;<br />by inserting after the line referenced to 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2280 the following:<br />“18 U.S.C. &#167; 2280a 2A1.1, 2A1.2, 2A1.3, 2A1.4, 2A2.1, 2A2.2, 2A2.3, 2A6.1,<br />2B1.1, 2B3.2, 2K1.3, 2K1.4, 2M5.2, 2M5.3, 2M6.1,<br />2Q1.1, 2Q1.2, 2X1.1, 2X2.1, 2X3.1”;<br />by inserting after the line referenced to 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2281 the following:<br />“18 U.S.C. &#167; 2281a 2A1.1, 2A1.2, 2A1.3, 2A1.4, 2A2.1, 2A2.2, 2A2.3, 2A6.1,<br />2B1.1, 2B3.2, 2K1.4, 2M6.1, 2Q1.1, 2Q1.2, 2X1.1”;<br />and by inserting after the line referenced to 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2332h the following:<br />“18 U.S.C. &#167; 2332i 2A6.1, 2K1.4, 2M2.1, 2M2.3, 2M6.1”.</td><td>REASON FOR AMENDMENT: This amendment responds to recently enacted legislation<br />and miscellaneous guideline application issues.<br />USA FREEDOM Act<br />The Uniting and Strengthening America by Fulfilling Rights and Ensuring Effective<br />Discipline Over Monitoring Act (“USA FREEDOM Act”) of 2015, Pub. L. 114–23<br />(June 2, 2015), set forth changes to statutes related to maritime navigation and nu-<br />clear terrorism and provided new and expanded criminal offenses to implement the<br />United States’ obligations under certain provisions of four international conventions.<br />The USA FREEDOM Act also specified that the new crimes constitute “federal crimes<br />of terrorism.” See 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2332b(g)(5). The amendment responds to the USA FREE-<br />DOM Act by referencing the new offenses in Appendix A (Statutory Index) to various<br />Chapter Two guidelines covering murder and assault, weapons, national security, and<br />environmental offenses.<br />First, the USA FREEDOM Act enacted 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2280a (Violence against maritime<br />navigation and maritime transport involving weapons of mass destruction). Subsec-<br />tions 2280a(a)(1)(A) and (a)(1)(B)(i) prohibit certain acts against maritime navigation<br />committed in a manner that causes or is likely to cause death, serious injury, or dam-<br />age, when the purpose of the conduct is to intimidate a population or to compel a gov-<br />Amendment 804<br />ernment or international organization to do or abstain from doing any act. Subsec-<br />tions 2280a(a)(1)(B)(ii)–(vi) prohibit certain other acts against maritime navigation.<br />Subsection 2280a(a)(1)(C) prohibits transporting another person on board a ship know-<br />ing the person has committed a violation under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2280 (Violence against<br />maritime navigation) or certain subsections of section 2280a, or an offense under a<br />listed counterterrorism treaty. Subsection 2280a(a)(1)(D) prohibits injuring or killing<br />a person in connection with the commission of certain offenses under section 2280a.<br />Subsection 2280a(a)(1)(E) prohibits attempts and conspiracies under the statute. The<br />penalty for a violation of these subsections is a term of imprisonment for not more than<br />20 years. If the death of a person results, the penalty is imprisonment for any term of<br />years or for life. Subsection 2280a(a)(2) prohibits threats to commit offenses under<br />subsection 2280a(a)(1)(A), with a penalty of imprisonment of up to five years.<br />The new offenses at section 2280a are referenced in Appendix A (Statutory Index) to<br />the following Chapter Two guidelines: &#167;&#167;2A1.1 (First Degree Murder); 2A1.2 (Second<br />Degree Murder); 2A1.3 (Voluntary Manslaughter); 2A1.4 (Involuntary Manslaughter);<br />2A2.1 (Assault with Intent to Commit Murder; Attempted Murder); 2A2.2 (Aggravated<br />Assault); 2A2.3 (Assault); 2A6.1 (Threatening or Harassing Communications); 2B1.1<br />(Fraud); 2B3.2 (Extortion); 2K1.3 (Unlawful Receipt, Possession, or Transportation of<br />Explosive Materials; Prohibited Transactions Involving Explosive Materials); 2K1.4<br />(Arson; Property Damage by Use of Explosives); 2M5.2 (Exportation of Arms, Muni-<br />tions, or Military Equipment or Services Without Required Validated Export License);<br />2M5.3 (Providing Material Support or Resources to Designated Foreign Terrorist Or-<br />ganizations or Specially Designated Global Terrorists, or For a Terrorist Purpose);<br />2M6.1 (Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical Weapons, and Other Weapons of Mass De-<br />struction); 2Q1.1 (Knowing Endangerment Resulting From Mishandling Hazardous or<br />Toxic Substances, Pesticides or Other Pollutants); 2Q1.2 (Mishandling of Hazardous<br />or Toxic Substances or Pesticides); 2X1.1 (Conspiracy); 2X2.1 (Aiding and Abetting);<br />and 2X3.1 (Accessory After the Fact).<br />Second, the USA FREEDOM Act enacted 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2281a (Additional offenses<br />against maritime fixed platforms). Subsection 2281a(a)(1) prohibits certain acts that<br />occur either on a fixed platform or to a fixed platform committed in a manner that may<br />cause death, serious injury, or damage, when the purpose of the conduct is to intimi-<br />date a population or to compel a government or international organization to do or<br />abstain from doing any act. The penalty for a violation of subsection 2281a(a)(1) is a<br />term of imprisonment for not more than 20 years. If the death of a person results, the<br />penalty is imprisonment for any term of years or for life. Subsection 2281a(a)(2) pro-<br />hibits threats to commit offenses under subsection 2281a(a)(1), and the penalty for a<br />violation of subsection 2281a(a)(2) is imprisonment of up to five years.<br />The new offenses at 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2281a are referenced to &#167;&#167;2A1.1, 2A1.2, 2A1.3, 2A1.4,<br />2A2.1, 2A2.2, 2A2.3, 2A6.1, 2B1.1, 2B3.2, 2K1.4, 2M6.1, 2Q1.1, 2Q1.2, and 2X1.1.<br />Third, the USA FREEDOM Act enacted 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2332i (Acts of nuclear terrorism).<br />Section 2332i prohibits the possession or use of certain radioactive materials or devices<br />with the intent to cause death or serious bodily injury or to cause substantial damage<br />to property or the environment, as well as threats to commit any such acts. The penalty<br />for a violation of section 2332i is imprisonment for any term of years or for life.<br />The new offenses at 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2332i are referenced to &#167;&#167;2A6.1, 2K1.4, 2M2.1 (De-<br />struction of, or Production of Defective, War Material, Premises, or Utilities), 2M2.3<br />(Destruction of, or Production of Defective, National Defense Material, Premises, or<br />Utilities), and 2M6.1.<br />Amendment 804<br />176 ║ Supplement to Appendix C (November 1, 2016)<br />The amendment also makes clerical changes to Application Note 1 to &#167;2M6.1 (Nuclear,<br />Biological, and Chemical Weapons, and Other Weapons of Mass Destruction) to reflect<br />the redesignation of a section in the United States Code by the USA FREEDOM Act.<br />The three new statutes provide a wide range of elements – meaning that the statutes<br />can be violated in a large number of alternative ways. The Commission performed a<br />section-by-section analysis of the elements of the new statutes and identified the Chap-<br />ter Two offense guidelines that appear most analogous. As a result, the Commission<br />determined that referencing the new statutes in Appendix A (Statutory Index) to a<br />range of guidelines will allow the courts to select the most appropriate guideline in<br />light of the nature of the conviction. For example, a reference to &#167;2K1.4 (Arson; Prop-<br />erty Damage by Use of Explosives) is provided to account for when the defendant is<br />convicted under section 2280a(a)(1)(A)(i) for the use of an explosive device on a ship in<br />a manner that causes or is likely to cause death or serious injury. See USSG App. A,<br />Introduction (Where the statute is referenced to more than one guideline section, the<br />court is to “use the guideline most appropriate for the offense conduct charged in the<br />count of which the defendant was convicted.”). The Commission also found it persua-<br />sive that other similar statutes are referenced in Appendix A to a similar list of Chap-<br />ter Two guidelines. Referencing these three new statutes in a manner consistent with<br />the treatment of existing related statutes is reasonable to achieve parity, and will lead<br />to consistent application of the guidelines.<br />Firearms As Nonmailable Items under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1715<br />Section 1715 of title 18 of the United States Code (Firearms as nonmailable; regula-<br />tions) makes it unlawful to deposit for mailing or delivery by the mails pistols, revolv-<br />ers, and other firearms capable of being concealed on the person, and the penalty for a<br />violation of this statute is a term of imprisonment up to two years. Section 1715 is not<br />referenced in Appendix A (Statutory Index). The amendment amends Appendix A to<br />reference offenses under section 1715 to &#167;2K2.1 (Unlawful Receipt, Possession, or<br />Transportation of Firearms or Ammunition; Prohibited Transactions Involving Fire-<br />arms or Ammunition). The amendment also amends &#167;2K2.1 to provide a base offense<br />level of 6 under &#167;2K2.1(a)(8) for convictions under section 1715.<br />The Commission received public comment suggesting that the lack of specific guidance<br />for section 1715 offenses caused unwarranted sentencing disparity. Commission data<br />provided further support for the need for an amendment to address this issue. Alt-<br />hough the data indicated that courts routinely applied &#167;2K2.1 to violations of sec-<br />tion 1715, it also evidenced that courts were reaching different results in the base of-<br />fense level applied. The Commission was persuaded by the data and public comment<br />that an Appendix A reference and corresponding changes to &#167;2K2.1 would reduce those<br />unwarranted sentencing disparities. The Commission determined that &#167;2K2.1 is the<br />most analogous guideline for these types of firearms offenses. By providing an Appen-<br />dix A reference for section 1715, the amendment ensures that &#167;2K2.1 will be consist-<br />ently applied to these offenses. Moreover, the Commission decided that the accompa-<br />nying changes to &#167;2K2.1 will eliminate the disparate application of the base offense<br />levels in that guideline. The Commission selected the base offense level of 6 for these<br />offenses because similar statutory provisions with similar penalties are referenced to<br />&#167;2K2.1(a)(8). The Commission concluded that referencing section 1715 will promote<br />consistency in application and avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities.<br />Amendment 804<br />Background Commentary to &#167;2T1.6 (Failing to Collect or Truthfully Account<br />for and Pay Over Tax)<br />The Background Commentary in &#167;2T1.6 (Failing to Collect or Truthfully Account for<br />and Pay Over Tax) states that “[t]he offense is a felony that is infrequently prosecuted.”<br />Section 2T1.6 applies to violations of 26 U.S.C. &#167; 7202 (Willful failure to collect or pay<br />over tax) which requires employers to withhold from an employee’s paychecks money<br />representing the employee’s personal income and Social Security taxes. If an employer<br />willfully fails to collect, truthfully account for, or pay over such taxes, 26 U.S.C. &#167; 7202<br />provides both civil and criminal remedies. The amendment makes a clerical change to<br />the Background Commentary to &#167;2T1.6 to delete the statement that section 7202 of-<br />fenses are infrequently prosecuted. The amendment makes additional clerical changes<br />in the Introductory Commentary to Chapter Two, Part T, Subpart 2 (Alcohol and To-<br />bacco Taxes), and the Background Commentary to &#167;&#167;2T2.1 (Non-Payment of Taxes)<br />and 2T2.2 (Regulatory Offenses) which has similar language.<br />The amendment reflects public comment received by the Commission that indicated<br />while the statement in the Background Commentary to &#167;2T1.6 may have been accurate<br />when the commentary was originally written in 1987, the number of prosecutions un-<br />der section 7202 have since increased. Additionally, the Commission decided that re-<br />moving language characterizing the frequency of prosecutions for the tax offenses sen-<br />tenced under &#167;&#167;2T1.6, 2T2.1, and 2T2.2 will remove the perception that the Commis-<br />sion has taken a position regarding the relative frequency of prosecution of such of-<br />fenses.</td><td>Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2016.</td></tr></table></div></body>
