GUIDELINES MANUAL
This Volume of Appendix C presents the amendments to the guidelines, policy statements, and
official commentary promulgated effective January 15, 1988; June 15, 1988; October 15, 1988;
November 1, 1989; November 1, 1990; November 1, 1991; November 27, 1991; November 1, 1992;

May 1, 1997; November 1, 1997.*
For amendments effective after November 1, 1997, see Appendix C, Volume II.
The format under which the amendments are presented in this Appendix is designed to facilitate
a comparison between previously existing and amended provisions, in the event it becomes necessary
to reference the former guideline, policy statement, or commentary language.
AMENDMENTS
1. Amendment: Section 1B1.1(b) is amended by inserting "in the order listed" immediately
following "Chapter Two".
Section 1B1.1(d) is amended by deleting "one" and "three" and inserting in lieu thereof "(a)"
and "(c)" respectively.
The Commentary to §1B1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by inserting the
following additional note:
"4. The offense level adjustments from more than one specific offense characteristic
within an offense guideline are cumulative (added together) unless the guideline
specifies that only the greater (or greatest) is to be used. Within each specific
offense characteristic subsection, however, the offense level adjustments are
alternative; only the one that best describes the conduct is to be used. E.g., in
§2A2.2(b)(3), pertaining to degree of bodily injury, the subsection that best
Amendment 1 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003
– 2 –
describes the level of bodily injury is used; the adjustments for different degrees of
bodily injury (subsections (A), (B), and (C)) are not added together.".

and inserting in lieu thereof:
"After determining the appropriate offense guideline section pursuant to subsection (a)
of this section, determine the applicable guideline range in accordance with §1B1.3
(Relevant Conduct).".
The Commentary to §1B1.2 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 2 by deleting:

relevant to the offense (as well as all relevant offender characteristics). See §1B1.3
(Relevant Conduct).",

Sentence).".
Reason for Amendment: The purposes of this amendment are to correct a clerical error and
November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment 3
– 3 –
to clarify the operation of the guidelines.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is January 15, 1988.
3. Amendment: Chapter One, Part B is amended by deleting §1B1.3 in its entirety as follows:
"§1B1.3. Relevant Conduct
To determine the seriousness of the offense conduct, all conduct,
circumstances, and injuries relevant to the offense of conviction shall be
taken into account.
(a) Unless otherwise specified under the guidelines, conduct and
circumstances relevant to the offense of conviction means:
acts or omissions committed or aided and abetted by the
defendant, or by a person for whose conduct the defendant is
legally accountable, that (1) are part of the same course of
conduct, or a common scheme or plan, as the offense of
conviction, or (2) are relevant to the defendant’s state of mind or
motive in committing the offense of conviction, or (3) indicate
the defendant’s degree of dependence upon criminal activity for
a livelihood.
(b) Injury relevant to the offense of conviction means harm which is
caused intentionally, recklessly or by criminal negligence in the
course of conduct relevant to the offense of conviction.
Commentary
Application Note:
1. In sentencing, the court should consider all relevant offense and offender
characteristics. For purposes of assessing offense conduct, the relevant conduct
and circumstances of the offense of conviction are as follows:
a. conduct directed toward preparation for or commission of the offense of
conviction, and efforts to avoid detection and responsibility for the
offense of conviction;
b. conduct indicating that the offense of conviction was to some degree part
of a broader purpose, scheme, or plan;
c. conduct that is relevant to the state of mind or motive of the defendant in
committing the crime;
d. conduct that is relevant to the defendant’s involvement in crime as a
livelihood.
The first three criteria are derived from two sources, Rule 8(a) of the
Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, governing joinder of similar or related
Amendment 3 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003
– 4 –
offenses, and Rule 404(b) of the Federal Rules of Evidence, permitting admission
of evidence of other crimes to establish motive, intent, plan, and common
scheme. These rules provide standards that govern consideration at trial of
crimes "of the same or similar character," and utilize concepts and terminology
familiar to judges, prosecutors, and defenders. The governing standard should
be liberally construed in favor of considering information generally appropriate
to sentencing. When other crimes are inadmissible under the Rule 404(b)
standard, such crimes may not be "relevant to the offense of conviction" under
the criteria that determine this question for purposes of Chapter Two; such crimes
would, however, be considered in determining the relevant offender
characteristics to the extent authorized by Chapter Three (Adjustments), and
Chapter Four (Criminal History and Criminal Livelihood) and Chapter Five,
Part H (Specific Offender Characteristics). This construction is consistent with
the existing rule that "[n]o limitation shall be placed on the information
concerning the background, character, and conduct of a person convicted of an
offense . . . for the purpose of imposing an appropriate sentence," 18 U.S.C.
§ 3577, so long as the information "has sufficient indicia of reliability to support
its probable accuracy." United States v. Marshall, 519 F. Supp. 751 (D. Wis.
1981), aff’d, 719 F.2d 887 (7th Cir. 1983).
The last of these criteria is intended to ensure that a judge may consider
at sentencing, information that, although not specifically within other criteria of
relevance, indicates that the defendant engages in crime for a living. Inclusion
of this information in sentencing considerations is consistent with 28 U.S.C. §
994(d)(11).".
A replacement guideline with accompanying commentary is inserted as §1B1.3 (Relevant
Conduct (Factors that Determine the Guideline Range)).
Reason for Amendment: The purpose of this amendment is to clarify the guideline. The
amended language restates the intent of §1B1.3 as originally promulgated.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is January 15, 1988.
4. Amendment: Chapter One, Part B is amended by deleting §1B1.4 in its entirety as follows:
"§1B1.4. Determining the Offense Level
In determining the offense level:
(a) determine the base offense level from Chapter Two;
(b) make any applicable adjustments for specific offense
characteristics from Chapter Two in the order listed;
(c) make any applicable adjustments from Chapter Three;
(d) make any applicable adjustments from Chapter Four, Part B
(Career Offenders and Criminal Livelihood).
Commentary
November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment 5
– 5 –
Application Notes:
1. A particular guideline (in the base offense level or in a specific offense
characteristic) may expressly direct that a particular factor be applied only if the
defendant was convicted of a particular statute. E.g., in §2K2.3, a base offense
level of 12 is used "if convicted under 26 U.S.C. § 5861." Unless such an express
direction is included, conviction under the statute is not required. Thus, use of
a statutory reference to describe a particular set of circumstances does not require
a conviction under the referenced statute. Examples of this usage are found in
§2K1.3(b)(4) ("if the defendant was a person prohibited from receiving
explosives under 18 U.S.C. § 842(i), or if the defendant knowingly distributed
explosives to a person prohibited from receiving explosives under 18 U.S.C. §
842(i), increase by 10 levels"); and §2A3.4(b)(2) ("if the abusive contact was
accomplished as defined in 18 U.S.C. § 2242, increase by 4 levels"). In such
cases, the particular circumstances described are to be evaluated under the
"relevant conduct" standard of §1B1.3.
2. Once the appropriate base offense level is determined, all specific offense
characteristics are to be applied in the order listed.
3. The offense level adjustments from more than one specific offense characteristic
within an offense guideline are cumulative (added together) unless the guideline
specifies that only the greater (or greatest) is to be used. Within each specific
offense characteristic subsection, however, the offense level adjustments are
alternative; only the one that best describes the conduct is to be used. E.g., in
§2A2.2(b)(3), pertaining to degree of bodily injury, the subsection that best
describes the level of bodily injury is used; the adjustments from different
degrees of bodily injury (subsections (A), (B) and (C)) are not added together).
4. The adjustments in Chapter Three that may apply include Part A (Victim-Related
Adjustments), Part B (Role in the Offense), Part C (Obstruction), Part D
(Multiple Counts), and Part E (Acceptance of Responsibility).".
A replacement guideline with accompanying commentary is inserted as §1B1.4 (Information
to be Used in Imposing Sentence (Selecting a Point Within the Guideline Range or Departing
from the Guidelines)).
Reason for Amendment: The purposes of this amendment are to remove material made
redundant by the reorganization of this Part and to replace it with material that clarifies the
operation of the guidelines. The material formerly in this section is now covered by §1B1.1.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is January 15, 1988.
5. Amendment: Chapter One, Part B, is amended by inserting an additional guideline with
accompanying commentary as §1B1.8 (Use of Certain Information).
Reason for Amendment: The purpose of this amendment is to facilitate cooperation
agreements by ensuring that certain information revealed by a defendant, as part of an
agreement to cooperate with the government by providing information concerning unlawful
activities of others, will not be used to increase the guideline sentence.
Amendment 5 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003
– 6 –
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is June 15, 1988.
6. Amendment: Chapter One, Part B, is amended by inserting an additional guideline with
accompanying commentary as §1B1.9 (Petty Offenses).
Reason for Amendment: The purpose of this guideline is to delete coverage of petty offenses.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is June 15, 1988.
7. Amendment: Section 2B1.1(b)(1) is amended by deleting "value of the property taken" and
inserting in lieu thereof "loss".
The Commentary to §2B1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 2 by deleting:
"Loss is to be based upon replacement cost to the victim or market value of the property,
whichever is greater.",
and inserting in lieu thereof:
"‘Loss’ means the value of the property taken, damaged, or destroyed. Ordinarily, when
property is taken or destroyed the loss is the fair market value of the particular property
at issue. Where the market value is difficult to ascertain or inadequate to measure harm
to the victim, the court may measure loss in some other way, such as reasonable
replacement cost to the victim. When property is damaged the loss is the cost of repairs,
not to exceed the loss had the property been destroyed. In cases of partially completed
conduct, the loss is to be determined in accordance with the provisions of §2X1.1
(Attempt, Solicitation, or Conspiracy Not Covered by a Specific Guideline). E.g., in the
case of the theft of a government check or money order, loss refers to the loss that would
have occurred if the check or money order had been cashed. Similarly, if a defendant is
apprehended in the process of taking a vehicle, the loss refers to the value of the vehicle
even if the vehicle is recovered immediately.".
Reason for Amendment: The purpose of this amendment is to clarify the guideline in respect
to the determination of loss.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is June 15, 1988.
8. Amendment: Section 2B1.2 is amended by transposing the texts of subsections (b)(2) and (3).
The Commentary to §2B1.2 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by deleting:
"3. For consistency with §2B1.1, it is the Commission’s intent that specific offense
characteristic (b)(3) be applied before (b)(2).",
and by renumbering Note 4 as Note 3.
Reason for Amendment: The purpose of this amendment is to correct a clerical error in the
guideline. Correction of the error makes the deleted commentary unnecessary.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is January 15, 1988.

43. Amendment: Chapter Two, Part X is amended by deleting §2X5.1 in its entirety as follows:
"§2X5.1. Other Offenses (Policy Statement)
For offenses for which no specific guideline has been promulgated:
(a) If the offense is a felony or class A misdemeanor, the most
analogous guideline should be applied. If no sufficiently
analogous guideline exists, any sentence that is reasonable and
consistent with the purposes of sentencing should be imposed.
See 18 U.S.C. § 3553(b).
(b) If the offense is a Class B or C misdemeanor or an infraction, any
sentence that is reasonable and consistent with the purpose of
sentencing should be imposed. See 18 U.S.C. § 3553(b).
Commentary
Background: This policy statement addresses cases in which a defendant has been
convicted of an offense for which no specific guideline has been written. For a felony
Amendment 43 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003
– 16 –
or a class A misdemeanor (see 18 U.S.C. §§ 3559(a) and 3581(b)), the court is directed
to apply the most analogous guideline. If no sufficiently analogous guideline exists, the
court is directed to sentence without reference to a specific guideline or guideline range,
as provided in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(b).
For a class B or C misdemeanor or an infraction (see 18 U.S.C. §§ 3559(a) and
3581(b)) that is not covered by a specific guideline, the court is directed to sentence
without reference to a specific guideline or guideline range, as provided in 18 U.S.C. §
3553(b). An inquiry as to whether there is a sufficiently analogous guideline that might
be applied is not required. The Commission makes this distinction in treatment because
for many lesser offenses (e.g., traffic infractions), generally handled under assimilative
offense provisions by magistrates, there will be no sufficiently analogous guideline, and
a case-by-case determination in respect to this issue for the high volume of cases
processed each year would be unduly burdensome and would not significantly reduce
disparity.".
A replacement guideline with accompanying commentary is inserted as §2X5.1 (Other
Offenses).
Reason for Amendment: The purposes of this amendment are to make the section a binding
guideline (as the Commission originally intended with respect to felonies and Class A
misdemeanors) rather than a policy statement, to delete language relating to petty offenses, and
to conform and clarify the commentary.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is June 15, 1988.

and inserting in lieu thereof:
"This guideline applies when specified individuals are victims of the offense. This
guideline does not apply when the only victim is an organization, agency, or the
government.".
Reason for Amendment: The purpose of this amendment is to clarify the commentary.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is January 15, 1988.
45. Amendment: Section 3D1.2(d) is amended by deleting:
"(d) When counts involve the same general type of offense and the guidelines for that
type of offense determine the offense level primarily on the basis of the total
amount of harm or loss, the quantity of a substance involved, or some other
measure of aggregate harm. Offenses of this kind are found in Chapter Two, Part
B (except §§2B2.1-2B3.3), Part D (except §§2D1.6-2D3.4), Part E (except
§§2E1.1-2E2.1), Part F, Part G (§§2G2.2-2G3.1), Part K (§2K2.3), Part N
(§§2N2.1, 2N3.1), Part Q (§§2Q2.1, 2Q2.2), Part R, Part S, and Part T. This rule

– 17 –
also applies where the guidelines deal with offenses that are continuing, e.g..,
§§2L1.3 and 2Q1.3(b)(1)(A).",
and inserting in lieu thereof:
"(d) Counts are grouped together if the offense level is determined largely on the basis
of the total amount of harm or loss, the quantity of a substance involved, or some
other measure of aggregate harm, or if the offense behavior is ongoing or
continuous in nature and the offense guideline is written to cover such behavior.
Offenses covered by the following guidelines are specifically included under this
subsection:

2M3.8, 2M3.9;
§§2P1.1, 2P1.2, 2P1.3, 2P1.4.
For multiple counts of offenses that are not listed, grouping under this subsection
may or may not be appropriate; a case-by-case determination must be made based
upon the facts of the case and the applicable guidelines (including specific
offense characteristics and other adjustments) used to determine the offense level.
Exclusion of an offense from grouping under this subsection does not necessarily
preclude grouping under another subsection.".

less than 5 years
The Commentary to §4B1.1 captioned "Background" is amended by deleting the last paragraph
as follows:
"The guideline levels for career offenders were established by using the statutory
maximum for the offense of conviction to determine the class of felony provided in
18 U.S.C. § 3559. Then the maximum authorized sentence of imprisonment for each
November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment 49
– 19 –
class of felony was determined as provided by 18 U.S.C. § 3581. A guideline range for
each class of felony was then chosen so that the maximum of the guideline range was at
or near the maximum provided in 18 U.S.C. § 3581.".

Amendment 54 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003
– 22 –
offense.".
The Commentary to §5E4.2 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by deleting:
"2. The maximum fines generally authorized by statute are restated in subsection (b).
These apply to each count of conviction. Ordinarily, the maximum fines on each
count are independent and cumulative. However, if the offenses ‘arise from a
common scheme or plan’ and ‘do not cause separable or distinguishable kinds of
harm or damage,’ the aggregate fine may not exceed ‘twice the amount imposable
for the most serious offense.’ 18 U.S.C. § 3572(b) (former 18 U.S.C. §
3623(c)(2)).
3. Alternative fine limits are provided in subsection (c)(2). The term ‘estimated
gain’ is used to emphasize that the Commission does not intend precise or
detailed calculation of the monetary gain (nor of the loss) in using the alternative
fine limits. In many cases, circumstances will make it unnecessary to consider
these standards other than in the most general terms.",
and inserting in lieu thereof:
"2. In general, the maximum fine permitted by law as to each count of conviction is
$250,000 for a felony or for any misdemeanor resulting in death; $100,000 for
a Class A misdemeanor; and $5,000 for any other offense. 18 U.S.C.
§ 3571(b)(3)-(7). However, higher or lower limits may apply when specified by
statute. 18 U.S.C. § 3571(b)(1), (e). As an alternative maximum, the court may
fine the defendant up to the greater of twice the gross gain or twice the gross loss.
18 U.S.C. § 3571(b)(2), (d).
3. Alternative fine limits are provided in subsection (c). The terms ‘pecuniary gain’
and ‘pecuniary loss’ are taken from 18 U.S.C. § 3571(d). The Commission does
not intend precise or detailed calculation of the gain or loss in using the
alternative fine limits. In many cases, circumstances will make it unnecessary to
consider these standards other than in the most general terms.".
The Commentary to §5E4.2 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 4 by deleting
"Any restitution" and inserting in lieu thereof "Restitution".
The Commentary to §5E4.2 captioned "Background" is amended by deleting:
"defendant. In addition, the Commission concluded that greater latitude with a gain-
based fine was justified; when the court finds it necessary to rely on the gain, rather than
the loss, to set the fine, ordering restitution usually will not be feasible because of the
difficulty in computing the amount.",
and inserting in lieu thereof:
"participants. In addition, in many such cases restitution will not be feasible.".
Reason for Amendment: The purposes of this amendment are to make the guideline
consistent with 18 U.S.C. § 3571, as amended, to clarify the commentary, and to correct clerical
errors in the guideline and commentary.

Statement)
With regard to labor racketeering offenses, a part of the punishment
imposed by 29 U.S.C. §§ 504 and 511 is the prohibition of convicted
persons from service in labor unions, employer associations, employee
benefit plans, and as labor relations consultants. Violations of these
provisions are felony offenses. Persons convicted after October 12, 1984,
may petition the sentencing court to reduce the statutory disability
(thirteen years after sentence or imprisonment, whichever is later) to a
lesser period (not less than three years after entry of judgment in the trial
court). After November 1, 1987, petitions for exemption from the
disability that were formerly administered by the United States Parole
Commission will be transferred to the courts. Relief shall not be given in
such cases to aid rehabilitation, but may be granted only following a clear
demonstration by the convicted person that he has been rehabilitated since
commission of the crime.".

and inserting in lieu thereof:
"Disclosure of Presentence Report; Issues in Dispute (Policy Statement)
Courts should adopt procedures to provide for the timely disclosure of the presentence
report; the narrowing and resolution, where feasible, of issues in dispute in advance of
the sentencing hearing; and the identification for the court of issues remaining in dispute.
See Model Local Rule for Guideline Sentencing prepared by the Probation Committee
of the Judicial Conference (August 1987).".

to statutory title and section number:
"49 U.S.C. § 1472(k)(1) 2A5.3".

November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment 70
– 29 –
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is October 15, 1988.
66. Amendment: Chapter Two, Part D is amended by deleting §2D1.5 in its entirety as follows:
"§2D1.5. Continuing Criminal Enterprise
(a) Base Offense Level:
(1) 32, for the first conviction of engaging in a continuing
criminal enterprise; or
(2) 38, for the second or any subsequent conviction of
engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise; or
(3) 43, for engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise as the
principal administrator, leader, or organizer, if either the
amount of drugs involved was 30 times the minimum in
the first paragraph (i.e., the text corresponding to Level
36) of the Drug Quantity Table or 300 times the
minimum in the third paragraph (i.e., the text
corresponding to Level 32), or the principal received $10
million in gross receipts for any twelve-month period.
Commentary
Statutory Provision: 21 U.S.C. § 848.
Application Note:
1. Do not apply any adjustment from Chapter Three, Part B (Role in the Offense).
Background: The base offense levels for continuing criminal enterprises are mandatory
minimum sentences provided by the statute that mandate imprisonment for leaders of
large scale drug enterprises. A conviction establishes that the defendant controlled and
exercised decision-making authority over one of the most serious forms of ongoing
criminal activity. Therefore, an adjustment for role in the offense in Chapter Three, Part
B, is not applicable.".
A replacement guideline with accompanying commentary is inserted as §2D1.5 (Continuing
Criminal Enterprise).
Reason for Amendment: The purpose of this amendment is to ensure that the guideline
adequately reflects the seriousness of the criminal conduct. The previous guideline specified
sentences that were lower than sentences typically imposed on defendants convicted of
engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise, a result that the Commission did not intend. The
guideline is also amended to delete, as unnecessary, provisions that referred to statutory
minimum sentences.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is October 15, 1988.
67. Amendment: Chapter One, Part A (4)(b) is amended in the first sentence by deleting "... that
Amendment 68 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003
– 30 –
was" and inserting in lieu thereof "of a kind, or to a degree,".
Chapter One, Part A, section 4(b) is amended in the second sentence of the last paragraph by
deleting "Part H" and inserting in lieu thereof "Part K (Departures)", and in the third sentence
of the last paragraph by deleting "Part H" and inserting in lieu thereof "Part K".
Reason for Amendment: The purposes of this amendment are to conform the quotation to the
statute, as amended by Section 3 of the Sentencing Act of 1987, and to correct a clerical error.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1989.
68. Amendment: Chapter One, Part A, section 4(b) is amended in the first sentence of the fourth
paragraph by deleting "three" and inserting in lieu thereof "two"; in the fourth paragraph by
deleting the second through eighth sentences as follows:
"The first kind, which will most frequently be used, is in effect an interpolation between
two adjacent, numerically oriented guideline rules. A specific offense characteristic, for
example, might require an increase of four levels for serious bodily injury but two levels
for bodily injury. Rather than requiring a court to force middle instances into either the
‘serious’ or the ‘simple’ category, the guideline commentary suggests that the court may
interpolate and select a midpoint increase of three levels. The Commission has decided
to call such an interpolation a ‘departure’ in light of the legal views that a guideline
providing for a range of increases in offense levels may violate the statute’s 25 percent
rule (though other have presented contrary legal arguments). Since interpolations are
technically departures, the courts will have to provide reasons for their selection, and it
will be subject to review for ‘reasonableness’ on appeal. The Commission believes,
however, that a simple reference by the court to the ‘mid-category’ nature of the facts
will typically provide sufficient reason. It does not foresee serious practical problems
arising out of the application of the appeal provisions to this form of departure.";
in the first sentence of the fifth paragraph by deleting "second" and inserting in lieu thereof
"first"; and, in the first sentence of the sixth paragraph by deleting "third" and inserting in lieu
thereof "second".
Reason for Amendment: The purpose of this amendment is to eliminate references to
interpolation as a special type of departure. The Commission has reviewed the discussion of
interpolation in Chapter One, which has been read as describing "interpolation" as a departure
from an offense level rather than from the guideline range established after the determination
of an offense level. The Commission concluded that it is simpler to add intermediate offense
level adjustments to the guidelines in the cases where interpolation is most likely to be
considered (i.e., degree of bodily injury). This amendment is not intended to preclude
interpolation in other cases; where appropriate, the court will be able to achieve the same result
by use of the regular departure provisions.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1989.
69. Amendment: Section 1B1.1(a) is amended by deleting "guideline section in Chapter Two
most applicable to the statute of conviction" and inserting in lieu thereof "applicable offense
guideline section from Chapter Two", and by deleting the last sentence as follows: "If more
than one guideline is referenced for the particular statute, select the guideline most appropriate
for the conduct of which the defendant was convicted.".
November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment 70
– 31 –
Reason for Amendment: The purposes of this amendment are to clarify the guideline and
conform the language to §1B1.2.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1989.
70. Amendment: Section 1B1.1(e) is amended by deleting the last sentence as follows: "The
resulting offense level is the total offense level.".
Section 1B1.1(g) is amended by deleting "total", and by inserting "determined above"
immediately following "category".
Reason for Amendment: The purpose of this amendment is to clarify the guideline.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1989.
Amendment 71 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003
– 32 –
71. Amendment: The Commentary to §1B1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note
1(c) by deleting "firearm or other dangerous weapon" and inserting in lieu thereof "dangerous
weapon (including a firearm)".
The Commentary to §1B1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 1(d) by
inserting the following additional sentence at the end: "Where an object that appeared to be a
dangerous weapon was brandished, displayed, or possessed, treat the object as a dangerous
weapon.".
The Commentary to §1B1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 1(g) by deleting
"firearm or other dangerous weapon" the first time it appears and inserting in lieu thereof
"dangerous weapon (including a firearm)".
The Commentary to §1B1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by inserting the
following additional note:
"5. Where two or more guideline provisions appear equally applicable, but the
guidelines authorize the application of only one such provision, use the provision
that results in the greater offense level. E.g., in §2A2.2(b)(2), if a firearm is both
discharged and brandished, the provision applicable to the discharge of the
firearm would be used.".
Reason for Amendment: The purposes of this amendment are to clarify the definition of a
dangerous weapon; and to clarify that when two or more guideline provisions appear equally
applicable, but the guidelines authorize the application of only one such provision, the
provision that results in the greater offense level is to be used.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1989.
72. Amendment: The Commentary to §1B1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by
inserting the following additional note:
"6. In the case of a defendant subject to a sentence enhancement under 18 U.S.C. §
3147 (Penalty for an Offense Committed While on Release), see §2J1.7
(Commission of Offense While on Release).".
Reason for Amendment: The purpose of this amendment is to clarify the treatment of a
specific enhancement provision.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1989.
73. Amendment: Section 1B1.2(a) is amended in the first sentence by deleting "The court shall
apply" and inserting in lieu thereof "Determine"; and in the second sentence by deleting "the
court shall apply" and inserting in lieu thereof "determine", and by deleting "guideline in such
chapter" and inserting in lieu thereof "offense guideline section in Chapter Two".
Reason for Amendment: The purposes of this amendment are to clarify the guideline and to
make the phraseology of this subsection more consistent with that of §§1B1.1 and 1B1.2(b).
November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment 76
– 33 –
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1989.
74. Amendment: Section 1B1.2(a) is amended in the first sentence by inserting immediately
before the period: "(i.e., the offense conduct charged in the count of the indictment or
information of which the defendant was convicted)".
The Commentary to §1B1.2 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in the first paragraph
of Note 1 by deleting:
"As a general rule, the court is to apply the guideline covering the offense conduct most
applicable to the offense of conviction. Where a particular statute proscribes a variety
of conduct which might constitute the subject of different guidelines, the court will
decide which guideline applies based upon the nature of the offense conduct charged.",
and inserting in lieu thereof:
"As a general rule, the court is to use the guideline section from Chapter Two most
applicable to the offense of conviction. The Statutory Index (Appendix A) provides a
listing to assist in this determination. When a particular statute proscribes only a single
type of criminal conduct, the offense of conviction and the conduct proscribed by the
statute will coincide, and there will be only one offense guideline referenced. When a
particular statute proscribes a variety of conduct that might constitute the subject of
different offense guidelines, the court will determine which guideline section applies
based upon the nature of the offense conduct charged in the count of which the defendant
was convicted.".
Reason for Amendment: The purpose of this amendment is to clarify the guideline and
commentary.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1989.
75. Amendment: Section 1B1.2(a) is amended by deleting the last sentence as follows:
"Similarly, stipulations to additional offenses are treated as if the defendant had been
convicted of separate counts charging those offenses.",
and by inserting the following additional subsections:
"(c) A conviction by a plea of guilty or nolo contendere containing a stipulation that
specifically establishes the commission of additional offense(s) shall be treated
as if the defendant had been convicted of additional count(s) charging those
offense(s).
(d) A conviction on a count charging a conspiracy to commit more than one offense
shall be treated as if the defendant had been convicted on a separate count of
conspiracy for each offense that the defendant conspired to commit.".
Amendment 75 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003
– 34 –
The Commentary to §1B1.2 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in the second paragraph
of Note 1 by deleting:
"Similarly, if the defendant pleads guilty to one robbery but admits the elements of two
additional robberies as part of a plea agreement, the guideline applicable to three
robberies is to be applied.",
and by inserting the following additional notes:
"4. Subsections (c) and (d) address circumstances in which the provisions of Chapter
Three, Part D (Multiple Counts) are to be applied although there may be only one
count of conviction. Subsection (c) provides that in the case of a stipulation to
the commission of additional offense(s), the guidelines are to be applied as if the
defendant had been convicted of an additional count for each of the offenses
stipulated. For example, if the defendant is convicted of one count of robbery
but, as part of a plea agreement, admits to having committed two additional
robberies, the guidelines are to be applied as if the defendant had been convicted
of three counts of robbery. Subsection (d) provides that a conviction on a
conspiracy count charging conspiracy to commit more than one offense is treated
as if the defendant had been convicted of a separate conspiracy count for each
offense that he conspired to commit. For example, where a conviction on a single
count of conspiracy establishes that the defendant conspired to commit three
robberies, the guidelines are to be applied as if the defendant had been convicted
on one count of conspiracy to commit the first robbery, one count of conspiracy
to commit the second robbery, and one count of conspiracy to commit the third
robbery.
5. Particular care must be taken in applying subsection (d) because there are cases
in which the jury’s verdict does not establish which offense(s) was the object of
the conspiracy. In such cases, subsection (d) should only be applied with respect
to an object offense alleged in the conspiracy count if the court, were it sitting as
a trier of fact, would convict the defendant of conspiring to commit that object
offense. Note, however, if the object offenses specified in the conspiracy count
would be grouped together under §3D1.2(d) (e.g., a conspiracy to steal three
government checks) it is not necessary to engage in the foregoing analysis,
because §1B1.3(a)(2) governs consideration of the defendant’s conduct.".
Reason for Amendment: The purpose of this amendment is to add a guideline subsection
(subsection (d)) expressly providing that a conviction of conspiracy to commit more than one
offense is treated for guideline purposes as if the defendant had been convicted of a separate
conspiracy count for each offense that the defendant conspired to commit. The current
instruction in Application Note 9 of §3D1.2 is inadequate. For consistency, material now
contained at §1B1.2(a) concerning stipulations to having committed additional offenses is
moved to a new subsection (subsection (c)).
Additional commentary (Application Note 5) is provided to address cases in which the jury’s
November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment 78
– 35 –
verdict does not specify how many or which offenses were the object of the conspiracy of
which the defendant was convicted. Compare United States v. Johnson, 713 F.2d 633, 645-46
(11th Cir. 1983) (conviction stands if there is sufficient proof with respect to any one of the
objectives) cert. denied sub nom. Wilkins v. United States, 465 U.S. 1081 (1984) with United
States v. Tarnopol, 561 F.2d 466 (3d Cir. 1977) (failure of proof with respect to any one of the
objectives renders the conspiracy conviction invalid). In order to maintain consistency with
other §1B1.2(a) determinations, this decision should be governed by a reasonable doubt
standard. A higher standard of proof should govern the creation of what is, in effect, a new
count of conviction for the purposes of Chapter Three, Part D (Multiple Counts). Because the
guidelines do not explicitly establish standards of proof, the proposed new application note calls
upon the court to determine which offense(s) was the object of the conspiracy as if it were
"sitting as a trier of fact." The foregoing determination is not required, however, in the case of
offenses that are grouped together under §3D1.2(d) (e.g., fraud and theft) because §1B1.3(a)(2)
governs consideration of the defendant’s conduct.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1989.
76. Amendment: Section 1B1.3 is amended in subsection (a)(3) by deleting "or risk of harm"
immediately following "all harm", and by deleting "if the harm or risk was caused intentionally,
recklessly or by criminal negligence, and all harm or risk" and inserting in lieu thereof "and all
harm".
Section 1B1.3(a) is amended by deleting:
"(4) the defendant’s state of mind, intent, motive and purpose in committing the
offense; and",
by renumbering subsection (a)(5) as (a)(4), and by inserting "and" at the end of subsection
(a)(3) immediately following the semicolon.
The Commentary to §1B1.3 captioned "Background" is amended by deleting:
" Subsection (a)(4) requires consideration of the defendant’s ‘state of mind, intent,
motive or purpose in committing the offense.’ The defendant’s state of mind is an
element of the offense that may constitute a specific offense characteristic. See, e.g.,
§2A1.4 (Involuntary Manslaughter) (distinction made between recklessness and criminal
negligence). The guidelines also incorporate broader notions of intent or purpose that
are not elements of the offense, e.g., whether the offense was committed for profit, or for
the purpose of facilitating a more serious offense. Accordingly, such factors must be
considered in determining the applicable guideline range.",
and inserting in lieu thereof:
" Subsection (a)(4) requires consideration of any other information specified in the
applicable guideline. For example, §2A1.4 (Involuntary Manslaughter) specifies
consideration of the defendant’s state of mind; §2K1.4 (Arson; Property Damage By Use
of Explosives) specifies consideration of the risk of harm created.".
Amendment 76 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003
– 36 –
Reason for Amendment: The purpose of this amendment is to delete language pertaining to
"risk of harm" and "state of mind" as unnecessary. Cases in which the guidelines specifically
address risk of harm or state of mind are covered in the amended guideline under subsection
(a)(4) [formerly subsection (a)(5)]. In addition, the amendment deletes reference to harm
committed "intentionally, recklessly, or by criminal negligence" as unnecessary and potentially
confusing.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1989.
77. Amendment: Section 1B1.3 is amended by deleting the introductory sentence as follows:
"The conduct that is relevant to determining the applicable guideline range includes that set
forth below.".
Section 1B1.3(b) is amended by deleting:
"(b) Chapter Four (Criminal History and Criminal Livelihood). To determine the
criminal history category and the applicability of the career offender and criminal
livelihood guidelines, the court shall consider all conduct relevant to a
determination of the factors enumerated in the respective guidelines in Chapter
Four.",
and inserting in lieu thereof:
"(b) Chapters Four (Criminal History and Criminal Livelihood) and Five
(Determining the Sentence). Factors in Chapters Four and Five that establish the
guideline range shall be determined on the basis of the conduct and information
specified in the respective guidelines.".
The Commentary to §1B1.3 captioned "Background" is amended in the second paragraph by
deleting "Chapter Four" and inserting in lieu thereof "Chapters Four and Five", and by deleting
"that Chapter" and inserting in lieu thereof "those Chapters".
Reason for Amendment: The purpose of this amendment is to clarify the guideline.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1989.
78. Amendment: The Commentary to §1B1.3 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note
1 by deleting:
"If the conviction is for conspiracy, it includes conduct in furtherance of the conspiracy
that was known to or was reasonably foreseeable by the defendant. If the conviction is
for solicitation, misprision or accessory after the fact, it includes all conduct relevant to
determining the offense level for the underlying offense that was known to or reasonably
should have been known by the defendant. See generally §§2X1.1-2X4.1.",
November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment 78
– 37 –
and inserting in lieu thereof:
"In the case of criminal activity undertaken in concert with others, whether or not
charged as a conspiracy, the conduct for which the defendant ‘would be otherwise
accountable’ also includes conduct of others in furtherance of the execution of the
jointly-undertaken criminal activity that was reasonably foreseeable by the defendant.
Because a count may be broadly worded and include the conduct of many participants
over a substantial period of time, the scope of the jointly-undertaken criminal activity,
and hence relevant conduct, is not necessarily the same for every participant. Where it
is established that the conduct was neither within the scope of the defendant’s agreement,
nor was reasonably foreseeable in connection with the criminal activity the defendant
agreed to jointly undertake, such conduct is not included in establishing the defendant’s
offense level under this guideline.
In the case of solicitation, misprision, or accessory after the fact, the conduct for which
the defendant ‘would be otherwise accountable’ includes all conduct relevant to
determining the offense level for the underlying offense that was known, or reasonably
should have been known, by the defendant.
Illustrations of Conduct for Which the Defendant is Accountable
a. Defendant A, one of ten off-loaders hired by Defendant B, was convicted of
importation of marihuana, as a result of his assistance in off-loading a boat containing
a one-ton shipment of marihuana. Regardless of the number of bales of marihuana that
he actually unloaded, and notwithstanding any claim on his part that he was neither
aware of, nor could reasonably foresee, that the boat contained this quantity of
marihuana, Defendant A is held accountable for the entire one-ton quantity of marihuana
on the boat because he aided and abetted the unloading, and hence the importation, of the
entire shipment.
b. Defendant C, the getaway driver in an armed bank robbery in which $15,000 is
taken and a teller is injured, is convicted of the substantive count of bank robbery.
Defendant C is accountable for the money taken because he aided and abetted the taking
of the money. He is accountable for the injury inflicted because he participated in
concerted criminal conduct that he could reasonably foresee might result in the infliction
of injury.
c. Defendant D pays Defendant E a small amount to forge an endorsement on an
$800 stolen government check. Unknown to Defendant E, Defendant D then uses that
check as a down payment in a scheme to fraudulently obtain $15,000 worth of
merchandise. Defendant E is convicted of forging the $800 check. Defendant E is not
accountable for the $15,000 because the fraudulent scheme to obtain $15,000 was
beyond the scope of, and not reasonably foreseeable in connection with, the criminal
activity he jointly undertook with Defendant D.
d. Defendants F and G, working together, design and execute a scheme to sell
fraudulent stocks by telephone. Defendant F fraudulently obtains $20,000. Defendant
Amendment 78 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003
– 38 –
G fraudulently obtains $35,000. Each is convicted of mail fraud. Each defendant is
accountable for the entire amount ($55,000) because each aided and abetted the other in
the fraudulent conduct. Alternatively, because Defendants F and G engaged in concerted
criminal activity, each is accountable for the entire $55,000 loss because the conduct of
each was in furtherance of the jointly undertaken criminal activity and was reasonably
foreseeable.
e. Defendants H and I engaged in an ongoing marihuana importation conspiracy in
which Defendant J was hired only to help off-load a single shipment. Defendants H, I,
and J are included in a single count charging conspiracy to import marihuana. For the
purposes of determining the offense level under this guideline, Defendant J is
accountable for the entire single shipment of marihuana he conspired to help import and
any acts or omissions in furtherance of the importation that were reasonably foreseeable.
He is not accountable for prior or subsequent shipments of marihuana imported by
Defendants H or I if those acts were beyond the scope of, and not reasonably
foreseeable in connection with, the criminal activity he agreed to jointly undertake with
Defendants H and I (i.e., the importation of the single shipment of marihuana).".
Reason for Amendment: The purpose of this amendment is to clarify the definition of
conduct for which the defendant is "otherwise accountable."
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1989.
79. Amendment: Section 1B1.5 is amended by deleting "adjustments for" immediately following
"all applicable", and by inserting "and cross references" immediately before the period at the
end of the sentence.
The Commentary to §1B1.5 captioned "Application Note" is amended in Note 1 by inserting
"and cross references" immediately before "as well as the base offense level".
Reason for Amendment: The purpose of this amendment is to clarify the guideline and
commentary.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1989.
80. Amendment: The Commentary to §1B1.5 captioned "Application Note" is amended in Note
1 by deleting the last sentence as follows: "If the victim was vulnerable, the adjustment from
§3A1.1 (Vulnerable Victim) also would apply.".
Reason for Amendment: The purpose of this amendment is to delete an unnecessary sentence.
No substantive change is made.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1989.
81. Amendment: Section 1B1.9 is amended in the title by deleting "Petty Offenses" and inserting
in lieu thereof "Class B or C Misdemeanors and Infractions".
November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment 81
– 39 –
Section 1B1.9 is amended by deleting "(petty offense)" immediately following "infraction".
The Commentary to §1B1.9 captioned "Application Notes is amended in the first sentence of
Note 1 by deleting "petty offense" and inserting in lieu thereof "Class B or C misdemeanor or
an infraction", in the second sentence of Note 1 by deleting "A petty offense is any offense for
which the maximum sentence that may be imposed does not exceed six months’ imprisonment."
and inserting in lieu thereof "A Class B misdemeanor is any offense for which the maximum
authorized term of imprisonment is more than thirty days but not more than six months; a Class
C misdemeanor is any offense for which the maximum authorized term of imprisonment is
more than five days but not more than thirty days; an infraction is any offense for which the
maximum authorized term of imprisonment is not more than five days.", in the first sentence
of Note 2 by deleting "petty offenses" and inserting in lieu thereof "Class B or C misdemeanors
or infractions", in the second sentence of Note 2 by deleting "petty" and inserting in lieu thereof
"such", in the third sentence of Note 2 by deleting "petty offense" and inserting in lieu thereof
"Class B or C misdemeanor or infraction" and, in Note 3 by deleting:
"3. All other provisions of the guidelines should be disregarded to the extent that they
purport to cover petty offenses.".
The Commentary to §1B1.9 captioned "Background" is amended by deleting:
"voted to adopt a temporary amendment to exempt all petty offenses from the coverage
of the guidelines. Consequently, to the extent that some published guidelines may appear
to cover petty offenses, they should be disregarded even if they appear in the Statutory
Index",
and inserting in lieu thereof:
"exempted all Class B and C misdemeanors and infractions from the coverage of the
guidelines".
Reason for Amendment: The purposes of this amendment are to conform the guideline to a
revision in the statutory definition of a petty offense, and to convert the wording of the
Commission’s emergency amendment at §1B1.9 (effective June 15, 1988) to that appropriate
for a permanent amendment. Section 7089 of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 revises the
definition of a petty offense so that it no longer exactly corresponds with a Class B or C
misdemeanor or infraction. Under the revised definition, a Class B or C misdemeanor or
infraction that has an authorized fine of more than $5,000 for an individual (or more than
$10,000 for an organization) will not be a petty offense. This legislative revision does not
affect the maximum terms of imprisonment authorized. The maximum authorized term of
imprisonment remains controlled by the grade of the offense (i.e., the maximum term of
imprisonment remains five days for an infraction, thirty days for a Class C misdemeanor, and
six months for a Class B misdemeanor). Because the statutory grade of the offense (i.e., a Class
B or C misdemeanor or an infraction) is the more relevant definition for guideline purposes, this
amendment deletes the references in §1B1.9 to "petty offenses" and in lieu thereof inserts
references to "Class B and C misdemeanors and infractions."
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1989.
Amendment 81 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003
– 40 –
82. Amendment: The Commentary to §2A1.1 captioned "Statutory Provision" is amended by
deleting "Provision" and inserting in lieu thereof "Provisions", and by inserting "; 21 U.S.C.
§ 848(e)" at the end immediately before the period.
The Commentary to §2A1.1 captioned "Application Note" is amended in the caption by
deleting "Note" and inserting in lieu thereof "Notes", and by inserting the following additional
note:
"2. If the defendant is convicted under 21 U.S.C. § 848(e), a sentence of death may
be imposed under the specific provisions contained in that statute. This guideline
applies when a sentence of death is not imposed.".
The Commentary to §2A1.1 captioned "Background" is amended by deleting "statute" and
inserting in lieu thereof "18 U.S.C. § 1111", and by inserting immediately after the first
sentence:
"Prior to the applicability of the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, a defendant convicted
under this statute and sentenced to life imprisonment could be paroled (see 18 U.S.C. §
4205(a)). Because of the abolition of parole by that Act, the language of 18 U.S.C. §
1111(b) (which was not amended by the Act) appears on its face to provide a mandatory
minimum sentence of life imprisonment for this offense. Other provisions of the Act,
however, classify this offense as a Class A felony (see 18 U.S.C. § 3559(a)(1)), for which
a term of imprisonment of any period of time is authorized as an alternative to
imprisonment for the duration of the defendant’s life (see 18 U.S.C. §§ 3559(b),
3581(b)(1), as amended); hence, the relevance of the discussion in Application Note 1,
supra, regarding circumstances in which a sentence less than life may be appropriate for
a conviction under this statute."
The Commentary to §2A1.1 captioned "Background" is amended by inserting the following
additional paragraph at the end:
" The maximum penalty authorized under 21 U.S.C. § 848(e) is death or life
imprisonment. If a term of imprisonment is imposed, the statutorily required minimum
term is twenty years.".
Reason for Amendment: The purpose of this amendment is to incorporate new first-degree
murder offenses created by Section 7001 of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 where the death
penalty is not imposed. This amendment also clarifies the existing commentary to this
guideline.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1989.
83. Amendment: Section 2A2.1 is amended in subsection (b)(2)(B) by deleting "a firearm or a
dangerous weapon" and inserting in lieu thereof "a dangerous weapon (including a firearm)",
and in subsection (b)(2)(C) by deleting "a firearm or other dangerous weapon" and inserting in
lieu thereof "a dangerous weapon (including a firearm)".
November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment 85

deleting "Notes" and inserting in lieu thereof "Note", and by deleting:
"2. If the degree of bodily injury falls between two injury categories, use of the
intervening level (i.e., interpolation) is appropriate."
Reason for Amendment: The purpose of this amendment is to provide intermediate
adjustment levels for the degree of bodily injury.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1989.
85. Amendment: Section 2A2.2 is amended in subsection (b)(2)(B) by deleting "a firearm or a
dangerous weapon" and inserting in lieu thereof "a dangerous weapon (including a firearm)",
and in subsection (b)(2)(C) by deleting "a firearm or other dangerous weapon" and inserting in
lieu thereof "a dangerous weapon (including a firearm)".
Reason for Amendment: The purposes of this amendment are to clarify that a firearm is a
type of dangerous weapon and to remove the inconsistency in language between specific
offense characteristic subdivisions (b)(2)(B) and (b)(2)(C).
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1989.
86. Amendment: Section 2A2.2(b)(3) is amended by inserting the following additional
subdivisions:

possessed and its use was threatened".
The Commentary to §2A2.3 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by deleting:
"2. ‘Striking, beating, or wounding’ means conduct sufficient to violate 18 U.S.C.
§ 113(d).",
and inserting in lieu thereof:
"2. Definitions of ‘firearm’ and ‘dangerous weapon’ are found in the Commentary
to §1B1.1 (Application Instructions).".
The Commentary to §2A2.3 captioned "Background" is amended by deleting the last sentence
as follows: "The distinction for striking, beating, or wounding reflects the statutory distinction
found in 18 U.S.C. § 113(d) and (e).".
Reason for Amendment: The purpose of this amendment is to provide a clearer standard by
replacing the phrase "striking, wounding, or beating" (a statutory phrase dealing with a petty
offense) with "physical contact." The amendment also provides an enhanced offense level for
the case in which a weapon is possessed and its use is threatened.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1989.
88. Amendment: The Commentary to §2A2.3 captioned "Statutory Provisions" is amended by
deleting "113(d), 113(e),".

offenses.

to §1B1.1 (Application Instructions).".
Reason for Amendment: The purpose of this amendment is to provide a clearer standard by
replacing the phrase "striking, wounding, or beating" (a statutory phrase dealing with a petty
offense) with "physical contact." The amendment also provides an enhanced offense level for
the case in which a weapon is possessed and its use is threatened.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1989.
91. Amendment: Section 2A3.1(b)(1) is amended by deleting:
"criminal sexual abuse was accomplished as defined in 18 U.S.C. § 2241",
and inserting in lieu thereof:

by deleting the parenthesis immediately before the period at the end of the Note, and by
inserting the following additional sentence at the end of the Note:
"This provision would apply, for example, where any dangerous weapon was used,
brandished, or displayed to intimidate the victim.".

1. ‘Accomplished as defined in 18 U.S.C. § 2241’ means accomplished by force,
threat, or other means as defined in 18 U.S.C. § 2241(a) or (b) (i.e., by using

any person will be subject to death, serious bodily injury, or kidnapping; by
rendering the victim unconscious; or by administering by force or threat of force,
or without the knowledge or permission of the victim, a drug, intoxicant, or other
similar substance and thereby substantially impairing the ability of the victim to

kidnapping); or when the victim is incapable of appraising the nature of the
conduct or physically incapable of declining participation in, or communicating

Background: This section covers abusive sexual contact not amounting to criminal
sexual abuse (criminal sexual abuse is covered under §2A3.1-3.3). Enhancements are
Amendment 95 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003
– 46 –
provided for the use of force or threats. The maximum term of imprisonment authorized

Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1989.
96. Amendment: Section 2A4.1(b)(2) is amended by inserting immediately before the period at
the end of the sentence: "; or (C) if the degree of injury is between that specified in

Reason for Amendment: The purposes of this amendment are to conform the theft and fraud
loss tables to the tax evasion table in order to remove an unintended inconsistency between
these tables in cases where the amount is greater than $40,000, to increase the offense levels
for larger losses to provide additional deterrence and better reflect the seriousness of the
conduct, and to eliminate minor gaps in the loss table.
Amendment 99 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003
– 48 –
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1989.
100. Amendment: Section 2B1.1(b)(6) is amended by deleting "organized criminal activity" and
inserting in lieu thereof "an organized scheme to steal vehicles or vehicle parts".
The Commentary to §2B1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by deleting:
"8. ‘Organized criminal activity’ refers to operations such as car theft rings or ‘chop
shops,’ where the scope of the activity is clearly significant.",
and inserting in lieu thereof:
"8. Subsection (b)(6), referring to an ‘organized scheme to steal vehicles or vehicle
parts,’ provides an alternative minimum measure of loss in the case of an
ongoing, sophisticated operation such as an auto theft ring or ‘chop shop.’
‘Vehicles’ refers to all forms of vehicles, including aircraft and watercraft.".
The Commentary to §2B1.1 captioned "Background" is amended in the last paragraph by
deleting:
"A minimum offense level of 14 is provided for organized criminal activity, i.e.,
operations such as car theft rings or ‘chop shops,’ where the scope of the activity is
clearly significant but difficult to estimate. The guideline is structured so that if reliable
information enables the court to estimate a volume of property loss that would result in
a higher offense level, the higher offense level would govern.",
and inserting in lieu thereof:
"A minimum offense level of 14 is provided for offenses involving an organized scheme
to steal vehicles or vehicle parts. Typically, the scope of such activity is substantial (i.e.,
the value of the stolen property, combined with an enhancement for ‘more than minimal
planning’ would itself result in an offense level of at least 14), but the value of the
property is particularly difficult to ascertain in individual cases because the stolen
property is rapidly resold or otherwise disposed of in the course of the offense.
Therefore, the specific offense characteristic of ‘organized scheme’ is used as an
alternative to ‘loss’ in setting the offense level.".
Reason for Amendment: The purpose of this amendment is to clarify the coverage of a
specific offense characteristic.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1989.
101. Amendment: The Commentary to §2B1.1 captioned "Background" is amended in the first

guideline would apply, depending upon whether the defendant stole the
property.",

Reason for Amendment: The purpose of this amendment is to clarify the nature of the cases
to which this guideline applies.

by the addressee or his agent (e.g., it includes mail that is in the addressee’s mail
box).".

The Commentary to §2B3.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by deleting:
"2. Pursuant to the last sentence of §2B3.1(b)(1), robbery or attempted robbery of a
bank or post office results in a minimum one-level enhancement. There is no
special enhancement for banks and post offices if the loss exceeds $10,000,
however.",
and inserting in lieu thereof:
November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment 110
– 53 –
"2. When an object that appeared to be a dangerous weapon was brandished,
displayed, or possessed, treat the object as a dangerous weapon for the purposes
of subsection (b)(2)(C).".
The Commentary to §2B3.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by inserting the
following additional note:
"8. An ‘express threat of death,’ as used in subsection (b)(2)(D), may be in the form
of an oral or written statement, act, gesture, or combination thereof. For example,
an oral or written demand using words such as ‘Give me the money or I will kill
you’, ‘Give me the money or I will pull the pin on the grenade I have in my
pocket’, ‘Give me the money or I will shoot you’, ‘Give me your money or else
(where the defendant draws his hand across his throat in a slashing motion)’, or
‘Give me the money or you are dead’ would constitute an express threat of death.
The court should consider that the intent of the underlying provision is to provide
an increased offense level for cases in which the offender(s) engaged in conduct
that would instill in a reasonable person, who is a victim of the offense,
significantly greater fear than that necessary to constitute an element of the
offense of robbery.".
The Commentary to §2B3.1 captioned "Background" is amended in the first paragraph by
deleting the third sentence as follows:
"Banks and post offices carry a minimum 1 level enhancement for property loss because
such institutions generally have more cash readily available, and whether the defendant
obtains more or less than $2,500 is largely fortuitous.".
Reason for Amendment: The purposes of this amendment are to increase the offense level
for robbery to better reflect the seriousness of the offense and past practice, to provide an
increased enhancement for the robbery of the property of a financial institution or post office,
to provide an enhancement for an express threat of death, and to provide that an object that
appeared to be a dangerous weapon is to be treated as a dangerous weapon for the purposes of
subsection (b)(2)(C).
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1989.
111. Amendment: Section 2B3.1(b)(3) is amended by inserting the following additional
subdivisions:
"(D) If the degree of injury is between that specified in subdivisions (A) and (B), add
3 levels; or
(E) If the degree of injury is between that specified in subdivisions (B) and (C), add
5 levels.".
The Commentary to §2B3.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by deleting:
"4. If the degree of bodily injury falls between two injury categories, use of the
Amendment 110 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003
– 54 –
intervening level (i.e., interpolation) is appropriate.",
and by renumbering Notes 5-8 as 4-7, respectively.

adjustment levels for the degree of bodily injury.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1989.
112. Amendment: Section 2B3.2 is amended in subsection (b)(2)(B) by deleting "a firearm or a
dangerous weapon" and inserting in lieu thereof "a dangerous weapon (including a firearm)",
and in subsection (b)(2)(C) by deleting "a firearm or other dangerous weapon" and inserting in
lieu thereof "a dangerous weapon (including a firearm)".
Reason for Amendment: The purposes of this amendment are to clarify that a firearm is a
type of dangerous weapon and to remove the inconsistency in language between specific
offense characteristic subdivisions (b)(2)(B) and (b)(2)(C).
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1989.
113. Amendment: Section 2B3.2(b)(3) is amended by inserting the following additional
subdivisions:
"(D) If the degree of injury is between that specified in subdivisions (A) and (B), add
3 levels; or

adjustment levels for the degree of bodily injury.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1989.
114. Amendment: Section 2B3.3(b) is amended by deleting "Characteristics" and inserting in lieu
thereof "Characteristic".
Reason for Amendment: The purpose of this amendment is to correct a clerical error.
November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment 121
– 55 –
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1989.
115. Amendment: Section 2B5.1 is amended in the title by inserting "Bearer" immediately before
"Obligations".
The Commentary to §2B5.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by renumbering Note
2 as Note 3, and by inserting the following new note 2:
"2. ‘Counterfeit,’ as used in this section, means an instrument that purports to be
genuine but is not, because it has been falsely made or manufactured in its
entirety. Offenses involving genuine instruments that have been altered are
covered under §2B5.2.".
The Commentary to §2B5.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in the renumbered Note
3 by deleting ", paste corners of notes on notes of a different denomination," immediately
before "or otherwise produce".
Reason for Amendment: The purpose of this amendment is to clarify the coverage and
operation of this guideline. The amendment revises the title of §2B5.1 to make the coverage
of the guideline clear from the title, and adopts the definition of "counterfeit" used in 18 U.S.C.
§ 513. "Altered" obligations (e.g., the corner of a note of one denomination pasted on a note
of a different denomination) are covered under §2B5.2.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1989.
116. Amendment: Section 2B5.2 is amended in the title by inserting "Altered or" immediately
following "Involving" and by inserting "Counterfeit Bearer" immediately following "Other
than".
Reason for Amendment: The purpose of this amendment is to clarify the coverage of this
guideline.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1989.
117. Amendment: Section 2B6.1(b) is amended by renumbering subsection (b)(2) as (b)(3) and
inserting the following new subsection (b)(2):
"(2) If the defendant was in the business of receiving and selling stolen property,
increase by 2 levels.".
Reason for Amendment: The purpose of this amendment is to resolve an inconsistency
between this section and §2B1.2 created by the lack of an enhancement in this section for a
person in the business of selling stolen property. This amendment eliminates this inconsistency
by adding a 2-level increase if the defendant was in the business of selling stolen property.
Two levels rather than four levels is the applicable increase to conform to §2B1.2 because the
base offense level of §2B6.1 already incorporates the adjustment for more than minimal

planning.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1989.

activity" and inserting in lieu thereof "an organized scheme to steal vehicles or vehicle parts,

"1. See Commentary to §2B1.1 (Larceny, Embezzlement, and other Forms of Theft)
regarding the adjustment in subsection (b)(2) for organized criminal activity, such
as car theft rings and ‘chop shop’ operations.",
and inserting in lieu thereof:
"1. Subsection (b)(3), referring to an ‘organized scheme to steal vehicles or vehicle
parts, or to receive stolen vehicles or vehicle parts,’ provides an alternative
minimum measure of loss in the case of an ongoing, sophisticated operation such
as an auto theft ring or ‘chop shop.’ ‘Vehicles’ refers to all forms of vehicles,
including aircraft and watercraft. See Commentary to §2B1.1 (Larceny,
Embezzlement, and Other Forms of Theft).".
Reason for Amendment: The purpose of this amendment is to clarify the coverage of a
specific offense characteristic.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1989.
119. Amendment: Section 2B6.1(b) is amended by deleting "Characteristic" and inserting in lieu
thereof "Characteristics".
The Commentary to §2B6.1 captioned "Statutory Provisions" and "Background" is amended
by deleting "2320" wherever it appears and inserting in lieu thereof in each instance "2321".
Reason for Amendment: The purpose of this amendment is to correct clerical errors.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1989.
120. Amendment: Section 2C1.1(b)(1) is amended by deleting "action received" and inserting in
lieu thereof "benefit received, or to be received,".
The Commentary to §2C1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 2 in the first
sentence by deleting "action received" and inserting in lieu thereof "benefit received, or to be
received,", and by deleting "action (i.e., benefit or favor)" and inserting in lieu thereof "benefit";
in the second sentence by deleting "action received in return" and inserting in lieu thereof
"benefit received or to be received", and by deleting "such action" and inserting in lieu thereof
"such benefit"; and in the third sentence by deleting "action" and inserting in lieu thereof
"benefit".
November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment 123
– 57 –
Reason for Amendment: The purpose of this amendment is to clarify the guideline and
commentary.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1989.
121. Amendment: Section 2C1.1(b) is amended by deleting "(1)" and "(2)" and inserting in lieu
thereof "(A)" and "(B)" respectively; and by deleting "Apply the greater" and inserting in lieu
thereof:
"(1) If the offense involved more than one bribe, increase by 2 levels.
(2) (If more than one applies, use the greater):".
The Commentary to §2C1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by deleting the text of
Note 6 as follows:
"When multiple counts are involved, each bribe is to be treated as a separate, unrelated
offense not subject to §3D1.2(d) or §3D1.3(b). Instead, apply §3D1.4. However, if a
defendant makes several payments as part of a single bribe, that is to be treated as a
single bribery offense involving the total amount of the bribe.",
and inserting in lieu thereof:
"Related payments that, in essence, constitute a single bribe (e.g., a number of
installment payments for a single action) are to be treated as a single bribe, even if
charged in separate counts.".
Section 2C1.2(b) is amended by deleting "(1)" and "(2)" and inserting in lieu thereof "(A)" and
"(B)" respectively; and by deleting "Apply the greater" and inserting in lieu thereof:
"(1) If the offense involved more than one gratuity, increase by 2 levels.
(2) (If more than one applies, use the greater):".
The Commentary to §2C1.2 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by deleting the text of
Note 4 as follows:
"When multiple counts of receiving a gratuity are involved, each count is to be treated
as a separate, unrelated offense not subject to §3D1.2(d) or §3D1.3(b). Instead, apply
§3D1.4.",
and inserting in lieu thereof:
"Related payments that, in essence, constitute a single gratuity (e.g., separate payments
for airfare and hotel for a single vacation trip) are to be treated as a single gratuity, even
if charged in separate counts.".
Section 3D1.2(d) is amended in the listing of offense sections in the third paragraph by deleting
Amendment 121 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003
– 58 –
"§2C1.1,", and in the listing of offense sections in the second paragraph by inserting in order
by section number "§§2C1.1, 2C1.2;".
The Introductory Commentary to Chapter Three, Part D, is amended in the fifth paragraph by
deleting ", robbery, and bribery" and inserting in lieu thereof "and robbery", and in the seventh
paragraph by deleting ", robbery, or bribery" and inserting in lieu thereof "or robbery".
Under the current bribery guideline, there is no enhancement for repeated instances of bribery
if the conduct involves the same course of conduct or common scheme or plan and the same
victim (as frequently is the case where the government is the victim) because such cases are
grouped under §3D1.2(b). In contrast, the fraud and theft guidelines generally provide a 2-level
increase in cases of repeated instances under the second prong of the "more than minimal
planning" definition.
Unlike the theft and fraud guidelines, it is arguable that the value of any bribe that was part of
the same course of conduct or a common scheme or plan as the offense of conviction, but not
included in the count of conviction, is excluded from consideration. This is because
§1B1.3(a)(2), which authorizes consideration of conduct not expressly included in the offense
of conviction but part of the same course of conduct or common scheme or plan, applies only
to offenses grouped under §3D1.2(d). Thus, if the defendant pleads to one count of a bribery
offense involving one $10,000 bribe in satisfaction of a 15 count indictment involving an
additional $80,000 in separate bribes that were part of the same course of conduct, the current
bribery guideline, unlike the theft and fraud guidelines, would not take into account the
additional $80,000, and there would be no increase for repeated instances.
The current guideline may also create various anomalies because the multiple count rule (which
applies only where the offenses are not grouped under §3D1.2(b)) increases the offense level
differently than the monetary table. For example, an elected public official who takes three
unrelated $200 bribes has an offense level of 21; the same defendant who took two unrelated
$500,000 bribes would have an offense level of 20.
Reason for Amendment: The purpose of this amendment is to address the above noted issues.
A specific offense characteristic is added to provide a 2-level increase where the offense
involved more than one bribe or gratuity. In addition, such offenses will be grouped under
§3D1.2(d) which allows for aggregation of the amount of the bribes from the same course of
conduct or common scheme or plan under §1B1.3(a)(2) (as in theft and fraud offenses).
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1989.
122. Amendment: The Commentary to §2C1.1 captioned "Background" is amended in the eighth
paragraph by deleting "extortions, conspiracies, and attempts" and inserting in lieu thereof
"extortion, or attempted extortion,".
Reason for Amendment: The purpose of this amendment is to correct a technical error. This
section expressly covers extortion and attempted extortion; conspiracy is covered through the
operation of §2X1.1.
November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment 123
– 59 –
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1989.
123. Amendment: Section 2D1.1(a) is amended by deleting:
"(a) Base Offense Level:
(1) 43, for an offense that results in death or serious bodily injury with a prior
conviction for a similar drug offense; or
(2) 38, for an offense that results in death or serious bodily injury and
involved controlled substances (except Schedule III, IV, and V controlled
substances and less than: (A) fifty kilograms of marihuana,
(B) ten kilograms of hashish, and (C) one kilogram of hashish oil); or
(3) For any other offense, the base offense level is the level specified in the
Drug Quantity Table below.",
and inserting in lieu thereof:
"(a) Base Offense Level (Apply the greatest):
(1) 43, if the defendant is convicted under 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(A),
(b)(1)(B), or (b)(1)(C), or 21 U.S.C. § 960(b)(1), (b)(2), or (b)(3), and the
offense of conviction establishes that death or serious bodily injury
resulted from the use of the substance and that the defendant committed
the offense after one or more prior convictions for a similar offense; or
(2) 38, if the defendant is convicted under 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(A),
(b)(1)(B), or (b)(1)(C), or 21 U.S.C. § 960(b)(1), (b)(2), or (b)(3), and the
offense of conviction establishes that death or serious bodily injury
resulted from the use of the substance; or
(3) the offense level specified in the Drug Quantity Table set forth in
subsection (c) below.".
The Commentary to §2D1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 1 by deleting
"‘Similar drug offense’ as used in §2D1.1(a)(1) means a prior conviction as described in
21 U.S.C. §§ 841(b) or 962(b).", and inserting in lieu thereof "‘Mixture or substance’ as used
in this guideline has the same meaning as in 21 U.S.C. § 841.".
Reason for Amendment: The purpose of this amendment is to provide that subsections (a)(1)
and (a)(2) apply only in the case of a conviction under circumstances specified in the statutes
cited. The amendment also clarifies that the term "mixture or substance" has the same meaning
as it has in the statute.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1989.
Amendment 123 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003
– 60 –
124. Amendment: Section 2D1.1(b) is amended by deleting "a firearm or other dangerous weapon"

*Unless otherwise specified, the weight of a controlled substance set forth in the table refers to the entire weight of any
mixture or substance containing a detectable amount of the controlled substance. If a mixture or substance contains more
than one controlled substance, the weight of the entire mixture or substance is assigned to the controlled substance that
results in the greater offense level. In the case of a mixture or substance containing PCP or methamphetamine, use the
offense level determined by the entire weight of the mixture or substance or the offense level determined by the weight
of the pure PCP or methamphetamine, whichever is greater.
In the case of an offense involving marihuana plants, if the offense involved (A) 50 or more marihuana plants, treat each
plant as equivalent to 1 KG of marihuana; (B) fewer than 50 marihuana plants, treat each plant as equivalent to 100 G of
marihuana. Provided, however, that if the actual weight of the marihuana is greater, use the actual weight of the
marihuana.".
The Commentary to §2D1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 9 by inserting
immediately before the period at the end of the first sentence of the first paragraph:
", except in the case of PCP or methamphetamine for which the guideline itself provides
for the consideration of purity (see the footnote to the Drug Quantity Table)",
and by deleting the second paragraph as follows:
"Congress provided an exception to purity considerations in the case of phencyclidine
(PCP). 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(A). The legislation designates amounts of pure PCP and
mixtures in establishing mandatory sentences. The first row of the table illustrates this
distinction as one kilogram of PCP or 100 grams of pure PCP. Allowance for higher
sentences based on purity is not appropriate for PCP.".
The Commentary to §2D1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in the first paragraph
of Note 10 by inserting "methamphetamine, fentanyl," immediately following "i.e., heroin,
cocaine, PCP," and by deleting:
"one gram of a substance containing methamphetamine, a Schedule I stimulant, is to be
treated as the equivalent of two grams of a substance containing cocaine in applying the
November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment 125

Drug Quantity Table.",
and inserting in lieu thereof:
"one gram of a substance containing oxymorphone, a Schedule I opiate, is to be treated
as the equivalent of five grams of a substance containing heroin in applying the Drug
Quantity Table.".
The Commentary to §2D1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 10, in the
subdivision of the "Drug Equivalency Tables" captioned "Cocaine and Other Schedule I & II
Stimulants" by deleting "2.0 gm. of cocaine/0.4 gm of heroin" immediately following "1 gm
of Methamphetamine =" and inserting in lieu thereof "5.0 gm of cocaine/1.0 gm of heroin", and
by deleting:
"1 gm of Phenylacetone/P2P

involved, but in no event less than level 13, for involving an
individual fourteen years of age or less; or
(2) Level from §2D1.1, corresponding to double the drug amount
involved, for involving an individual at least fifteen years of age
and less than eighteen years of age.
Commentary
Statutory Provision: 21 U.S.C. § 845b.
Application Notes:
1. If multiple drugs or offenses occur and all or some of them involve juveniles,
double or triple the drug amounts for those offenses involving juveniles before
totalling the amounts. For example, if there are three drug offenses of conviction
and only one involves juveniles in trafficking, add the amount from the first and
second offense, double the amount for the offense involving juveniles, and total.
Use that total to determine the base offense level.
2. The reference to the level from §2D1.1 includes the base offense level plus the
specific offense characteristic dealing with a weapon. Under §2D1.1(b)(1) there
is a 2-level increase for possession of a firearm or other dangerous weapon
during commission of the offense.
Amendment 135 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003
– 74 –
Background: The statute addressed by this section punishes any person eighteen years
of age or older who knowingly employs or uses any person younger than eighteen to
violate or to conceal any violation of any provision of Title 21. Section 845b provides
a minimum mandatory period of imprisonment of one year. An increased penalty for the
employment or use of persons fourteen years of age or younger reflects the enhanced
sentence authorized by 21 U.S.C. § 845b(d).
§2D1.3. Distributing Controlled Substances to Individuals Younger than Twenty-
One Years, To Pregnant Women, or Within 1000 Feet of a School or
College
(a) Base Offense Level:
(1) Level from §2D1.1, corresponding to double the drug
amount involved, but in no event less than level 13, for
distributing a controlled substance to a pregnant woman;
(2) (A) Level from §2D1.1, corresponding to double the
drug amount involved, but in no event less than
level 13, for distributing a controlled substance
other than five grams or less of marihuana to an
individual under the age of twenty-one years; or
(B) Level from §2D1.1, corresponding to double the
drug amount involved, but in no event less than
level 13, for distributing or manufacturing a
controlled substance other than five grams or
less of marihuana within 1000 feet of a
schoolyard.
Commentary
Statutory Provisions: 21 U.S.C. §§ 845, 845a.
Application Notes:
1. The provisions addressed by this section contain a mandatory minimum period
of imprisonment of one year. The base offense level is determined as in §2D1.2.
If both subsections (a)(1) and (a)(2) apply to a single distribution (e.g., the
distribution of 10 grams of a controlled substance to a pregnant woman under
twenty-one years of age), the enhancements are applied cumulatively, i.e., by
using four times rather than two times the amount distributed. However, only
one of the enhancements in §2D1.3(a)(2) shall apply in a given case.
2. If multiple drugs or offenses occur, determine the offense level as described in
the Commentary to §2D1.2.
3. The reference to the level from §2D1.1 includes the base offense level plus the
specific offense characteristic dealing with a weapon. Under §2D1.1(b)(1) there
is a 2-level increase for possession of a firearm, or other dangerous weapon
November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment 136
– 75 –
during the commission of the offense.
Background: The guideline sentences for distribution of controlled substances to
individuals under twenty-one years of age or within 1000 feet of a school or college treat
the distribution of less than five grams of marihuana less harshly than other controlled
substances. This distinction is based on the statutory provisions that specifically exempt
convictions for the distribution of less than five grams of marihuana from the mandatory
minimum one-year imprisonment requirement.".
A replacement guideline with accompanying commentary is inserted as §2D1.2 (Drug Offenses
Occurring Near Protected Locations or Involving Underage or Pregnant Individuals).
Reason for Amendment: The purposes of this amendment are to implement the directive in
Section 6454 of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988, and to expand the coverage of the guideline
to include the provision of Sections 6458 and 6459 of that Act. The amendment also covers
the provisions of 21 U.S.C. § 845, 845a, and 845b not included in the statutory direction to the
Commission.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1989.
136. Amendment: The Commentary to §2D1.4 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note
1 by deleting:
"Where the defendant was not reasonably capable of producing the negotiated amount,
the court may depart and impose a sentence lower than the sentence that would otherwise
result.",
and inserting in lieu thereof:
"However, where the court finds that the defendant did not intend to produce and was
not reasonably capable of producing the negotiated amount, the court shall exclude from
the guideline calculation the amount that it finds the defendant did not intend to produce
and was not reasonably capable of producing.".
Reason for Amendment: Application Note 1 currently provides that the "weight under
negotiation in an uncompleted distribution shall be used to calculate the applicable amount."
The instruction then provides "Where the defendant was not reasonably capable of producing
the negotiated amount the court may depart and impose a sentence lower than the sentence that
would otherwise result." This provision may result in inflated offense levels in uncompleted
offenses where a defendant is merely "puffing," even though the court is then authorized to
address the situation by a downward departure. The purpose of this amendment is to provide
a more direct procedure for calculating the offense level where the court finds that the
defendant did not intend to produce and was not reasonably capable of producing the
negotiated amount.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1989.
137. Amendment: The Commentary to §2D1.4 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note

or
(2) 38.".
The Commentary to §2D1.5 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 2 by deleting
"if the quantity of drugs substantially exceeds that required for level 36 in the drug quantity
table," immediately before "or if", and by deleting "is extremely" and inserting in lieu thereof
"was extremely".
The Commentary to §2D1.5 captioned "Background" is amended in the first paragraph by
deleting "base offense level of 36" and inserting in lieu thereof "minimum base offense level
of 38", and in the second paragraph by deleting "for second convictions" and inserting in lieu
thereof "for the first conviction, a 30-year minimum mandatory penalty for a second
conviction,".
Reason for Amendment: The purpose of this amendment is to reflect the increased mandatory
minimum penalty for this offense pursuant to Section 6481 of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of
1988.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1989.
140. Amendment: Chapter Two, Part D is amended by inserting an additional guideline with
accompanying commentary as §2D1.10 (Endangering Human Life While Illegally
Manufacturing a Controlled Substance).
Reason for Amendment: The purpose of this amendment is to create a guideline covering the
new offense in Section 6301 of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988.
November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment 142
– 77 –
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1989.
141. Amendment: Section 2D2.3 is amended by deleting : "(a) Base Offense Level: 8" and
inserting in lieu thereof:
"(a) Base Offense Level (Apply the greatest):
(1) 26, if death resulted; or
(2) 21, if serious bodily injury resulted; or
(3) 13, otherwise.
(b) Special Instruction:
(1) If the defendant is convicted of a single count involving the death or
serious bodily injury of more than one person, apply Chapter Three, Part
D (Multiple Counts) as if the defendant had been convicted of a separate
count for each such victim.".
The Commentary to §2D2.3 is amended by inserting at the end:
"Background: This section implements the direction to the Commission in Section 6482
of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988. Offenses covered by this guideline may vary
widely with regard to harm and risk of harm. The offense levels assume that the offense
involved the operation of a common carrier carrying a number of passengers, e.g., a bus.
If no or only a few passengers were placed at risk, a downward departure may be
warranted. If the offense resulted in the death or serious bodily injury of a large number
of persons, such that the resulting offense level under subsection (b) would not
adequately reflect the seriousness of the offense, an upward departure may be
warranted.".
Reason for Amendment: The purpose of this amendment is to implement the directive to the
Commission in Section 6482 of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988. In addition, the base
offense level under subsection (a)(3) is increased to reflect the seriousness of the offense.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1989.
142. Amendment: The Commentary to §2E1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by
inserting the following additional note:
"4. Certain conduct may be charged in the count of conviction as part of a ‘pattern
of racketeering activity’ even though the defendant has previously been
sentenced for that conduct. Where such previously imposed sentence resulted
from a conviction prior to the last overt act of the instant offense, treat as a prior
sentence under §4A1.2(a)(1) and not as part of the instant offense. This
treatment is designed to produce a result consistent with the distinction between
the instant offense and criminal history found throughout the guidelines. If this
treatment produces an anomalous result in a particular case, a guideline departure
may be warranted.".
Amendment 150 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003
– 78 –
Reason for Amendment: The purpose of this amendment is to clarify the treatment of certain
conduct for which the defendant previously has been sentenced as either part of the instant

Embezzlement, and Other Forms of Theft) corresponding to the loss.",
and inserting in lieu thereof:
"Apply §2B1.1 (Larceny, Embezzlement, and Other Forms of Theft).".
The Commentary to §2E5.4 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by deleting:
"1. ‘More than minimal planning’ is defined in the Commentary to §1B1.1
(Applicable Instructions). Valuation of loss is discussed in the Commentary to
§2B1.1 (Larceny, Embezzlement, and Other Forms of Theft).
2. If the adjustment for being a union officer or occupying a position of trust in a
union at §2E5.4(b)(2) is applied, do not apply the adjustment at §3B1.3 (Abuse
of a Position of Trust or Use of a Special Skill).",
and inserting in lieu thereof:
"1. In the case of a defendant who was a union officer or occupied a position of trust
in the union, as set forth in 29 U.S.C. § 501(a), an adjustment under §3B1.3
(Abuse of Position of Trust or Use of Special Skill) would apply.",
and by deleting in the caption "Notes" and inserting in lieu thereof "Note".
The Commentary to §2E5.4 captioned "Background" is amended by deleting the last sentence
as follows:

guidelines.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1989.
153. Amendment: Section 2E5.5(a)(2) is amended by deleting "false records were used for
criminal conversion of funds or a scheme" and inserting in lieu thereof "the offense was

embezzlement, or an offense involving a bribe or gratuity.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1989.
154. Amendment: Section 2F1.1(b)(1) is amended by deleting:
"Loss Increase in Level
(A) $2,000 or less no increase
(B) $2,001 - $5,000 add 1
(C) $5,001 - $10,000 add 2

(R) More than $40,000,000 add 17
(S) More than $80,000,000 add 18.".
Reason for Amendment: The purposes of this amendment are to conform the theft and fraud
loss tables to the tax evasion table in order to remove an unintended inconsistency between
these tables in cases where the amount is greater than $40,000, to increase the offense levels
for offenses with larger losses to provide additional deterrence and better reflect the seriousness
of the conduct, and to eliminate minor gaps in the loss table.
November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment 156
– 83 –
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1989.
155. Amendment: The Commentary to §2F1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended
beginning in Note 14 by deleting:
"In such instances, although §2F1.1 applies, a departure may be warranted.
15. In certain other cases, the mail or wire fraud statutes, or other relatively broad
statutes, are used primarily as jurisdictional bases for the prosecution of other
offenses. For example, a state law arson where a fraudulent insurance claim was
mailed might be prosecuted as mail fraud. In such cases the most analogous
guideline (in the above case, §2K1.4) is to be applied.",
and by inserting at the end of Note 14:
"In certain other cases, the mail or wire fraud statutes, or other relatively broad statutes,
are used primarily as jurisdictional bases for the prosecution of other offenses. For
example, a state arson offense where a fraudulent insurance claim was mailed might be
prosecuted as mail fraud. Where the indictment or information setting forth the count
of conviction (or a stipulation as described in §1B1.2(a)) establishes an offense more
aptly covered by another guideline, apply that guideline rather than §2F1.1. Otherwise,
in such cases, §2F1.1 is to be applied, but a departure from the guidelines may be
considered.".
The Commentary to §2F1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in the second sentence
of Note 14 by deleting "in which" and inserting in lieu thereof "for which".
Reason for Amendment: The purposes of this amendment are to ensure that this guideline
is interpreted in a manner consistent with §1B1.2 and to correct a clerical error.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1989.
156. Amendment: Section 2F1.1(b)(2) is amended by deleting "; (B)" and inserting in lieu thereof
", or (B)", and by deleting "; (C) a misrepresentation that the defendant was acting on behalf
of a charitable, educational, religious or political organization, or a government agency; or (D)
violation of any judicial or administrative order, injunction, decree or process; increase by 2
levels, but if the result is less than level 10, increase to level 10" and inserting in lieu thereof
", increase by 2 levels".
Section 2F1.1(b)(3) is renumbered as (b)(5), and the following are inserted as new subsections:
"(3) If the offense involved (A) a misrepresentation that the defendant was acting on
behalf of a charitable, educational, religious or political organization, or a
government agency, or (B) violation of any judicial or administrative order,
injunction, decree or process, increase by 2 levels. If the resulting offense level
is less than level 10, increase to level 10.
(4) If the offense involved the conscious or reckless risk of serious bodily injury,
increase by 2 levels. If the resulting offense level is less than level 13, increase

following "caused".

present", and by deleting the last sentence as follows:
"A number of special cases are specifically broken out under subdivision (b)(2) to ensure
that defendants in such cases are adequately punished.".
The Commentary to §2F1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by deleting:
"10. The adjustments for loss do not distinguish frauds involving losses greater than
$5,000,000. Departure above the applicable guideline may be warranted if the
loss substantially exceeds that amount.",
and by renumbering Notes 11-14 as 10-13 respectively.
The Commentary to §2F1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 1 by deleting
"(b)(2)" and inserting in lieu thereof "(b)(3)", by deleting "several" and inserting in lieu thereof
"both", and by deleting "upward" and inserting in lieu thereof "an upward".
Reason for Amendment: The purpose of this amendment is to reflect the instruction to the
Commission in Section 2(b) of the Major Fraud Act of 1988. The Commission has concluded
that a 2-level enhancement with a minimum offense level of 13 should apply to all fraud cases
involving a conscious or reckless risk of serious bodily injury. In addition, the amendment
divides former subsection (b)(2) into two separate specific offenses characteristics to better
reflect their separate nature.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1989.
157. Amendment: Section 2G1.1(b)(1) is amended by deleting "defendant used" and inserting in
lieu thereof "offense involved the use of", and by deleting "drugs or otherwise" and inserting

– 85 –
158. Amendment: Section 2G1.1 is amended by inserting the following additional subsection:

for the application of the multiple count rule in cases involving the transportation of more than
one person.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1989.

(1) If the offense involves the transportation of more than one person,
Chapter Three, Part D (Multiple Counts) shall be applied as if the
transportation of each person had been contained in a separate count of
conviction.".

for the application of the multiple count rule in cases involving the transportation of more than
one person.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1989.

lieu thereof "victim. Consequently, multiple counts involving the exploitation of different
Amendment 166 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003
– 86 –
minors are not to be grouped together under §3D1.2 (Groups of Closely-Related Counts).".
Reason for Amendment: The purpose of this amendment is to clarify that multiple counts
involving different minors are not grouped under §3D1.2.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1989.
162. Amendment: Chapter Two, Part G, is amended by inserting an additional guideline with
accompanying commentary as §2G2.3 (Selling or Buying of Children for Use in the Production
of Pornography).
Reason for Amendment: The purpose of this amendment is to create a guideline covering the
new offense in Section 7512 of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1989.
163. Amendment: The Commentary to §2G3.1 captioned "Statutory Provisions" is amended by
deleting "§§1461-1465" and inserting in lieu thereof "§§1460-1463, 1465-1466".
Reason for Amendment: The purposes of this amendment are to conform the Statutory
Provisions to the revision of §2G3.2 and to make them more comprehensive.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1989.
164. Amendment: Chapter Two, Part G is amended by deleting §2G3.2 in its entirety as follows:
"§2G3.2. Obscene or Indecent Telephone Communications
(a) Base Offense Level: 6
Commentary
Statutory Provision: 47 U.S.C. § 223.
Background: This offense is a misdemeanor for which the maximum term of
imprisonment authorized by statute is six months.".
A replacement guideline with accompanying commentary is inserted as §2G3.2 (Obscene
Telephone Communications for a Commercial Purpose; Broadcasting Obscene Material).
Reason for Amendment: The purposes of this amendment are to delete a guideline covering
a petty offense; and to insert a guideline covering felony offenses, including two offenses
created by Sections 7523 and 7524 of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1989.
165. Amendment: The title to §2H1.3 is amended by inserting at the end "; Damage to Religious
Real Property".
November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment 166
– 87 –
The Commentary to §2H1.3 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 3 by deleting
"the adjustment at" immediately before "§3B1.3".
The Commentary to §2H1.3 captioned "Background" is amended in the third sentence by
deleting "injury occurs, ten years if injury occurs," and inserting in lieu thereof "bodily injury
results, ten years if bodily injury results".
The Commentary to §2H1.3 captioned "Statutory Provisions" is amended by deleting
"18 U.S.C. § 245" and inserting in lieu thereof "18 U.S.C. §§ 245, 247".
Reason for Amendment: The purposes of this amendment are to include a recently enacted
offense (18 U.S.C. § 247) expressly in the title of this guideline and to make editorial
improvements.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1989.
166. Amendment: Section 2H1.4(a)(2) is amended by deleting "2 plus" and inserting in lieu thereof
"6 plus".
The Commentary to §2H1.4 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 1 by deleting
"2 plus" and inserting in lieu thereof "6 plus", and by deleting "is defined" and inserting in lieu
thereof "means 6 levels above the offense level for any underlying criminal conduct. See the
discussion".
The Commentary to §2H1.4 captioned "Background" is amended in the first paragraph by
deleting ", except where death results, in which case the maximum term of imprisonment
authorized is life imprisonment" and inserting in lieu there of "if no bodily injury results, ten
years if bodily injury results, and life imprisonment if death results", by deleting "Given this
one-year statutory maximum, a" and inserting in lieu thereof "A", by inserting "one-year"
immediately following "near the", and by inserting "or bodily injury" immediately following
"resulting in death".
The Commentary to §2H1.4 captioned "Background" is amended by inserting the following
sentences at the end of the first paragraph:
"The 6-level increase under subsection (a)(2) reflects the 2-level increase that is applied
to other offenses covered in this Part plus a 4-level increase for the commission of the
offense under actual or purported legal authority. This 4-level increase is inherent in the
base offense level of 10 under subsection (a)(1).".
Reason for Amendment: The purpose of this amendment is to correct an anomaly between
the offense level under this section and §2H1.5 when the offense level is determined under
subsection (a)(2). Section 2H1.4 is similar to §2H1.5 in that it may or may not involve the use
of force. Under §2H1.4, however, the offense must involve the abuse of actual or purported
legal authority. The base offense level of 10 used in 2H1.4(a)(1) has a built-in 4-level
enhancement (which corresponds to the base offense level of 6 under §2H1.5(a)(1) plus the 4-
level increase for a public official). There is an anomaly, however, when the base offense level
from (a)(2) is used. In such cases, §2H1.4 results in an offense level that is 4 levels less than
Amendment 170 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003
– 88 –
§2H1.5 when the offense is committed by a public official. The Commentary to §2H1.4 is also
amended to reflect the increase in the maximum authorized sentence from one to ten years in
cases involving bodily injury.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1989.
167. Amendment: The Commentary to §2H1.5 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note
1 by deleting "explained" and inserting in lieu thereof "defined".
The Commentary to §2H1.5 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 2 by deleting
"§2H1.4(b)(1)" and inserting in lieu thereof "§2H1.5(b)(1)", and by deleting "the adjustment
at" immediately before "§3B1.3".
Reason for Amendment: The purposes of this amendment are to correct a clerical error and
to make editorial improvements.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1989.
168. Amendment: Section 2H2.1(a)(1) is amended by deleting "persons" and inserting in lieu
thereof "person(s)".
The Commentary to §2H2.1 captioned "Background" is amended by deleting "Specific offense
characteristics" and inserting in lieu thereof "Alternative base offense levels".
Reason for Amendment: The purpose of this amendment is to correct two clerical errors.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1989.
169. Amendment: Section 2H3.1 is amended by deleting:
"(a) Base Offense Level (Apply the greater):
(1) 9; or
(2) If the purpose of the conduct was to facilitate another offense, apply the
guideline applicable to an attempt to commit that offense.
(b) Specific Offense Characteristic
(1) If the purpose of the conduct was to obtain direct or indirect commercial
advantage or economic gain not covered by §2H3.1(a)(2) above, increase
by 3 levels.",
and inserting in lieu thereof:
"(a) Base Offense Level: 9
(b) Specific Offense Characteristic
November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment 170
– 89 –
(1) If the purpose of the conduct was to obtain direct or indirect commercial
advantage or economic gain, increase by 3 levels.
(c) Cross Reference
(1) If the purpose of the conduct was to facilitate another offense, apply the
guideline applicable to an attempt to commit that offense, if the resulting
offense level is greater than that determined above.".
Reason for Amendment: The purpose of this amendment is to correct an anomaly in §2H3.1.
Currently, specific offense characteristic (b)(1) applies only to base offense level (a)(1).
Consequently, conduct facilitating an offense for economic gain of level 8 or 9 would result
in a greater offense level (11 or 12) than conduct facilitating a more serious (level 10 or 11)
offense.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1989.
170. Amendment: Section 2J1.1 is amended by deleting:
"If the defendant was adjudged guilty of contempt, the court shall impose a sentence
based on stated reasons and the purposes of sentencing set forth in 18 U.S.C.
§ 3553(a)(2).",
and inserting in lieu thereof:
"Apply §2X5.1 (Other Offenses).".
The Commentary to §2J1.1 captioned "Application Note" is amended in Note 1 by deleting
"See, however, §2X5.1 (Other Offenses)." and inserting in lieu thereof "In certain cases, the
offense conduct will be sufficiently analogous to §2J1.2 (Obstruction of Justice) for that
guideline to apply.".
Reason for Amendment: This section is designated as a guideline, but it is not a guideline
contemplated by the Sentencing Reform Act. The purpose of this amendment is to clarify the
Commission’s original intent by referencing this section to §2X5.1 (Other Offenses).
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1989.
171. Amendment: The Commentary to §2J1.1 captioned "Statutory Provisions" is amended by
deleting "Provisions" and inserting in lieu thereof "Provision", and by deleting "§" and ", 402".
Reason for Amendment: The purpose of this amendment is to delete a reference to a petty
offense.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1989.
172. Amendment: Section 2J1.2(b)(1) is amended by deleting "defendant obstructed or attempted
to obstruct the administration of justice by" and inserting in lieu thereof "offense involved", and
by deleting "or property," and inserting in lieu thereof ", or property damage, in order to
Amendment 176 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003
– 90 –
obstruct the administration of justice".
Section 2J1.2(b)(2) is amended by deleting "defendant substantially interfered" and inserting
in lieu thereof "offense resulted in substantial interference".
Section 2J1.2(c)(1) is amended by deleting "conduct was" and inserting in lieu thereof "offense
involved", and by deleting "such" and inserting in lieu thereof "that".
The Commentary to §2J1.2 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 1 by deleting
"‘Substantially interfered" and inserting in lieu thereof "‘Substantial interference", and by
deleting "offense conduct resulting in" immediately before "a premature".
Reason for Amendment: The purposes of this amendment are to clarify the guideline and to
ensure that an attempted obstruction is not excluded from subsection (c) because of the non-
parallel language between (b)(1) and (c)(1).
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1989.
173. Amendment: The Commentary to §2J1.2 captioned "Statutory Provisions" is amended by
deleting "1503-" and inserting in lieu thereof "1503, 1505-".
Reason for Amendment: The purpose of this amendment is to delete a reference to a petty
offense.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1989.
174. Amendment: The Commentary to §2J1.2 captioned "Statutory Provisions" is amended by
inserting ", 1516" immediately following "1513".
Reason for Amendment: The purpose of this amendment is to expand the coverage of an
existing guideline to include a new offense (Obstruction of a Federal Audit) created by Section
7078 of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1989.
175. Amendment: Section 2J1.3 is amended in the caption by inserting "or Subornation of Perjury"
immediately following "Perjury".
Section 2J1.3(b)(1) is amended by deleting "defendant suborned perjury by" and inserting in
lieu thereof "offense involved", and by deleting "or property" and inserting in lieu thereof ",
or property damage, in order to suborn perjury".
Section 2J1.3(b)(2) is amended by deleting "defendant’s" immediately following "If the", and
by deleting "substantially interfered" and inserting in lieu thereof "resulted in substantial
interference".
Section 2J1.3(c)(1) is amended by deleting "conduct was perjury" and inserting in lieu thereof
"offense involved perjury or subornation of perjury", and by deleting "such" and inserting in
lieu thereof "that".
November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment 176
– 91 –
The Commentary to §2J1.3 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 1 by deleting
"‘Substantially interfered" and inserting in lieu thereof "‘Substantial interference", and by
deleting "offense conduct resulting in" immediately before "a premature".
Reason for Amendment: The purposes of this amendment are to clarify the guideline and to
ensure that subornation of perjury is not excluded from subsection (c) due to a lack of parallel
wording in the subsections.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1989.
176. Amendment: Section 2J1.4(b)(1) is amended by deleting:
"If the defendant falsely represented himself as a federal officer, agent or employee to
demand or obtain any money, paper, document, or other thing of value or to conduct an
unlawful arrest or search, increase by 6 levels.",
and inserting in lieu thereof:
"If the impersonation was committed for the purpose of conducting an unlawful arrest,
detention, or search, increase by 6 levels.".
Section 2J1.4 is amended by inserting the following additional subsection:
"(c) Cross Reference
(1) If the impersonation was to facilitate another offense, apply the guideline
for an attempt to commit that offense, if the resulting offense level is
greater than the offense level determined above.".
Reason for Amendment: The purpose of this amendment is to relate the offense levels more
directly to the underlying offense where the impersonation is committed for the purpose of
facilitating another offense.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1989.
177. Amendment: Section 2J1.5(b)(1) is amended by deleting "substantially interfered" and

deleting "offense conduct resulting in" immediately before "a premature".
Reason for Amendment: The purpose of this amendment is to clarify the guideline.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1989.
178. Amendment: Chapter Two, Part J is amended by deleting §2J1.7 in its entirety as follows:
Amendment 179 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003
– 92 –
"§2J1.7. Commission of Offense While on Release
(a) Base Offense Level: 6
(b) Specific Offense Characteristics
(1) If the offense committed while on release is punishable
by death or imprisonment for a term of fifteen years or
more, increase by 6 levels.
(2) If the offense committed while on release is punishable
by a term of imprisonment of five or more years, but less
than fifteen years, increase by 4 levels.
(3) If the offense committed while on release is a felony
punishable by a maximum term of less than five years,
increase by 2 levels.
Commentary
Statutory Provision: 18 U.S.C. § 3147.
Application Notes:
1. This guideline applies whenever a sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3147 is
imposed.
2. By statute, a term of imprisonment imposed for a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 3147
runs consecutively to any other term of imprisonment. Consequently, a sentence
for such a violation is exempt from grouping under the multiple count rules. See
§3D1.2.
Background: Because defendants convicted under this section will generally have a
prior criminal history, the guideline sentences provided are greater than they otherwise
might appear.".
A replacement guideline with accompanying commentary is inserted as §2J1.7 (Commission
of Offense While on Release).
Reason for Amendment: The purpose of this amendment is to reflect the fact that 18 U.S.C.
§ 3147 is an enhancement provision, not a distinct offense. Created in 1984 as part of the
Comprehensive Crime Control Act, the statute contained interim provisions (mandatory
consecutive sentences that were subject to the parole and good time provisions of prior law)
that were to be in effect until the sentencing guidelines took effect. The Senate Report to
S.1762 indicates that the mandatory nature of the interim provisions was to be eliminated when
the sentencing guidelines took effect ("Section 213(h) [220(g) of the CCCA of 1984] amends
the new provision in title I of this Act relating to consecutive enhanced penalties for
committing an offense while on release (new 18 U.S.C. § 3147)) by eliminating the mandatory

nature of the penalties in favor of utilizing sentencing guidelines" (Senate Report 98-225 at
186). The statute, as amended, however, did not actually eliminate all language referring to
mandatory penalties. A mandatory consecutive term of imprisonment is required but, unlike
other mandatory provisions, there is no minimum required.
The amendment converts this section into an offense level adjustment for the offense
committed while on release, a treatment that is considerably more consistent with the treatment
of other offense/offender characteristics.

Statutory Provisions: 18 U.S.C. § 922(a)(1), (a)(3), (a)(4), (a)(6), (e), (f), (g), (h), (i), (j),
(k), (l), (n), and (o); 26 U.S.C. § 5861(b), (c), (d), (h), (i), (j), and (k).
Application Notes:
1. The definition of ‘firearm’ used in this section is that set forth in 18 U.S.C.
§ 921(a)(3) (if the defendant is convicted under 18 U.S.C. § 922) and 26 U.S.C.
§ 5845(a) (if the defendant is convicted under 26 U.S.C. § 5861). These
definitions are somewhat broader than that used in Application Note 1(e) of the
Commentary to §1B1.1 (Application Instructions). Under 18 U.S.C. § 921(a)(3),
the term ‘firearm’ means (A) any weapon (including a starter gun) which will or
is designed to or may readily be converted to expel a projectile by the action of
Amendment 189 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003

an explosive; (B) the frame or receiver of any such weapon; (C) any firearm
muffler or firearm silencer; or (D) any destructive device. Under 26 U.S.C. §
5845(a), the term ‘firearm’ includes a shotgun, or a weapon made from a shotgun,
with a barrel or barrels of less than 18 inches in length; a weapon made from a
shotgun or rifle with an overall length of less than 26 inches; a rifle, or weapon
made from a rifle, with a barrel or barrels less than 16 inches in length; a machine
gun; a muffler or silencer for a firearm; a destructive device; and certain other
large bore weapons.
2. Under §2K2.1(b)(1), intended lawful use, as determined by the surrounding
circumstances, provides a decrease in the offense level. Relevant circumstances
include, among others, the number and type of firearms (sawed-off shotguns, for
example, have few legitimate uses) and ammunition, the location and
circumstances of possession, the nature of the defendant’s criminal history (e.g.,
whether involving firearms), and the extent to which possession was restricted by
local law.".

Commentary
November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment 189
– 99 –
Statutory Provisions: 26 U.S.C. §§ 5861(b) through (l).
Application Notes:
1. Under §2K2.2(b)(3), intended lawful use, as determined by the surrounding
circumstances, provides a decrease in offense level. Relevant circumstances
include, among others, the number and type of firearms (sawed-off shotguns, for
example, have few legitimate uses) and ammunition, the location and
circumstances of possession, the nature of the defendant’s criminal history (e.g.,
whether involving firearms), and the extent to which possession is restricted by
local law.
2. Subsection (c)(1) refers to any situation in which the defendant possessed a
firearm to facilitate another offense that he committed or attempted.
Background: 26 U.S.C. § 5861 prohibits the unlicensed receipt, possession,
transportation, or manufacture of certain firearms, such as machine guns, silencers, rifles
and shotguns with shortened barrels, and destructive devices. As with §2K2.1, there is
considerable variation in the conduct included under this statutory provision and some
violations may be relatively technical.
§2K2.3. Prohibited Transactions in or Shipment of Firearms and Other Weapons
(a) Base Offense Level:
(1) 12, if convicted under 26 U.S.C. § 5861; or
(2) 6, otherwise.
(b) Specific Offense Characteristics
(1) If the number of firearms unlawfully dealt in exceeded 5,
increase as follows:
Number of Firearms Increase in Level
(A) 6 - 10 add 1
(B) 11 - 20 add 2
(C) 21 - 50 add 3
(D) 51 - 100 add 4
(E) 101 - 200 add 5
(F) more than 200 add 6
(2) If any of the following applies, use the greatest:
(A) If the defendant knew or had reason to believe
that a purchaser was a person prohibited by
federal law from owning the firearm, increase by
2 levels.
Amendment 189 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003
– 100 –
(B) If the defendant knew or had reason to believe
that a purchaser resided in another state in which
he was prohibited from owning the firearm,
increase by 1 level.
(C) If the defendant knew or had reason to believe
that a firearm was stolen or had an altered or
obliterated serial number, increase by 1 level.
(c) Cross Reference
(1) If the defendant provided the firearm to another for the
purpose of committing another offense, or knowing that
he planned to use it in committing another offense, apply
§2X1.1 (Attempt or Conspiracy) in respect to such other
offense, if the resulting offense level is higher.
Commentary
Statutory Provisions: 18 U.S.C. § 922 (a)(1), (a)(5), (b)(2), (b)(3), (d), (i), (j), (k), (l);
26 U.S.C. § 5861(a).
Background: This section applies to a variety of offenses involving prohibited
transactions in or transportation of firearms and certain other weapons.".
A replacement guideline with accompanying commentary is inserted as §2K2.2 (Unlawful
Trafficking and Other Prohibited Transactions Involving Firearms).
Chapter Two, Part K, Subpart 2 is amended by inserting an additional guideline with
accompanying commentary as §2K2.3 (Receiving, Transporting, Shipping or Transferring a
Firearm or Ammunition With Intent to Commit Another Offense, or With Knowledge that It
Will Be Used in Committing Another Offense).
Reason for Amendment: This amendment addresses a number of diverse substantive and
technical issues, as well as the creation of several new offenses, and increased statutory
maximum penalties for certain other offenses. Because there exist a large number of
overlapping statutory provisions, the three basic guidelines, §2K2.1 (Possession by a prohibited
person), §2K2.2 (Possession of certain types of weapons), and §2K2.3 (Unlawful trafficking)
are not closely tied to the actual conduct. The amendment addresses this issue by consolidating
the current three guidelines into two guidelines: (1) unlawful possession, receipt, or
transportation, and (2) unlawful trafficking; and by more carefully drawing the distinctions
between the base offense levels provided. The third guideline in this amendment is a new
guideline to address transfer of a weapon with intent or knowledge that it will be used to
commit another offense (formerly covered in a cross reference) and a new offense added by the
Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 (Section 6211)(Interstate travel to acquire a firearm for a criminal
purpose).
The base offense level for conduct covered by the current §2K2.1 is increased in the
November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment 190
– 101 –
amendment from 9 to 12. The statutorily authorized maximum sentence for the conduct
covered under §2K2.1 was increased from five to ten years by the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of
1988 (Section 6462). Note, however, that the most aggravated conduct under §2K2.1
(possession of a weapon during commission of another offense) is handled by the cross-
reference at subsection (c) and is based upon the offense level for an attempt to commit the
underlying offense. See Background Commentary to current §2K2.1. The offense level for
unlawful possession of a machine gun, sawed off shotgun, or destructive device is increased
from 12 to 16. In addition, the amendment raises the enhancement for stolen weapons or
obliterated serial numbers from 1 to 2 levels to better reflect the seriousness of this conduct.
The numbers currently used in the table for the distribution of multiple weapons in §2K2.2 are
amended to increase the offense level more rapidly for sale of multiple weapons.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1989.
190. Amendment: Section 2K2.4 is amended by deleting "penalties are those" and inserting in lieu
thereof "term of imprisonment is that".
The Commentary to §2K2.4 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by inserting the
following additional note:
"3. Imposition of a term of supervised release is governed by the provisions of
§5D1.1 (Imposition of a Term of Supervised Release).".
Section 2K2.4 is amended by inserting "(a)" immediately before "If", and by inserting the
following additional subsection:
"(b) Special Instructions for Fines
(1) Where there is a federal conviction for the underlying offense, the fine
guideline shall be the fine guideline that would have been applicable had
there only been a conviction for the underlying offense. This guideline
shall be used as a consolidated fine guideline for both the underlying
offense and the conviction underlying this section.".
The Commentary to §2K2.4 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by inserting the
following additional note:
"4. Subsection (b) sets forth special provisions concerning the imposition of fines.
Where there is also a conviction for the underlying offense, a consolidated fine
guideline is determined by the offense level that would have applied to the
underlying offense absent a conviction under 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) or 929(a). This
is because the offense level for the underlying offense may be reduced when
there is also a conviction under 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) or 929(a) in that any specific
offense characteristic for possession, use, or discharge of a firearm is not applied
(see Application Note 2). The Commission has not established a fine guideline
range for the unusual case in which there is no conviction for the underlying
offense.".
Reason for Amendment: The purpose of this amendment is to address the imposition of a fine
or term of supervised release when this guideline applies.
Amendment 190 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003
– 102 –
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1989.
191. Amendment: Chapter Two, Part K is amended by inserting an additional guideline with
accompanying commentary as §2K2.5 (Possession of Firearms and Dangerous Weapons in
Federal Facilities).
Reason for Amendment: The purpose of this amendment is to reflect a new offense enacted
by Section 6215 of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988. A base offense level of 6 is provided for
the misdemeanor portion of this statute. The felony portion of this statute (possession with
intent to commit another offense) is treated as if an attempt to commit that other offense.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1989.
192. Amendment: Section 2L1.1(b) is amended by inserting the following additional subsection:
"(3) If the defendant is an unlawful alien who has been deported (voluntarily or
involuntarily) on one or more occasions prior to the instant offense, and the
offense level determined above is less than level 8, increase to level 8.".
The Commentary to §2L1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 6 by deleting
"enhancement at §2L1.1(b)(1) does not apply" and inserting in lieu thereof "reduction at
§2L1.1(b)(1) applies".
Reason for Amendment: The purposes of this amendment are to provide an offense level that
is no less than that provided under §2L1.2 in the case of a defendant who is a previously
deported alien, and to conform Application Note 6 of the Commentary to §2L1.1 to the January
1988 revision of §2L1.1.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1989.
193. Amendment: Section 2L1.2 is amended by inserting the following additional subsection:
"(b) Specific Offense Characteristic
(1) If the defendant previously was deported after sustaining a conviction for
a felony, other than a felony involving violation of the immigration laws,
increase by 4 levels.",
The Commentary to §2L1.2 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by inserting the
following additional notes:
"3. A 4-level increase is provided under subsection (b)(1) in the case of a defendant
who was previously deported after sustaining a conviction for a felony, other than
a felony involving a violation of the immigration laws. In the case of a defendant
previously deported after sustaining a conviction for an aggravated felony as
defined in 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a), or for any other violent felony, an upward
departure may be warranted.
4. The adjustment under §2L1.2(b)(1) is in addition to any criminal history points
added for such conviction in Chapter 4, Part A (Criminal History).".
November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment 195
– 103 –
Reason for Amendment: The purpose of this amendment is to add a specific offense
characteristic to provide an increase in the case of an alien previously deported after conviction
of a felony other than an immigration law violation. This specific offense characteristic is in
addition to, and not in lieu of, criminal history points added for the prior sentence. The
amendment provides for consideration of an upward departure where the previous deportation
was for an "aggravated felony" or for any other violent felony.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1989.
194. Amendment: Chapter Two, Part L, Subpart 1 is amended by deleting §2L1.3 in its entirety as
follows:
"§2L1.3. Engaging in a Pattern of Unlawful Employment of Aliens

Commentary
Statutory Provision: 8 U.S.C. § 1324a(f)(1).
Background: The offense covered under this section is a misdemeanor for which the
maximum term of imprisonment authorized by statute is six months.".
Reason for Amendment: The purpose of this amendment is to delete a guideline applying
only to a petty offense. Petty offenses were deleted from coverage of the guidelines by the
adoption of §1B1.9 (effective June 15, 1988).
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1989.
195. Amendment: Section 2L2.1(a) is amended by deleting "6" and inserting in lieu thereof "9".
Section 2L2.1(b)(1) is amended by deleting "for profit, increase by 3 levels" and inserting in
lieu thereof "other than for profit, decrease by 3 levels".

guideline to that of §2L1.1.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1989.

(1) If the defendant is an unlawful alien who has been deported (voluntarily
or involuntarily) on one or more occasions prior to the instant offense,

"(b) If more than one vehicle was involved, apply §2F1.1 (Offenses Involving Fraud
or Deceit).",
November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment 201
– 105 –
and inserting in lieu thereof:
"(b) Cross Reference
(1) If the offense involved more than one vehicle, apply §2F1.1 (Fraud and
Deceit).".
Reason for Amendment: The purposes of this amendment are to correct a clerical error and
to conform the phraseology of this subsection to that used elsewhere in the guidelines.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1989.
200. Amendment: Section 2P1.1(a) is amended by deleting:
"(1) 13, if from lawful custody resulting from a conviction or as a result of a lawful
arrest for a felony;
(2) 8, if from lawful custody awaiting extradition, pursuant to designation as a
recalcitrant witness or as a result of a lawful arrest for a misdemeanor.",
and inserting in lieu thereof:
"(1) 13, if the custody or confinement is by virtue of an arrest on a charge of felony,
or conviction of any offense;
(2) 8, otherwise.".
Reason for Amendment: The purpose of this amendment is to clarify the language of the
guideline by making it conform more closely to that used in 18 U.S.C. § 751, the statute from
which it was derived.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1989.
201. Amendment: Section 2P1.1(b)(3) is amended by deleting:
"If the defendant committed the offense while a correctional officer or other employee
of the Department of Justice, increase by 2 levels.",
and inserting in lieu thereof:
"If the defendant was a law enforcement or correctional officer or employee, or an
employee of the Department of Justice, at the time of the offense, increase by 2 levels.".
Reason for Amendment: The current specific offense characteristic (b)(3) applies only to
correctional officers or Justice Department employees, and not to local or state law enforcement
officers who might have custody of a federal prisoner, or even to federal law enforcement
officers who are not employed by the Department of Justice (e.g., Secret Service agents are
employed by the Treasury Department). It also does not appear to apply to law enforcement
or correctional employees who are not sworn officers unless they are Justice Department
employees. The purpose of this amendment is to correct this anomaly.

Subsection (b)(1) applies if the defendant knew or believed the funds were
criminally derived property. Subsection (b)(1) applies in addition to, and not in
lieu of, subsection (a)(1)(C). Where subsection (b)(1) applies, subsection
(a)(1)(C) also will apply. It is possible that a defendant ‘believed’ or ‘reasonably
should have believed’ that the funds were criminally derived property even if, in
fact, the funds were not so derived (e.g., in a ‘sting’ operation where the
defendant is told the funds were derived from the unlawful sale of controlled
substances).".

"The base offense level is set at 13 for the great majority of cases. However, the base

level is increased by 5 levels if the defendant knew that the funds were criminally
derived.",
and inserting in lieu thereof:
"A base offense level of 13 is provided for those offenses where the defendant
either structured the transaction to evade reporting requirements, made false
statements to conceal or disguise the activity, or reasonably should have believed
that the funds were criminally derived property. A lower alternative base offense
level of 5 is provided in all other cases. The Commission anticipates that such
November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment 219
– 113 –
cases will involve simple recordkeeping or other more minor technical violations
of the regulatory scheme governing certain monetary transactions committed by
defendants who reasonably believe that the funds at issue emanated from
legitimate sources.
Where the defendant actually knew or believed that the funds were criminally derived
property, subsection (b)(1) provides for a 5 level increase in the offense level.".

"Although the definition of tax loss corresponds to what is commonly called the
‘criminal deficiency,’ its amount is to be determined by the same rules applicable in

approach adopted by the guidelines, tax losses resulting from more than one year are to
be added whether or not the defendant is convicted of multiple counts.",
and inserting in lieu thereof:
"In determining the total tax loss attributable to the offense (see §1B1.3(a)(2)), all
conduct violating the tax laws should be considered as part of the same course of conduct
or common scheme or plan unless the evidence demonstrates that the conduct is clearly
Amendment 224 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003

course of conduct or common scheme or plan: (a) there is a continuing pattern of
violations of the tax laws by the defendant; (b) the defendant uses a consistent method
to evade or camouflage income, e.g., backdating documents or using off-shore accounts;

specific source of income, e.g., interest from savings accounts or income from a
particular business activity. These examples are not intended to be exhaustive.".

such instances, the court should impose a sentence above the guideline. A

seriousness of the conduct, and to eliminate minor gaps in the table.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1989.
238. Amendment: Section 2X1.1(b)(1) is amended by deleting "or solicitation" immediately
following "If an attempt".

"(3) If a solicitation, and the statute treats solicitation identically with the object of the
offense, do not apply §2X1.1(b)(1); i.e., the offense level for solicitation is the

or aid the offense completed all the acts he believed necessary for
successful completion of the object offense or the circumstances

control.
(B) If the statute treats solicitation of the offense identically with the object offense,
do not apply subdivision (A) above; i.e., the offense level for solicitation is the
same as that for the object offense.".

to clarify the treatment of such cases in a manner consistent with the treatment of attempts and
conspiracies.

"4. In certain cases, the participants may have completed (or have been about to
complete but for apprehension or interruption) all of the acts necessary for the
successful completion of part, but not all, of the intended offense. In such cases,
the offense level for the count (or group of closely-related multiple counts) is
whichever of the following is greater: the offense level for the intended offense
minus 3 levels (under §2X1.1(b)(1), (b)(2), or (b)(3)(A)), or the offense level for
the part of the offense for which the necessary acts were completed (or about to
be completed but for apprehension or interruption). For example, where the
intended offense was the theft of $800,000 but the participants completed (or
were about to complete) only the acts necessary to steal $30,000, the offense
level is the offense level for the theft of $800,000 minus 3 levels, or the offense
level for the theft of $30,000, whichever is greater.
In the case of multiple counts that are not closely-related counts, whether the 3-
level reduction under §2X1.1(b)(1) or (2) applies is determined separately for

assaulted such officer in a manner creating a substantial risk of serious bodily injury,
increase by 3 levels.".
The Commentary to §3A1.2 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by inserting the
following additional notes:
"4. ‘Motivated by such status’ in subdivision (a) means that the offense of conviction
was motivated by the fact that the victim was a law enforcement or corrections
officer or other person covered under 18 U.S.C. § 1114, or a member of the
immediate family thereof. This adjustment would not apply, for example, where
both the defendant and victim were employed by the same government agency
and the offense was motivated by a personal dispute.
5. Subdivision (b) applies in circumstances tantamount to aggravated assault against
November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment 247
– 125 –
a law enforcement or corrections officer, committed in the course of, or in
immediate flight following, another offense, such as bank robbery. While this
subdivision may apply in connection with a variety of offenses that are not by
nature targeted against official victims, its applicability is limited to assaultive
conduct against law enforcement or corrections officers that is sufficiently serious
to create at least a ‘substantial risk of serious bodily injury’ and that is proximate
in time to the commission of the offense.
6. The phrase ‘substantial risk of serious bodily injury’ in subdivision (b) is a
threshold level of harm that includes any more serious injury that was risked, as
well as actual serious bodily injury (or more serious harm) if it occurs.".

252. Amendment: The Commentary to §3C1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note
4 by deleting:
", except in determining the combined offense level as specified in Chapter Three, Part
D (Multiple Counts). Under §3D1.2(e), a count for obstruction will be grouped with the
count for the underlying offense. Ordinarily, the offense level for that Group of Closely
Related Counts will be the offense level for the underlying offense, as increased by the
2-level adjustment specified by this section. In some instances, however, the offense
level for the obstruction offense may be higher, in which case that will be the offense
level for the Group. See §3D1.3(a). In cases in which a significant further obstruction
occurred during the investigation or prosecution of an obstruction offense itself (one of
the above listed offenses), an upward departure may be warranted (e.g., where a witness
to an obstruction offense is threatened during the course of the prosecution for the
obstruction offense).",
and inserting in lieu thereof:
"to the offense level for that offense except where a significant further obstruction
occurred during the investigation or prosecution of the obstruction offense itself (e.g.,
where the defendant threatened a witness during the course of the prosecution for the
obstruction offense). Where the defendant is convicted both of the obstruction offense
and the underlying offense, the count for the obstruction offense will be grouped with the
count for the underlying offense under subsection (c) of §3D1.2 (Groups of Closely-
Related Counts). The offense level for that Group of Closely-Related Counts will be the
offense level for the underlying offense increased by the 2-level adjustment specified by
this section, or the offense level for the obstruction offense, whichever is greater.".

deleting:
"4. An adjustment under this section is not warranted where a defendant perjures
himself, suborns perjury, or otherwise obstructs the trial or the administration of
justice (see §3C1.1), regardless of other factors.",

November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment 262
– 129 –
"4. Conduct resulting in an enhancement under §3C1.1 (Willfully Obstructing or

(ii) is burglary of a dwelling, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives,
or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of
physical injury to another".
Section 4B1.2(2) is amended by deleting "as used in this provision" immediately before
"means", and by deleting "identified in 21 U.S.C. §§841, 845(b), 856, 952(a), 955, 955(a), 959;
and similar offenses" and inserting in lieu thereof:
"under a federal or state law prohibiting the manufacture, import, export, or distribution
of a controlled substance (or a counterfeit substance) or the possession of a controlled
substance (or a counterfeit substance) with intent to manufacture, import, export, or
Amendment 268 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003
– 132 –
distribute".
The Commentary to §4B1.2 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by deleting:
"1. ‘Crime of violence’ is defined in 18 U.S.C. § 16 to mean an offense that has as
an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the
person or property of another, or any other offense that is a felony and that by its
nature involves a substantial risk that physical force against the person or
property of another may be used in committing the offense. The Commission
interprets this as follows: murder, manslaughter, kidnapping, aggravated assault,
extortionate extension of credit, forcible sex offenses, arson, or robbery are
covered by this provision. Other offenses are covered only if the conduct for
which the defendant was specifically convicted meets the above definition. For
example, conviction for an escape accomplished by force or threat of injury
would be covered; conviction for an escape by stealth would not be covered.
Conviction for burglary of a dwelling would be covered; conviction for burglary
of other structures would not be covered.
2. ‘Controlled substance offense’ includes any federal or state offense that is
substantially similar to any of those listed in subsection (2) of the guideline.
These offenses include manufacturing, importing, distributing, dispensing, or
possessing with intent to manufacture, import, distribute, or dispense, a controlled
substance (or a counterfeit substance). This definition also includes aiding and
abetting, conspiring, or attempting to commit such offenses, and other offenses
that are substantially equivalent to the offenses listed.",
and inserting in lieu thereof:
"1. The terms ‘crime of violence’ and ‘controlled substance offense’ include the
offenses of aiding and abetting, conspiring, and attempting to commit such
offenses.
2. ‘Crime of violence’ includes murder, manslaughter, kidnapping, aggravated
assault, forcible sex offenses, robbery, arson, extortion, extortionate extension of
credit, and burglary of a dwelling. Other offenses are included where (A) that
offense has as an element the use attempted use, or threatened use, of physical
force against the person of another, or (B) the conduct set forth in the count of
which the defendant was convicted involved use of explosives or, by its nature,
presented a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.".
The caption of §4B1.2 is amended by deleting "Definitions" and inserting in lieu thereof
"Definitions of Terms Used in Section 4B1.1".
The Commentary to §4B1.2 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 4 by deleting
"§4A1.2(e) (Applicable Time Period), §4A1.2(h) (Foreign Sentences), and §4A1.2(j)
(Expunged Convictions)" and inserting in lieu thereof "§4A1.2 (Definitions and Instructions
for Computing Criminal History)", and by deleting the last sentence as follows: "Also
applicable is the Commentary to §4A1.2 pertaining to invalid convictions.".
Reason for Amendment: The purpose of this amendment is to clarify the definitions of crime
November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment 270
– 133 –
of violence and controlled substance offense used in this guideline. The definition of crime of
violence used in this amendment is derived from 18 U.S.C. § 924(e). In addition, the
amendment clarifies that all pertinent definitions and instructions in §4A1.2 apply to this
section.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1989.
269. Amendment: Section 4B1.3 is amended by deleting "from which he derived a substantial
portion of his income" and inserting in lieu thereof "engaged in as a livelihood".
The Commentary to §4B1.3 captioned "Application Note" is amended by deleting "Note" and
inserting in lieu thereof "Notes", and by inserting the following additional note:
"2. ‘Engaged in as a livelihood’ means that (1) the defendant derived income from
the pattern of criminal conduct that in any twelve-month period exceeded 2,000
times the then existing hourly minimum wage under federal law (currently 2,000
times the hourly minimum wage under federal law is $6,700); and (2) the totality
of circumstances shows that such criminal conduct was the defendant’s primary
occupation in that twelve-month period (e.g., the defendant engaged in criminal
conduct rather than regular, legitimate employment; or the defendant’s legitimate
employment was merely a front for his criminal conduct).".
The Commentary to §4B1.3 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 1 by deleting
the last sentence as follows: "This guideline is not intended to apply to minor offenses.".
The Commentary to §4B1.3 captioned "Background" is amended by deleting "proportion" and
inserting in lieu thereof "portion".
Reason for Amendment: The purpose of this amendment is to provide a better definition of
the intended scope of this enhancement. Compare, for example, United States v. Kerr, 686 F.
Supp. 1174 (W.D. Penn. 1988) with United States v. Rivera, 694 F. Supp. 1105 (S.D.N.Y.
1988). The first prong of the definition in application Note 2 above is derived from former 18
U.S.C. § 3575, the provision from which the statutory instruction underlying this guideline (28
U.S.C. § 994 (i)(2)) was itself derived.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1989.
270. Amendment: Chapter Five, Part A, is amended in the Sentencing Table by deleting "0-1, 0-2,
0-3, 0-4, and 0-5" wherever it appears, and inserting in each instance "0-6".
Chapter Five, Part A, is amended in the Sentencing Table by inserting "(in months of
imprisonment)" immediately under the title "Sentencing Table", by inserting "(Criminal History
Points)" immediately following the caption "Criminal History Category", and by enclosing in
parentheses each of the six sets of criminal history points displayed under that caption.
Reason for Amendment: This amendment provides that the maximum of the guideline range
is six months wherever the minimum of the guideline range is zero months. The court has
discretion to impose a sentence of up to 6 months imprisonment for a Class B misdemeanor
(Class B or C misdemeanors and infractions are not covered by the guidelines; see §1B1.9).
It appears anomalous that the Commission guidelines allow less discretion for certain felonies
Amendment 270 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003
– 134 –
and Class A misdemeanors. In fact, in certain cases, a plea to a reduced charge of a Class B
misdemeanor could result in a higher potential sentence because the sentence for the felony or
Class A misdemeanor might be restricted to less than 6 months by the guidelines. This can
happen when the Sentencing Table provides a guideline range of 0-1 month, 0-2 months, 0-3,
0-4, or 0-5 months. These very narrow ranges are not required by statute, which allows a 6
month guideline range in such cases. This anomaly is removed by amending the guideline table
to provide that whenever the lower limit of the guideline range is 0 months, the upper limit of
the guideline range is six months.
In addition, this amendment makes minor editorial improvements to the title and caption of the
Sentencing Table.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1989.
271. Amendment: Section 5B1.4(b)(20) is amended by inserting ", but only as a substitute for
imprisonment" immediately following "release".
Section 5C2.1(c)(2) is amended by deleting "or community confinement" and inserting in lieu
thereof ", community confinement, or home detention".
Section 5C2.1(c)(3) is amended by inserting "or home detention" immediately following
"community confinement".
Section 5C2.1(d)(2) is amended by inserting "or home detention" immediately following
"community confinement".
Section 5C2.1(e) is amended by inserting the following additional subdivision:
"(3) One day of home detention for one day of imprisonment.",
and by deleting the period at the end of subsection (e)(2) and inserting a semicolon in lieu
thereof.
The Commentary to §5C2.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in the first sentence of
the second subparagraph of Note 3 by deleting "intermittent confinement or community
confinement, or combination of intermittent and community confinement," and inserting in lieu
thereof "intermittent confinement, community confinement, or home detention, or combination
of intermittent confinement, community confinement, and home detention,".
The Commentary to §5C2.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in the second sentence
of the second subparagraph of Note 3 by deleting "intermittent or community confinement" and
inserting in lieu thereof "intermittent confinement, community confinement, or home
detention".
The Commentary to §5C2.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in the third
subparagraph of Note 3 by inserting "or home detention" immediately following "community
confinement", wherever the latter appears.
The Commentary to §5C2.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in the last paragraph
of Note 3 by inserting "or home detention" immediately following "community confinement",
November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment 271
– 135 –
wherever the latter appears.
The Commentary to §5C2.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 4 by inserting
"or home detention" immediately following "community confinement", wherever the latter
appears.
The Commentary to §5C2.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 5 by deleting
the last sentence as follows: "Home detention may not be substituted for imprisonment.".
Section 5F5.2 is amended by inserting ", but only as a substitute for imprisonment" immediately
following "release".
The Commentary to §5F5.2 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 1 by deleting:
"‘Home detention’ means a program of confinement and supervision that restricts the
defendant to his place of residence continuously, or during specified hours, enforced by
appropriate means of surveillance by the probation office. The judge may also impose
other conditions of probation or supervised release appropriate to effectuate home
detention. If the confinement is only during specified hours, the defendant shall engage
exclusively in gainful employment, community service or treatment during the non-
residential hours.",
and inserting in lieu thereof:
"‘Home detention’ means a program of confinement and supervision that restricts the
defendant to his place of residence continuously, except for authorized absences,
enforced by appropriate means of surveillance by the probation office. When an order
of home detention is imposed, the defendant is required to be in his place of residence
at all times except for approved absences for gainful employment, community service,
religious services, medical care, educational or training programs, and such other times
as may be specifically authorized. Electronic monitoring is an appropriate means of
surveillance and ordinarily should be used in connection with home detention. However,
alternative means of surveillance may be used so long as they are as effective as
electronic monitoring.".
The Commentary to §5F5.2 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 2 by deleting:
"Home detention generally should not be imposed for a period in excess of six months.
However, a longer term may be appropriate for disabled, elderly or extremely ill
defendants who would otherwise be imprisoned.",
and inserting in lieu thereof:
"The court may impose other conditions of probation or supervised release appropriate
to effectuate home detention. If the court concludes that the amenities available in the
residence of a defendant would cause home detention not to be sufficiently punitive, the
court may limit the amenities available.".
The Commentary to §5F5.2 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by inserting the
following additional note:
Amendment 271 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003
– 136 –
"3. The defendant’s place of residence, for purposes of home detention, need not be
the place where the defendant previously resided. It may be any place of
residence, so long as the owner of the residence (and any other person(s) from
whom consent is necessary) agrees to any conditions that may be imposed by the
court, e.g., conditions that a monitoring system be installed, that there will be no
‘call forwarding’ or ‘call waiting’ services, or that there will be no cordless
telephones or answering machines.".
The Commentary to §5F5.2 is amended by inserting at the end:
"Background: The Commission has concluded that the surveillance necessary for
effective use of home detention ordinarily requires electronic monitoring. However, in
some cases home detention may effectively be enforced without electronic monitoring,
e.g., when the defendant is physically incapacitated, or where some other effective means
of surveillance is available. Accordingly, the Commission has not required that
electronic monitoring be a necessary condition for home detention. Nevertheless, before
ordering home detention without electronic monitoring, the court should be confident
that an alternative form of surveillance will be equally effective.
In the usual case, the Commission assumes that a condition requiring that the
defendant seek and maintain gainful employment will be imposed when home detention
is ordered.".
Section 5B1.1(a)(2) is amended by deleting "or community confinement" and inserting in lieu
thereof ", community confinement, or home detention".
The Commentary to §5B1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 1 by inserting
", home detention," immediately after "community confinement" wherever the latter appears.
Chapter One, Part A, section 4(d) is amended in the third sentence of the third paragraph by
deleting "or intermittent confinement" and inserting in lieu thereof ", intermittent confinement,
or home detention", and in the fourth sentence of the third paragraph by inserting "or home
detention" immediately following "of community confinement".
Reason for Amendment: The purpose of this amendment is to conform the guidelines with
Section 7305 of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1989.
272. Amendment: Section 5B1.4(b) is amended by inserting the following additional paragraph at
the end:
"(25) Curfew
If the court concludes that restricting the defendant to his place of residence
during evening and nighttime hours is necessary to provide just punishment for
the offense, to protect the public from crimes that the defendant might commit
during those hours, or to assist in the rehabilitation of the defendant, a condition
of curfew is recommended. Electronic monitoring may be used as a means of
surveillance to ensure compliance with a curfew order.".
November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment 274
– 137 –
Section 5B1.4 is amended by inserting the following commentary:
"Commentary
Application Note:
1. Home detention, as defined by §5F5.2, may only be used as a substitute for
imprisonment. See §5C2.1 (Imposition of a Term of Imprisonment). Under
home detention, the defendant, with specified exceptions, is restricted to his place
of residence during all non-working hours. Curfew, which limits the defendant
to his place of residence during evening and nighttime hours, is less restrictive
than home detention and may be imposed as a condition of probation whether or
not imprisonment could have been ordered.".
Reason for Amendment: The purposes of this amendment are to set forth the conditions under
which curfew is a recommended condition of probation and clarify that electronic monitoring
may be used as a means of surveillance in connection with an order of curfew.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1989.
273. Amendment: Section 5B1.3(c) is amended by inserting immediately before the period at the
end of the first sentence:
", unless the court finds on the record that extraordinary circumstances exist that would
make such a condition plainly unreasonable, in which event the court shall impose one
or more of the other conditions set forth under 18 U.S.C. § 3563(b)".
Reason for Amendment: The purpose of this amendment is to conform the guideline to a
statutory revision.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1989.
274. Amendment: Section 5B1.3(a) is amended by inserting at the end: "The court shall also
impose a condition that the defendant not possess illegal controlled substances. 18 U.S.C.
§ 3563(a)(3).".
Section 5B1.3 is amended by inserting the following commentary:
"Commentary
A broader form of the condition required under 18 U.S.C. § 3563(a)(3) (pertaining to
possession of controlled substances) is set forth as recommended condition (7) at §5B1.4
(Recommended Conditions of Probation and Supervised Release).".
Reason for Amendment: The purpose of this amendment is to reference a mandatory
condition of probation added by Section 7303 of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1989.
275. Amendment: Section 5C2.1(e) is amended by deleting "Thirty days" and inserting in lieu
Amendment 274 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003
– 138 –
thereof "One day", by deleting "one month" wherever it appears and inserting in lieu thereof
in each instance "one day", and by deleting "One month" and inserting in lieu thereof "One
day".
Reason for Amendment: The purpose of this amendment is to enhance the internal
consistency of the guidelines.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1989.
276. Amendment: Section 5D3.3 is amended by deleting:
"(b) In order to fulfill any authorized purposes of sentencing, the court may impose
other conditions reasonably related to (1) the nature and circumstances of the
offense, and (2) the history and characteristics of the defendant. 18 U.S.C.
§ 3583(d).",
and inserting in lieu thereof:
"(b) The court may impose other conditions of supervised release, to the extent that
such conditions are reasonably related to (1) the nature and circumstances of the
offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant, and (2) the need for
the sentence imposed to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct, to protect
the public from further crimes of the defendant, and to provide the defendant with
needed educational or vocational training, medical care, or other correctional
treatment in the most effective manner. 18 U.S.C. §§ 3553(a)(2) and 3583(d).".
Reason for Amendment: The purposes of this amendment are to clarify the guideline and
conform it to the statute as amended by Section 7108 of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1989.
277. Amendment: Section 5D3.3(a) is amended by inserting at the end: "The court shall also
impose a condition that the defendant not possess illegal controlled substances. 18 U.S.C.
§ 3563(a)(3).".
The Commentary to §5D3.3 captioned "Background" is amended by inserting the following
additional sentence at the end:
"A broader form of the condition required under 18 U.S.C. § 3563(a)(3) (pertaining to
possession of controlled substances) is set forth as recommended condition (7) at §5B1.4
(Recommended Conditions of Probation and Supervised Release).".
Reason for Amendment: The purpose of this amendment is to reference a mandatory
condition of supervised release added by Section 7303 of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1989.
278. Amendment: Section 5E4.1 is amended by inserting the following additional subsection:
"(c) With the consent of the victim of the offense, the court may order a defendant to
November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment 280
– 139 –
perform services for the benefit of the victim in lieu of monetary restitution or in
conjunction therewith. 18 U.S.C. § 3663(b)(4).".
Reason for Amendment: The purpose of this amendment is to insert language previously
contained in §5F5.3(b) where it had been erroneously placed.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1989.
279. Amendment: The Commentary to §5E4.1 captioned "Background" is amended in the first
paragraph by deleting:
"See S. Rep. No. 225, 98th Cong., 1st Sess. 95-96.",
and inserting in lieu thereof:
"See 18 U.S.C. § 3563(b)(3) as amended by Section 7110 of Pub. L. No. 100-690
(1988).".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment replaces a reference to legislative history with a
citation to a revised statute. Section 7110 of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 confirms the
authority of a sentencing court to impose restitution as a condition of probation. Previously,
such authority was inferred from 18 U.S.C. §3563(b)(20) (defendant may be ordered to "satisfy
such other conditions as the court may impose") and from legislative history.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1989.
280. Amendment: Section 5E4.2(a) is amended by deleting the second sentence as follows:
"If the guideline for the offense in Chapter Two prescribes a different rule for imposing
fines, that rule takes precedence over this subsection.".
Section 5E4.2(b) is amended by inserting at the end:
"If, however, the guideline for the offense in Chapter Two provides a specific rule for
imposing a fine, that rule takes precedence over subsection (c) of this section.".
Reason for Amendment: The purpose of this amendment is to clarify the guideline. The last
sentence of current §5E4.2(a) is in the wrong place. This amendment moves the content of this
sentence to subsection (b) where it belongs.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1989.
281. Amendment: Section 5E4.2(c)(3) is amended by deleting:
"1 $ 25 $ 250
2-3 $100 $1,000
4-5 $250 $2,500",
and inserting in lieu thereof:
Amendment 280 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003
– 140 –
"3 and below $100 $5,000
4-5 $250 $5,000".
Reason for Amendment: The purpose of this amendment is to increase the maximum in the
fine table for offense levels 5 and below to $5,000, an amount equal to the maximum fine
authorized for a petty offense. Moreover, because the guidelines now cover only felonies and
class A misdemeanors, the minimum fine guideline is increased to $100.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1989.
282. Amendment: The Commentary to Section 5E4.3 captioned "Background" is amended in the
first paragraph by inserting at the end:
"Under the Victims of Crime Act, as amended by Section 7085 of the Anti-Drug Abuse
Act of 1988, the court is required to impose assessments in the following amounts with
respect to offenses committed on or after November 18, 1988:
Individuals:
$5, if the defendant is an individual convicted of an infraction or a Class C
misdemeanor;
$10, if the defendant is an individual convicted of a Class B misdemeanor;
$25, if the defendant is an individual convicted of a Class A misdemeanor; and
$50, if the defendant is an individual convicted of a felony.
Organizations:
$50, if the defendant is an organization convicted of a Class B misdemeanor;
$125, if the defendant is an organization convicted of a Class A misdemeanor; and
$200, if the defendant is an organization convicted of a felony. 18 U.S.C. § 3013.",
and in the second paragraph by deleting "The Act requires the court" and inserting in lieu
thereof "With respect to offenses committed prior to November 18, 1988, the court is required".
Reason for Amendment: The purpose of this amendment is to conform the commentary to
the statute as amended by Section 7085 of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1989.
283. Amendment: Section 5F5.3(a) is amended by deleting "(a)", and by inserting "and sentenced
to probation" immediately following "felony".
Section 5F5.3(b) is amended by deleting:
"(b) With the consent of the victim of the offense, the court may order a defendant to
perform services for the benefit of the victim in lieu of monetary restitution. 18
U.S.C. § 3663(b)(4).".
Reason for Amendment: The purposes of this amendment are to correct an erroneous
statement in §5F5.3(a) and to delete §5F5.3(b), which deals with restitution, and therefore
November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment 285
– 141 –
should appear at §5E4.1.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1989.
284. Amendment: The Commentary to §5F5.4 captioned "Background" is amended by deleting the
third paragraph as follows:
"The legislative history indicates that, although the sanction was designed to provide
actual notice to victims, a court might properly limit notice to only those victims who
could be most readily identified, if to do otherwise would unduly prolong or complicate
the sentencing process.".
Reason for Amendment: The purpose of this amendment is to delete an unnecessary
statement that could be subject to misinterpretation.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1989.
285. Amendment: Section 5F5.5(a) is amended by deleting:
"(2) there is a risk that, absent such restriction, the defendant will continue to engage
in unlawful conduct similar to that for which the defendant was convicted; and
(3) imposition of such a restriction is reasonably necessary to protect the public.",
and inserting in lieu thereof:
"(2) imposition of such a restriction is reasonably necessary to protect the public
because there is reason to believe that, absent such restriction, the defendant will
continue to engage in unlawful conduct similar to that for which the defendant
was convicted.",
and by inserting "and" at the end of subsection (a)(1).
Reason for Amendment: The purpose of this amendment is to clarify the guideline.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1989.
286. Amendment: Chapter Five, Part G is amended by deleting §5G1.1 in its entirety as follows:
"§5G1.1. Sentencing on a Single Count of Conviction
(a) If application of the guidelines results in a sentence above the
maximum authorized by statute for the offense of conviction, the
statutory maximum shall be the guideline sentence.
(b) If application of the guidelines results in a sentence below the
minimum sentence required by statute, the statutory minimum
shall be the guideline sentence.
(c) In any other case, the sentence imposed shall be the sentence as
Amendment 285 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003
– 142 –
determined from application of the guidelines.
Commentary
If the statute requires imposition of a sentence other than that required by the guidelines,
the statute shall control. The sentence imposed should be consistent with the statute but
as close as possible to the guidelines.".
A replacement guideline with accompanying commentary is inserted as §5G1.1 (Sentencing on
a Single Count of Conviction).
Reason for Amendment: The purpose of this amendment is to clarify the guideline.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1989.
287. Amendment: The Commentary to §5G1.2 is amended in the second paragraph by deleting
"any combination of concurrent and consecutive sentences that produces the total punishment
may be imposed" and inserting in lieu thereof "consecutive sentences are to be imposed to the
extent necessary to achieve the total punishment".
Reason for Amendment: The purpose of this amendment is to clarify the commentary.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1989.
288. Amendment: The Commentary to §5G1.2 is amended by inserting the following additional
paragraph immediately after the first paragraph:
" This section applies to multiple counts of conviction (1) contained in the same
indictment or information, or (2) contained in different indictments or informations for
which sentences are to be imposed at the same time or in a consolidated proceeding.".
Reason for Amendment: The purpose of this amendment is to clarify that this guideline
applies in the case of separate indictments that are consolidated for purposes of sentencing.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1989.
289. Amendment: Chapter Five, Part G is amended by deleting §5G1.3 in its entirety as follows:
"§5G1.3. Convictions on Counts Related to Unexpired Sentences
If at the time of sentencing, the defendant is already serving one or more
unexpired sentences, then the sentences for the instant offense(s) shall run
consecutively to such unexpired sentences, unless one or more of the
instant offenses(s) arose out of the same transactions or occurrences as the
unexpired sentences. In the latter case, such instant sentences and the
unexpired sentences shall run concurrently, except to the extent otherwise
required by law.
Commentary
November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment 290
– 143 –
This section reflects the statutory presumption that sentences imposed at different times
ordinarily run consecutively. See 18 U.S.C. § 3584(a). This presumption does not apply
when the new counts arise out of the same transaction or occurrence as a prior
conviction.
Departure would be warranted when independent prosecutions produce anomalous
results that circumvent or defeat the intent of the guidelines.".
A replacement guideline with accompanying commentary is inserted as §5G1.3 (Imposition of
a Sentence on a Defendant Serving an Unexpired Term of Imprisonment).
Reason for Amendment: The purpose of this amendment is to specify the circumstances in
which a consecutive sentence is required by the guidelines.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1989.
290. Amendment: Section 5K1.1 is amended by deleting "made a good faith effort to provide" and
inserting in lieu thereof "provided".
Section 5K1.1(a) is amended in the first sentence by deleting "conduct" immediately following
"of the following".
Reason for Amendment: The purpose of this amendment is to clarify the Commission’s intent
that departures under this policy statement be based upon the provision of substantial assistance.
The existing policy statement could be interpreted as requiring only a willingness to provide
such assistance. The amendment also makes an editorial correction.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1989.
291. Amendment: The Commentary to §5K1.2 is deleted in its entirety as follows:
"Commentary
Background: The Commission considered and rejected the use of a defendant’s refusal
to assist authorities as an aggravating sentencing factor. Refusal to assist authorities
based upon continued involvement in criminal activities and association with
accomplices may be considered, however, in evaluating a defendant’s sincerity in
claiming acceptance of responsibility.".
Reason for Amendment: The purpose of this amendment is to delete unnecessary

"2. The Statutory Mission
The Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984 foresees guidelines that will
further the basic purposes of criminal punishment, i.e., deterring crime, incapacitating
the offender, providing just punishment, and rehabilitating the offender. It delegates to
the Commission broad authority to review and rationalize the federal sentencing process.
The statute contains many detailed instructions as to how this determination
should be made, but the most important of them instructs the Commission to create
Amendment 305 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003
– 152 –
categories of offense behavior and offender characteristics. An offense behavior
category might consist, for example, of ‘bank robbery/committed with a gun/$2500
taken.’ An offender characteristic category might be ‘offender with one prior conviction
who was not sentenced to imprisonment.’ The Commission is required to prescribe
guideline ranges that specify an appropriate sentence for each class of convicted persons,
to be determined by coordinating the offense behavior categories with the offender
characteristic categories. The statute contemplates the guidelines will establish a range
of sentences for every coordination of categories. Where the guidelines call for
imprisonment, the range must be narrow: the maximum imprisonment cannot exceed the
minimum by more than the greater of 25 percent or six months. 28 U.S.C. § 994(b)(2).
The sentencing judge must select a sentence from within the guideline range. If,
however, a particular case presents atypical features, the Act allows the judge to depart
from the guidelines and sentence outside the range. In that case, the judge must specify
reasons for departure. 18 U.S.C. § 3553(b). If the court sentences within the guideline
range, an appellate court may review the sentence to see if the guideline was correctly
November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment 307
– 153 –
applied. If the judge departs from the guideline range, an appellate court may review the
reasonableness of the departure. 18 U.S.C. § 3742. The Act requires the offender to
serve virtually all of any prison sentence imposed, for it abolishes parole and
substantially restructures good behavior adjustments.
The law requires the Commission to send its initial guidelines to Congress by
April 13, 1987, and under the present statute they take effect automatically on
November 1, 1987. Pub. L. No. 98-473, § 235, reprinted at 18 U.S.C. § 3551. The
Commission may submit guideline amendments each year to Congress between the
beginning of a regular session and May 1. The amendments will take effect
automatically 180 days after submission unless a law is enacted to the contrary.
28 U.S.C. § 994(p).
The Commission, with the aid of its legal and research staff, considerable public
testimony, and written commentary, has developed an initial set of guidelines which it
now transmits to Congress. The Commission emphasizes, however, that it views the
guideline-writing process as evolutionary. It expects, and the governing statute
anticipates, that continuing research, experience, and analysis will result in modifications
and revisions to the guidelines by submission of amendments to Congress. To this end,
the Commission is established as a permanent agency to monitor sentencing practices in
the federal courts throughout the nation.
3. The Basic Approach (Policy Statement)
To understand these guidelines and the rationale that underlies them, one must
begin with the three objectives that Congress, in enacting the new sentencing law, sought
to achieve. Its basic objective was to enhance the ability of the criminal justice system
to reduce crime through an effective, fair sentencing system. To achieve this objective,
Congress first sought honesty in sentencing. It sought to avoid the confusion and
implicit deception that arises out of the present sentencing system which requires a judge
to impose an indeterminate sentence that is automatically reduced in most cases by ‘good
time’ credits. In addition, the parole commission is permitted to determine how much
of the remainder of any prison sentence an offender actually will serve. This usually
results in a substantial reduction in the effective length of the sentence imposed, with
defendants often serving only about one-third of the sentence handed down by the court.
Second, Congress sought uniformity in sentencing by narrowing the wide
disparity in sentences imposed by different federal courts for similar criminal conduct
by similar offenders. Third, Congress sought proportionality in sentencing through a
system that imposes appropriately different sentences for criminal conduct of different
severity.
Honesty is easy to achieve: The abolition of parole makes the sentence imposed
by the court the sentence the offender will serve. There is a tension, however, between
the mandate of uniformity (treat similar cases alike) and the mandate of proportionality
(treat different cases differently) which, like the historical tension between law and
equity, makes it difficult to achieve both goals simultaneously. Perfect uniformity --
sentencing every offender to five years -- destroys proportionality. Having only a few
simple categories of crimes would make the guidelines uniform and easy to administer,
but might lump together offenses that are different in important respects. For example,
Amendment 307 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003
– 154 –
a single category for robbery that lumps together armed and unarmed robberies, robberies
with and without injuries, robberies of a few dollars and robberies of millions, is far too
broad.
At the same time, a sentencing system tailored to fit every conceivable wrinkle
of each case can become unworkable and seriously compromise the certainty of
punishment and its deterrent effect. A bank robber with (or without) a gun, which the
robber kept hidden (or brandished), might have frightened (or merely warned), injured
seriously (or less seriously), tied up (or simply pushed) a guard, a teller or a customer,
at night (or at noon), for a bad (or arguably less bad) motive, in an effort to obtain money
for other crimes (or for other purposes), in the company of a few (or many) other robbers,
for the first (or fourth) time that day, while sober (or under the influence of drugs or
alcohol), and so forth.
The list of potentially relevant features of criminal behavior is long; the fact that
they can occur in multiple combinations means that the list of possible permutations of
factors is virtually endless. The appropriate relationships among these different factors
are exceedingly difficult to establish, for they are often context specific. Sentencing
courts do not treat the occurrence of a simple bruise identically in all cases, irrespective
of whether that bruise occurred in the context of a bank robbery or in the context of a
breach of peace. This is so, in part, because the risk that such a harm will occur differs
depending on the underlying offense with which it is connected (and therefore may
already be counted, to a different degree, in the punishment for the underlying offense);
and also because, in part, the relationship between punishment and multiple harms is not
simply additive. The relation varies, depending on how much other harm has occurred.
(Thus, one cannot easily assign points for each kind of harm and simply add them up,
irrespective of context and total amounts.)
The larger the number of subcategories, the greater the complexity that is created
and the less workable the system. Moreover, the subcategories themselves, sometimes
too broad and sometimes too narrow, will apply and interact in unforeseen ways to
unforeseen situations, thus failing to cure the unfairness of a simple, broad category
system. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, probation officers and courts, in applying
a complex system of subcategories, would have to make a host of decisions about
whether the underlying facts are sufficient to bring the case within a particular
subcategory. The greater the number of decisions required and the greater their
complexity, the greater the risk that different judges will apply the guidelines differently
to situations that, in fact, are similar, thereby reintroducing the very disparity that the
guidelines were designed to eliminate.
In view of the arguments, it is tempting to retreat to the simple, broad-category
approach and to grant judges the discretion to select the proper point along a broad
sentencing range. Obviously, however, granting such broad discretion risks
correspondingly broad disparity in sentencing, for different courts may exercise their
discretionary powers in different ways. That is to say, such an approach risks a return
to the wide disparity that Congress established the Commission to limit.
In the end, there is no completely satisfying solution to this practical stalemate.
The Commission has had to simply balance the comparative virtues and vices of broad,
simple categorization and detailed, complex subcategorization, and within the constraints
November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment 307
– 155 –
established by that balance, minimize the discretionary powers of the sentencing court.
Any ultimate system will, to a degree, enjoy the benefits and suffer from the drawbacks
of each approach.
A philosophical problem arose when the Commission attempted to reconcile the
differing perceptions of the purposes of criminal punishment. Most observers of the
criminal law agree that the ultimate aim of the law itself, and of punishment in particular,
is the control of crime. Beyond this point, however, the consensus seems to break down.
Some argue that appropriate punishment should be defined primarily on the basis of the
moral principle of ‘just deserts.’ Under this principle, punishment should be scaled to
the offender’s culpability and the resulting harms. Thus, if a defendant is less culpable,
the defendant deserves less punishment. Others argue that punishment should be
imposed primarily on the basis of practical ‘crime control’ considerations. Defendants
sentenced under this scheme should receive the punishment that most effectively lessens
the likelihood of future crime, either by deterring others or incapacitating the defendant.
Adherents of these points of view have urged the Commission to choose between
them, to accord one primacy over the other. Such a choice would be profoundly difficult.
The relevant literature is vast, the arguments deep, and each point of view has much to
be said in its favor. A clear-cut Commission decision in favor of one of these approaches
would diminish the chance that the guidelines would find the widespread acceptance they
need for effective implementation. As a practical matter, in most sentencing decisions
both philosophies may prove consistent with the same result.
For now, the Commission has sought to solve both the practical and philosophical
problems of developing a coherent sentencing system by taking an empirical approach
that uses data estimating the existing sentencing system as a starting point. It has
analyzed data drawn from 10,000 presentence investigations, crimes as distinguished in
substantive criminal statutes, the United States Parole Commission’s guidelines and
resulting statistics, and data from other relevant sources, in order to determine which
distinctions are important in present practice. After examination, the Commission has
accepted, modified, or rationalized the more important of these distinctions.
This empirical approach has helped the Commission resolve its practical problem
by defining a list of relevant distinctions that, although of considerable length, is short
enough to create a manageable set of guidelines. Existing categories are relatively broad
and omit many distinctions that some may believe important, yet they include most of
the major distinctions that statutes and presentence data suggest make a significant
difference in sentencing decisions. Important distinctions that are ignored in existing
practice probably occur rarely. A sentencing judge may take this unusual case into
account by departing from the guidelines.
The Commission’s empirical approach has also helped resolve its philosophical
dilemma. Those who adhere to a just deserts philosophy may concede that the lack of
moral consensus might make it difficult to say exactly what punishment is deserved for
a particular crime, specified in minute detail. Likewise, those who subscribe to a
philosophy of crime control may acknowledge that the lack of sufficient, readily
available data might make it difficult to say exactly what punishment will best prevent
that crime. Both groups might therefore recognize the wisdom of looking to those
distinctions that judges and legislators have, in fact, made over the course of time. These
Amendment 307 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003
– 156 –
established distinctions are ones that the community believes, or has found over time, to
be important from either a moral or crime-control perspective.
The Commission has not simply copied estimates of existing practice as revealed
by the data (even though establishing offense values on this basis would help eliminate
disparity, for the data represent averages). Rather, it has departed from the data at
different points for various important reasons. Congressional statutes, for example, may
suggest or require departure, as in the case of the new drug law that imposes increased
and mandatory minimum sentences. In addition, the data may reveal inconsistencies in
treatment, such as punishing economic crime less severely than other apparently
equivalent behavior.
Despite these policy-oriented departures from present practice, the guidelines
represent an approach that begins with, and builds upon, empirical data. The guidelines
will not please those who wish the Commission to adopt a single philosophical theory
and then work deductively to establish a simple and perfect set of categorizations and
distinctions. The guidelines may prove acceptable, however, to those who seek more
modest, incremental improvements in the status quo, who believe the best is often the
enemy of the good, and who recognize that these initial guidelines are but the first step
in an evolutionary process. After spending considerable time and resources exploring
alternative approaches, the Commission has developed these guidelines as a practical
effort toward the achievement of a more honest, uniform, equitable, and therefore
effective, sentencing system.
4. The Guidelines’ Resolution of Major Issues (Policy Statement)
The guideline-writing process has required the Commission to resolve a host of
important policy questions, typically involving rather evenly balanced sets of competing
considerations. As an aid to understanding the guidelines, this introduction will briefly
discuss several of those issues. Commentary in the guidelines explains others.
(a) Real Offense vs. Charge Offense Sentencing.
One of the most important questions for the Commission to decide was whether
to base sentences upon the actual conduct in which the defendant engaged regardless of
the charges for which he was indicted or convicted (‘real offense’ sentencing), or upon
the conduct that constitutes the elements of the offense with which the defendant was
charged and of which he was convicted (‘charge offense’ sentencing). A bank robber,
for example, might have used a gun, frightened bystanders, taken $50,000, injured a
teller, refused to stop when ordered, and raced away damaging property during escape.
A pure real offense system would sentence on the basis of all identifiable conduct. A
pure charge offense system would overlook some of the harms that did not constitute
statutory elements of the offenses of which the defendant was convicted.
The Commission initially sought to develop a real offense system. After all, the
present sentencing system is, in a sense, a real offense system. The sentencing court (and
the parole commission) take account of the conduct in which the defendant actually
engaged, as determined in a presentence report, at the sentencing hearing, or before a
parole commission hearing officer. The Commission’s initial efforts in this direction,
carried out in the spring and early summer of 1986, proved unproductive mostly for
November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment 307
– 157 –
practical reasons. To make such a system work, even to formalize and rationalize the
status quo, would have required the Commission to decide precisely which harms to take
into account, how to add them up, and what kinds of procedures the courts should use to
determine the presence or absence of disputed factual elements. The Commission found
no practical way to combine and account for the large number of diverse harms arising
in different circumstances; nor did it find a practical way to reconcile the need for a fair
adjudicatory procedure with the need for a speedy sentencing process, given the potential
existence of hosts of adjudicated ‘real harm’ facts in many typical cases. The effort
proposed as a solution to these problems required the use of, for example, quadratic roots
and other mathematical operations that the Commission considered too complex to be
workable, and, in the Commission’s view, risked return to wide disparity in practice.
The Commission therefore abandoned the effort to devise a ‘pure’ real offense
system and instead experimented with a ‘modified real offense system,’ which it
published for public comment in a September 1986 preliminary draft.
This version also foundered in several major respects on the rock of practicality.
It was highly complex and its mechanical rules for adding harms (e.g., bodily injury
added the same punishment irrespective of context) threatened to work considerable
unfairness. Ultimately, the Commission decided that it could not find a practical or fair
and efficient way to implement either a pure or modified real offense system of the sort
it originally wanted, and it abandoned that approach.
The Commission, in its January 1987 Revised Draft and the present guidelines,
has moved closer to a ‘charge offense’ system. The system is not, however, pure; it has
a number of real elements. For one thing, the hundreds of overlapping and duplicative
statutory provisions that make up the federal criminal law have forced the Commission
to write guidelines that are descriptive of generic conduct rather than tracking purely
statutory language. For another, the guidelines, both through specific offense
characteristics and adjustments, take account of a number of important, commonly
occurring real offense elements such as role in the offense, the presence of a gun, or the
amount of money actually taken.
Finally, it is important not to overstate the difference in practice between a real
and a charge offense system. The federal criminal system, in practice, deals mostly with
drug offenses, bank robberies and white collar crimes (such as fraud, embezzlement, and
bribery). For the most part, the conduct that an indictment charges approximates the real
and relevant conduct in which the offender actually engaged.
The Commission recognizes its system will not completely cure the problems of
a real offense system. It may still be necessary, for example, for a court to determine
some particular real facts that will make a difference to the sentence. Yet, the
Commission believes that the instances of controversial facts will be far fewer; indeed,
there will be few enough so that the court system will be able to devise fair procedures
for their determination. See United States v. Fatico, 579 F.2d 707 (2d Cir. 1978)
(permitting introduction of hearsay evidence at sentencing hearing under certain
conditions), on remand, 458 F. Supp. 388 (E.D.N.Y. 1978), aff’d, 603 F.2d 1053 (2d Cir.
1979) (holding that the government need not prove facts at sentencing hearing beyond
a reasonable doubt), cert. denied, 444 U.S. 1073 (1980).
Amendment 307 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003
– 158 –
The Commission also recognizes that a charge offense system has drawbacks of
its own. One of the most important is its potential to turn over to the prosecutor the
power to determine the sentence by increasing or decreasing the number (or content) of
the counts in an indictment. Of course, the defendant’s actual conduct (that which the
prosecutor can prove in court) imposes a natural limit upon the prosecutor’s ability to
increase a defendant’s sentence. Moreover, the Commission has written its rules for the
treatment of multicount convictions with an eye toward eliminating unfair treatment that
might flow from count manipulation. For example, the guidelines treat a three-count
indictment, each count of which charges sale of 100 grams of heroin, or theft of $10,000,
the same as a single-count indictment charging sale of 300 grams of heroin or theft of
$30,000. Further, a sentencing court may control any inappropriate manipulation of the
indictment through use of its power to depart from the specific guideline sentence.
Finally, the Commission will closely monitor problems arising out of count manipulation
and will make appropriate adjustments should they become necessary.
(b) Departures.
The new sentencing statute permits a court to depart from a guideline-specified
sentence only when it finds ‘an aggravating or mitigating circumstance of a kind, or to
a degree, not adequately taken into consideration by the Sentencing Commission . . .’.
18 U.S.C. § 3553(b). Thus, in principle, the Commission, by specifying that it had
adequately considered a particular factor, could prevent a court from using it as grounds
for departure. In this initial set of guidelines, however, the Commission does not so limit
the courts’ departure powers. The Commission intends the sentencing courts to treat
each guideline as carving out a ‘heartland,’ a set of typical cases embodying the conduct
that each guideline describes. When a court finds an atypical case, one to which a
particular guideline linguistically applies but where conduct significantly differs from the
norm, the court may consider whether a departure is warranted. Section 5H1.10 (Race,
Sex, National Origin, Creed, Religion, Socio-Economic Status), the third sentence of
§5H1.4, and the last sentence of §5K2.12, list a few factors that the court cannot take into
account as grounds for departure. With those specific exceptions, however, the
Commission does not intend to limit the kinds of factors (whether or not mentioned
anywhere else in the guidelines) that could constitute grounds for departure in an unusual
case.
The Commission has adopted this departure policy for two basic reasons. First
is the difficulty of foreseeing and capturing a single set of guidelines that encompasses
the vast range of human conduct potentially relevant to a sentencing decision. The
Commission also recognizes that in the initial set of guidelines it need not do so. The
Commission is a permanent body, empowered by law to write and rewrite guidelines,
with progressive changes, over many years. By monitoring when courts depart from the
guidelines and by analyzing their stated reasons for doing so, the Commission, over time,
will be able to create more accurate guidelines that specify precisely where departures
should and should not be permitted.
Second, the Commission believes that despite the courts’ legal freedom to depart
from the guidelines, they will not do so very often. This is because the guidelines,
offense by offense, seek to take account of those factors that the Commission’s
sentencing data indicate make a significant difference in sentencing at the present time.
Thus, for example, where the presence of actual physical injury currently makes an
November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment 307
– 159 –
important difference in final sentences, as in the case of robbery, assault, or arson, the
guidelines specifically instruct the judge to use this factor to augment the sentence.
Where the guidelines do not specify an augmentation or diminution, this is generally
because the sentencing data do not permit the Commission, at this time, to conclude that
the factor is empirically important in relation to the particular offense. Of course, a
factor (say physical injury) may nonetheless sometimes occur in connection with a crime
(such as fraud) where it does not often occur. If, however, as the data indicate, such
occurrences are rare, they are precisely the type of events that the court’s departure
powers were designed to cover -- unusual cases outside the range of the more typical
offenses for which the guidelines were designed. Of course, the Commission recognizes
that even its collection and analysis of 10,000 presentence reports are an imperfect source
of data sentencing estimates. Rather than rely heavily at this time upon impressionistic
accounts, however, the Commission believes it wiser to wait and collect additional data
from our continuing monitoring process that may demonstrate how the guidelines work
in practice before further modification.
It is important to note that the guidelines refer to two different kinds of departure.
The first kind involves instances in which the guidelines provide specific
guidance for departure, by analogy or by other numerical or non-numerical suggestions.
For example, the commentary to §2G1.1 (Transportation for Prostitution), recommends
a downward adjustment of eight levels where commercial purpose was not involved. The
Commission intends such suggestions as policy guidance for the courts. The
Commission expects that most departures will reflect the suggestions, and that the courts
of appeals may prove more likely to find departures ‘unreasonable’ where they fall
outside suggested levels.
A second kind of departure will remain unguided. It may rest upon grounds
referred to in Chapter 5, Part K (Departures), or on grounds not mentioned in the
guidelines. While Chapter 5, Part K lists factors that the Commission believes may
constitute grounds for departure, those suggested grounds are not exhaustive. The
Commission recognizes that there may be other grounds for departure that are not
mentioned; it also believes there may be cases in which a departure outside suggested
levels is warranted. In its view, however, such cases will be highly unusual.
(c) Plea Agreements.
Nearly ninety percent of all federal criminal cases involve guilty pleas, and many
of these cases involve some form of plea agreement. Some commentators on early
Commission guideline drafts have urged the Commission not to attempt any major
reforms of the agreement process, on the grounds that any set of guidelines that threatens
to radically change present practice also threatens to make the federal system
unmanageable. Others, starting with the same facts, have argued that guidelines which
fail to control and limit plea agreements would leave untouched a ‘loophole’ large
enough to undo the good that sentencing guidelines may bring. Still other commentators
make both sets of arguments.
The Commission has decided that these initial guidelines will not, in general,
make significant changes in current plea agreement practices. The court will accept or
reject any such agreements primarily in accordance with the rules set forth in
Amendment 307 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003
– 160 –
Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(e). The Commission will collect data on the courts’ plea practices and
will analyze this information to determine when and why the courts accept or reject plea
agreements. In light of this information and analysis, the Commission will seek to
further regulate the plea agreement process as appropriate.
The Commission nonetheless expects the initial set of guidelines to have a
positive, rationalizing impact upon plea agreements for two reasons. First, the guidelines
create a clear, definite expectation in respect to the sentence that a court will impose if
a trial takes place. Insofar as a prosecutor and defense attorney seek to agree about a
likely sentence or range of sentences, they will no longer work in the dark. This fact
alone should help to reduce irrationality in respect to actual sentencing outcomes.
Second, the guidelines create a norm to which judges will likely refer when they decide
whether, under Rule 11(e), to accept or to reject a plea agreement or recommendation.
Since they will have before them the norm, the relevant factors (as disclosed in the plea
agreement), and the reason for the agreement, they will find it easier than at present to
determine whether there is sufficient reason to accept a plea agreement that departs from
the norm.
(d) Probation and Split Sentences.
The statute provides that the guidelines are to ‘reflect the general appropriateness
of imposing a sentence other than imprisonment in cases in which the defendant is a first
offender who has not been convicted of a crime of violence or an otherwise serious
offense . . .’ 28 U.S.C. § 994(j). Under present sentencing practice, courts sentence to
probation an inappropriately high percentage of offenders guilty of certain economic
crimes, such as theft, tax evasion, antitrust offenses, insider trading, fraud, and
embezzlement, that in the Commission’s view are ‘serious.’ If the guidelines were to
permit courts to impose probation instead of prison in many or all such cases, the present
sentences would continue to be ineffective.
The Commission’s solution to this problem has been to write guidelines that
classify as ‘serious’ (and therefore subject to mandatory prison sentences) many offenses
for which probation is now frequently given. At the same time, the guidelines will
permit the sentencing court to impose short prison terms in many such cases. The
Commission’s view is that the definite prospect of prison, though the term is short, will
act as a significant deterrent to many of these crimes, particularly when compared with
the status quo where probation, not prison, is the norm.
More specifically, the guidelines work as follows in respect to a first offender.
For offense levels one through six, the sentencing court may elect to sentence the
offender to probation (with or without confinement conditions) or to a prison term. For
offense levels seven through ten, the court may substitute probation for a prison term, but
the probation must include confinement conditions (community confinement, intermittent
confinement, or home detention). For offense levels eleven and twelve, the court must
impose at least one half the minimum confinement sentence in the form of prison
confinement, the remainder to be served on supervised release with a condition of
community confinement or home detention. The Commission, of course, has not dealt
with the single acts of aberrant behavior that still may justify probation at higher offense
levels through departures.
November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment 307
– 161 –
(e) Multi-Count Convictions.
The Commission, like other sentencing commissions, has found it particularly
difficult to develop rules for sentencing defendants convicted of multiple violations of
law, each of which makes up a separate count in an indictment. The reason it is difficult
is that when a defendant engages in conduct that causes several harms, each additional
harm, even if it increases the extent to which punishment is warranted, does not
necessarily warrant a proportionate increase in punishment. A defendant who assaults
others during a fight, for example, may warrant more punishment if he injures ten people
than if he injures one, but his conduct does not necessarily warrant ten times the
punishment. If it did, many of the simplest offenses, for reasons that are often fortuitous,
would lead to life sentences of imprisonment--sentences that neither ‘just deserts’ nor
‘crime control’ theories of punishment would find justified.
Several individual guidelines provide special instructions for increasing
punishment when the conduct that is the subject of that count involves multiple
occurrences or has caused several harms. The guidelines also provide general rules for
aggravating punishment in light of multiple harms charged separately in separate counts.
These rules may produce occasional anomalies, but normally they will permit an
appropriate degree of aggravation of punishment when multiple offenses that are the
subjects of separate counts take place.
These rules are set out in Chapter Three, Part D. They essentially provide: (1)
When the conduct involves fungible items, e.g., separate drug transactions or thefts of
money, the amounts are added and the guidelines apply to the total amount. (2) When
nonfungible harms are involved, the offense level for the most serious count is increased
(according to a somewhat diminishing scale) to reflect the existence of other counts of
conviction.
The rules have been written in order to minimize the possibility that an arbitrary
casting of a single transaction into several counts will produce a longer sentence. In
addition, the sentencing court will have adequate power to prevent such a result through
departures where necessary to produce a mitigated sentence.
(f) Regulatory Offenses.
Regulatory statutes, though primarily civil in nature, sometimes contain criminal
provisions in respect to particularly harmful activity. Such criminal provisions often
describe not only substantive offenses, but also more technical, administratively-related
offenses such as failure to keep accurate records or to provide requested information.
These criminal statutes pose two problems. First, which criminal regulatory provisions
should the Commission initially consider, and second, how should it treat technical or
administratively-related criminal violations?
In respect to the first problem, the Commission found that it cannot
comprehensively treat all regulatory violations in the initial set of guidelines. There are
hundreds of such provisions scattered throughout the United States Code. To find all
potential violations would involve examination of each individual federal regulation.
Because of this practical difficulty, the Commission has sought to determine, with the
assistance of the Department of Justice and several regulatory agencies, which criminal
Amendment 307 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003
– 162 –
regulatory offenses are particularly important in light of the need for enforcement of the
general regulatory scheme. The Commission has sought to treat these offenses in these
initial guidelines. It will address the less common regulatory offenses in the future.
In respect to the second problem, the Commission has developed a system for
treating technical recordkeeping and reporting offenses, dividing them into four
categories.
First, in the simplest of cases, the offender may have failed to fill out a form
intentionally, but without knowledge or intent that substantive harm would likely follow.
He might fail, for example, to keep an accurate record of toxic substance transport, but
that failure may not lead, nor be likely to lead, to the release or improper treatment of any
toxic substance. Second, the same failure may be accompanied by a significant
likelihood that substantive harm will occur; it may make a release of a toxic substance
more likely. Third, the same failure may have led to substantive harm. Fourth, the
failure may represent an effort to conceal a substantive harm that has occurred.
The structure of a typical guideline for a regulatory offense is as follows:
(1) The guideline provides a low base offense level (6) aimed at the first type of
recordkeeping or reporting offense. It gives the court the legal authority to
impose a punishment ranging from probation up to six months of imprisonment.
(2) Specific offense characteristics designed to reflect substantive offenses that do
occur (in respect to some regulatory offenses), or that are likely to occur, increase
the offense level.
(3) A specific offense characteristic also provides that a recordkeeping or reporting
offense that conceals a substantive offense will be treated like the substantive
offense.
The Commission views this structure as an initial effort. It may revise its
approach in light of further experience and analysis of regulatory crimes.
(g) Sentencing Ranges.
In determining the appropriate sentencing ranges for each offense, the
Commission began by estimating the average sentences now being served within each
category. It also examined the sentence specified in congressional statutes, in the parole
guidelines, and in other relevant, analogous sources. The Commission’s forthcoming
detailed report will contain a comparison between estimates of existing sentencing
practices and sentences under the guidelines.
While the Commission has not considered itself bound by existing sentencing
practice, it has not tried to develop an entirely new system of sentencing on the basis of
theory alone. Guideline sentences in many instances will approximate existing practice,
but adherence to the guidelines will help to eliminate wide disparity. For example, where
a high percentage of persons now receive probation, a guideline may include one or more
specific offense characteristics in an effort to distinguish those types of defendants who
now receive probation from those who receive more severe sentences. In some instances,
November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment 307
– 163 –
short sentences of incarceration for all offenders in a category have been substituted for
a current sentencing practice of very wide variability in which some defendants receive
probation while others receive several years in prison for the same offense. Moreover,
inasmuch as those who currently plead guilty often receive lesser sentences, the
guidelines also permit the court to impose lesser sentences on those defendants who
accept responsibility and those who cooperate with the government.
The Commission has also examined its sentencing ranges in light of their likely
impact upon prison population. Specific legislation, such as the new drug law and the
career offender provisions of the sentencing law, require the Commission to promulgate
rules that will lead to substantial prison population increases. These increases will occur
irrespective of any guidelines. The guidelines themselves, insofar as they reflect policy
decisions made by the Commission (rather than legislated mandatory minimum, or career
offender, sentences), will lead to an increase in prison population that computer models,
produced by the Commission and the Bureau of Prisons, estimate at approximately
10 percent, over a period of ten years.
(h) The Sentencing Table.
The Commission has established a sentencing table. For technical and practical
reasons it has 43 levels. Each row in the table contains levels that overlap with the levels
in the preceding and succeeding rows. By overlapping the levels, the table should
discourage unnecessary litigation. Both prosecutor and defendant will realize that the
difference between one level and another will not necessarily make a difference in the
sentence that the judge imposes. Thus, little purpose will be served in protracted
litigation trying to determine, for example, whether $10,000 or $11,000 was obtained as
a result of a fraud. At the same time, the rows work to increase a sentence
proportionately. A change of 6 levels roughly doubles the sentence irrespective of the
level at which one starts. The Commission, aware of the legal requirement that the
maximum of any range cannot exceed the minimum by more than the greater of
25 percent or six months, also wishes to permit courts the greatest possible range for
exercising discretion. The table overlaps offense levels meaningfully, works
proportionately, and at the same time preserves the maximum degree of allowable
discretion for the judge within each level.
Similarly, many of the individual guidelines refer to tables that correlate amounts
of money with offense levels. These tables often have many, rather than a few levels.
Again, the reason is to minimize the likelihood of unnecessary litigation. If a money
table were to make only a few distinctions, each distinction would become more
important and litigation as to which category an offender fell within would become more
likely. Where a table has many smaller monetary distinctions, it minimizes the
likelihood of litigation, for the importance of the precise amount of money involved is
considerably less.
5. A Concluding Note
The Commission emphasizes that its approach in this initial set of guidelines is
one of caution. It has examined the many hundreds of criminal statutes in the United
States Code. It has begun with those that are the basis for a significant number of
prosecutions. It has sought to place them in a rational order. It has developed additional
Amendment 307 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003
– 164 –
distinctions relevant to the application of these provisions, and it has applied sentencing
ranges to each resulting category. In doing so, it has relied upon estimates of existing
sentencing practices as revealed by its own statistical analyses, based on summary reports
of some 40,000 convictions, a sample of 10,000 augmented presentence reports, the
parole guidelines and policy judgments.
The Commission recognizes that some will criticize this approach as overly
cautious, as representing too little a departure from existing practice. Yet, it will cure
wide disparity. The Commission is a permanent body that can amend the guidelines each
year. Although the data available to it, like all data, are imperfect, experience with these
guidelines will lead to additional information and provide a firm empirical basis for
revision.
Finally, the guidelines will apply to approximately 90 percent of all cases in the
federal courts. Because of time constraints and the nonexistence of statistical
information, some offenses that occur infrequently are not considered in this initial set
of guidelines. They will, however, be addressed in the near future. Their exclusion from
this initial submission does not reflect any judgment about their seriousness. The
Commission has also deferred promulgation of guidelines pertaining to fines, probation
and other sanctions for organizational defendants, with the exception of antitrust
violations. The Commission also expects to address this area in the near future.".

Reason for Amendment: This amendment clarifies the Commission’s intention that the use
of information concerning the defendant’s prior criminal convictions and sentences not be
restricted by a cooperation agreement, makes several additional clarifying changes, and corrects
a clerical error.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1990.
309. Amendment: The Commentary to §1B1.3 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note
2 by deleting:
"This subsection applies to offenses of types for which convictions on multiple counts
would be grouped together pursuant to §3D1.2(d); multiple convictions are not
required.",
and inserting in lieu thereof:
"‘Offenses of a character for which §3D1.2(d) would require grouping of multiple
counts,’ as used in subsection (a)(2), applies to offenses for which grouping of counts
would be required under §3D1.2(d) had the defendant been convicted of multiple counts.
Application of this provision does not require the defendant, in fact, to have been
convicted of multiple counts. For example, where the defendant engaged in three drug
sales of 10, 15, and 20 grams of cocaine, as part of the same course of conduct or
common scheme or plan, subsection (a)(2) provides that the total quantity of cocaine
involved (45 grams) is to be used to determine the offense level even if the defendant is
convicted of a single count charging only one of the sales. If the defendant is convicted
of multiple counts for the above noted sales, the grouping rules of Chapter Three, Part
D (Multiple Counts) provide that the counts are grouped together. Although Chapter
Three, Part D (Multiple Counts) applies to multiple counts of conviction, it does not limit
the scope of subsection (a)(2). Subsection (a)(2) merely incorporates by reference the
types of offenses set forth in §3D1.2(d); thus, as discussed above, multiple counts of
conviction are not required for subsection (a)(2) to apply.".
The Commentary to §3D1.2 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 4 by
renumbering example (4) as (5); and by inserting, immediately before "But:", the following:
"(4) The defendant is convicted of two counts of distributing a controlled substance, each
count involving a separate sale of 10 grams of cocaine that is part of a common scheme
Amendment 309 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003
– 166 –
or plan. In addition, a finding is made that there are two other sales, also part of the
common scheme or plan, each involving 10 grams of cocaine. The total amount of all
four sales (40 grams of cocaine) will be used to determine the offense level for each
count under §1B1.3(a)(2). The two counts will then be grouped together under either this
subsection or subsection (d) to avoid double counting.".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment clarifies the intended scope of §1B1.3(a)(2) in
conjunction with Chapter Three, Part D (Multiple Counts) to ensure that the latter is not read
to limit the former only to conduct of which the defendant was convicted.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1990.
310. Amendment: The Commentary to §2A1.1 captioned "Statutory Provisions" is amended by
deleting "18 U.S.C. § 1111" and inserting in lieu thereof "18 U.S.C. §§ 1111, 2113(e),
2118(c)(2)".
The Commentary to §2A1.1 is amended in the first paragraph of Application Note 1 by deleting
"the ‘willful, deliberate, malicious, and premeditated killing’ to which 18 U.S.C. § 1111
applies" and inserting in lieu thereof: "premeditated killing"; and by deleting:
"However, the same statute applies when death results from certain enumerated felonies
-- arson, escape, murder, kidnapping, treason, espionage, sabotage, rape, burglary, or
robbery.",
and inserting in lieu thereof:
"However, this guideline also applies when death results from the commission of certain
felonies.".
The Commentary to §2A1.1 captioned "Background" is amended in the first paragraph by
deleting:
"Prior to the applicability of the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, a defendant convicted
under this statute and sentenced to life imprisonment could be paroled (see 18 U.S.C.
§ 4205(a)). Because of the abolition of parole by that Act, the language of 18 U.S.C. §
1111(b) (which was not amended by the Act) appears on its face to provide a mandatory
minimum sentence of life imprisonment for this offense. Other provisions of the Act,
however, classify this offense as a Class A felony (see 18 U.S.C. § 3559(a)(1)), for which
a term of imprisonment of any period of time is authorized as an alternative to
imprisonment for the duration of the defendant’s life (see 18 U.S.C. §§ 3559(b),
3581(b)(1), as amended); hence, the relevance of the discussion in Application Note 1,
supra, regarding circumstances in which a sentence less than life may be appropriate for
a conviction under this statute.",
and inserting in lieu thereof:
"Whether a mandatory minimum term of life imprisonment is applicable to every
defendant convicted of first degree murder under 18 U.S.C. § 1111 is a matter of
statutory interpretation for the courts. The discussion in Application Note 1, supra,
regarding circumstances in which a downward departure may be warranted is relevant
November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment 311
– 167 –
in the event the penalty provisions of 18 U.S.C. § 1111 are construed to permit a
sentence less than life imprisonment, or in the event the defendant is convicted under a
statute that expressly authorizes a sentence of less than life imprisonment (e.g., 18 U.S.C.
§§ 2113(e), 2118(c)(2), 21 U.S.C. § 848(e)).".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment clarifies the commentary with respect to
circumstances that may warrant a departure below the guideline range for offenses to which this
guideline applies. This amendment also reserves for the courts the issue of whether life
imprisonment is the mandatory minimum sentence for first degree murder under 18 U.S.C.
§ 1111.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1990.
311. Amendment: Section 2A2.1 is amended in the title by deleting "Conspiracy or Solicitation to
Commit Murder;" immediately before "Attempted Murder".
Section 2A2.1 is amended by deleting:
"(a) Base Offense Level: 20
(b) Specific Offense Characteristics
(1) If an assault involved more than minimal planning, increase by 2 levels.
(2) (A) If a firearm was discharged, increase by 5 levels; (B) if a dangerous
weapon (including a firearm) was otherwise used, increase by 4 levels;
(C) if a dangerous weapon (including a firearm) was brandished or its use
was threatened, increase by 3 levels.
(3) If the victim sustained bodily injury, increase the offense level according
to the seriousness of the injury:
Degree of Bodily Injury Increase in Level
(A) Bodily Injury add 2
(B) Serious Bodily Injury add 4
(C) Permanent or Life-Threatening Bodily Injury add 6
(D) If the degree of injury is between that specified in subdivisions
(A) and (B), add 3 levels; or
(E) If the degree of injury is between that specified in subdivisions
(B) and (C), add 5 levels.
Provided, however, that the cumulative adjustments from (2) and (3) shall
not exceed 9 levels.
(4) If a conspiracy or assault was motivated by a payment or offer of money
or other thing of value, increase by 2 levels.",
Amendment 311 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003
– 168 –
and inserting in lieu thereof:
"(a) Base Offense Level:
(1) 28, if the object of the offense would have constituted first degree murder;
or
(2) 22, otherwise.
(b) Specific Offense Characteristics
(1) (A) If the victim sustained permanent or life-threatening bodily injury,
increase by 4 levels; (B) if the victim sustained serious bodily injury,
increase by 2 levels; or (C) if the degree of injury is between that
specified in subdivisions (A) and (B), increase by 3 levels.
(2) If the offense involved the offer or the receipt of anything of pecuniary
value for undertaking the murder, increase by 4 levels.".
The Commentary to §2A2.1 captioned "Statutory Provisions" is amended by deleting "(d), 373,
1113, 1116(a), 1117, 1751(c), (d), 1952A(a)" and inserting in lieu thereof "1113, 1116(a),
1751(c)".
The Commentary to §2A2.1 captioned "Application Note" is amended in Note 1 by deleting
"‘more than minimal planning,’ ‘firearm,’ ‘dangerous weapon,’ ‘brandished,’ ‘otherwise used,’
‘bodily injury,’ ‘serious bodily injury,’" and inserting in lieu thereof "‘serious bodily injury’".
The Commentary to §2A2.1 captioned "Application Note" is amended by inserting the
following additional note:
"2. ‘First degree murder,’ as used in subsection (a)(1), means conduct that, if
committed within the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United
States, would constitute first degree murder under 18 U.S.C. § 1111.";
and in the caption by deleting "Note" and inserting in lieu thereof "Notes".
The Commentary to §2A2.1 captioned "Background" is amended in the first paragraph by
deleting ", conspiracy to commit murder, solicitation to commit murder," immediately before
"and attempted murder"; and by inserting the following additional sentence at the end:
"An attempted manslaughter, or assault with intent to commit manslaughter, is covered
under §2A2.2 (Aggravated Assault).".
The Commentary to §2A2.1 captioned "Background" is amended by deleting the second and
third paragraphs as follows:
" The maximum term of imprisonment authorized by statute for conspiracy to
murder is life imprisonment (18 U.S.C. § 1117). The maximum term of imprisonment
authorized by statute for solicitation to murder is twenty years (18 U.S.C. § 373). The
statutes that prohibit attempted murder, or assaults with intent to commit murder, vary
November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment 311
– 169 –
widely in the maximum term of imprisonment authorized. Assault with intent to commit
murder (18 U.S.C. § 113(a)) carries a maximum authorized term of twenty years
imprisonment. An attempted assassination of certain essential government officials
(18 U.S.C. § 351(c)) carries a maximum authorized term of life imprisonment. An
attempted murder of foreign officials (18 U.S.C. § 1116(a)) carries a maximum
authorized term of twenty years imprisonment. An attempt to commit murder, other than
an assault with intent to commit murder covered by 18 U.S.C. § 113(a), carries a
maximum term of three years imprisonment (18 U.S.C. § 1113).
Enhancements are provided for planning, weapon use, injury, and commission
of the crime for hire. All of the factors can apply in the case of an assault; only the last
can apply in the case of a conspiracy that does not include an assault; and none can apply
in the case of a mere solicitation.".
The Commentary to §2A2.2 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 3 by inserting
the following additional sentence as the first sentence: "This guideline also covers attempted
manslaughter and assault with intent to commit manslaughter.".
The Commentary to §2A2.2 captioned "Background" is amended in the first sentence of the
first paragraph by deleting "where there is no intent to kill" immediately following " assaults".
Chapter Two, Part A, Subpart 1, is amended by inserting an additional guideline with
accompanying commentary as §2A1.5 (Conspiracy or Solicitation to Commit Murder).
Section 2E1.4(a)(1) is amended by deleting "23" and inserting in lieu thereof "32".
The Commentary to §2E1.4 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by deleting Note 2 as
follows:
"2. If the offense level for the underlying conduct is less than the alternative
minimum base offense level specified (i.e., 23), the alternative minimum base
offense level is to be used.";
and in the caption by deleting "Notes" and inserting in lieu thereof "Note".
The Commentary to §2X1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 1 in the
paragraph beginning "Offense guidelines that expressly cover attempts" by deleting
"Conspiracy or Solicitation to Commit Murder;" immediately before "Attempted Murder"; in
the paragraph beginning "Offense guidelines that expressly cover conspiracies" by deleting
"§2A2.1 (Assault With Intent to Commit Murder; Conspiracy or Solicitation to Commit
Murder; Attempted Murder)" and inserting in lieu thereof "§2A1.5 (Conspiracy or Solicitation
to Commit Murder)"; and in the paragraph beginning "Offense guidelines that expressly cover
solicitations" by deleting "§2A2.1 (Assault With Intent to Commit Murder; Conspiracy or
Solicitation to Commit Murder; Attempted Murder)" and inserting in lieu thereof "§2A1.5
(Conspiracy or Solicitation to Commit Murder)".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment restructures §2A2.1, and increases the offense level
for attempted murder and assault with intent to commit murder where the intended offense, if
successful, would have constituted first degree murder to better reflect the seriousness of this
conduct. For the same reason, the enhancement for an offense involving the offer or receipt of
Amendment 315 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003
– 170 –
anything of pecuniary value for undertaking the murder is increased. For greater clarity, an
additional guideline (§2A1.5) is inserted to cover conspiracy or solicitation to commit murder.
Section 2E1.4 is amended to conform the offense level to that of §2A1.5.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1990.
312. Amendment: Section 2B1.1(b) is amended by transposing subdivisions (4) and (5); and by
renumbering the transposed subdivisions accordingly.
Section 2B1.2(b) is amended by transposing subdivisions (3) and (4); and by renumbering the
transposed subdivisions accordingly.
Section 2B1.3(b) is amended by transposing subdivisions (2) and (3); and by renumbering the
transposed subdivisions accordingly.
Reason for Amendment: This amendment reorders the specific offense characteristics in
§§2B1.1, 2B1.2, and 2B1.3 that address offenses involving U.S. mail. In cases involving the
theft or destruction of U.S. mail, the theft guideline (§2B1.1), stolen property guideline
(§2B1.2), property destruction guideline (§2B1.3), and forgery guideline (§2B5.2) produce
identical results if the amount involved more than $1,000, or if the offense did not involve more
than minimal planning. However, because of the ordering of the specific offense
characteristics, there is a 1 or 2-level difference between §§2B1.1, 2B1.2 and 2B1.3 on the one
hand, and §2B5.2 on the other, in cases of stolen or destroyed mail involving more than
minimal planning and a loss of $1,000 or less. In these cases, §§2B1.1, 2B1.2 and 2B1.3
produce a result that is 1 or 2-levels lower than §2B5.2. This amendment corrects this anomaly
by conforming the offense levels in §§2B1.1, 2B1.2, and 2B1.3 to that of §2B5.2 in such cases.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1990.
313. Section 2B1.3 is amended by inserting the following additional subsection:
"(c) Cross Reference
(1) If the offense involved arson, or property damage by use of explosives,
apply §2K1.4 (Arson; Property Damage by Use of Explosives).";
and in the title by deleting "(Other than by Arson or Explosives)" immediately following "or
Destruction".
The Commentary to §2B1.3 captioned "Statutory Provisions" is amended by deleting the last
sentence as follows:
"Arson is treated separately in Part K, Offenses Involving Public Order and Safety.".
The Commentary to §2H1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 1 by deleting
"(Other than by Arson or Explosives)" immediately following "or Destruction".
Section 2H3.3(a)(3) is amended by deleting "(Other than by Arson or Explosives)" immediately
following "or Destruction".
November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment 314
– 171 –
The Commentary to §2H3.3 captioned "Background" is amended by deleting "(Other than by
Arson or Explosives)" immediately following "or Destruction".
Section 2Q1.6(a)(2) is amended by deleting "(Other Than by Arson or Explosives)"
immediately following "or Destruction".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment inserts a cross reference providing that offense
conduct constituting arson or property destruction by explosives is to be treated under §2K1.4
(Arson, Property Destruction by Explosives). Because arson or property damage by use of
explosives is an aggravated form of property destruction, just as armed robbery is an aggravated
form of robbery, the use of the same "relevant conduct" standard to determine the offense level
is appropriate.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1990.
314. Section 2B3.1(b)(1) is amended by deleting "offense involved robbery or attempted robbery
of the" immediately following "If the"; and by inserting "was taken, or if the taking of such
property was an object of the offense" immediately before ", increase".
The Commentary to §2B3.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 6 by deleting
"actually" immediately following "defendant", and by inserting "; Attempted Murder"
immediately following "Assault With Intent to Commit Murder".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment clarifies the guideline and Commentary.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1990.
315. Amendment: Section 2B2.1(b)(3) is amended by deleting "obtaining" immediately before "a
firearm", and by deleting "an object" and inserting in lieu thereof "taken, or if the taking of such
item was an object".
The Commentary to §2B2.1 is amended by inserting between "Commentary" and "Application
Notes" the following:
"Statutory Provision: 18 U.S.C. § 1153.".
The Commentary to §2B2.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by deleting Note 2 as
follows:
"2. Obtaining a weapon or controlled substance is to be presumed to be an object of
the offense if such an item was in fact taken.";
and by renumbering Notes 3 and 4 as 2 and 3, respectively.
Section 2B2.2(b)(3) is amended by deleting "obtaining" immediately before "a firearm"; and
by deleting "an object" and inserting in lieu thereof "taken, or if the taking of such item was an
object".
The Commentary to §2B2.2 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by deleting Note 2 as
Amendment 317 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003
– 172 –
follows:
"2. Obtaining a weapon or controlled substance is to be presumed to be an object of
the offense if such an item was in fact taken.";
and by renumbering Notes 3 and 4 as 2 and 3, respectively.
Section 2B3.1(b)(5) is amended by deleting "obtaining" immediately before "a firearm"; and
by deleting "the object" and inserting in lieu thereof "taken, or if the taking of such item was
an object".
The Commentary to §2B3.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by deleting Note 5 as
follows:
"5. Obtaining a weapon or controlled substance is to be presumed to be an object of
the offense if such an item was in fact taken.";
and by renumbering Notes 6, 7, and 8 as 5, 6, and 7 respectively.
The Commentary to §2B3.1 captioned "Background" is amended by deleting the second
paragraph as follows:
" Obtaining drugs or other controlled substances is often the motive for robberies
of a Veterans Administration Hospital, a pharmacy on a military base, or a similar
facility. A specific offense characteristic is included for robberies where drugs or
weapons were the object of the offense to take account of the dangers involved when
such items are taken.".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment provides that the specific offense characteristic
related to the taking of a firearm or controlled substance applies whenever such item is taken
or is an object of the offense. Also, it inserts additional Commentary to §2B2.1 referencing a
statutory provision contained in Appendix A (Statutory Index) to conform the format of this
guideline to that of other offense guidelines.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1990.
316. Amendment: Section 2B3.2(b)(1) is amended by deleting "§2B3.1" and inserting in lieu
thereof "§2B2.1(b)(2)".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment references the loss table to §2B2.1(b)(2) rather
than §2B3.1. The amendment to the loss table in §2B3.1, effective November 1, 1989,
inadvertently reduced the offense level for certain cases under this guideline by one level.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1990.
317. Amendment: Section 2B1.1(b) is amended by inserting the following additional subdivision:
"(7) If the offense substantially jeopardized the safety and soundness of a financial
institution, increase by 4 levels. If the resulting offense level is less than level 24,
increase to level 24.".
November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment 317
– 173 –
The Commentary to §2B1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by inserting the
following additional notes:
"9. ‘Financial institution,’ as used in this guideline, is defined to include any
institution described in 18 U.S.C. §§ 215, 656-657, 1005-1008, 1014, and 1344;
any state or foreign bank, trust company, credit union, insurance company,

business), and associations that undertake to provide pension, disability, or other
benefits (e.g., medical or hospitalization insurance) to large numbers of persons.
10. An offense shall be deemed to have ‘substantially jeopardized the safety and

inserting in lieu thereof "289".
The Commentary to §2F1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by inserting the
following additional notes:

additional paragraph at the end:
" Subsection (b)(6) implements, in a broader form, the statutory directive to the
Commission in Section 961(m) of Public Law 101-73.".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment implements, in a broader form, the following

Sentencing Commission shall promulgate guidelines, or amend existing guidelines, to provide
for a substantial period of incarceration for a violation of, or a conspiracy to violate, section

Commentary to §2B4.1, and deletes a reference to a petty offense in the Commentary to §2F1.1

"certain controlled substances. Do not use this table if any more reliable estimate of the total
weight is available from case-specific information".
The Commentary to §2D1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 11 by deleting
the following from the table captioned "Typical Weight Per Unit (Dose, Pill, or Capsule)
Table":
"Bufotenine 1 mg
Diethyltryptamine 60 mg
Dimethyltryptamine 50 mg",
"Barbiturates 100 mg
Glutethimide (Doriden) 500 mg",
"Thiobarbital 50 mg";
by inserting an asterisk immediately after each of the following:
"LSD (Lysergic acid diethylamide)", "MDA", "PCP", "Psilocin", "Psilocybin", "2,5-
Dimethoxy-4-methylamphetamine (STP, DOM)", "Methaqualone", "Amphetamine",
"Methamphetamine", "Phenmetrazine (Preludin)";
and by inserting the following at the end:
November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment 319
– 177 –
"*For controlled substances marked with an asterisk, the weight per unit shown is the
weight of the actual controlled substance, and not generally the weight of the mixture or
substance containing the controlled substance. Therefore, use of this table provides a
very conservative estimate of the total weight.".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment provides an additional equivalency to reflect the
distinction between methamphetamine and pure methamphetamine in the Drug Quantity Table
at §2D1.1(c), corrects an error in the equivalency for Phenylacetone/P2P, and deletes a duplicate
listing for Mephobarbital.
In addition, this amendment clarifies that the "Typical Weight Per Unit Table" in Note 11 of
the Commentary to §2D1.1 is not to be used where a more reliable estimate of the weight of the
mixture or substance containing the controlled substance is available from case-specific
information. This amendment also clarifies that for certain controlled substances this table
provides an estimate of the weight of the actual controlled substance, not necessarily the weight
of the mixture or substance containing the controlled substance, and therefore use of this table
in such cases will provide a very conservative estimate. Finally, this amendment deletes listings
for several controlled substances that are generally legitimately manufactured and then
unlawfully diverted; in such cases, more accurate weight estimates can be obtained from other
sources (e.g., from the Drug Enforcement Administration or the manufacturer).
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1990.
319. Amendment: Section 2D1.2(a)(1) is amended by inserting "applicable to the quantity of
controlled substances directly involving a protected location or an underage or pregnant
individual" immediately following "§2D1.1".
Section §2D1.2(a) is amended by renumbering subdivisions (2) and (3) as (3) and (4),
respectively; and by inserting the following as subdivision (2):
"(2) 1 plus the offense level from §2D1.1 applicable to the total quantity of controlled
substances involved in the offense; or".
The Commentary to §2D1.2 is amended by inserting, immediately before "Background", the
following:
"Application Note:
1. Where only part of the relevant offense conduct directly involved a protected
location or an underage or pregnant individual, subsections (a)(1) and (a)(2) may
result in different offense levels. For example, if the defendant, as part of the
same course of conduct or common scheme or plan, sold 5 grams of heroin near
a protected location and 10 grams of heroin elsewhere, the offense level from
subsection (a)(1) would be level 16 (2 plus the offense level for the sale of 5
grams of heroin, the amount sold near the protected location); the offense level
from subsection (a)(2) would be level 17 (1 plus the offense level for the sale of
15 grams of heroin, the total amount of heroin involved in the offense).".
Amendment 319 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003
– 178 –
Reason for Amendment: This amendment provides for the determination of the offense level
in cases in which only part of the relevant offense conduct involves a protected location or an
underage or pregnant individual.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1990.
320. Amendment: Section 2D1.6 is amended by deleting "12" and inserting in lieu thereof: "the
offense level applicable to the underlying offense.".
The Commentary to §2D1.6 is amended by inserting, immediately before "Background", the
following:
"Application Note:
1. Where the offense level for the underlying offense is to be determined by
reference to §2D1.1, see Application Note 12 of the Commentary to §2D1.1, and
Application Notes 1 and 2 of the Commentary to §2D1.4, for guidance in
determining the scale of the offense. Note that the Drug Quantity Table in
§2D1.1 provides a minimum offense level of 12 where the offense involves
heroin (or other Schedule I or II Opiates), cocaine (or other Schedule I or II
Stimulants), cocaine base, PCP, Methamphetamine, LSD (or other Schedule I or
II Hallucinogens), Fentanyl, or Fentanyl Analogue (§2D1.1(c)(16)); and a
minimum offense level of 6 otherwise (§2D1.1(c)(19)).".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment is designed to reduce unwarranted disparity by
requiring consideration in the guideline of the amount of the controlled substance involved in
the offense, thus conforming this guideline section to the structure of §§2D1.1, 2D1.2, 2D1.4,
and 2D1.5. The statute to which this guideline applies (21 U.S.C. § 843(b)) prohibits the use
of a communications facility to commit, cause, or facilitate a felony controlled substance
offense. Frequently, a conviction under this statute is the result of a plea bargain because the
statute has a low maximum (four years with no prior felony drug conviction; eight years with
a prior felony drug conviction) and no mandatory minimum. The current guideline has a base
offense level of 12 and no specific offense characteristics. Therefore, the scale of the
underlying drug offense is not reflected in the guideline. This results in a departure from the
guideline range frequently being warranted. Without guidance as to whether or how far to
depart, the potential for unwarranted disparity is substantial. Under this amendment, the
guideline itself will take into account the scale of the underlying offense.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1990.
321. Amendment: Section 2D2.1(a)(1) is amended by deleting "or an analogue of these" and
inserting in lieu thereof "an analogue of these, or cocaine base".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment specifies the appropriate offense level for
possession of cocaine base ("crack") in cases not covered by the enhanced penalties created by
section 6371 of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1990.
November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment 323
– 179 –
322. Amendment: Section 2G1.1(c)(1) is amended by deleting "involves" and inserting in lieu
thereof "involved".
The Commentary to §2G1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 3 by inserting
at the end:
"This factor would apply, for example, where the ability of the person being transported
to appraise or control conduct was substantially impaired by drugs or alcohol. In the case
of transportation involving an adult, rather than a minor, this characteristic generally will
not apply where the alcohol or drug was voluntarily taken.".
The Commentary to §2G1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 5 by deleting
", distinct offense, even if several persons are transported in a single act" and inserting in lieu
thereof:
"victim. Consequently, multiple counts involving the transportation of different persons
are not to be grouped together under §3D1.2 (Groups of Closely-Related Counts).
Special instruction (c)(1) directs that if the relevant conduct of an offense of conviction
includes more than one person being transported, whether specifically cited in the count
of conviction or not, each such person shall be treated as if contained in a separate count
of conviction".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment clarifies the application of this guideline and
corrects a clerical error.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1990.
323. Amendment: Section 2G1.2(c)(1) is amended by deleting "involves" and inserting in lieu
thereof "involved".
Section 2G1.2 is amended by inserting the following additional subsection:
"(d) Cross Reference
(1) If the offense involved the defendant causing, transporting, permitting, or
offering or seeking by notice or advertisement, a minor to engage in
sexually explicit conduct for the purpose of producing a visual depiction
of such conduct, apply §2G2.1 (Sexually Exploiting a Minor by
Production of Sexually Explicit Visual or Printed Material; Custodian
Permitting Minor to Engage in Sexually Explicit Conduct; Advertisement
for Minors to Engage in Production).".
The Commentary to §2G1.2 captioned "Statutory Provisions" is amended by deleting "§ 2423"
and inserting in lieu thereof "§§ 2421, 2422, 2423".
The Commentary to §2G1.2 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 1 by deleting
", distinct offense, even if several persons are transported in a single act" and inserting in lieu
thereof:
Amendment 323 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003
– 180 –
"victim. Consequently, multiple counts involving the transportation of different persons
are not to be grouped together under §3D1.2 (Groups of Closely-Related Counts).
Special instruction (c)(1) directs that if the relevant conduct of an offense of conviction
includes more than one person being transported, whether specifically cited in the count
of conviction or not, each such person shall be treated as if contained in a separate count
of conviction".
The Commentary to §2G1.2 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 3 by inserting
the following at the end:
"This factor would apply, for example, where the ability of the person being transported
to appraise or control conduct was substantially impaired by drugs or alcohol.".
The Commentary to §2G1.2 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by inserting the
following additional notes:
"4. ‘Sexually explicit conduct,’ as used in this guideline, has the meaning set forth
in 18 U.S.C. § 2256.
5. The cross reference in (d)(1) is to be construed broadly to include all instances
where the offense involved employing, using, persuading, inducing, enticing,
coercing, transporting, permitting, or offering or seeking by notice or
advertisement, a minor to engage in sexually explicit conduct for the purpose of
producing any visual depiction of such conduct.".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment clarifies the application of this guideline and
corrects a clerical error. In addition, a cross reference to §2G2.1 is inserted where the offense
involves conduct that is more appropriately covered by that guideline to provide an offense
level that more appropriately reflects the seriousness of such conduct.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1990.
324. Amendment: Section 2G2.1 is amended in the title by inserting "; Custodian Permitting Minor
to Engage in Sexually Explicit Conduct; Advertisement for Minors to Engage in Production"
immediately following "Printed Material".
Section 2G2.1 is amended by deleting:
"(1) If the minor was under the age of twelve years, increase by 2 levels.";
and inserting in lieu thereof:
"(1) If the offense involved a minor under the age of twelve years, increase by
4 levels; otherwise, if the offense involved a minor under the age of
sixteen years, increase by 2 levels.
(2) If the defendant was a parent, relative, or legal guardian of the minor
involved in the offense, or if the minor was otherwise in the custody, care,
or supervisory control of the defendant, increase by 2 levels.
November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment 324
– 181 –
(c) Special Instruction
(1) If the offense involved the exploitation of more than one minor, Chapter
Three, Part D (Multiple Counts) shall be applied as if the exploitation of
each minor had been contained in a separate count of conviction.";
and by deleting "Characteristic" and inserting in lieu thereof "Characteristics".
The Commentary to §2G2.1 captioned "Statutory Provisions" is amended by deleting "8 U.S.C.
§ 1328;"; and by inserting "(a), (b), (c)(1)(B)" immediately following "18 U.S.C. § 2251".
The Commentary to §2G2.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 1 by inserting
at the end:
"Special instruction (c)(1) directs that if the relevant conduct of an offense of conviction
includes more than one minor being exploited, whether specifically cited in the count of
conviction or not, each such minor shall be treated as if contained in a separate count of
conviction.".
The Commentary to §2G2.1 captioned "Application Note" is amended by inserting the
following additional notes:
"2. Specific offense characteristic (b)(2) is intended to have broad application and
includes offenses involving a minor entrusted to the defendant, whether
temporarily or permanently. For example, teachers, day care providers, baby-
sitters, or other temporary caretakers are among those who would be subject to
this enhancement. In determining whether to apply this adjustment, the court
should look to the actual relationship that existed between the defendant and the
child and not simply to the legal status of the defendant-child relationship.
3. If specific offense characteristic (b)(2) applies, no adjustment is to be made under
§3B1.3 (Abuse of Position of Trust or Use of Special Skill).";
and in the caption by deleting "Note" and inserting in lieu thereof "Notes".
The Commentary to §2G2.1 captioned "Background" is deleted in its entirety as follows:
"Background: This offense commonly involves the production source of a child
pornography enterprise. Because the offense directly involves the exploitation of minors,
the base offense level is higher than for the distribution of the sexually explicit material
after production. An enhancement is provided when the conduct involves the
exploitation of a minor under age twelve to reflect the more serious nature of exploiting
young children.".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment revises subsection (b)(1) to provide distinctions
for the age of the victim consistent with §2G1.2, and adds subsection (b)(2) to provide an
increase for defendants who abuse a position of trust in exploiting minor children. A special
instruction is added to conform the operation of the multiple count rule in this guideline with
§§2G1.1 and 2G1.2. A revision to the statutory provisions removes 8 U.S.C. § 1328; such
Amendment 324 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003
– 182 –
offenses are now brought under this guideline by the cross reference appearing in §2G1.2. In
addition, the reference in the statutory provisions to 18 U.S.C. § 2251 is made specific to the
appropriate subsections.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1990.
325. Amendment: Section 2G2.2 is amended by inserting the following at the end:
" (3) If the offense involved material that portrays sadistic or masochistic
conduct or other depictions of violence, increase by 4 levels.
(c) Cross Reference
(1) If the offense involved causing, transporting, permitting, or offering or
seeking by notice or advertisement, a minor to engage in sexually explicit
conduct for the purpose of producing a visual depiction of such conduct,
apply §2G2.1 (Sexually Exploiting a Minor by Production of Sexually
Explicit Visual or Printed Material; Custodian Permitting Minor to
Engage in Sexually Explicit Conduct; Advertisement for Minors to
Engage in Production) if the resulting offense level is greater than that
determined above.".
The Commentary to §2G2.2 captioned "Statutory Provision" is amended by deleting
"Provision" and inserting in lieu thereof "Provisions"; and by inserting "§ 1460, 2251(c)(1)(A),"
immediately before "2252".
The Commentary to §2G2.2 captioned "Application Note" is amended by inserting the
following additional notes:
"2. ‘Sexually explicit conduct,’ as used in this guideline, has the meaning set forth
in 18 U.S.C. § 2256.
3. The cross reference in (c)(1) is to be construed broadly to include all instances
where the offense involved employing, using, persuading, inducing, enticing,
coercing, transporting, permitting, or offering or seeking by notice or
advertisement, a minor to engage in sexually explicit conduct for the purpose of
producing any visual depiction of such conduct.
4. If the defendant sexually abused a minor at any time, whether or not such sexual
abuse occurred during the course of the offense, an upward departure is
warranted. In determining the extent of such a departure, the court should take
into consideration the offense levels provided in §§2A3.1, 2A3.2, and 2A3.4
most commensurate with the defendant’s conduct.";
and in the caption by deleting "Note" and inserting in lieu thereof "Notes".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment provides a specific offense characteristic for
materials involving depictions of sadistic or masochistic conduct or other violence, and a cross
reference for offenses more appropriately treated under §2G2.1. It also provides Commentary
November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment 327
– 183 –
recommending consideration of an upward departure in cases in which the defendant has
sexually abused a minor at any time, whether or not such sexual abuse occurred during the
course of the instant offense. In addition, it inserts a statutory provision indicating the
applicability of this guideline to violations of 18 U.S.C. § 2251(c)(1)(A).
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1990.
326. Amendment: Section 2G3.1(b)(2) is amended by deleting "sadomasochistic" and inserting in
lieu thereof "sadistic or masochistic".
Section 2G3.1(c) is amended by deleting:
"(1) If the offense involved a criminal enterprise, apply the appropriate guideline from
Chapter Two, Part E (Offenses Involving Criminal Enterprises and Racketeering)
if the resulting offense level is greater than that determined above.",
and inserting in lieu thereof:
"(1) If the offense involved transporting, distributing, receiving, possessing, or
advertising to receive material involving the sexual exploitation of a minor, apply
§2G2.2 (Transporting, Receiving, or Trafficking in Material Involving the Sexual
Exploitation of a Minor).".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment inserts a cross reference to §2G2.2 for offenses
involving materials which, in fact, depict children to ensure that the penalties for such offenses
adequately reflect their seriousness. The current cross reference at subsection (c)(1) is deleted.
In addition, the amendment conforms the terminology of specific offense characteristic (b)(2)
to that used in other offense guidelines.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1990.
327. Amendment: Section 2H1.1 is amended in the title by inserting "Conspiracy to Interfere with
Civil Rights;" immediately before "Going".
Chapter Two, Part H, Subpart 1 is amended by deleting §2H1.2 in its entirety as follows:
"§2H1.2. Conspiracy to Interfere with Civil Rights
(a) Base Offense Level (Apply the greater):
(1) 13; or
(2) 2 plus the offense level applicable to any underlying
offense.
(b) Specific Offense Characteristic
(1) If the defendant was a public official at the time of the
Amendment 327 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003
– 184 –
offense, increase by 4 levels.
Commentary
Statutory Provision: 18 U.S.C. § 241.
Application Notes:
1. ‘2 plus the offense level applicable to any underlying offense’ is defined in the
Commentary to §2H1.1.
2. Where the adjustment in §2H1.2(b)(1) is applied, do not apply §3B1.3 (Abuse of
Position of Trust or Use of Special Skill).
Background: This section applies to conspiracies to interfere with civil rights. The
maximum term of imprisonment authorized by statute is ten years; except where death
results, the maximum term of imprisonment authorized by statute is life imprisonment.
The base offense level for this guideline assumes threatening or otherwise serious
conduct.".
The Commentary to §2X1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 1 in the
paragraph beginning "Offense guidelines that expressly cover conspiracies" by deleting
"§2H1.2 (Conspiracy to Interfere with Civil Rights)" and inserting in lieu thereof "§2H1.1
(Conspiracy to Interfere With Civil Rights; Going in Disguise to Deprive of Rights)".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment consolidates two guidelines and raises the
minimum base offense level from level 13 to level 15 for cases currently covered under §2H1.2
to better reflect the seriousness of this offense.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1990.
328. Amendment: The Commentary to §2H1.5 captioned "Statutory Provisions" is amended by
deleting "Provisions" and inserting in lieu thereof "Provision"; and by deleting "; 42 U.S.C. §
3631".
The Commentary to §2H1.5 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by deleting Note 3 as
follows:
"3. In the case of a violation of 42 U.S.C. § 3631, apply this guideline where the
offense did not involve the threat or use of force. If the offense involved the
threat or use of force, apply §2H1.3.".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment deletes references to a statute to which this
guideline does not apply.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1990.
329. Amendment: Section 2J1.6 is amended by deleting:
November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment 329
– 185 –
"(a) Base Offense Level: 6
(b) Specific Offense Characteristics
(1) If the underlying offense is punishable by death or imprisonment for a
term of fifteen years or more, increase by 9 levels.
(2) If the underlying offense is punishable by a term of imprisonment of five
or more years, but less than fifteen years, increase by 6 levels.
(3) If the underlying offense is a felony punishable by a maximum term of
less than five years, increase by 3 levels.",
and inserting in lieu thereof:
"(a) Base Offense Level:
(1) 11, if the offense constituted a failure to report for service of sentence; or
(2) 6, otherwise.
(b) Specific Offense Characteristics
(1) If the base offense level is determined under subsection (a)(1), and the
defendant --
(A) voluntarily surrendered within 96 hours of the time he was
originally scheduled to report, decrease by 5 levels; or
(B) was ordered to report to a community corrections center,
community treatment center, ‘halfway house,’ or similar facility,
and subdivision (A) above does not apply, decrease by 2 levels.
Provided, however, that this reduction shall not apply if the defendant,
while away from the facility, committed any federal, state, or local
offense punishable by a term of imprisonment of one year or more.
(2) If the base offense level is determined under subsection (a)(2), and the
underlying offense is --
(A) punishable by death or imprisonment for a term of fifteen years
or more, increase by 9 levels; or
(B) punishable by a term of imprisonment of five years or more, but
less than fifteen years, increase by 6 levels; or
(C) a felony punishable by a term of imprisonment of less than five
years, increase by 3 levels.".
Amendment 329 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003
– 186 –
The Commentary to §2J1.6 captioned "Background" is amended by deleting "The offense level
for this offense" and inserting in lieu thereof "Where the base offense level is determined under
subsection (a)(2), the offense level".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment provides greater differentiation in the guideline
offense levels for the various types of conduct covered by this guideline.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1990.
330. Amendment: Chapter Two, Part K, Subpart 1 is amended by deleting §2K1.4 in its entirety
as follows:
"§2K1.4. Arson; Property Damage By Use of Explosives
(a) Base Offense Level: 6
(b) Specific Offense Characteristics
If more than one applies, use the greatest:
(1) If the defendant knowingly created a substantial risk of
death or serious bodily injury, increase by 18 levels.
(2) If the defendant recklessly endangered the safety of
another, increase by 14 levels.
(3) If the offense involved destruction or attempted
destruction of a residence, increase by 12 levels.
(4) If the defendant used fire or an explosive to commit
another offense that is a felony under federal law, or
carried explosives during the commission of any offense
that is a felony under federal law (i.e., the defendant is
convicted under 18 U.S.C. § 844(h)), increase by
7 levels.
(5) If the defendant endangered the safety of another person,
increase by 4 levels.
(6) If a destructive device was used, increase by 2 levels.
(c) Cross References
(1) If the defendant caused death, or intended to cause bodily
injury, apply the most analogous guideline from
Chapter Two, Part A (Offenses Against the Person) if the
resulting offense level is greater than that determined
above.
November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment 330
– 187 –
(2) Apply §2B1.3 (Property Damage or Destruction) if the
resulting offense level is greater than that determined
above.
(d) Note
(1) The specific offense characteristic in subsection (b)(4)
applies only in the case of an offense committed prior to
November 18, 1988.
Commentary
Statutory Provisions: 18 U.S.C. §§ 32, 33, 81, 844(f), (h) (only in the case of an
offense committed prior to November 18, 1988), (i), 1153, 1855, 2275.
Application Notes:
1. ‘Destructive device’ means any article described in 18 U.S.C. § 921(a)(4)
(for example, explosive, incendiary, or poison gas bombs, grenades,
mines, and similar devices and certain rockets, missiles, and large bore
weapons).
2. If bodily injury resulted, an upward departure may be warranted. See
Chapter Five, Part K (Departures).
Background: Review of presentence reports indicates that many arson cases
involve ‘malicious mischief,’ i.e., minor property damage under circumstances
that do not present an appreciable danger. A low base offense level is provided
for these cases. However, aggravating factors are provided for instances where
a defendant knowingly or recklessly endangered others, destroyed or attempted
to destroy a residence, used a destructive device, or otherwise endangered others.
As amended by Section 6474(b) of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 (effective
November 18, 1988), 18 U.S.C. § 844(h) sets forth a mandatory sentencing
enhancement of five years for the first offense and ten years for subsequent
offenses if the defendant was convicted of using fire or an explosive to commit
a felony or of carrying an explosive during the commission of a felony. See
§2K1.7.".
A replacement guideline with accompanying commentary is inserted as §2K1.4 (Arson;
Property Damage by Use of Explosives).
Reason for Amendment: This amendment restructures this guideline to provide more
appropriate offense levels for the conduct covered. The Commission has determined that the
offense levels provided in the current guideline do not adequately reflect the seriousness of the
offenses that are covered under this section.
Amendment 330 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003
– 188 –
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1990.
331. Amendment: Section 2K1.6(a) is amended by deleting "greater" and inserting in lieu thereof
"greatest"; and by inserting the following additional subdivision:
"(3) If death resulted, apply the most analogous guideline from Chapter Two, Part A,
Subpart 1 (Homicide).".
Section 2K1.6(a)(2) is amended by deleting the period at the end and inserting in lieu thereof
"; or".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment adds an additional alternative base offense level
to cover the situation in which the commission of this offense results in death.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1990.
332. Amendment: Section 2K1.7 is amended by inserting "(a)" immediately before "If"; and by
inserting the following additional subsection:
"(b) Special Instruction for Fines
(1) Where there is a federal conviction for the underlying offense, the fine
guideline shall be the fine guideline that would have been applicable had
there only been a conviction for the underlying offense. This guideline
shall be used as a consolidated fine guideline for both the underlying
offense and the conviction underlying this section.".
The Commentary to §2K1.7 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by inserting the
following additional notes:
"3. Where a sentence under this section is imposed in conjunction with a sentence for
an underlying offense, any specific offense characteristic for the use of fire or
explosives is not to be applied in respect to the guideline for the underlying
offense.
4. Subsection (b) sets forth special provisions concerning the imposition of fines.
Where there is also a conviction for the underlying offense, a consolidated fine
guideline is determined by the offense level that would have applied to the
underlying offense absent a conviction under 18 U.S.C. § 844(h). This is
required because the offense level for the underlying offense may be reduced in
that any specific offense characteristic for use of fire or explosives would not be
applied (see Application Note 3). The Commission has not established a fine
guideline range for the unusual case in which there is no conviction for the
underlying offense, although a fine is authorized under 18 U.S.C. § 3571.".
The Commentary to §2K2.4 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 4 in the third
sentence by inserting "required" immediately before "because"; and by inserting ", although a
fine is authorized under 18 U.S.C. § 3571" immediately before the period at the end of the last
November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment 335
– 189 –
sentence.
Reason for Amendment: This amendment conforms §2K1.7 to §2K2.4, which includes
specific instructions concerning treatment of fines and double counting. Both sections are based
upon similarly written statutes that provide for a fixed mandatory, consecutive sentence of
imprisonment. In addition, Application Note 4 of the Commentary to §2K2.4 is revised and
expanded for greater clarity.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1990.
333. Amendment: Section 2K2.1(a)(1) is amended by deleting "16" and inserting in lieu thereof
"18".
Section 2K2.1(b)(1) is amended by inserting ", other than a firearm covered in 26 U.S.C.
§ 5845(a)," immediately following "ammunition".
Section 2K2.2(a)(1) is amended by deleting "16" and inserting in lieu thereof "18".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment provides that the reduction in offense level under
subsection (b)(1) for possession of a weapon for sporting purposes or collection may not be
applied in the case of any weapon described in 26 U.S.C. § 5845(a). In addition, the
amendment increases the base offense level in subsection (a)(1) of §§2K2.1 and 2K2.2 from
16 to 18 to better reflect the seriousness of the conduct covered.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1990.
334. Amendment: Chapter Two, Part K, Subpart 3 is amended by inserting an additional guideline
with accompanying commentary as §2K3.2 (Feloniously Mailing Injurious Articles).
Reason for Amendment: This amendment adds an additional guideline covering the felony
provisions of 18 U.S.C. § 1716.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1990.
335. Amendment: Section 2L1.1(b)(1) is amended by deleting "and without knowledge that the
alien was excludable under 8 U.S.C. §§ 1182(a)(27), (28), (29)," immediately before
"decrease".
The Commentary to §2L1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by deleting:
"7. 8 U.S.C. §§ 1182(a)(27), (a)(28), and (a)(29) concern certain aliens who are
excludable because they are subversives.",
and inserting in lieu thereof:
"7. Where the defendant smuggled, transported, or harbored an alien knowing that
the alien intended to enter the United States to engage in subversive activity, an
upward departure may be warranted.".
Amendment 335 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003
– 190 –
The Commentary to §2L1.1 captioned "Background" is amended in the second sentence by
deleting "and did not know the alien was excludable as a subversive" immediately following
"profit".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment deletes a portion of specific offense characteristic
(b)(1) that is unclear in application, and in any event rarely occurs, and replaces it with an
application note indicating that an upward departure may be warranted in the circumstances
specified.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1990.
336. Amendment: Section 2M4.1(b)(1) is amended by deleting "while" and inserting in lieu thereof
"at a time when"; and by deleting "into the armed services, other than in time of war or armed
conflict" and inserting in lieu thereof "for compulsory military service".
The Commentary to §2M4.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by deleting:
"1. ‘While persons were being inducted into the armed services’ means at a time of
compulsory military service under the Selective Service laws.
2. The Commission has not considered the appropriate sanction for this offense
when persons are being inducted during time of war or armed conflict.",
and inserting in lieu thereof:
"1. Subsection (b)(1) does not distinguish between whether the offense was
committed in peacetime or during time of war or armed conflict. If the offense
was committed when persons were being inducted for compulsory military
service during time of war or armed conflict, an upward departure may be
warranted.";
and in the caption by deleting "Notes" and inserting in lieu thereof "Note".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment clarifies this guideline and deletes language that
produced the anomalous result of a lower offense level for failure to register and evasion of
military service in time of war or armed conflict than during a peacetime draft. In addition, the
amendment makes a technical correction to the language of the guideline that enables the
elimination of current Application Note 1.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1990.
337. Amendment: Section 2M5.2 is amended by deleting:
"(a) Base Offense Level (Apply the greater):
(1) 22, if sophisticated weaponry was involved; or
(2) 14.",
November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment 338
– 191 –
and inserting in lieu thereof:
"(a) Base Offense Level:
(1) 22, except as provided in subdivision (2) below;
(2) 14, if the offense involved only non-fully-automatic small arms (rifles,
handguns, or shotguns), and the number of weapons did not exceed ten.".
The Commentary to §2M5.2 captioned "Statutory Provision" is amended by deleting
"Provision" and inserting in lieu thereof "Provisions", and by deleting "§ 2778" and inserting
in lieu thereof "§§ 2778, 2780".
The Commentary to §2M5.2 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 1 by inserting,
immediately before "In the case of a violation", the following:
"Under 22 U.S.C. § 2778, the President is authorized, through a licensing system
administered by the Department of State, to control exports of defense articles and
defense services that he deems critical to a security or foreign policy interest of the
United States. The items subject to control constitute the United States Munitions List,
which is set out in 22 C.F.R. Part 121.1. Included in this list are such things as military
aircraft, helicopters, artillery, shells, missiles, rockets, bombs, vessels of war, explosives,
military and space electronics, and certain firearms.
The base offense level assumes that the offense conduct was harmful or had the potential
to be harmful to a security or foreign policy interest of the United States. In the unusual
case where the offense conduct posed no such risk, a downward departure may be
warranted.".
The Commentary to §2M5.2 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in the first sentence of
Note 2 by inserting "or foreign policy" immediately before "interest".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment revises this guideline to better distinguish the more
and less serious forms of offense conduct covered.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1990.
338. Amendment: Section 2N1.1 is amended by inserting the following additional subsection:
"(b) Cross Reference
(1) If the offense involved extortion, apply §2B3.2 (Extortion by Force or
Threat of Injury or Serious Damage) if the resulting offense level is
greater than that determined above.".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment adds a cross reference to ensure that in the case of
an offense involving extortion, the offense level will not be lower than that under §2B3.2.
Amendment 338 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003
– 192 –
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1990.
339. Amendment: Section 2N1.2 is amended by deleting:
"(a) Base Offense Level (Apply the greater):
(1) 16;
(2) If the offense involved extortion, apply §2B3.2.",
and inserting in lieu thereof:
"(a) Base Offense Level: 16
(b) Cross Reference
(1) If the offense involved extortion, apply §2B3.2 (Extortion by Force or
Threat of Injury or Serious Damage).".
The Commentary to §2N1.2 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by deleting Note 1 as
follows:
"1. If the offense involved extortion, apply the guideline from §2B3.2 (Extortion by
Force or Threat of Injury or Serious Damage) rather than the guideline from this
section.";
by renumbering Note 2 as Note 1; and in the caption by deleting "Notes" and inserting in lieu
thereof "Note".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment conforms the structure of this guideline to that used
in other guidelines. No substantive change results.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1990.
340. Amendment: The Commentary to §2N2.1 captioned "Statutory Provisions" is amended by
inserting "(a)(1), (a)(2), (b)" immediately after "333".
The Commentary to §2N2.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by inserting the
following additional note:
"4. The Commission has not promulgated a guideline for violations of 21 U.S.C. §
333(e) (offenses involving anabolic steroids).".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment provides that §2N2.1 does not apply to convictions
under 21 U.S.C. § 333(e).
November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment 342
– 193 –
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1990.
341. Amendment: Section 2P1.1(b)(2) is amended by inserting the following at the end:
"Provided, however, that this reduction shall not apply if the defendant, while away from
the facility, committed any federal, state, or local offense punishable by a term of
imprisonment of one year or more.".
Section 2P1.1(b) is amended by renumbering subdivision (3) as (4); and by inserting the
following as subdivision (3):
"(3) If the defendant escaped from the non-secure custody of a community corrections
center, community treatment center, ‘halfway house,’ or similar facility, and
subsection (b)(2) is not applicable, decrease the offense level under subsection
(a)(1) by 4 levels or the offense level under subsection (a)(2) by 2 levels.
Provided, however, that this reduction shall not apply if the defendant, while
away from the facility, committed any federal, state, or local offense punishable
by a term of imprisonment of one year or more.".
The Commentary to §2P1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 3 by deleting
"§2P1.1(b)(3)" and inserting in lieu thereof "subsection (b)(4)".
The Commentary to §2P1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by inserting the
following additional note:
"5. Criminal history points under Chapter Four, Part A (Criminal History) are to be
determined independently of the application of this guideline. For example, in
the case of a defendant serving a one-year sentence of imprisonment at the time
of the escape, criminal history points from §4A1.1(b) (for the sentence being
served at the time of the escape), §4A1.1(d) (custody status), and §4A1.1(e)
(recency) would be applicable.".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment provides greater differentiation in the guideline
offense levels for the various types of conduct covered by this guideline. In addition, it clarifies
that, where the instant offense is escape, criminal history points from §4A1.1(d) or (e), or both,
may be applicable and that the addition of such points does not constitute unintended double
counting.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1990.
342. Amendment: The Introductory Commentary to Chapter Two, Part S, is deleted in its entirety
as follows:
"Introductory Commentary
Money laundering activities are essential to the operation of organized crime.
Congress recently enacted new statutes prohibiting these activities and increased the
maximum penalties.
Amendment 342 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003
– 194 –
The guidelines provide substantially increased punishments for these offenses.
In fiscal year 1985, the time served by defendants convicted of felonies involving
monetary transaction reporting under 31 U.S.C. §§ 5313, 5316, and 5322 averaged about
ten months, and only a few defendants served as much as four to five years. However,
courts have been imposing higher sentences as they come to appreciate the seriousness
of this activity, and sentences as long as thirty-five years have been reported.
Specifically, Congress made all reporting violations felonies in 1984, and enacted the
Money Laundering Control Act of 1986 (18 U.S.C. §§ 1956, 1957), which creates new
offenses and provides higher maximum sentences when knowledge, facilitation or
concealment of serious criminal activity is proved.".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment deletes the introductory commentary to this part
as outdated, inconsistent with the commentaries to other sections, and better covered in the
individual commentaries to the offenses contained in the part.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1990.
343. Amendment: The Commentary to §2T1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note
5 by deleting:
"‘racketeering activity’ as defined in 18 U.S.C. § 1961. If §2T1.1(b)(1) applies, do not
apply §4B1.3 (Criminal Livelihood), which is substantially duplicative",
and inserting in lieu thereof:
"conduct constituting a criminal offense under federal, state, or local law".
The Commentary to §2T1.2 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 1 by deleting:
"‘racketeering activity’ as defined in 18 U.S.C. § 1961. If §2T1.2(b)(1) applies, do not
apply §4B1.3 (Criminal Livelihood), which is substantially duplicative",
and inserting in lieu thereof:
"conduct constituting a criminal offense under federal, state, or local law".
The Commentary to §2T1.3 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 1 by deleting:
"‘racketeering activity’ as defined in 18 U.S.C. § 1961. If §2T1.3(b)(1) applies, do not
apply §4B1.3 (Criminal Livelihood), which is substantially duplicative",
and inserting in lieu thereof:
"conduct constituting a criminal offense under federal, state, or local law".
The Commentary to §2T1.4 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 1 by deleting
the last sentence as follows:
"If this subsection applies, do not apply §4B1.3 (Criminal Livelihood) which is
November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment 345
– 195 –
substantially duplicative.".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment deletes the portion of these application notes
concerning application of §4B1.3 (Criminal Livelihood) because this commentary conflicts
with the principle expressed in Application Note 5 of the Commentary to §1B1.1 (when two
guideline provisions are equally applicable, the one producing the greater offense level
controls). In addition, this amendment broadens the definition of "criminal activity" to cover
any criminal violation of federal, state, or local law.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1990.
344. Amendment: The Introductory Commentary to Chapter Three, Part A is amended by deleting
the second sentence as follows: "They are to be treated as specific offense characteristics.".
The Commentary to §3A1.1 (Vulnerable Victim) captioned "Application Notes" is amended
in Note 2 by inserting the following at the end:
"For example, where the offense guideline provides an enhancement for the age of the
victim, this guideline should not be applied unless the victim was unusually vulnerable
for reasons unrelated to age.".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment clarifies the application of §3A1.1, and eliminates
an unnecessary and confusing sentence in the introductory commentary to this part.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1990.
345. Amendment: The Introductory Commentary to Chapter Three, Part B, is amended by
beginning a new paragraph with the second sentence; and by inserting, immediately after the
first sentence, the following:
"The determination of a defendant’s role in the offense is to be made on the basis of all
conduct within the scope of §1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct), i.e., all conduct included under
§1B1.3(a)(1)-(4), and not solely on the basis of elements and acts cited in the count of
conviction. However, where the defendant has received mitigation by virtue of being
convicted of an offense significantly less serious than his actual criminal conduct, e.g.,
the defendant is convicted of unlawful possession of a controlled substance but his actual
conduct involved drug trafficking, a further reduction in the offense level under §3B1.2
(Mitigating Role) ordinarily is not warranted because the defendant is not substantially
less culpable than a defendant whose only conduct involved the less serious offense.".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment clarifies the conduct that is relevant to the
determination of Chapter Three, Part B, and clarifies the operation of §3B1.2 in certain cases.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1990.
346. Amendment: Section 3B1.3 is amended in the second sentence by deleting "in addition to that
provided for in §3B1.1, nor may it be employed" immediately following "may not be
employed"; and by inserting the following additional sentence at the end:
Amendment 347 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003
– 196 –
"If this adjustment is based upon an abuse of a position of trust, it may be employed in
addition to an adjustment under §3B1.1 (Aggravating Role); if this adjustment is based
solely on the use of a special skill, it may not be employed in addition to an adjustment
under §3B1.1 (Aggravating Role).".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment provides that the enhancement for abuse of a
position of trust may apply in addition to an enhancement for an aggravating role under §3B1.1.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1990.
347. Amendment: Section 3C1.1 is amended in the title by deleting "Willfully Obstructing or
Impeding Proceedings" and inserting in lieu thereof "Obstructing or Impeding the
Administration of Justice".
Section 3C1.1 is amended by deleting "impeded or obstructed, or attempted to impede or
obstruct" and inserting in lieu thereof "obstructed or impeded, or attempted to obstruct or
impede,"; and by deleting "or prosecution" and inserting in lieu thereof ", prosecution, or
sentencing".
The Commentary to §3C1.1 is amended by deleting the introductory paragraph immediately
before "Application Notes" as follows:
" This section provides a sentence enhancement for a defendant who engages in
conduct calculated to mislead or deceive authorities or those involved in a judicial
proceeding, or otherwise to willfully interfere with the disposition of criminal charges,
in respect to the instant offense.".
The Commentary to §3C1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by deleting Notes 1-4
as follows:
"1. The following conduct, while not exclusive, may provide a basis for applying this
adjustment:
(a) destroying or concealing material evidence, or attempting to do so;
(b) directing or procuring another person to destroy or conceal material
evidence, or attempting to do so;
(c) testifying untruthfully or suborning untruthful testimony concerning a
material fact, or producing or attempting to produce an altered, forged, or
counterfeit document or record during a preliminary or grand jury
proceeding, trial, sentencing proceeding, or any other judicial proceeding;
(d) threatening, intimidating, or otherwise unlawfully attempting to influence
a co-defendant, witness, or juror, directly or indirectly;
(e) furnishing material falsehoods to a probation officer in the course of a
presentence or other investigation for the court.
November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment 347
– 197 –
2. In applying this provision, suspect testimony and statements should be evaluated
in a light most favorable to the defendant.
3. This provision is not intended to punish a defendant for the exercise of a
constitutional right. A defendant’s denial of guilt is not a basis for application of
this provision.
4. Where the defendant is convicted for an offense covered by §2J1.1 (Contempt),
§2J1.2 (Obstruction of Justice), §2J1.3 (Perjury), §2J1.8 (Bribery of Witness), or
§2J1.9 (Payment to Witness), this adjustment is not to be applied to the offense
level for that offense except where a significant further obstruction occurred
during the investigation or prosecution of the obstruction offense itself (e.g.,
where the defendant threatened a witness during the course of the prosecution for
the obstruction offense). Where the defendant is convicted both of the
obstruction offense and the underlying offense, the count for the obstruction
offense will be grouped with the count for the underlying offense under
subsection (c) of §3D1.2 (Groups of Closely-Related Counts). The offense level
for that Group of Closely-Related Counts will be the offense level for the
underlying offense increased by the 2-level adjustment specified by this section,
or the offense level for the obstruction offense, whichever is greater.",
and inserting in lieu thereof:
"1. This provision is not intended to punish a defendant for the exercise of a
constitutional right. A defendant’s denial of guilt (other than a denial of guilt
under oath that constitutes perjury), refusal to admit guilt or provide information
to a probation officer, or refusal to enter a plea of guilty is not a basis for
application of this provision. In applying this provision, the defendant’s
testimony and statements should be evaluated in a light most favorable to the
defendant.
2. Obstructive conduct can vary widely in nature, degree of planning, and
seriousness. Application Note 3 sets forth examples of the types of conduct to
which this enhancement is intended to apply. Application Note 4 sets forth
examples of less serious forms of conduct to which this enhancement is not
intended to apply, but that ordinarily can appropriately be sanctioned by the
determination of the particular sentence within the otherwise applicable guideline
range. Although the conduct to which this enhancement applies is not subject to
precise definition, comparison of the examples set forth in Application Notes 3
and 4 should assist the court in determining whether application of this
enhancement is warranted in a particular case.
3. The following is a non-exhaustive list of examples of the types of conduct to
which this enhancement applies:
(a) threatening, intimidating, or otherwise unlawfully influencing a co-
defendant, witness, or juror, directly or indirectly, or attempting to do so;
Amendment 347 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003
– 198 –
(b) committing, suborning, or attempting to suborn perjury;
(c) producing or attempting to produce a false, altered, or counterfeit
document or record during an official investigation or judicial proceeding;
(d) destroying or concealing or directing or procuring another person to
destroy or conceal evidence that is material to an official investigation or
judicial proceeding (e.g., shredding a document or destroying ledgers
upon learning that an official investigation has commenced or is about to
commence), or attempting to do so; however, if such conduct occurred
contemporaneously with arrest (e.g., attempting to swallow or throw
away a controlled substance), it shall not, standing alone, be sufficient to
warrant an adjustment for obstruction unless it resulted in a material
hindrance to the official investigation or prosecution of the instant offense
or the sentencing of the offender;
(e) escaping or attempting to escape from custody before trial or sentencing;
or willfully failing to appear, as ordered, for a judicial proceeding;
(f) providing materially false information to a judge or magistrate;
(g) providing a materially false statement to a law enforcement officer that
significantly obstructed or impeded the official investigation or
prosecution of the instant offense;
(h) providing materially false information to a probation officer in respect to
a presentence or other investigation for the court;
(i) conduct prohibited by 18 U.S.C. §§ 1501-1516.
This adjustment also applies to any other obstructive conduct in respect to the
official investigation, prosecution, or sentencing of the instant offense where
there is a separate count of conviction for such conduct.
4. The following is a non-exhaustive list of examples of the types of conduct that,
absent a separate count of conviction for such conduct, do not warrant application
of this enhancement, but ordinarily can appropriately be sanctioned by the
determination of the particular sentence within the otherwise applicable guideline
range:
(a) providing a false name or identification document at arrest, except where
such conduct actually resulted in a significant hindrance to the
investigation or prosecution of the instant offense;
(b) making false statements, not under oath, to law enforcement officers,
unless Application Note 3(g) above applies;
November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment 348
– 199 –
(c) providing incomplete or misleading information, not amounting to a
material falsehood, in respect to a presentence investigation;
(d) avoiding or fleeing from arrest (see, however, §3C1.2 (Reckless
Endangerment During Flight)).
5. ‘Material’ evidence, fact, statement, or information, as used in this section, means
evidence, fact, statement, or information that, if believed, would tend to influence
or affect the issue under determination.
6. Where the defendant is convicted for an offense covered by §2J1.1 (Contempt),
§2J1.2 (Obstruction of Justice), §2J1.3 (Perjury or Subornation of Perjury),
§2J1.5 (Failure to Appear by Material Witness), §2J1.6 (Failure to Appear by
Defendant), §2J1.8 (Bribery of Witness), or §2J1.9 (Payment to Witness), this
adjustment is not to be applied to the offense level for that offense except where
a significant further obstruction occurred during the investigation or prosecution
of the obstruction offense itself (e.g., where the defendant threatened a witness
during the course of the prosecution for the obstruction offense). Where the
defendant is convicted both of the obstruction offense and the underlying offense,
the count for the obstruction offense will be grouped with the count for the
underlying offense under subsection (c) of §3D1.2 (Groups of Closely-Related
Counts). The offense level for that group of closely-related counts will be the
offense level for the underlying offense increased by the 2-level adjustment
specified by this section, or the offense level for the obstruction offense,
whichever is greater.".
Chapter Three, Part C, is amended by inserting an additional guideline with accompanying
commentary as §3C1.2 (Reckless Endangerment During Flight).
Reason for Amendment: This amendment clarifies the operation of §3C1.1 and inserts an
additional guideline to address reckless endangerment during flight. The Commission believes
that reckless endangerment during flight is sufficiently different from other forms of obstructive
conduct to warrant a separate enhancement.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1990.
348. Amendment: Section 3D1.1 is amended by inserting "(a)" immediately before "When"; by
deleting "(a)", "(b)", and "(c)", and inserting in lieu thereof "(1)", "(2)", and "(3)" respectively;
and by inserting the following additional subsection:
"(b) Any count for which the statute mandates imposition of a consecutive sentence
is excluded from the operation of §§3D1.2-3D1.5. Sentences for such counts are
governed by the provisions of §5G1.2(a).".
The Commentary to §3D1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 1 by deleting:
"Certain offenses, e.g., 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) (use of a deadly or dangerous weapon in
Amendment APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003
– 200 –
relation to a crime of violence or drug trafficking) by law carry mandatory consecutive
sentences. Such offenses are exempted from the operation of these rules. See §3D1.2.",
and inserting in lieu thereof:
"Counts for which a statute mandates imposition of a consecutive sentence are excepted
from application of the multiple count rules. Convictions on such counts are not used in
the determination of a combined offense level under this Part, but may affect the offense
level for other counts. A conviction for 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) (use of firearm in
commission of a crime of violence) provides a common example. In the case of a
conviction under 18 U.S.C. § 924(c), the specific offense characteristic for weapon use
in the primary offense is to be disregarded to avoid double counting. See Commentary
to §2K2.4. Example: The defendant is convicted of one count of bank robbery (18
U.S.C. § 2113), and one count of use of a firearm in the commission of a crime of
violence (18 U.S.C. § 924(c)). The two counts are not grouped together, and the offense
level for the bank robbery count is computed without application of an enhancement for
weapon possession or use. The mandatory five-year sentence on the weapon-use count
runs consecutively, as required by law. See §5G1.2(a).".
Section 3D1.2 is amended by deleting the second sentence as follows:
"A count for which the statute mandates imposition of a consecutive sentence is excluded
from such Groups for purposes of §§3D1.2-3D1.5.".
The Commentary to §3D1.2 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by deleting Note 1 as
follows:
"1. Counts for which the statute mandates imposition of a consecutive sentence are
excepted from application of the multiple count rules. Convictions under such
counts are excluded from the determination of the combined offense level.
Convictions for 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) (use of firearm in commission of a crime of
violence) provide a common example. Note that such a conviction usually does
affect the offense level for other counts, however, in that in the event of such a
conviction the specific offense characteristic for weapon use in the primary
offense is to be disregarded. See Commentary to §2K2.4. Example: The
defendant is convicted of one count of bank robbery in which he took $5,000 and
discharged a weapon causing permanent bodily injury (18 U.S.C. § 2113), and
one count of use of a firearm in the commission of a crime of violence (18 U.S.C.
§ 924(c)). The two counts are not grouped together, but the offense level for the
bank robbery count is 28 (18 + 4 + 6) rather than 31. The mandatory five year
sentence on the weapon-use count runs consecutively, as required by law.".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment consolidates the provisions dealing with statutorily
required consecutive sentences in §3D1.1 for greater clarity.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1990.
November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment 349
– 201 –
349. Amendment: Section 3D1.2(b) is amended by deleting, immediately following "common
scheme or plan", the following:
" , including, but not limited to:
(1) A count charging conspiracy or solicitation and a count charging any
substantive offense that was the sole object of the conspiracy or
solicitation. 28 U.S.C. § 994(l)(2).
(2) A count charging an attempt to commit an offense and a count charging
the commission of the offense. 18 U.S.C. § 3584(a).
(3) A count charging an offense based on a general prohibition and a count
charging violation of a specific prohibition encompassed in the general
prohibition. 28 U.S.C. § 994(v)".
Section 3D1.2(d) is amended by deleting "Counts are grouped together if" and inserting in lieu
thereof "When".
Section 3D1.2(d) is amended by deleting "specifically included" and inserting in lieu thereof
"to be grouped".
Section 3D1.2(d) is amended in the second paragraph by inserting in the appropriate place:
"§2K2.2;".
Section 3D1.2(d) is amended in the third paragraph by inserting "Chapter Two," immediately
before "Part A".
The Commentary to §3D1.2 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by inserting the
following as Note 1:
"1. Subsections (a)-(d) set forth circumstances in which counts are to be grouped
together into a single Group. Counts are to be grouped together into a single
Group if any one or more of the subsections provide for such grouping. Counts
for which the statute mandates imposition of a consecutive sentence are excepted
from application of the multiple count rules. See §3D1.1(b).".
The Commentary to §3D1.2 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 3 by inserting
the following as the second paragraph:
"When one count charges an attempt to commit an offense and the other charges the
commission of that offense, or when one count charges an offense based on a general
prohibition and the other charges violation of a specific prohibition encompassed in the
general prohibition, the counts will be grouped together under subsection (a).".
The Commentary to §3D1.2 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 4 in the first
sentence of the first paragraph by deleting "states the principle" and inserting in lieu thereof
"provides".
Amendment 349 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003
– 202 –
The Commentary to §3D1.2 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 4 by inserting
the following sentence as the second sentence of the first paragraph:
"This provision does not authorize the grouping of offenses that cannot be considered to
represent essentially one composite harm (e.g., robbery of the same victim on different
occasions involves multiple, separate instances of fear and risk of harm, not one
composite harm).";
and by inserting the following as the second paragraph:
"When one count charges a conspiracy or solicitation and the other charges a substantive
offense that was the sole object of the conspiracy or solicitation, the counts will be
grouped together under subsection (b).".
The Commentary to §3D1.2 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 6 by deleting
the third sentence of the first paragraph as follows:
"The same general type of offense" is to be construed broadly, and would include, for
example, larceny, embezzlement, forgery, and fraud.";
and by inserting the following as the second paragraph:
"Counts involving offenses to which different offense guidelines apply are grouped
together under subsection (d) if the offenses are of the same general type and otherwise
meet the criteria for grouping under this subsection. In such cases, the offense guideline
that results in the highest offense level is used; see §3D1.3(b). The ‘same general type’
of offense is to be construed broadly, and would include, for example, larceny,
embezzlement, forgery, and fraud.".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment clarifies the operation of §3D1.2(b), makes
editorial improvements in §3D1.2(d), makes the listing of offenses in §3D1.2(d) more
comprehensive, clarifies the interaction of §§ 3D1.2(d) and 3D1.3(b), and clarifies the
Commentary of §3D1.2 by making explicit that offenses such as multiple robberies do not fit
within the parameters of §3D1.2(b).
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1990.
350. Amendment: Section 3D1.4 is amended in the fourth line of the Unit table by inserting "2 1/2-
" immediately before "3" the first time "3" appears; and in the fifth line of the Unit table by
deleting "4 or" and inserting in lieu thereof "3 1/2-".
Section 3D1.4 is amended by deleting:
"(d) Except when the total number of Units is 1 1/2, round up to the next large whole
number.".
The Commentary to §3D1.4 captioned "Background" is amended in the first paragraph by
deleting the fifth sentence as follows:
November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment 351
– 203 –
"When this approach produces a fraction in the total Units, other than 1 1/2, it is rounded
up to the nearest whole number.".
The "Illustrations of the Operation of the Multiple-Count Rules" following §3D1.5 are amended
in example 1 in the third sentence by deleting "18" and "4-" and inserting in lieu thereof "20"
and "2-" respectively; and in the sixth sentence by deleting "(rounded up to 3)" immediately
following "2 1/2 Units".
The "Illustrations of the Operation of the Multiple-Count Rules" following §3D1.5 are amended
in example 3 in the sixth sentence by deleting "Obstruction" and inserting in lieu thereof
"Obstructing or Impeding the Administration of Justice".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment simplifies the operation of §3D1.4. In addition,
the amendment conforms the illustrations of the operation of the multiple-count rules.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1990.
351. Amendment: The Commentary to §3E1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by
deleting:
"2. Conviction by trial does not preclude a defendant from consideration under this
section. A defendant may manifest sincere contrition even if he exercises his
constitutional right to a trial. This may occur, for example, where a defendant
goes to trial to assert and preserve issues that do not relate to factual guilt (e.g.,
to make a constitutional challenge to a statute or a challenge to the applicability
of a statute to his conduct).
3. A guilty plea may provide some evidence of the defendant’s acceptance of
responsibility. However, it does not, by itself, entitle a defendant to a reduced
sentence under this section.",
and inserting in lieu thereof:
"2. This adjustment is not intended to apply to a defendant who puts the government
to its burden of proof at trial by denying the essential factual elements of guilt,
is convicted, and only then admits guilt and expresses remorse. Conviction by
trial, however, does not automatically preclude a defendant from consideration
for such a reduction. In rare situations a defendant may clearly demonstrate an
acceptance of responsibility for his criminal conduct even though he exercises his
constitutional right to a trial. This may occur, for example, where a defendant
goes to trial to assert and preserve issues that do not relate to factual guilt (e.g.,
to make a constitutional challenge to a statute or a challenge to the applicability
of a statute to his conduct). In each such instance, however, a determination that
a defendant has accepted responsibility will be based primarily upon pre-trial
statements and conduct.
3. Entry of a plea of guilty prior to the commencement of trial combined with
truthful admission of involvement in the offense and related conduct will
constitute significant evidence of acceptance of responsibility for the purposes of
Amendment 351 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003
– 204 –
this section. However, this evidence may be outweighed by conduct of the
defendant that is inconsistent with such acceptance of responsibility.".
The Commentary to §3E1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 4 in the first
sentence by deleting "Willfully Obstructing or Impeding Proceedings" and inserting in lieu
thereof "Obstructing or Impeding the Administration of Justice".
The Commentary to §3E1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 5 in the second
sentence by deleting "and should not be disturbed unless it is without foundation" immediately
following "review".
The Commentary to §3E1.1 captioned "Background" is amended in the first paragraph in the
second sentence by inserting "and related conduct" immediately before "by taking"; and in the
third sentence by deleting "lesser sentence" and inserting in lieu thereof "lower offense level",
and by deleting "sincere remorse" and inserting in lieu thereof "acceptance of responsibility".
The Commentary to §3E1.1 captioned "Background" is amended by deleting the second
paragraph as follows:
" The availability of a reduction under §3E1.1 is not controlled by whether the
conviction was by trial or plea of guilty. Although a guilty plea may show some
evidence of acceptance of responsibility, it does not automatically entitle the defendant
to a sentencing adjustment.".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment clarifies the operation of this guideline and
conforms the title of a reference to another guideline.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1990.
352. Amendment: Section 4A1.2(a)(3) is amended by inserting "or execution" immediately
following "imposition".
Section 4A1.2(c)(1) is amended by inserting in the appropriate place by alphabetical order:
"Careless or reckless driving",
"Insufficient funds check".
Section 4A1.2(c)(1) is amended by inserting "(excluding local ordinance violations that are also
criminal offenses under state law)" immediately following "Local ordinance violations".
Section 4A1.2(c)(2) is amended by inserting "(e.g., speeding)" immediately following "minor
traffic infractions".
The Commentary to §4A1.2 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by inserting the
following additional notes:
"12. Local ordinance violations. A number of local jurisdictions have enacted
ordinances covering certain offenses (e.g., larceny and assault misdemeanors)
that are also violations of state criminal law. This enables a local court (e.g., a
November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment 353
– 205 –
municipal court) to exercise jurisdiction over such offenses. Such offenses are
excluded from the definition of local ordinance violations in §4A1.2(c)(1) and,
therefore, sentences for such offenses are to be treated as if the defendant had
been convicted under state law.
13. Insufficient funds check. ‘Insufficient funds check,’ as used in §4A1.2(c)(1),
does not include any conviction establishing that the defendant used a false name
or non-existent account.".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment clarifies that, for the purpose of computing
criminal history points, there is no difference between the suspension of the "imposition" and
"execution" of a prior sentence. This amendment also makes the provisions of §4A1.2(c)(1)
more comprehensive in respect to certain vehicular offenses and clarifies the application of
§4A1.2(c)(1) in respect to certain offenses prosecuted in municipal courts. In addition, this
amendment expands the coverage of §4A1.2(c)(1) to include a misdemeanor or petty offense
conviction for an insufficient funds check.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1990.
353. Amendment: The Commentary to §4A1.2 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note
6 by deleting:
"Any other sentence resulting in a valid conviction is to be counted in the criminal
history score. Convictions which the defendant shows to have been constitutionally
invalid may not be counted in the criminal history score. Also, if to count an
uncounseled misdemeanor conviction would result in the imposition of a sentence of
imprisonment under circumstances that would violate the United States Constitution,
then such conviction shall not be counted in the criminal history score. Nonetheless, any
conviction that is not counted in the criminal history score may be considered pursuant
to §4A1.3 if it provides reliable evidence of past criminal activity.",
and inserting in lieu thereof:
"Also, sentences resulting from convictions that a defendant shows to have been
previously ruled constitutionally invalid are not to be counted. Nonetheless, the criminal
conduct underlying any conviction that is not counted in the criminal history score may
be considered pursuant to §4A1.3 (Adequacy of Criminal History Category).".
The Commentary to §4A1.2 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in the caption of Note
6 by deleting "Invalid" and inserting in lieu thereof "Reversed, Vacated, or Invalidated".
The Commentary to §4A1.2 is amended by inserting at the end:
"Background: Prior sentences, not otherwise excluded, are to be counted in the criminal
history score, including uncounseled misdemeanor sentences where imprisonment was
not imposed.
The Commission leaves for court determination the issue of whether a defendant
may collaterally attack at sentencing a prior conviction.".
Amendment 353 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003
– 206 –
Reason for Amendment: This amendment clarifies the circumstances under which prior
sentences are excluded from the criminal history score. In particular, the amendment clarifies
the Commission’s intent regarding the counting of uncounseled misdemeanor convictions for
which counsel constitutionally is not required because the defendant was not imprisoned. Lack
of clarity regarding whether these prior sentences are to be counted may result not only in
considerable disparity in guideline application, but also in the criminal history score not
adequately reflecting the defendant’s failure to learn from the application of previous sanctions
and his potential for recidivism. This amendment expressly states the Commission’s position
that such convictions are to be counted for the purposes of criminal history under Chapter Four,
Part A.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1990.
354. Amendment: The Commentary to §4B1.3 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note
2 by deleting "(currently 2,000x the hourly minimum wage under federal law is $6,700)"
immediately following "then existing hourly minimum wage under federal law".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment deletes a reference to the federal minimum wage
that is now outdated.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1990.
355. Amendment: Chapter Four, Part B, is amended by inserting an additional guideline with
accompanying commentary as §4B1.4 (Armed Career Criminal).
Reason for Amendment: This amendment adds a new section to address cases subject to a
sentence enhancement under 18 U.S.C. § 924(e).
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1990.
356. Amendment: Section 5E1.2 is amended by deleting:
"(a) Except as provided in subsection (f) below, the court shall impose a fine in all
cases.",
and inserting in lieu thereof:
"(a) The court shall impose a fine in all cases, except where the defendant establishes
that he is unable to pay and is not likely to become able to pay any fine.".
Section 5E1.2(d)(2) is amended by deleting "the ability of the defendant" and inserting in lieu
thereof "any evidence presented as to the defendant’s ability".
The Commentary to §5E1.2 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 3 by deleting
the fourth sentence as follows:
"In many cases, circumstances will make it unnecessary to consider these standards other
than in the most general terms.";
November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment 358
– 207 –
and by inserting the following additional paragraphs at the end:
"Where it is readily ascertainable that the defendant cannot, and is not likely to become
able to, pay a fine greater than the maximum fine set forth in Column B of the Fine Table
in subsection (c)(3), calculation of the alternative maximum fines under subsections
(c)(2)(B) (twice the gross pecuniary loss caused by the offense) and (c)(2)(C) (three
times the gross pecuniary gain to all participants in the offense) is unnecessary. In such
cases, a statement that ‘the alternative maximums of the fine table were not calculated
because it is readily ascertainable that the defendant cannot, and is not likely to become
able to, pay a fine greater than the maximum set forth in the fine table’ is recommended
in lieu of such calculations.
The determination of the fine guideline range may be dispensed with entirely upon a
court determination of present and future inability to pay any fine. The inability of a
defendant to post bail bond (having otherwise been determined eligible for release) and
the fact that a defendant is represented by (or was determined eligible for) assigned
counsel are significant indicators of present inability to pay any fine. In conjunction with
other factors, they may also indicate that the defendant is not likely to become able to pay
any fine.".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment clarifies the operation of this guideline.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1990.
357. Amendment: The Introductory Commentary to Chapter Five, Part H is amended by inserting
the following additional paragraph at the end:
" In addition, 28 U.S.C. § 994(e) requires the Commission to assure that its
guidelines and policy statements reflect the general inappropriateness of considering the
defendant’s education, vocational skills, employment record, family ties and
responsibilities, and community ties in determining whether a term of imprisonment
should be imposed or the length of a term of imprisonment.".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment clarifies the relationship of 28 U.S.C. § 994(e) to
certain of the policy statements contained in this part.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1990.
358. Amendment: Chapter Five, Part K, Subpart 2, is amended in the title by deleting "GENERAL
PROVISIONS:" and inserting in lieu thereof "OTHER GROUNDS FOR DEPARTURE".
Section 5K2.0 is amended in the first sentence of the first paragraph by inserting a comma
immediately following "degree", and by inserting "that should result in a sentence different
from that described" immediately following "the guidelines"; in the third sentence of the first
paragraph by deleting "court at the time of sentencing" and inserting in lieu thereof "courts";
in the fourth sentence of the first paragraph by deleting "the present section" and inserting in
lieu thereof "this subpart", by deleting "fully" immediately before "take", by inserting "fully"
immediately following "account", and by deleting "precise" and inserting in lieu thereof "the";
in the sixth sentence of the first paragraph by deleting "judge" and inserting in lieu thereof
Amendment 358 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003
– 208 –
"court"; and in the seventh sentence of the first paragraph by deleting "listed elsewhere in the
guidelines (e.g., as an adjustment or specific offense characteristic)" and inserting in lieu thereof
"taken into consideration in the guidelines (e.g., as a specific offense characteristic or other
adjustment)".
Section 5K2.0 is amended in the first sentence of the second paragraph by inserting ", for
example," immediately following "Where", by deleting "guidelines, specific offense
characteristics," and inserting in lieu thereof "offense guideline", by deleting "part" and
inserting in lieu thereof "subpart", by deleting "guideline" and inserting in lieu thereof
"applicable guideline range", and by deleting "of conviction" immediately following "the
offense"; in the second sentence of the second paragraph by deleting "offense of conviction"
and inserting in lieu thereof "applicable offense guideline"; in the third sentence of the second
paragraph by deleting "offense of conviction is theft" and inserting in lieu thereof "theft offense
guideline is applicable", by deleting "when" immediately before "the theft", and by inserting
"range" immediately before "more readily"; and in the fourth sentence of the second paragraph
by deleting "offense of conviction is robbery" and inserting in lieu thereof "robbery offense
guideline is applicable", and by deleting "sentence" immediately before "adjustment".
Section 5K2.0 is amended by deleting the fourth paragraph as follows:
"Harms identified as a possible basis for departure from the guidelines should be taken
into account only when they are relevant to the offense of conviction, within the
limitations set forth in §1B1.3.".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment makes various editorial and clarifying changes.
In addition, the last paragraph is deleted as unclear and overly restrictive.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1990.
359. Amendment: Appendix A (Statutory Index) is amended by inserting the following in the
appropriate place by title and section:

Reason for Amendment: This amendment implements the directive in 28 U.S.C. § 994(u) in
respect to the guideline amendments effective November 1, 1990.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1990.
361. Amendment: The Commentary to §1B1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note
1 by inserting the following additional subdivision at the end:

rocket having a propellant charge of more than four ounces, (iv) missile having
an explosive or incendiary charge of more than one-quarter ounce, (v) mine, or
(vi) device similar to any of the devices described in the proceeding clauses).".
The Commentary to §2B1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 1 by deleting
"and ‘firearm’" and inserting in lieu thereof ",‘firearm,’ and ‘destructive device’", and by

formerly in the Commentary to §2K1.4, in the Commentary to §1B1.1, with minor revisions
to the examples of the articles prohibited by 18 U.S.C. § 921(a)(4) to better reflect the statutory
provision. This amendment also conforms the commentary of various offense guidelines to
reference the definitions set forth in Application Note 1 of the Commentary to §1B1.1.
Amendment 361 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003
– 216 –
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1990.
362. Amendment: Chapter Seven is deleted in its entirety as follows:
"CHAPTER SEVEN - VIOLATIONS OF PROBATION AND
SUPERVISED RELEASE
§7A1.1. Reporting of Violations of Probation and Supervised Release (Policy
Statement)
(a) The Probation Officer shall promptly report to the court any
alleged violation of a condition of probation or supervised
release that constitutes new criminal conduct, other than conduct
that would constitute a petty offense.
(b) The Probation Officer shall promptly report to the court any
other alleged violation of a condition of probation or supervised
release, unless the officer determines: (1) that such violation is
minor, not part of a continuing pattern of violation, and not
indicative of a serious adjustment problem; and (2) that non-
reporting will not present an undue risk to the public or be
inconsistent with any directive of the court relative to the
reporting of violations.
Commentary
This policy statement addresses the reporting of violations of probation and
supervised release. It is the Commission’s intent that significant violations be promptly
reported to the court. At the same time, the Commission realizes that it would neither be
practical nor desirable to require such reporting for every minor violation.
§7A1.2. Revocation of Probation (Policy Statement)
(a) Upon a finding of a violation of probation involving new
criminal conduct, other than criminal conduct constituting a petty
offense, the court shall revoke probation.
(b) Upon a finding of a violation of probation involving conduct
other than conduct under subsection (a), the court may: (1)
revoke probation; or (2) extend the term of probation and/or
modify the conditions of probation.
November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment 362
– 217 –
Commentary
This policy statement expresses a presumption that probation is to be revoked in
the case of new criminal conduct other than a petty offense. For lesser violations, the
policy statements provide that the court may revoke probation, extend the term of
supervision, or modify the conditions of supervision.
§7A1.3. Revocation of Supervised Release (Policy Statement)
(a) Upon a finding of a violation of supervised release involving new
criminal conduct, other than criminal conduct constituting a petty
offense, the court shall revoke supervised release.
(b) Upon a finding of a violation of supervised release involving
conduct other than conduct under subsection (a), the court may:
(1) revoke supervised release; or (2) extend the term of
supervised release and/or modify the conditions of supervised
release.
Commentary
This policy statement expresses a presumption that supervised release is to be
revoked in the case of new criminal conduct other than a petty offense. For lesser
violations, the policy statements provide that the court may revoke supervised release,
extend the term of supervision, or modify the conditions of supervision.
§7A1.4. No Credit for Time Under Supervision (Policy Statement)
(a) Upon revocation of probation, no credit shall be given (toward
any sentence of imprisonment imposed) for any portion of the
term of probation served prior to revocation.
(b) Upon revocation of supervised release, no credit shall be given
(toward any term of imprisonment ordered) for time previously
served on post-release supervision.
Commentary
This policy statement provides that time served on probation or supervised release
is not to be credited in the determination of any term of imprisonment imposed upon
revocation.".
A replacement chapter containing policy statements with accompanying commentary is inserted
as Chapter Seven (Violations of Probation and Supervised Release).
Reason for Amendment: This amendment replaces Chapter Seven with a set of more detailed
policy statements applicable to violations of probation and supervised release. Under 28 U.S.C.
§ 994(a)(3), the Sentencing Commission is required to issue guidelines or policy statements
applicable to the revocation of probation and supervised release. At this time, the Commission
Amendment 362 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003
– 218 –
has chosen to promulgate policy statements only. These policy statements will provide
guidance while allowing for the identification of any substantive or procedural issues that
require further review. The Commission views these policy statements as evolutionary and will
review relevant data and materials concerning revocation determinations under these policy
statements. Revocation guidelines will be issued after federal judges, probation officers,
practitioners, and others have the opportunity to evaluate and comment on these policy
statements.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1990.
363. Amendment: Section 2A4.1(b) is amended by deleting:
"(5) If the victim was kidnapped, abducted, or unlawfully restrained to
facilitate the commission of another offense: (A) increase by 4 levels; or
(B) if the result of applying this guideline is less than that resulting from
application of the guideline for such other offense, apply the guideline for
such other offense.",
and inserting in lieu thereof:
"(5) If the victim was sexually exploited, increase by 3 levels.
(6) If the victim is a minor and, in exchange for money or other
consideration, was placed in the care or custody of another person who
had no legal right to such care or custody of the victim, increase by 3
levels.
(7) If the victim was kidnapped, abducted, or unlawfully restrained during the
commission of, or in connection with, another offense or escape
therefrom; or if another offense was committed during the kidnapping,
abduction, or unlawful restraint, increase to --
(A) the offense level from the Chapter Two offense guideline
applicable to that other offense if such offense guideline includes
an adjustment for kidnapping, abduction, or unlawful restraint,
or otherwise takes such conduct into account; or
(B) 4 plus the offense level from the offense guideline applicable to
that other offense, but in no event greater than level 43, in any
other case,
if the resulting offense level is greater than that determined above.
(c) Cross Reference
(1) If the victim was killed under circumstances that would constitute murder
under 18 U.S.C. § 1111 had such killing taken place within the territorial
or maritime jurisdiction of the United States, apply §2A1.1 (First Degree
Murder).".
November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment 364
– 219 –
The Commentary to §2A4.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by inserting the
following additional note:
"4. ‘Sexually exploited’ includes offenses set forth in 18 U.S.C. §§ 2241-2244, 2251,
and 2421-2423.".
The Commentary to §2A4.1 captioned "Background" is amended by inserting the following
additional paragraph at the end:
" Section 401 of Public Law 101-647 amended 18 U.S.C. § 1201 to require that
courts take into account certain specific offense characteristics in cases involving a
victim under eighteen years of age and directed the Commission to include those specific
offense characteristics within the guidelines. Where the guidelines did not already take
into account the conduct identified by the Act, additional specific offense characteristics
have been provided.".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment implements the instructions in Section 401 of the
Crime Control Act of 1990 (Public Law 101-647), in some cases with a broader scope, by
adding specific offense characteristics at subsections (b)(5) and (b)(6). With respect to the
portion of the Congressional instruction pertaining to aiders or abettors, no amendment was
required because §1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct) provides an offense level greater than that
required by the Congressional instruction. A separate amendment (amendment 388) clarifies
that maltreatment to a life threatening degree constitutes life-threatening bodily injury. In
addition, this amendment replaces the current subsection (b)(5) with a revised subsection (b)(7)
that addresses other offenses connected with kidnapping, abduction, or unlawful restraint in a
manner that more appropriately reflects the combined seriousness of such offenses, and inserts
a cross reference to address the case in which the victim was murdered.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1991.
364. Amendment: Section 2B1.1(b)(7) is amended by inserting "-- (A)" immediately before

in lieu thereof "1007, and 1014".
The Commentary to §2B1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 10 by deleting:
"as a consequence of the offense the institution became insolvent, substantially reduced
benefits to pensioners or insureds, was unable on demand to refund fully any deposit,
payment or investment, or was so depleted of its assets as to be forced to merge with
another institution in order to continue active operations",
Amendment 364 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003

following additional notes:
"11. ‘The defendant derived more than $1,000,000 in gross receipts from the offense,’
as used in subsection (b)(7)(B), generally means that the gross receipts to the
defendant individually, rather than to all participants, exceeded $1,000,000.
‘Gross receipts from the offense’ includes all property, real or personal, tangible
or intangible, which is obtained directly or indirectly as a result of such offense.
See 18 U.S.C. § 982(a)(4).
12. If the defendant is convicted under 18 U.S.C. § 225 (relating to a continuing
financial crimes enterprise), the offense level is that applicable to the underlying
series of offenses comprising the ‘continuing financial crimes enterprise.’
13. If subsection (b)(7)(A) or (B) applies, there shall be a rebuttable presumption that
the offense involved ‘more than minimal planning.’".
The Commentary to §2B1.1 captioned "Background" is amended in the seventh paragraph by
deleting "(b)(7)" and inserting in lieu thereof "(b)(7)(A)", and by deleting "statutory directive"
and inserting in lieu thereof "instruction"; and by inserting the following additional paragraph
at the end:
" Subsection (b)(7)(B) implements the instruction to the Commission in Section
2507 of Public Law 101-647.".
Section 2B4.1(b)(2) is amended by inserting "-- (A)" immediately before "substantially"; and
by deleting the comma immediately following "institution" and inserting in lieu thereof "; or
(B) affected a financial institution and the defendant derived more than $1,000,000 in gross
receipts from the offense,".

benefits to pensioners or insureds, was unable on demand to refund fully any deposit,
payment or investment, or was so depleted of its assets as to be forced to merge with
another institution in order to continue active operations",
and inserting in lieu thereof:

benefits to pensioners or insureds; was unable on demand to refund fully any deposit,
payment, or investment; was so depleted of its assets as to be forced to merge with
another institution in order to continue active operations; or was placed in substantial
jeopardy of any of the above".

following additional notes:
"5. ‘The defendant derived more than $1,000,000 in gross receipts from the offense,’
as used in subsection (b)(2)(B), generally means that the gross receipts to the
defendant individually, rather than to all participants, exceeded $1,000,000.
‘Gross receipts from the offense’ includes all property, real or personal, tangible
or intangible, which is obtained directly or indirectly as a result of such offense.
See 18 U.S.C. § 982(a)(4).
6. If the defendant is convicted under 18 U.S.C. § 225 (relating to a continuing
financial crimes enterprise), the offense level is that applicable to the underlying
series of offenses comprising the ‘continuing financial crimes enterprise.’".

immediately before "285".
Amendment 364 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003
– 222 –
The Commentary to §2F1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 14 by deleting
"215" and inserting in lieu thereof "20"; and by deleting "1008, 1014, and 1344" and inserting
in lieu thereof "1007, and 1014".
The Commentary to §2F1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 15 by deleting:
"as a consequence of the offense the institution became insolvent, substantially reduced
benefits to pensioners or insureds, was unable on demand to refund fully any deposit,
payment or investment, or was so depleted of its assets as to be forced to merge with
another institution in order to continue active operations",
and inserting in lieu thereof:
", as a consequence of the offense, the institution became insolvent; substantially reduced
benefits to pensioners or insureds; was unable on demand to refund fully any deposit,
payment, or investment; was so depleted of its assets as to be forced to merge with
another institution in order to continue active operations; or was placed in substantial
jeopardy of any of the above".
The Commentary to §2F1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by inserting the
following additional notes:
"16. ‘The defendant derived more than $1,000,000 in gross receipts from the offense,’
as used in subsection (b)(6)(B), generally means that the gross receipts to the
defendant individually, rather than to all participants, exceeded $1,000,000.

deleting "(b)(6)" and inserting in lieu thereof "(b)(6)(A)", and by deleting "statutory directive"
and inserting in lieu thereof "instruction"; and by inserting the following additional paragraph
at the end:

2507 of Public Law 101-647.".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment implements the instruction to the Commission in
Section 2507 of the Crime Control Act of 1990 (Public Law 101-647). It also reflects the new
offense relating to a continuing financial crimes enterprise created by Section 2510 of the Crime
Control Act of 1990. In addition, it revises the Commentary to §§2B1.1, 2B4.1, and 2F1.1 with
respect to the definition of "substantially jeopardized the safety and soundness of a financial
November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment 366

institution" so that the commentary is read to include cases in which the offense created a
substantial risk of any of the harms described in addition to cases in which such harm actually
occurred.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1991.
365. Amendment: Section 2B3.1(b) is amended by deleting:
"(2) (A) If a firearm was discharged, increase by 5 levels; (B) if a dangerous weapon
(including a firearm) was otherwise used, increase by 4 levels; (C) if a dangerous
weapon (including a firearm) was brandished, displayed, or possessed, increase
by 3 levels; or (D) if an express threat of death was made, increase by 2 levels.",
and inserting in lieu thereof:
"(2) (A) If a firearm was discharged, increase by 7 levels; (B) if a firearm was
otherwise used, increase by 6 levels; (C) if a firearm was brandished, displayed,
or possessed, increase by 5 levels; (D) if a dangerous weapon was otherwise
used, increase by 4 levels; (E) if a dangerous weapon was brandished, displayed,
or possessed, increase by 3 levels; or (F) if an express threat of death was made,
increase by 2 levels.".
Section 2B3.1 (b)(3) is amended by deleting "9" and inserting in lieu thereof "11".
The Commentary to §2B3.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 1 by inserting
"‘bodily injury,’ ‘serious bodily injury,’ ‘permanent or life-threatening bodily injury,’"
immediately before "‘abducted’".
The Commentary to §2B3.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 2 by deleting
"(b)(2)(C)" and inserting in lieu thereof "(b)(2)(E)".
The Commentary to §2B3.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 4 by deleting
"9" and inserting in lieu thereof "11".
The Commentary to §2B3.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 7 by deleting
"(b)(2)(D)" and inserting in lieu thereof "(b)(2)(F)".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment increases the offense levels for use or possession
of a firearm by 2 levels to better reflect the seriousness of such offenses and to reduce the
disparity resulting from the exercise of prosecutorial discretion in the charging of an offense
under 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) or § 929(a). In addition, this amendment revises the commentary to
make the reference to the terms defined in §1B1.1 more comprehensive.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1991.
366. Amendment: Section 2B3.2(b) is amended by deleting subdivisions (1) and (2) as follows:
"(1) If the greater of the amount obtained or demanded exceeded $2,500, increase by
the corresponding number of levels from the table in §2B2.1(b)(2).
Amendment 366 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003
– 224 –
(2) (A) If a firearm was discharged, increase by 5 levels; (B) if a dangerous weapon
(including a firearm) was otherwise used, increase by 4 levels; (C) if a dangerous
weapon (including a firearm) was brandished, displayed, or possessed, increase
by 3 levels.";
by renumbering subdivisions (3) and (4) as (4) and (5) respectively; by inserting the following
as subdivisions (1)-(3):
"(1) If the offense involved an express or implied threat of death, bodily injury, or
kidnapping, increase by 2 levels.
(2) If the greater of the amount demanded or the loss to the victim exceeded $10,000,
increase by the corresponding number of levels from the table in §2B3.1(b)(6).
(3) (A)(i) If a firearm was discharged, increase by 7 levels; (ii) if a firearm was
otherwise used, increase by 6 levels; (iii) if a firearm was brandished, displayed,
or possessed, increase by 5 levels; (iv) if a dangerous weapon was otherwise
used, increase by 4 levels; or (v) if a dangerous weapon was brandished,
displayed, or possessed, increase by 3 levels; or
(B) If the offense involved preparation to carry out a threat of (i) death, (ii)
serious bodily injury, (iii) kidnapping, or (iv) product tampering; or if the
participant(s) otherwise demonstrated the ability to carry out such threat, increase
by 3 levels.";
and in the last sentence of the renumbered subdivision (4) (formerly (3)) by deleting "(2)", "(3)"
and "9", and inserting in lieu thereof "(3)", "(4)", and "11", respectively.
Section 2B3.2 is amended by inserting the following additional subsection:
"(c) Cross Reference
(1) If the offense was tantamount to attempted murder, apply §2A2.1 (Assault
With Intent to Commit Murder; Attempted Murder) if the resulting
offense level is greater than that determined above.".
The Commentary to §2B3.2 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 1 by inserting
"‘bodily injury,’ ‘serious bodily injury,’ ‘permanent or life-threatening bodily injury,’"
immediately before "abducted"; and in Note 4 by deleting "9" and inserting in lieu thereof "11".
The Commentary to §2B3.2 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by deleting:
"5. Valuation of loss is discussed in the Commentary to §2B1.1 (Larceny,
Embezzlement, and Other Forms of Theft).",
and inserting in lieu thereof:
November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment 367
– 225 –
"5. ‘Loss to the victim,’ as used in subsection (b)(2), means any demand paid plus
any additional consequential loss from the offense (e.g., the cost of defensive
measures taken in direct response to the offense).
6. In certain cases, an extortionate demand may be accompanied by conduct that
does not qualify as a display of a dangerous weapon under subsection
(b)(3)(A)(v) but is nonetheless similar in seriousness, demonstrating the
defendant’s preparation or ability to carry out the threatened harm (e.g., an
extortionate demand containing a threat to tamper with a consumer product
accompanied by a workable plan showing how the product’s tamper-resistant
seals could be defeated, or a threat to kidnap a person accompanied by
information showing study of that person’s daily routine). Subsection (b)(3)(B)
addresses such cases.
7. If the offense involved the threat of death or serious bodily injury to numerous
victims (e.g., in the case of a plan to derail a passenger train or poison consumer
products), an upward departure may be warranted.
8. If the offense involved organized criminal activity, or a threat to a family member
of the victim, an upward departure may be warranted.".
The Commentary to §2B3.2 captioned "Background" is amended in the last sentence by
deleting "§ 877" and inserting in lieu thereof "18 U.S.C. § 877".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment provides a specific offense characteristic to
distinguish the greater seriousness of offenses that involve an express or implied threat of death,
bodily injury, or kidnapping; conforms the loss table to that used in the robbery guideline to
reflect that the typical case under the amended guideline will have an offense level that is more
closely comparable to robbery; increases the offense levels for offenses involving use or
possession of a firearm to conform to an amendment being made to the robbery guideline; adds
a subdivision to the specific offense characteristic dealing with use or possession of a dangerous
weapon to address cases in which the conduct is tantamount in seriousness to the brandishing,
display, or possession of a dangerous weapon, but does not qualify under the current specific
offense characteristic for weapon enhancement; modifies subsection (b)(1) to provide that the
greater of the amount demanded or the loss to the victim is used; adds a cross reference to
§2A2.1 to address cases in which the conduct was tantamount to attempted murder; and sets
forth commentary describing certain aggravating factors that may warrant an upward departure.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1991.
367. Amendment: Section 2C1.1(b)(1) is amended by inserting "or extortion" immediately
following "bribe".
Section 2C1.1(b)(2)(A) is amended by deleting "bribe or the benefit received, or to be received,
in return for the bribe" and inserting in lieu thereof "payment, the benefit received or to be
received in return for the payment, or the loss to the government from the offense, whichever
is greatest,".
Section 2C1.1(b)(2)(B) is amended by deleting "bribe" and inserting in lieu thereof "payment".
Amendment 367 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003
– 226 –
Section 2C1.1(c) is amended by deleting:
"(1) If the bribe was for the purpose of concealing or facilitating another criminal
offense, or for obstructing justice in respect to another criminal offense, apply
§2X3.1 (Accessory After the Fact) in respect to such other criminal offense if the
resulting offense level is greater than that determined above.";
by renumbering subsection (c)(2) as (c)(3); and by inserting the following as subsections (c)(1)
and (2):
"(1) If the offense was committed for the purpose of facilitating the commission of
another criminal offense, apply the offense guideline applicable to a conspiracy
to commit that other offense if the resulting offense level is greater than that
determined above.
(2) If the offense was committed for the purpose of concealing, or obstructing justice
in respect to, another criminal offense, apply §2X3.1 (Accessory After the Fact)
or §2J1.2 (Obstruction of Justice), as appropriate, in respect to that other offense
if the resulting offense level is greater than that determined above.".
The Commentary to §2C1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by deleting Note 2 as
follows:
"2. ‘Value of the bribe or the benefit received, or to be received, in return for the
bribe’ means the greater of the value of the bribe or the value of the benefit
received, or to be received, in return for the bribe. The ‘value of the benefit
received or to be received’ means the net value of such benefit. For example, if
a $150,000 contract on which $20,000 profit was made was awarded in return for
a bribe, the value of the benefit received in return is $20,000.",
and inserting in lieu thereof:
"2. ‘Loss’ is discussed in the Commentary to §2B1.1 (Larceny, Embezzlement, and
Other Forms of Theft) and includes both actual and intended loss. The value of
‘the benefit received or to be received’ means the net value of such benefit.
Examples: (1) A government employee, in return for a $500 bribe, reduces the
price of a piece of surplus property offered for sale by the government from
$10,000 to $2,000; the value of the benefit received is $8,000. (2) A $150,000
contract on which $20,000 profit was made was awarded in return for a bribe; the
value of the benefit received is $20,000. Do not deduct the value of the bribe
itself in computing the value of the benefit received or to be received. In the
above examples, therefore, the value of the benefit received would be the same
regardless of the value of the bribe.";
The Commentary to §2C1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 3 by deleting
"§2C1.1(c)(1) or (2)." and inserting in lieu thereof "§2C1.1(c)(1), (2), or (3). In such cases, an
adjustment from §3B1.3 (Abuse of Position of Trust or Use of Special Skill) may apply.".
November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment 367
– 227 –
The Commentary to §2C1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 4 by deleting
"bribe" and inserting in lieu thereof "unlawful payment"; and by deleting "and (2)" and
inserting in lieu thereof ", (2), and (3)".
The Commentary to §2C1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 6 by inserting
the following as the first sentence:
"Subsection (b)(1) provides an adjustment for offenses involving more than one incident
of either bribery or extortion.";
by deleting "bribe" the first time it occurs and inserting in lieu thereof "incident of bribery or
extortion"; and by inserting "or extortion" immediately before ", even if charged".
The Commentary to §2C1.1 captioned "Background" is amended by deleting the third
paragraph as follows:
" The amount of the bribe is used as a factor in the guideline not because it directly
measures harm to society, but because it is improbable that a large bribe would be given
for a favor of little consequence. Moreover, for deterrence purposes, the punishment
should be commensurate with the gain.",
and inserting in lieu thereof:
" In determining the net value of the benefit received or to be received, the value
of the bribe is not deducted from the gross value of such benefit; the harm is the same
regardless of value of the bribe paid to receive the benefit. Where the value of the bribe
exceeds the value of the benefit or the value of the benefit cannot be determined, the
value of the bribe is used because it is likely that the payer of such a bribe expected
something in return that would be worth more than the value of the bribe. Moreover, for
deterrence purposes, the punishment should be commensurate with the gain to the payer
or the recipient of the bribe, whichever is higher.".
The Commentary to §2C1.1 captioned "Background" is amended in the fourth paragraph by
deleting "bribe is" and inserting in lieu thereof "payment was".
The Commentary to §2C1.1 captioned "Background" is amended by deleting the fifth, sixth,
and seventh paragraphs as follows:
"Under §2C1.1(c)(1), if the purpose of the bribe involved the facilitation of
another criminal offense or the obstruction of justice in respect to another criminal
offense, the guideline for §2X3.1 (Accessory After the Fact) in respect to that criminal
offense will be applied, if the result is greater than that determined above. For example,
if a bribe was given for the purpose of facilitating or covering up the offense of
espionage, the guideline for accessory after the fact to espionage would be applied.
Under §2C1.1(c)(2), if the offense involved forcible extortion, the guideline from
§2B3.2 (Extortion by Force or Threat of Injury or Serious Damage) will apply if the
result is greater than that determined above.
Amendment 367 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003
– 228 –
Note that, when applying 2C1.1(c)(1) or (2), an adjustment from Chapter Three,
Part B (Role in the Offense) will also apply. This normally will result in an increase of
at least 2 levels.",
and inserting in lieu thereof:
" Under §2C1.1(c)(1), if the payment was to facilitate the commission of another
criminal offense, the guideline applicable to a conspiracy to commit that other offense
will apply if the result is greater than that determined above. For example, if a bribe was
given to a law enforcement officer to allow the smuggling of a quantity of cocaine, the
guideline for conspiracy to import cocaine would be applied if it resulted in a greater
offense level.
Under §2C1.1(c)(2), if the payment was to conceal another criminal offense or
obstruct justice in respect to another criminal offense, the guideline from §2X3.1
(Accessory After the Fact) or §2J1.2 (Obstruction of Justice), as appropriate, will apply
if the result is greater than that determined above. For example, if a bribe was given for
the purpose of concealing the offense of espionage, the guideline for accessory after the
fact to espionage would be applied.
Under §2C1.1(c)(3), if the offense involved forcible extortion, the guideline from
§2B3.2 (Extortion by Force or Threat of Injury or Serious Damage) will apply if the
result is greater than that determined above.
When the offense level is determined under §2C1.1(c)(1), (2), or (3), an
adjustment from §3B1.3 (Abuse of Position of Trust or Use of Special Skill) may
apply.".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment adds an additional factor in subsection (b)(2)(A)
to take into account loss to the government from the offense; expands subsection (c) to
distinguish an offense committed for the purpose of facilitating the commission of another
offense from an offense committed to cover up or obstruct justice in respect to another offense;
clarifies the term "value of the benefit received"; and substitutes "payment" for "bribe" and
adds "or extortion" where necessary to reflect that this guideline covers both bribery and
extortion under color of official right.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1991.
368. Amendment: Chapter Two, Part C, is amended by inserting an additional guideline with
accompanying commentary as §2C1.7 (Fraud Involving Deprivation of the Intangible Right to
the Honest Services of Public Officials; Conspiracy to Defraud by Interference with
Governmental Functions).
Reason for Amendment: This amendment provides an additional guideline to cover certain
offenses that involve public corruption but do not fall within the guidelines of Chapter Two,
Part C (Official Corruption) as currently written. In some cases, the statutes covered are used
to prosecute offenses more appropriately covered under §2C1.1 (Offering, Giving, Soliciting,
or Receiving a Bribe; Extortion Under Color of Official Right), §2C1.2 (Offering, Giving,
November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment 369
– 229 –
Soliciting, or Receiving a Gratuity), or §2C1.3 (Conflict of Interest). A cross reference is
provided to address such cases.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1991.
369. Amendment: Section 2D1.1(c)(12) is amended by deleting the period immediately after
"Schedule III substances" and inserting in lieu thereof "(except anabolic steroids);", and by
inserting the following additional subdivision at the end:
"40,000 or more units of anabolic steroids.".
Section 2D1.1(c)(13) is amended by deleting the period immediately after "Schedule III
substances" and inserting in lieu thereof "(except anabolic steroids);", and by inserting the
following additional subdivision at the end:
"At least 20,000 but less than 40,000 units of anabolic steroids.".
Section 2D1.1(c)(14) is amended by deleting the period immediately after "Schedule III
substances" and inserting in lieu thereof "(except anabolic steroids);", and by inserting the
following additional subdivision at the end:
"At least 10,000 but less than 20,000 units of anabolic steroids.".
Section 2D1.1(c)(15) is amended by deleting the period immediately after "Schedule III
substances" and inserting in lieu thereof "(except anabolic steroids);", and by inserting the
following additional subdivision at the end:
"At least 5,000 but less than 10,000 units of anabolic steroids.".
Section 2D1.1(c)(16) is amended by inserting "(except anabolic steroids)" immediately after
"Schedule III substances", and by inserting the following additional subdivision after the next
to last subdivision:
"At least 2,500 but less than 5,000 units of anabolic steroids;".
Section 2D1.1(c)(17) is amended by inserting "(except anabolic steroids)" immediately after
"Schedule III substances", and by inserting the following additional subdivision after the next
to last subdivision:
"At least 1,000 but less than 2,500 units of anabolic steroids;".
Section 2D1.1(c)(18) is amended by inserting "(except anabolic steroids)" immediately after
"Schedule III substances", and by inserting the following additional subdivision after the fourth
subdivision:
"At least 250 but less than 1,000 units of anabolic steroids;".
Amendment 369 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003
– 230 –
Section 2D1.1(c)(19) is amended by inserting "(except anabolic steroids)" immediately after
"Schedule III substances", and by inserting the following additional subdivision after the fourth
subdivision:
"Less than 250 units of anabolic steroids;".
Section 2D1.1(c) is amended in the note following subdivision (19) by inserting the following
additional paragraph at the end:
"In the case of anabolic steroids, one ‘unit’ means a 10 cc vial of an injectable steroid or
fifty tablets. All vials of injectable steroids are to be converted on the basis of their
volume to the equivalent number of 10 cc vials (e.g., one 50 cc vial is to be counted as
five 10 cc vials).".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment adds offenses involving anabolic steroids to
§2D1.1 to reflect that Title XIX of the Crime Control Act of 1990 (Public Law 101-647)
reclassified anabolic steroids as Schedule III controlled substances under 21 U.S.C. § 812(c).
Because of the variety of substances involved, the Commission has determined that a measure
based on quantity unit, rather than weight, provides the most appropriate measure of the scale
of the offense.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1991.
370. Amendment: Section 2D1.1(c) is amended in subdivision (1) by inserting ", or 30 KG or more
of ‘Ice’" immediately following "Pure Methamphetamine"; in subdivision (2) by inserting ",
or at least 10 KG but less than 30 KG of ‘Ice’" immediately following "Pure
Methamphetamine"; in subdivision (3) by inserting ", or at least 3 KG but less than 10 KG of
‘Ice’" immediately following "Pure Methamphetamine"; in subdivision (4) by inserting ", or
at least 1 KG but less than 3 KG of ‘Ice’" immediately following "Pure Methamphetamine"; in
subdivision (5) by inserting ", or at least 300 G but less than 1 KG of ‘Ice’" immediately
following "Pure Methamphetamine"; in subdivision (6) by inserting ", or at least 100 G but less
than 300 G of ‘Ice’" immediately following "Pure Methamphetamine"; in subdivision (7) by
inserting ", or at least 70 G but less than 100 G of ‘Ice’" immediately following "Pure
Methamphetamine"; in subdivision (8) by inserting ", or at least 40 G but less than 70 G of
‘Ice’" immediately following "Pure Methamphetamine"; subdivision (9) by inserting ", or at
least 10 G but less than 40 G of ‘Ice’" immediately following "Pure Methamphetamine"; in
subdivision (10) by inserting ", or at least 8 G but less than 10 G of ‘Ice’" immediately
following "Pure Methamphetamine"; in subdivision (11) by inserting ", or at least 6 G but less
than 8 G of ‘Ice’" immediately following "Pure Methamphetamine"; in subdivision (12) by
inserting ", or at least 4 G but less than 6 G of ‘Ice’" immediately following "Pure
Methamphetamine"; in subdivision (13) by inserting ", or at least 2 G but less than 4 G of ‘Ice’"
immediately following "Pure Methamphetamine"; subdivision (14) by inserting ", or at least
1 G but less than 2 G of ‘Ice’" immediately following "Pure Methamphetamine"; in subdivision
(15) by inserting ", or at least 500 MG but less than 1 G of ‘Ice’" immediately following "Pure
Methamphetamine"; in subdivision (16) by inserting ", or less than 500 MG of ‘Ice’"
immediately following "Pure Methamphetamine"; and in the note following subdivision (19)
by inserting the following as the second paragraph:
November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment 372
– 231 –
"‘Ice,’ for the purposes of this guideline, means a mixture or substance containing d-
methamphetamine hydrochloride of at least 80% purity.".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment implements the instruction to the Commission in
Section 2701 of the Crime Control Act of 1990 (Public Law 101-647) in a form compatible
with the structure of the guidelines.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1991.
371. Amendment: Chapter Two, Part D, Subpart 1, is amended by inserting additional guidelines
with accompanying commentary as §2D1.11 (Unlawfully Distributing, Importing, Exporting
or Possessing a Listed Chemical), §2D1.12 (Unlawful Possession, Manufacture, Distribution,
or Importation of Prohibited Flask or Equipment), and §2D1.13 (Structuring Chemical
Transactions or Creating a Chemical Mixture to Evade Reporting or Recordkeeping
Requirements; Presenting False or Fraudulent Identification to Obtain a Listed Chemical).
Chapter Two, Part D, Subpart 3 is amended by inserting an additional guideline with
accompanying commentary as §2D3.5 (Violation of Recordkeeping or Reporting Requirements
for Listed Chemicals and Certain Machines).
The Commentary to §2D1.1 captioned "Statutory Provisions" is amended by deleting "841,
960" and inserting in lieu thereof "841(a), (b)(1)-(3), 960(a), (b)".
The Commentary to §2D1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by inserting the
following additional note:
"14. D-lysergic acid, which is generally used to make LSD, is classified as a Schedule
III controlled substance (to which §2D1.1 applies) and as a listed precursor (to
which §2D1.11 applies). Where the defendant is convicted under 21 U.S.C. §§
841(b)(1)(D) or 860(b)(4) of an offense involving d-lysergic acid, apply §2D1.1
or §2D1.11, whichever results in the greater offense level. See Application Note
5 in the Commentary to §1B1.1 (Application Instructions). Where the defendant
is accountable for an offense involving the manufacture of LSD, see Application
Note 12 above pertaining to the determination of the scale of the offense.".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment makes Chapter Two, Part D more comprehensive
by providing additional guidelines to address violations involving listed chemicals, flasks, and
certain machines that are used in the manufacture of controlled substances. Conforming
changes are made to the Commentary to §2D1.1.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1991.
372. Amendment: Chapter Two, Part G, Subpart 2 is amended by inserting additional guidelines
with accompanying commentary as §2G2.4 (Receipt or Possession of Materials Depicting a
Minor Engaged in Sexually Explicit Conduct) and §2G2.5 (Recordkeeping Offenses Involving
the Production of Sexually Explicit Materials).
Amendment 372 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003
– 232 –
Section 2G2.2 is amended in the title by deleting "Transporting, Receiving, or"; and by
inserting at the end "; Receiving, Transporting, Advertising, or Possessing Material Involving
the Sexual Exploitation of a Minor with Intent to Traffic".
The Commentary to §2G2.2 captioned "Statutory Provisions" is amended by deleting "1460,".
Section 2G3.1(c)(1) is amended by deleting "(Transporting, Receiving, or Trafficking in
Material Involving the Sexual Exploitation of a Minor)" and inserting in lieu thereof
"(Trafficking in Material Involving the Sexual Exploitation of a Minor; Receiving,
Transporting, Advertising, or Possessing Material Involving the Sexual Exploitation of a Minor
with Intent to Traffic) or §2G2.4 (Receipt or Possession of Materials Depicting a Minor
Engaged in Sexually Explicit Conduct), as appropriate".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment inserts an additional guideline at §2G2.4 to address
offenses involving receipt or possession of materials depicting a minor engaged in sexually
explicit conduct, as distinguished from offenses involving trafficking in such material, which
continue to be covered under §2G2.2. Offenses involving receipt or transportation of such
material for the purpose of trafficking are referenced to §2G2.2 on the basis of the underlying
conduct (subsection (c)(2)). Similarly, offenses in which the underlying conduct is more
appropriately addressed as sexual exploitation of a minor are referenced to that guideline
(subsection (c)(1)). Among the offenses covered by this guideline is a new offense created by
Section 323 of the Crime Control Act of 1990 (Public Law 101-647). In addition, this
amendment inserts an additional guideline at §2G2.5 to address a recordkeeping offense created
by Section 311 of the Crime Control Act of 1990 (Public Law 101-647).
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1991.
373. Amendment: Chapter Two, Part K, Subpart 1 is amended by deleting §§2K1.3 and 2K1.6 in
their entirety as follows:

(b) Specific Offense Characteristics
If more than one applies, use the greatest:
(1) If the defendant"s conduct involved any written or oral
false or fictitious statement, false record, or
misrepresented identification, increase by 4 levels.
(2) If the offense involved explosives that the defendant
knew or had reason to believe were stolen, increase by 6
levels.
(3) If the defendant knowingly distributed explosives to a
person under twenty-one years of age, to a person
prohibited by state law or ordinance from receiving such
November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment 373
– 233 –
explosives at the place of distribution, or to a person the
defendant had reason to believe intended to transport
such materials into a state in violation of the law of that
state, increase by 4 levels.
(4) If the defendant was a person prohibited from receiving
explosives under 18 U.S.C. § 842(i), or if the defendant
knowingly distributed explosives to a person prohibited
from receiving explosives under 18 U.S.C. § 842(i),
increase by 10 levels.
(5) If a recordkeeping offense reflected an effort to conceal
a substantive offense involving explosives, apply the
guideline for the substantive offense.

Reason for Amendment: This amendment consolidates two guidelines, and revises the
offense levels and characteristics to more adequately reflect the seriousness of such offenses,
including enhancements for defendants previously convicted of felony crimes of violence or
controlled substance offenses. In addition, the amendment inserts an additional guideline to
cover certain recordkeeping offenses.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1991.
374. Amendment: Chapter Two, Part K, Subpart 2 is amended by deleting §§2K2.1, 2K2.2, and
2K2.3 in their entirety as follows:
"§2K2.1. Unlawful Receipt, Possession, or Transportation of Firearms or
Ammunition
(a) Base Offense Level (Apply the greatest):
(1) 18, if the defendant is convicted under
18 U.S.C. § 922(o) or 26 U.S.C. § 5861; or
(2) 12, if the defendant is convicted under 18 U.S.C.
§ 922(g), (h), or (n); or if the defendant, at the time of the
offense, had been convicted in any court of an offense
punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one
year; or
(3) 6, otherwise.
(b) Specific Offense Characteristics
(1) If the defendant obtained or possessed the firearm or
ammunition, other than a firearm covered in 26 U.S.C.
§ 5845(a), solely for lawful sporting purposes or
collection, decrease the offense level determined above
to level 6.
(2) If the firearm was stolen or had an altered or obliterated
serial number, increase by 2 levels.

(c) Cross References
(1) If the offense involved the distribution of a firearm or
possession with intent to distribute, apply §2K2.2
(Unlawful Trafficking and Other Prohibited Transactions
Involving Firearms) if the resulting offense level is
greater than that determined above.
(2) If the defendant used or possessed the firearm in
connection with commission or attempted commission of
another offense, apply §2X1.1 (Attempt, Solicitation, or
Conspiracy) in respect to that other offense, if the
resulting offense level is greater than that determined
above.
Commentary
Statutory Provisions: 18 U.S.C. § 922(a)(1), (a)(3), (a)(4), (a)(6), (e), (f), (g), (h), (i), (j),
(k), (l), (n), and (o); 26 U.S.C. § 5861(b), (c), (d), (h), (i), (j), and (k). For additional
statutory provision(s), see Appendix A (Statutory Index).
Application Notes:
1. The definition of ‘firearm’ used in this section is that set forth in 18 U.S.C.
§ 921(a)(3) (if the defendant is convicted under 18 U.S.C. § 922) and 26 U.S.C.
§ 5845(a) (if the defendant is convicted under 26 U.S.C. § 5861). These
definitions are somewhat broader than that used in Application Note 1(e) of the
Commentary to §1B1.1 (Application Instructions). Under 18 U.S.C. § 921(a)(3),
the term ‘firearm’ means (A) any weapon (including a starter gun) which will or
is designed to or may readily be converted to expel a projectile by the action of
an explosive; (B) the frame or receiver of any such weapon; (C) any firearm
muffler or firearm silencer; or (D) any destructive device. Under 26 U.S.C. §
5845(a), the term ‘firearm’ includes a shotgun, or a weapon made from a shotgun,
with a barrel or barrels of less than 18 inches in length; a weapon made from a
shotgun or rifle with an overall length of less than 26 inches; a rifle, or weapon
made from a rifle, with a barrel or barrels less than 16 inches in length; a machine
gun; a muffler or silencer for a firearm; a destructive device; and certain other
large bore weapons.
2. Under §2K2.1(b)(1), intended lawful use, as determined by the surrounding
circumstances, provides a decrease in the offense level. Relevant circumstances
include, among others, the number and type of firearms (sawed-off shotguns, for
example, have few legitimate uses) and ammunition, the location and
circumstances of possession, the nature of the defendant’s criminal history (e.g.,
whether involving firearms), and the extent to which possession was restricted by
local law.
Background: Under pre-guidelines practice, there was substantial sentencing variation
for these crimes. From the Commission’s investigations, it appeared that the variation
Amendment 374 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003
– 236 –
was attributable primarily to the wide variety of circumstances under which these
offenses occur. Apart from the nature of the defendant’s criminal history, his actual or
intended use of the firearm was probably the most important factor in determining the
sentence.
Statistics showed that pre-guidelines sentences averaged two to three months
lower if the firearm involved was a rifle or an unaltered shotgun. This may reflect the
fact that these weapons tend to be more suitable than others for recreational activities.
However, some rifles or shotguns may be possessed for criminal purposes, while some
handguns may be suitable primarily for recreation. Therefore, the guideline is not based
upon the type of firearm. Intended lawful use, as determined by the surrounding
circumstances, is a mitigating factor.
Available pre-guidelines data were not sufficient to determine the effect a stolen
firearm had on the average sentence. However, reviews of pre-guidelines cases
suggested that this factor tended to result in more severe sentences. Independent studies
show that stolen firearms are used disproportionately in the commission of crimes.
The firearm statutes often are used as a device to enable the federal court to
exercise jurisdiction over offenses that otherwise could be prosecuted only under state
law. For example, a convicted felon may be prosecuted for possessing a firearm if he
used the firearm to rob a gasoline station. In pre-guidelines practice, such prosecutions
resulted in high sentences because of the true nature of the underlying conduct. The
cross reference at §2K2.1(c)(2) deals with such cases.
§2K2.2. Unlawful Trafficking and Other Prohibited Transactions Involving
Firearms
(a) Base Offense Level:
(1) 18, if the defendant is convicted under 18 U.S.C.
§ 922(o) or 26 U.S.C. § 5861;
(2) 6, otherwise.
(b) Specific Offense Characteristics
(1) If the offense involved distribution of a firearm, or
possession with intent to distribute, and the number of
firearms unlawfully distributed, or to be distributed,
exceeded two, increase as follows:
Number of Firearms Increase in Level
(A) 3 - 4 add 1
(B) 5 - 7 add 2
(C) 8 - 12 add 3
(D) 13 - 24 add 4
(E) 25 - 49 add 5
November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment 374
– 237 –
(F) 50 or more add 6.
(2) If any of the firearms was stolen or had an altered or
obliterated serial number, increase by 2 levels.
(3) If more than one of the following applies, use the greater:
(A) If the defendant is convicted under 18 U.S.C.
§ 922(d), increase by 6 levels; or
(B) If the defendant is convicted under 18 U.S.C.
§ 922(b)(1) or (b)(2), increase by 1 level.
(c) Cross Reference
(1) If the defendant, at the time of the offense, had been
convicted in any court of a crime punishable by
imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, apply
§2K2.1 (Unlawful Receipt, Possession, or Transportation
of Firearms or Ammunition) if the resulting offense level
is greater than that determined above.

Application Notes:
1. The definition of ‘firearm’ used in this section is that set forth in 18 U.S.C.
§ 921(a)(3) (if the defendant is convicted under 18 U.S.C. § 922) and 26 U.S.C.
§ 5845(a) (if the defendant is convicted under 26 U.S.C § 5861). These
definitions are somewhat broader than that used in Application Note 1(e) of the

with a barrel or barrels of less than 18 inches in length; a weapon made from a
shotgun or rifle with an overall length of less than 26 inches; a rifle, or weapon
made from a rifle, with a barrel or barrels less than 16 inches in length; a machine

assault rifles).
Background: This guideline applies to a variety of offenses involving firearms, ranging
from unlawful distribution of silencers, machine guns, sawed-off shotguns and
destructive devices, to essentially technical violations.

Statutory Provision: 18 U.S.C. § 930.".
A replacement guideline with accompanying commentary is inserted as §2K2.5 (Possession of
Firearm or Dangerous Weapon in Federal Facility; Possession or Discharge of Firearm in
School Zone).
Reason for Amendment: This amendment consolidates three firearms guidelines and revises
the adjustments and offense levels to more adequately reflect the seriousness of such conduct,
including enhancements for defendants previously convicted of felony crimes of violence or
controlled substance offenses. In addition, §2K1.5 is amended to address offenses committed
within a school zone or federal court facility.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1991.
375. Amendment: Section 2L1.1(a) is amended by deleting "9" and inserting in lieu thereof:
"(1) 20, if the defendant was convicted under 8 U.S.C. § 1327 of a violation involving
an alien who previously was deported after a conviction for an aggravated felony;
or
(2) 9, otherwise.".
Section 2L1.1(b)(1) is amended by inserting "and the base offense level is determined under
subsection (a)(2)," immediately before "decrease".
The Commentary to §2L1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by inserting the
following additional note:
"9. ‘Aggravated felony’ is defined in the Commentary to §2L1.2 (Unlawfully
Entering or Remaining in the United States).".
Section 2L1.2(b) is amended by deleting "Specific Offense Characteristic" and inserting in lieu
thereof:
"Specific Offense Characteristics

Section 2L1.2(b)(1) is amended by deleting "sustaining" immediately before "a conviction";
and by inserting the following additional subdivision:
"(2) If the defendant previously was deported after a conviction for an aggravated
felony, increase by 16 levels.".
The Commentary to §2L1.2 captioned "Statutory Provisions" is amended by deleting "1325"
and inserting in lieu thereof "1325(a)".
Amendment 375 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003
– 240 –
The Commentary to §2L1.2 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 1 by deleting:
"First offenses under 8 U.S.C. § 1325 are petty offenses for which no guideline has been
promulgated.",
and inserting in lieu thereof:
"A first offense under 8 U.S.C. § 1325(a) is a Class B misdemeanor for which no
guideline has been promulgated. A prior sentence for such offense, however, is to be
considered under the provisions of Chapter Four, Part A (Criminal History).".
The Commentary to §2L1.2 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 3 by deleting
"sustaining" immediately before "a conviction"; and by deleting the last sentence as follows:
"In the case of a defendant previously deported after sustaining a conviction for an
aggravated felony as defined in 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a), or for any other violent felony, an
upward departure may be warranted.".
The Commentary to §2L1.2 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by deleting:
"4. The adjustment under §2L1.2(b)(1) is in addition to any criminal history points
added for such conviction in Chapter 4, Part A (Criminal History).",
and inserting in lieu thereof:
"4. A 16-level increase is provided under subsection (b)(2) in the case of a defendant
who was previously deported after a conviction for an aggravated felony.
5. An adjustment under subsection (b)(1) or (b)(2) for a prior felony conviction
applies in addition to any criminal history points added for such conviction in
Chapter Four, Part A (Criminal History).
6. ‘Deported after a conviction,’ as used in subsections (b)(1) and (b)(2), means that
the deportation was subsequent to the conviction, whether or not the deportation
was in response to such conviction.
7. ‘Aggravated felony,’ as used in subsection (b)(2), means murder; any illicit
trafficking in any controlled substance (as defined in 21 U.S.C. § 802), including
any drug trafficking crime as defined in 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(2); any illicit
trafficking in any firearms or destructive devices as defined in 18 U.S.C. § 921;
any offense described in 18 U.S.C. § 1956 (relating to laundering of monetary
instruments); any crime of violence (as defined in 18 U.S.C. § 16, not including
a purely political offense) for which the term of imprisonment imposed
(regardless of any suspension of such imprisonment) is at least five years; or any
attempt or conspiracy to commit any such act. The term ‘aggravated felony’
applies to offenses described in the previous sentence whether in violation of
federal or state law and also applies to offenses described in the previous sentence
in violation of foreign law for which the term of imprisonment was completed
within the previous 15 years. See 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43).".
November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment 376
– 241 –
Reason for Amendment: This amendment adds a specific offense characteristic providing an
increase of 16 levels above the base offense level under §2L1.2 for defendants who reenter the
United States after having been deported subsequent to a conviction for an aggravated felony.
Previously, such cases were addressed by a recommendation for consideration of an upward
departure. This amendment also modifies §2L1.1 to provide a base offense level of 20 for a
defendant who is convicted under 8 U.S.C. § 1327 for an offense involving the smuggling,
transporting, or harboring of an alien who was deported after a conviction for an aggravated
felony. The Commission has determined that these increased offense levels are appropriate to
reflect the serious nature of these offenses. In addition, this amendment revises the
Commentary to §2L1.2 to make the statutory reference more precise, and to clarify the
operation of the guidelines in respect to prior criminal history.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1991.
376. Amendment: Section 2N1.1 is amended in the title by deleting "Serious" and inserting in lieu
thereof "Bodily".
Section 2N1.1 is amended by deleting:
"(b) Cross Reference
(1) If the offense involved extortion, apply §2B3.2 (Extortion by Force or
Threat of Injury or Serious Damage) if the resulting offense level is
greater than that determined above.",
and inserting in lieu thereof:
"(b) Specific Offense Characteristic
(1) (A) If any victim sustained permanent or life-threatening bodily injury,
increase by 4 levels; (B) if any victim sustained serious bodily injury,
increase by 2 levels; or (C) if the degree of injury is between that
specified in subdivisions (A) and (B), increase by 3 levels.
(c) Cross References
(1) If the offense resulted in death, apply §2A1.1 (First Degree Murder) if the
death was caused intentionally or knowingly, or §2A1.2 (Second Degree
Murder) in any other case.
(2) If the offense was tantamount to attempted murder, apply §2A2.1 (Assault
With Intent to Commit Murder; Attempted Murder) if the resulting
offense level is greater than that determined above.
(3) If the offense involved extortion, apply §2B3.2 (Extortion by Force or
Threat of Injury or Serious Damage) if the resulting offense level is
greater than that determined above.
(d) Special Instruction
Amendment 376 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003
– 242 –
(1) If the defendant is convicted of a single count involving (A) the death or
permanent, life-threatening, or serious bodily injury of more than one
victim, or (B) conduct tantamount to the attempted murder of more than
one victim, Chapter Three, Part D (Multiple Counts) shall be applied as
if the defendant had been convicted of a separate count for each such
victim.".
The Commentary to §2N1.1 captioned "Application Note" is amended by deleting:
"1. If death, bodily injury, extreme psychological injury, or substantial property
damage or monetary loss resulted, an upward departure may be warranted. See
Chapter Five, Part K (Departures).",
and inserting in lieu thereof:
"1. The base offense level reflects that this offense typically poses a risk of death or
serious bodily injury to one or more victims; or causes, or is intended to cause,
bodily injury. Where the offense posed a substantial risk of death or serious
bodily injury to numerous victims, or caused extreme psychological injury or
substantial property damage or monetary loss, an upward departure may be
warranted. In the unusual case in which the offense did not cause a risk of death
or serious bodily injury, and neither caused nor was intended to cause bodily
injury, a downward departure may be warranted.
2. The special instruction in subsection (d)(1) applies whether the offense level is
determined under subsection (b)(1) or by use of a cross reference in subsection
(c).";
and in the caption by deleting "Note" and inserting in lieu thereof "Notes".
The Commentary to §2N1.1 captioned "Background" is deleted in its entirety as follows:
"Background: The base offense level reflects the risk of death or serious injury posed
to significant numbers of people by this type of product tampering.".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment adds a specific offense characteristic for
permanent, life-threatening, or serious bodily injury, and adds cross references for cases in
which the offense resulted in death or was tantamount to attempted murder. In addition, a
special instruction is added to address certain conduct involving multiple victims. Finally, the
title of this guideline is revised to reflect more accurately the coverage of the guideline, and the
background commentary is revised to clarify the "heartland" conduct to which the guideline
applies.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1991.
377. Amendment: Section 2R1.1(a) is amended by deleting "9" and inserting in lieu thereof "10".
Section 2R1.1(b)(2) is amended by deleting "less than $1,000,000 or more than $4,000,000"
and inserting in lieu thereof "more than $400,000"; and by deleting:

(D) More than $15,000,000 add 2
(E) More than $50,000,000 add 3",
and inserting in lieu thereof:
"(A) More than $400,000 add 1
(B) More than $1,000,000 add 2
(C) More than $2,500,000 add 3
(D) More than $6,250,000 add 4
(E) More than $15,000,000 add 5
(F) More than $37,500,000 add 6
(G) More than $100,000,000 add 7.".
Section 2R1.1 is amended by deleting:
"(c) Fines
A fine shall be imposed in addition to any term of imprisonment. The guideline
fine range for an individual conspirator is from 4 to 10 percent of the volume of
commerce, but not less than $20,000. The fine range for an organization is from
20 to 50 percent of the volume of commerce, but not less than $100,000.",
and inserting in lieu thereof:
"(c) Special Instruction for Fines
(1) For an individual, the guideline fine range shall be from one to five
percent of the volume of commerce, but not less than $20,000.".
The Commentary to §2R1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by deleting:
"1. Because the guideline sentences depend on the volume of commerce done by
each firm, role in the offense is implicitly taken into account. Accordingly, the
provisions of §3B1.1 (Aggravating Role) are to be applied only in unusual
circumstances. An increase for role under §3B1.1 might be appropriate only
where a defendant actually coerced others into participating in a conspiracy -- an
unusual circumstance. Conversely, a decrease for role under §3B1.2 (Mitigating
Role) would not be appropriate merely because an individual defendant or his
firm did not profit substantially from the violation. An individual defendant
should be considered for a downward adjustment for a mitigating role in the
offense only if he was responsible in some minor way for his firm’s participation
in the conspiracy. A complementary bidder who did not win a bid would not for
that reason qualify for a downward adjustment, but a low-level employee who
participated in only one of several agreements constituting a conspiracy would.",
and inserting in lieu thereof:
Amendment 377 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003
– 244 –
"1. The provisions of §3B1.1 (Aggravating Role) and §3B1.2 (Mitigating Role)
should be applied to an individual defendant as appropriate to reflect the
individual’s role in committing the offense. For example, if a sales manager
organizes or leads the price-fixing activity of five or more participants, a 4-level
increase is called for under §3B1.1. An individual defendant should be
considered for a downward adjustment under §3B1.2 for a mitigating role in the
offense only if he was responsible in some minor way for his firm’s participation
in the conspiracy.".
The Commentary to §2R1.1 captioned "Background" is amended in the third paragraph by
deleting "four" and inserting in lieu thereof "six".
The Commentary to §2R1.1 captioned "Background" is amended by deleting the fourth
paragraph as follows:
" The guideline imprisonment terms represent a substantial change from pre-
guidelines practice. Under pre-guidelines practice, approximately 39 percent of all
individuals convicted of antitrust violations were imprisoned. Considering all defendants
sentenced, the average time served under pre-guidelines practice was only forty-
five days. The guideline prison terms are, however, consistent with the parole guidelines.
The fines specified in the guideline represent substantial increases over pre-guidelines
practice. Under pre-guidelines practice, the average fine for individuals was only
approximately $27,000; for corporations, it was approximately $160,000.".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment increases the offense levels for antitrust violations
to make them more comparable to the offense levels for fraud with similar amounts of loss. The
base offense level for antitrust violations starts higher than the base offense level for fraud
violations to reflect the serious nature of and the difficulty of detecting such violations, but the
offense levels for antitrust offenses based on volume of commerce increase less rapidly than
the offense levels for fraud, in part, because, on the average, the level of mark-up from an
antitrust violation may tend to decline with the volume of commerce involved. This
amendment also reduces the minimum guideline fine level based on the volume of commerce
to reflect a marginal shift from fines to imprisonment as the more effective means to deter
antitrust offenses. The provision addressing fines for organizational defendants in the current
guideline is deleted. Such fines are addressed by the provisions pertaining to the sentencing
of organizational defendants that are added by a separate amendment (amendment 422).
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1991.
378. Amendment: Section 2S1.1(a)(1) is amended by deleting "or (a)(2)(A)" and inserting in lieu
thereof
", (a)(2)(A), or (a)(3)(A)".
Section 2S1.1(b)(1) is amended by inserting "or believed" immediately following "knew".
The Commentary to §2S1.1 captioned "Background" is amended in the third paragraph by
deleting "or (a)(2)(A)" and inserting in lieu thereof ", (a)(2)(A), or (a)(3)(A)"; and by deleting
"did not merely conceal a serious crime that had already taken place, but" immediately before
"encouraged".
November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment 379
– 245 –
Reason for Amendment: This amendment revises this guideline to reflect the enactment of
subsection (a)(3) of 18 U.S.C. § 1956 that authorizes undercover "sting" operations in money
laundering cases. Such cases differ from those prosecuted under subsection (a)(1) in that the
money being laundered is not actually criminal proceeds, but is government "sting" money that
an undercover officer represents to be criminal proceeds. In all other respects, subsections
(a)(1) and (a)(3) are the same.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1991.
379. Amendment: Section 2S1.3(a)(1) is amended by deleting:
"(B) made false statements to conceal or disguise the evasion of reporting
requirements; or
(C) reasonably should have believed that the funds were criminally derived
property;",
and inserting in lieu thereof:
"(B) knowingly filed, or caused another to file, a report containing materially false
statements; or".
Section 2S1.3(b)(1) is amended by deleting "5 levels." and inserting in lieu thereof "4 levels.
If the resulting offense level is less than level 13, increase to level 13.".
The Commentary to §2S1.3 captioned "Statutory Provisions" is amended by deleting
"18 U.S.C. § 1005;"; and by deleting "5316," immediately before "5322".
The Commentary to §2S1.3 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by deleting:
"2. Subsection (a)(1)(C) applies where a reasonable person would have believed
from the circumstances that the funds were criminally derived property.
Subsection (b)(1) applies if the defendant knew or believed the funds were
criminally derived property. Subsection (b)(1) applies in addition to, and not in
lieu of, subsection (a)(1)(C). Where subsection (b)(1) applies, subsection
(a)(1)(C) also will apply. It is possible that a defendant ‘believed’ or ‘reasonably
should have believed’ that the funds were criminally derived property even if, in
fact, the funds were not so derived (e.g., in a ‘sting’ operation where the
defendant is told the funds were derived from the unlawful sale of controlled
substances).";
and in the caption by deleting "Notes" and inserting in lieu thereof "Note".
The Commentary to §2S1.3 captioned "Background" is amended by deleting the second and
third paragraphs as follows:
" A base offense level of 13 is provided for those offenses where the defendant
either structured the transaction to evade reporting requirements, made false statements
to conceal or disguise the activity, or reasonably should have believed that the funds
Amendment 379 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003
– 246 –
were criminally derived property. A lower alternative base offense level of 5 is provided
in all other cases. The Commission anticipates that such cases will involve simple
recordkeeping or other more minor technical violations of the regulatory scheme
governing certain monetary transactions committed by defendants who reasonably
believe that the funds at issue emanated from legitimate sources.
Where the defendant actually knew or believed that the funds were criminally
derived property, subsection (b)(1) provides for a 5 level increase in the offense level.",
and inserting in lieu thereof:
" A base offense level of 13 is provided for those offenses where the defendant
either structured the transaction to evade reporting requirements or knowingly filed, or
caused another to file, a report containing materially false statements. A lower
alternative base offense level of 5 is provided in all other cases.
Where the defendant actually knew or believed that the funds were criminally
derived property, subsection (b)(1) provides for the greater of a 4-level increase or an
increase to level 13.".
Chapter Two, Part S is amended by inserting an additional guideline with accompanying
commentary as §2S1.4 (Failure to File Currency and Monetary Instrument Report).
Reason for Amendment: This amendment clarifies the scope of the specific offense
characteristics in §2S1.3 and modifies subsection (b)(1) so that it does not produce a result that
exceeds the comparable offense level under §2S1.2. In addition, this amendment creates an
additional offense guideline (§2S1.4) for offenses involving Currency and Monetary Instrument
Reports (CMIR). Currently, such offenses are covered by §2S1.3, which deals with all
currency transaction reporting requirements. CMIR violations are committed by individuals
who, when entering or leaving the country, knowingly conceal $10,000 or more in cash or
bearer instruments on their persons or in their personal effects and knowingly fail to file the
report required by the U.S. Customs Service. Such criminal conduct is sufficiently different
from the other offenses covered by §2S1.3 to merit treatment in a separate guideline.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1991.
380. Amendment: Section 2X3.1(a) is amended by inserting the following additional sentence at
the end:
"Provided, that where the conduct is limited to harboring a fugitive, the offense level
shall not be more than level 20.".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment distinguishes harboring a fugitive from other forms
of accessory after the fact by providing a lower maximum offense level for such cases
reflective, in part, of the lower statutory maximum provided for such offenses.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1991.
November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment 381
– 247 –
381. Amendment: The Commentary to §4A1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by
inserting the following additional sentence as the second sentence of Note 4 and the third
sentence of Note 5:
"Failure to report for service of a sentence of imprisonment is to be treated as an escape
from such sentence. See §4A1.2(n).".
The Commentary to §4A1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in the third (formerly
second) sentence of Note 4 by inserting the following immediately before the period at the end
of the sentence:
"having a custodial or supervisory component, although active supervision is not
required for this item to apply. For example, a term of unsupervised probation would be
included; but a sentence to pay a fine, by itself, would not be included. A defendant who
commits the instant offense while a violation warrant from a prior sentence is outstanding
(e.g., a probation, parole, or supervised release violation warrant) shall be deemed to be
under a criminal justice sentence for the purposes of this provision if that sentence is
otherwise countable, even if that sentence would have expired absent such warrant. See
§4A1.2(m)".
Section 4A1.2(a) is amended by inserting the following additional subdivision:
"(4) Where a defendant has been convicted of an offense, but not yet sentenced, such
conviction shall be counted as if it constituted a prior sentence under §4A1.1(c)
if a sentence resulting from that conviction otherwise would be countable. In the
case of a conviction for an offense set forth in §4A1.2(c)(1), apply this provision
only where the sentence for such offense would be countable regardless of type
or length.
‘Convicted of an offense,’ for the purposes of this provision, means that the guilt
of the defendant has been established, whether by guilty plea, trial, or plea of
nolo contendere.".
Section 4A1.2(k)(2) is amended by deleting the last sentence as follows:
"It may also affect the time period under which certain sentences are counted as provided
in §4A1.2(e)(1).";
by inserting "(A)" immediately after "(2)"; and by inserting the following additional
subdivision:
"(B) Revocation of probation, parole, supervised release, special parole, or mandatory
release may affect the time period under which certain sentences are counted as
provided in §4A1.2(d)(2) and (e). For the purposes of determining the applicable
time period, use the following: (i) in the case of an adult term of imprisonment
totaling more than one year and one month, the date of last release from
incarceration on such sentence (see §4A1.2(e)(1)); (ii) in the case of any other
confinement sentence for an offense committed prior to the defendant’s
eighteenth birthday, the date of the defendant’s last release from confinement on
Amendment 381 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003
– 248 –
such sentence (see §4A1.2(d)(2)(A)); and (iii) in any other case, the date of the
original sentence (see §4A1.2(d)(2)(B) and (e)(2)).".
Section 4A1.2 is amended by inserting the following additional subsections:
"(l) Sentences on Appeal
Prior sentences under appeal are counted except as expressly provided below. In
the case of a prior sentence, the execution of which has been stayed pending
appeal, §4A1.1(a), (b), (c), (d), and (f) shall apply as if the execution of such
sentence had not been stayed; §4A1.1(e) shall not apply.
(m) Effect of a Violation Warrant
For the purposes of §4A1.1(d), a defendant who commits the instant offense
while a violation warrant from a prior sentence is outstanding (e.g., a probation,
parole, or supervised release violation warrant) shall be deemed to be under a
criminal justice sentence if that sentence is otherwise countable, even if that
sentence would have expired absent such warrant.
(n) Failure to Report for Service of Sentence of Imprisonment
For the purposes of §4A1.1(d) and (e), failure to report for service of a sentence
of imprisonment shall be treated as an escape from such sentence.
(o) Felony Offense
For the purposes of §4A1.2(c), a ‘felony offense’ means any federal, state, or
local offense punishable by death or a term of imprisonment exceeding one year,
regardless of the actual sentence imposed.".
The Commentary to §4A1.2 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 1 by inserting
the following additional paragraph:
"Under §4A1.2(a)(4), a conviction for which the defendant has not yet been sentenced
is treated as if it were a prior sentence under §4A1.1(c) if a sentence resulting from such
conviction otherwise would have been counted. In the case of an offense set forth in
§4A1.2(c)(1) (which lists certain misdemeanor and petty offenses), a conviction for
which the defendant has not yet been sentenced is treated as if it were a prior sentence
under §4A1.2(a)(4) only where the offense is similar to the instant offense (because
sentences for other offenses set forth in §4A1.2(c)(1) are counted only if they are of a
specified type and length).".
The Commentary to §4A1.2 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 2 by inserting,
immediately after "stated maximum", the following:
"(e.g., in the case of a determinate sentence of five years, the stated maximum is five
years; in the case of an indeterminate sentence of one to five years, the stated maximum
is five years; in the case of an indeterminate sentence for a term not to exceed five years,
November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment 382
– 249 –
the stated maximum is five years; in the case of an indeterminate sentence for a term not
to exceed the defendant’s twenty-first birthday, the stated maximum is the amount of
time in pre-trial detention plus the amount of time between the date of sentence and the
defendant’s twenty-first birthday)".
The Commentary to §4A1.2 is amended in Note 11 by inserting the following additional
paragraph at the end:
"Where a revocation applies to multiple sentences, and such sentences are counted
separately under §4A1.2(a)(2), add the term of imprisonment imposed upon revocation
to the sentence that will result in the greatest increase in criminal history points.
Example: A defendant was serving two probationary sentences, each counted separately
under §4A1.2(a)(2); probation was revoked on both sentences as a result of the same
violation conduct; and the defendant was sentenced to a total of 45 days of imprisonment.
If one sentence had been a ‘straight’ probationary sentence and the other had been a
probationary sentence that had required service of 15 days of imprisonment, the
revocation term of imprisonment (45 days) would be added to the probationary sentence
that had the 15-day term of imprisonment. This would result in a total of 2 criminal
history points under §4A1.1(b) (for the combined 60-day term of imprisonment) and 1
criminal history point under §4A1.1(c) (for the other probationary sentence).".
Section 4A1.3(d) is amended by deleting ", sentencing, or appeal" and inserting in lieu thereof
"or sentencing".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment clarifies the meaning of the term "under a criminal
justice sentence" as used in §4A1.1; inserts a new subdivision in §4A1.2(a) to address the case
in which the defendant has been convicted of a prior offense, but has not yet been sentenced
for that offense; inserts an additional subdivision in §4A1.2(k) to clarify the determination of
the applicable time periods in revocation cases; inserts additional subsections in §4A1.2 to
address the counting of sentences stayed pending appeal, the effect of a violation warrant on
the counting of points under §4A1.1(d), the counting of a failure to report for service of
sentence under §4A1.1(d) and (e), and the definition of a felony offense as used in §4A1.2(c);
adds an example to Application Note 2 in the Commentary to §4A1.2 to illustrate the meaning
of "stated maximum" sentence; adds an additional application note in the Commentary to
§4A1.2 addressing the counting of points in complex revocation cases; and conforms the
Commentary of §4A1.3 to the addition of §4A1.2(l).
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1991.
382. Amendment: Section 4A1.1 is amended by inserting the following additional subsection:
"(f) Add 1 point for each prior sentence resulting from a conviction of a crime of
violence that did not receive any points under (a), (b), or (c) above because such
sentence was considered related to another sentence resulting from a conviction
of a crime of violence, up to a total of 3 points for this item. Provided, that this
item does not apply where the sentences are considered related because the
offenses occurred on the same occasion.".
Amendment 382 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003
– 250 –
Section 4A1.1 is amended in the first sentence by deleting "(e)" and inserting in lieu thereof
"(f)".
Section 4A1.1(c) is amended by deleting "included" and inserting in lieu thereof "counted".
The Commentary to §4A1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by inserting the
following additional note:
"6. §4A1.1(f). Where the defendant received two or more prior sentences as a result
of convictions for crimes of violence that are treated as related cases but did not
arise from the same occasion (i.e., offenses committed on different occasions that
were part of a single common scheme or plan or were consolidated for trial or
sentencing; see Application Note 3 of the Commentary to §4A1.2), one point is
added under §4A1.1(f) for each such sentence that did not result in any additional
points under §4A1.1(a), (b), or (c). A total of up to 3 points may be added under
§4A1.1(f). ‘Crime of violence’ is defined in §4B1.2(1); see §4A1.2(p).
For example, a defendant’s criminal history includes two robbery convictions for
offenses committed on different occasions that were consolidated for sentencing
and therefore are treated as related. If the defendant received a five-year sentence
of imprisonment for one robbery and a four-year sentence of imprisonment for
the other robbery (consecutively or concurrently), a total of 3 points is added
under §4A1.1(a). An additional point is added under §4A1.1(f) because the
second sentence did not result in any additional point(s) (under §4A1.1(a), (b),
or (c)). In contrast, if the defendant received a one-year sentence of
imprisonment for one robbery and a nine-month consecutive sentence of
imprisonment for the other robbery, a total of 3 points also is added under
§4A1.1(a) (a one-year sentence of imprisonment and a consecutive nine-month
sentence of imprisonment are treated as a combined one-year-nine-month
sentence of imprisonment). But no additional point is added under §4A1.1(f)
because the sentence for the second robbery already resulted in an additional
point under §4A1.1(a). Without the second sentence, the defendant would only
have received two points under §4A1.1(b) for the one-year sentence of
imprisonment).".
Section 4A1.2(a)(2) is amended by deleting "the criminal history" and inserting in lieu thereof
"§4A1.1(a), (b), and (c)".
Section 4A1.2 is amended by inserting the following additional subsection:
"(p) Crime of Violence Defined
For the purposes of §4A1.1(f), the definition of ‘crime of violence’ is that set
forth in §4B1.2(1).".
The Commentary to §4A1.2 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 3 by deleting:
"Cases are considered related if they (1) occurred on a single occasion,",
November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment 383
– 251 –
and inserting in lieu thereof:
"Prior sentences are not considered related if they were for offenses that were separated
by an intervening arrest (i.e., the defendant is arrested for the first offense prior to
committing the second offense). Otherwise, prior sentences are considered related if they
resulted from offenses that (1) occurred on the same occasion,";
and by deleting:
"For example, if the defendant commits a number of offenses on independent occasions
separated by arrests, and the resulting criminal cases are consolidated and result in a
combined sentence of eight years, counting merely three points for this factor will not
adequately reflect either the seriousness of the defendant’s criminal history or the
frequency with which he commits crimes. In such circumstances, the court should
consider whether departure is warranted. See §4A1.3.",
and inserting in lieu thereof:
"For example, if a defendant was convicted of a number of serious non-violent offenses
committed on different occasions, and the resulting sentences were treated as related
because the cases were consolidated for sentencing, the assignment of a single set of
points may not adequately reflect the seriousness of the defendant’s criminal history or
the frequency with which he has committed crimes. In such circumstances, an upward
departure may be warranted. Note that the above example refers to serious non-violent
offenses. Where prior related sentences result from convictions of crimes of violence,
§4A1.1(f) will apply.".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment provides for a specific enhancement under
§4A1.2(f) in certain cases having prior convictions of crimes of violence not arising from the
same incident that otherwise would be treated as related under §4A1.2. In addition, the
definition of related cases in Application Note 3 in the Commentary to §4A1.2 is amended to
provide that cases separated by an intervening arrest for one of the offenses are not treated as
related cases.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1991.
383. Amendment: Section 5E1.1 is amended by redesignating subsections (b) and (c) as (c) and (d),
respectively; and by deleting:
"(a) Restitution shall be ordered for convictions under Title 18 of the United States
Code or under 49 U.S.C. § 1472(h), (i), (j) or (n) in accordance with
18 U.S.C. § 3663(d), and may be ordered as a condition of probation or
supervised release in any other case.",
and inserting in lieu thereof:
"(a) The court shall --
Amendment 383 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003
– 252 –
(1) enter a restitution order if such order is authorized under 18 U.S.C.
§§ 3663-3664; or
(2) if a restitution order would be authorized under 18 U.S.C. §§ 3663-3664,
except for the fact that the offense of conviction is not an offense set forth
in Title 18, United States Code, or 49 U.S.C. § 1472(h), (i), (j), or (n),
impose a term of probation or supervised release with a condition
requiring restitution.
(b) Provided, that the provisions of subsection (a) do not apply when full restitution
has been made, or to the extent the court determines that the complication and
prolongation of the sentencing process resulting from the fashioning of a
restitution requirement outweighs the need to provide restitution to any victims
through the criminal process.".
The Commentary to §5E1.1 captioned "Background" is amended in the first paragraph by
deleting the last sentence as follows:
"An order of restitution may be appropriate in offenses not specifically referenced in
18 U.S.C. § 3663 where victims require relief more promptly than the civil justice system
provides.".
The Commentary to §5E1.1 captioned "Background" is amended in the second paragraph by
deleting "5E1.1 requires the court to order restitution for offenses under Title 18, or 49 U.S.C. §
1472(h), (i), (j) or (n), unless" and inserting in lieu thereof "(a)(1) of this guideline requires the
court to order restitution for offenses under Title 18, United States Code, or 49 U.S.C. §
1472(h), (i), (j) or (n), unless full restitution has already been made or".
The Commentary to §5E1.1 captioned "Background" is amended in the sixth paragraph by
deleting "how and to whom" and by inserting in lieu thereof "the manner in which, and the
persons to whom,".
The Commentary to §5E1.1. captioned "Background" is amended by inserting the following
additional paragraph at the end:
" Subsection (a)(2) provides for restitution as a condition of probation or supervised
release for offenses not set forth in Title 18, United States Code, or 49 U.S.C. § 1472(h),
(i), (j), or (n).".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment expands §5E1.1 to require restitution as a condition
of probation or supervised release for offenses not set forth in Title 18 and 49 U.S.C. § 1472(h),
(i), (j), and (n). Currently, §5E1.1 permits, but does not require, restitution to be ordered as a
condition of probation or supervised release for offenses not set forth in Title 18, United States
Code, or 49 U.S.C. § 1472(h) (i), (j), and (n).
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1991.
November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment 384
– 253 –
384. Amendment: Section 5E1.2(c) is amended by deleting:
"(1) The minimum of the fine range is the greater of:
(A) the amount shown in column A of the table below; or
(B) the pecuniary gain to the defendant, less restitution made or ordered.
(2) Except as specified in (4) below, the maximum of the fine range is the greater of:
(A) the amount shown in column B of the table below;
(B) twice the gross pecuniary loss caused by the offense; or
(C) three times the gross pecuniary gain to all participants in the offense.",
and inserting in lieu thereof:
"(1) The minimum of the fine range is the amount shown in column A of the table
below.
(2) Except as specified in (4) below, the maximum of the fine range is the amount
shown in column B of the table below.".
The Commentary to §5E1.2 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 3 by deleting
the first two paragraphs as follows:
"Alternative fine limits are provided in subsection (c). The terms ‘pecuniary gain’ and
‘pecuniary loss’ are taken from 18 U.S.C. § 3571(d). The Commission does not intend
precise or detailed calculation of the gain or loss in using the alternative fine limits.
Where it is readily ascertainable that the defendant cannot, and is not likely to become
able to, pay a fine greater than the maximum fine set forth in Column B of the Fine Table
in subsection (c)(3), calculation of the alternative maximum fines under subsections
(c)(2)(B) (twice the gross pecuniary loss caused by the offense) and (c)(2)(C) (three
times the gross pecuniary gain to all participants in the offense) is unnecessary. In such
cases, a statement that ‘the alternative maximums of the fine table were not calculated
because it is readily ascertainable that the defendant cannot, and is not likely to become
able to, pay a fine greater than the maximum set forth in the fine table’ is recommended
in lieu of such calculations.".
The Commentary to §5E1.2 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by deleting:
"4. ‘Restitution made or ordered’ refers to restitution for the instant offense made
before or at the time of sentencing, as well as any restitution ordered at the time
of sentencing for the instant offense.",
and inserting in lieu thereof:
Amendment 384 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003
– 254 –
"4. The Commission envisions that for most defendants, the maximum of the
guideline fine range from subsection (c) will be at least twice the amount of gain
or loss resulting from the offense. Where, however, two times either the amount
of gain to the defendant or the amount of loss caused by the offense exceeds the
maximum of the fine guideline, an upward departure from the fine guideline may
be warranted.
Moreover, where a sentence within the applicable fine guideline range would not
be sufficient to ensure both the disgorgement of any gain from the offense that
otherwise would not be disgorged (e.g., by restitution or forfeiture) and an
adequate punitive fine, an upward departure from the fine guideline range may
be warranted.".
The Commentary to §5E1.2 captioned "Background" is deleted in its entirety as follows:
"Background: These guidelines permit a relatively wide range of fines. The
Commission may promulgate more detailed guidelines for the imposition of fines after
analyzing practice under these initial guidelines.
Recent legislation provides for substantial increases in fines.
18 U.S.C. § 3571(b). With few restrictions, 42 U.S.C. § 10601(b), and (c) authorize fine
payments up to $100 million to be deposited in the Crime Victims Fund in the United
States Treasury. With vigorous enforcement, higher fines should be effective punitive
and deterrent sanctions.
A larger multiple of the gain than of the loss is used in subsection (c)(2) because
most offenses result in losses to society that exceed the gain to the participants. In
addition, in many such cases restitution will not be feasible. These larger fines
authorized under subsection (c)(2) are, of course, subject to the absolute limits on fines
that are imposed by statute.
The Commission has not attempted to define gain or loss precisely. It is expected
that the terms will be used flexibly and consistently with their use in the criminal code,
including former 18 U.S.C. § 3623(c)(1).".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment is designed to simplify the operation of this
guideline and conserve probation and court resources by eliminating the need for the
determination of loss and gain under this section in most cases. Experience has shown that for
the vast majority of defendants, the amount from the fine table in subsection (c)(3) or the
amount from subsection (c)(4), as applicable, is more than twice the gain or loss from the
offense. This amendment provides that the guideline fine range is to be determined from
subsection (c)(3) or (c)(4), as applicable. In the unusual case in which twice the defendant’s
gain from the offense or twice the loss caused by the offense exceeds the maximum of the
guideline range, an upward departure may be considered.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1991.
November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment 386
– 255 –
385. Amendment: Chapter Five, Part G is amended by deleting §5G1.3 in its entirety as follows:
"§5G1.3. Imposition of a Sentence on a Defendant Serving an Unexpired Term of
Imprisonment
If the instant offense was committed while the defendant was serving a
term of imprisonment (including work release, furlough, or escape status),
the sentence for the instant offense shall be imposed to run consecutively
to the unexpired term of imprisonment.
Commentary
Under this guideline, the court shall impose a consecutive sentence where the
instant offense (or any part thereof) was committed while the defendant was serving an
unexpired term of imprisonment.
Where the defendant is serving an unexpired term of imprisonment, but did not
commit the instant offense while serving that term of imprisonment, the sentence for the
instant offense may be imposed to run consecutively or concurrently with the unexpired
term of imprisonment. The court may consider imposing a sentence for the instant
offense that results in a combined sentence that approximates the total punishment that
would have been imposed under §5G1.2 (Sentencing on Multiple Counts of Conviction)
had all of the offenses been federal offenses for which sentences were being imposed at
the same time. Where the defendant is serving a term of imprisonment for a state
offense, the information available may permit only a rough estimate of the total
punishment that would have been imposed under the guidelines. It is not intended that
the above methodology be applied in a manner that unduly complicates or prolongs the
sentencing process.".
A replacement guideline with accompanying commentary is inserted as §5G1.3 (Imposition of
a Sentence on a Defendant Subject to an Undischarged Term of Imprisonment).
Reason for Amendment: This amendment provides additional structure and guidance for the
decision to impose a consecutive or concurrent sentence upon a defendant subject to an
undischarged term of imprisonment to reduce the potential for unwarranted disparity in such
determinations.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1991.
386. Amendment: The Introductory Commentary to Chapter Five, Part H is amended by deleting:
" Congress has directed the Commission to consider whether certain specific
offender characteristics ‘have any relevance to the nature, extent, place of service, or
other incidents of an appropriate sentence’ and to take them into account only to the
extent they are determined relevant by the Commission. 28 U.S.C. § 994(d).",
and inserting in lieu thereof:
Amendment 386 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003
– 256 –
" The following policy statements address the relevance of certain offender
characteristics to the determination of whether a sentence should be outside the
applicable guideline range and, in certain cases, to the determination of a sentence within
the applicable guideline range. Under 28 U.S.C. § 994(d), the Commission is directed
to consider whether certain specific offender characteristics ‘have any relevance to the
nature, extent, place of service, or other incidents of an appropriate sentence’ and to take
them into account only to the extent they are determined to be relevant by the
Commission.
The Commission has determined that certain factors are not ordinarily relevant
to the determination of whether a sentence should be outside the applicable guideline
range. Unless expressly stated, this does not mean that the Commission views such
factors as necessarily inappropriate to the determination of the sentence within the
applicable guideline range or to the determination of various other incidents of an
appropriate sentence (e.g., the appropriate conditions of probation or supervised
release).".
Section 5H1.1 is amended by deleting:
"Age is not ordinarily relevant in determining whether a sentence should be outside the
guidelines. Neither is it ordinarily relevant in determining the type of sentence to be
imposed when the guidelines provide sentencing options. Age may be a reason to go
below the guidelines when the offender is elderly and infirm and where a form of
punishment (e.g., home confinement) might be equally efficient as and less costly than
incarceration. If, independent of the consideration of age, a defendant is sentenced to
probation or supervised release, age may be relevant in the determination of the length
and conditions of supervision.",
and inserting in lieu thereof:
"Age (including youth) is not ordinarily relevant in determining whether a sentence
should be outside the applicable guideline range. Age may be a reason to impose a
sentence below the applicable guideline range when the defendant is elderly and infirm
and where a form of punishment such as home confinement might be equally efficient
as and less costly than incarceration. Physical condition, which may be related to age,
is addressed at §5H1.4 (Physical Condition, Including Drug or Alcohol Dependence or
Abuse).
The guidelines are not applicable to a person sentenced as a juvenile delinquent under
the provisions of 18 U.S.C. § 5037.".
Section 5H1.2 is amended by deleting:
"Education and vocational skills are not ordinarily relevant in determining whether a
sentence should be outside the guidelines, but the extent to which a defendant may have
misused special training or education to facilitate criminal activity is an express guideline
factor. See §3B1.3 (Abuse of Position of Trust or Use of Special Skill). Neither are
education and vocational skills relevant in determining the type of sentence to be
imposed when the guidelines provide sentencing options. If, independent of
November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment 386
– 257 –
consideration of education and vocational skills, a defendant is sentenced to probation
or supervised release, these considerations may be relevant in the determination of the
length and conditions of supervision for rehabilitative purposes, for public protection by
restricting activities that allow for the utilization of a certain skill, or in determining the
type or length of community service.",
and by inserting in lieu thereof:
"Education and vocational skills are not ordinarily relevant in determining whether a
sentence should be outside the applicable guideline range, but the extent to which a
defendant may have misused special training or education to facilitate criminal activity

Skill).
Education and vocational skills may be relevant in determining the conditions of
probation or supervised release for rehabilitative purposes, for public protection by
restricting activities that allow for the utilization of a certain skill, or in determining the
appropriate type of community service.".
Section 5H1.3 is amended by deleting:
"Mental and emotional conditions are not ordinarily relevant in determining whether a
sentence should be outside the guidelines, except as provided in the general provisions
in Chapter Five. Mental and emotional conditions, whether mitigating or aggravating,
may be relevant in determining the length and conditions of probation or supervised
release.",
and inserting in lieu thereof:
"Mental and emotional conditions are not ordinarily relevant in determining whether a
sentence should be outside the applicable guideline range, except as provided in Chapter
Five, Part K, Subpart 2 (Other Grounds for Departure).
Mental and emotional conditions may be relevant in determining the conditions of
probation or supervised release; e.g., participation in a mental health program (see
recommended condition (24) at §5B1.4 (Recommended Conditions of Probation and
Supervised Release)).".
Section 5H1.4 is amended by deleting:
"Physical Condition, Including Drug Dependence and Alcohol Abuse (Policy Statement)
Physical condition is not ordinarily relevant in determining whether a sentence should
be outside the guidelines or where within the guidelines a sentence should fall. However,
an extraordinary physical impairment may be a reason to impose a sentence other than
imprisonment.
Drug dependence or alcohol abuse is not a reason for imposing a sentence below the
guidelines. Substance abuse is highly correlated to an increased propensity to commit

crime. Due to this increased risk, it is highly recommended that a defendant who is
incarcerated also be sentenced to supervised release with a requirement that the defendant
participate in an appropriate substance abuse program. If participation in a substance
abuse program is required, the length of supervised release should take into account the
length of time necessary for the supervisory body to judge the success of the program.
This provision would also apply in cases where the defendant received a sentence of
probation. The substance abuse condition is strongly recommended and the length of
probation should be adjusted accordingly. Failure to comply would normally result in
revocation of probation.",
and inserting in lieu thereof:
"Physical Condition, Including Drug or Alcohol Dependence or Abuse (Policy
Statement)
Physical condition or appearance, including physique, is not ordinarily relevant in
determining whether a sentence should be outside the applicable guideline range.
However, an extraordinary physical impairment may be a reason to impose a sentence
below the applicable guideline range; e.g., in the case of a seriously infirm defendant,
home detention may be as efficient as, and less costly than, imprisonment.
Drug or alcohol dependence or abuse is not a reason for imposing a sentence below the
guidelines. Substance abuse is highly correlated to an increased propensity to commit
crime. Due to this increased risk, it is highly recommended that a defendant who is
incarcerated also be sentenced to supervised release with a requirement that the defendant
participate in an appropriate substance abuse program (see recommended condition (23)
at §5B1.4 (Recommended Conditions of Probation and Supervised Release)). If
participation in a substance abuse program is required, the length of supervised release
should take into account the length of time necessary for the supervisory body to judge
the success of the program.
Similarly, where a defendant who is a substance abuser is sentenced to probation, it is
strongly recommended that the conditions of probation contain a requirement that the
defendant participate in an appropriate substance abuse program (see recommended
condition (23) at §5B1.4 (Recommended Conditions of Probation and Supervised
Release)).".
Section 5H1.5 is amended by deleting:
"Employment record is not ordinarily relevant in determining whether a sentence should
be outside the guidelines or where within the guidelines a sentence should fall.
Employment record may be relevant in determining the type of sentence to be imposed
when the guidelines provide for sentencing options. If, independent of the consideration
of employment record, a defendant is sentenced to probation or supervised release,
considerations of employment record may be relevant in the determination of the length
and conditions of supervision.",
November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment 387
– 259 –
and inserting in lieu thereof:
"Employment record is not ordinarily relevant in determining whether a sentence should
be outside the applicable guideline range.
Employment record may be relevant in determining the conditions of probation or
supervised release (e.g., the appropriate hours of home detention).".
Section 5H1.6 is amended by deleting:
"Family ties and responsibilities and community ties are not ordinarily relevant in
determining whether a sentence should be outside the guidelines. Family responsibilities
that are complied with are relevant in determining whether to impose restitution and
fines. Where the guidelines provide probation as an option, these factors may be relevant
in this determination. If a defendant is sentenced to probation or supervised release,
family ties and responsibilities that are met may be relevant in the determination of the
length and conditions of supervision.",
and inserting in lieu thereof:
"Family ties and responsibilities and community ties are not ordinarily relevant in
determining whether a sentence should be outside the applicable guideline range.
Family responsibilities that are complied with may be relevant to the determination of
the amount of restitution or fine.".
Chapter Five, Part H is amended by inserting an additional policy statement as §5H1.11
(Military, Civic, Charitable, or Public Service; Employment-Related Contributions; Record of
Prior Good Works (Policy Statement)).
Reason for Amendment: This amendment expresses the Commission’s intent that the factors
set forth in this part are not ordinarily relevant in determining whether a sentence should be
outside the applicable guideline range; but that, unless expressly stated, these policy statements
do not mean that the Commission views such factors as necessarily inappropriate to the
determination of the sentence within the applicable guideline range. The language within these
sections is revised for clarity and consistency. In addition, this amendment adds language that
expressly states that the guidelines do not apply to defendants sentenced as juvenile
delinquents; and sets forth the Commission’s position that physical appearance, including
physique, military, civic, charitable, or public service, employment-related contributions, and
record of prior good works are not ordinarily relevant in determining whether a sentence should
be outside the applicable guideline range.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1991.
387. Amendment: The Commentary to §6A1.3 is amended by inserting the following additional
paragraph as the third paragraph:
Amendment 387 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003
– 260 –
"The Commission believes that use of a preponderance of the evidence standard is
appropriate to meet due process requirements and policy concerns in resolving disputes
regarding application of the guidelines to the facts of a case.".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment expresses the Commission’s approval of the use
of a preponderance of the evidence standard in resolving disputes regarding application of the
guidelines to the facts of a case.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1991.
388. Amendment: The Commentary to §1B1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note
1 in the first sentence by inserting immediately before the colon:
"and are of general applicability (except to the extent expressly modified in respect to a
particular guideline or policy statement)".
The Commentary to §1B1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 2 by deleting
the first two sentences as follows:
"Definitions or explanations of terms may also appear within the commentary to specific
guidelines. Such commentary is not of general applicability.",
and inserting in lieu thereof:
"Definitions of terms also may appear in other sections. Such definitions are not
designed for general applicability; therefore, their applicability to sections other than
those expressly referenced must be determined on a case by case basis.";
and by beginning a new paragraph with the third sentence.
The Commentary to §1B1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 1(e) by
deleting:
"‘Firearm’ means any weapon which is designed to or may readily be converted to expel
any projectile by the action of an explosive.",
and inserting in lieu thereof:
"‘Firearm’ means (i) any weapon (including a starter gun) which will or is designed to
or may readily be converted to expel a projectile by the action of an explosive; (ii) the
frame or receiver of any such weapon; (iii) any firearm muffler or silencer; or (iv) any
destructive device.";
and by inserting "a" immediately before "‘BB’ or pellet gun".
The Commentary to §1B1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note (1)(f) by
inserting ", other than conduct to which §3C1.1 (Obstructing or Impeding the Administration
of Justice) applies." immediately following "conceal the offense".
November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment 389
– 261 –
The Commentary to §1B1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 1(h) by
inserting the following additional sentence at the end:
"In the case of a kidnapping, for example, maltreatment to a life-threatening degree (e.g.,
by denial of food or medical care) would constitute life-threatening bodily injury.".
The Commentary to §1B1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 1(k) by deleting
"18 U.S.C. § 921(a)(4)" and inserting in lieu thereof "26 U.S.C. § 5845(f)"; and by deleting
"proceeding" and inserting in lieu thereof "preceding".
The Commentary to §1B1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 1 by inserting
the following additional subdivision:
"(l) ‘Offense’ means the offense of conviction and all relevant conduct under §1B1.3
(Relevant Conduct) unless a different meaning is specified or is otherwise clear
from the context.".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment revises the definition of firearm in Note 1(e) to
track more closely the definition of firearm in 18 U.S.C. § 921; clarifies Note 1(f) to prevent
inappropriate "double counting;" clarifies in Note 1(h) that maltreatment to a life-threatening
degree constitutes life-threatening bodily injury; conforms the statutory reference in Note 1(k)
to conform to that used in §2K2.1; and inserts an additional subdivision in Note 1 (subdivision
(l)) that describes how the term "offense" is used in the guidelines. In addition, this amendment
correct clerical errors and makes editorial improvements.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1991.
389. Amendment: The Commentary to §1B1.3 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note
2 in the first sentence by inserting "that were part of the same course of conduct or common
scheme or plan as the offense of conviction" immediately following "‘Such acts and
omissions"; and by inserting ", that were part of the same course of conduct or common scheme
or plan as the offense of conviction" immediately following "otherwise accountable".
The Commentary to §1B1.3 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 2 by inserting
the following additional paragraph at the end:
"As noted above, subsection (a)(2) applies to offenses of a character for which §3D1.2(d)
would require grouping of multiple counts, had the defendant been convicted of multiple
counts. For example, the defendant sells 30 grams of cocaine (a violation of 21 U.S.C.
§ 841) on one occasion and, as part of the same course of conduct or common scheme
or plan, attempts to sell an additional 15 grams of cocaine (a violation of 21 U.S.C. 846)
on another occasion. The defendant is convicted of one count charging the completed
sale of 30 grams of cocaine. The two offenses (sale of cocaine and attempted sale of
cocaine), although covered by different statutory provisions, are of a character for which
§3D1.2(d) would require the grouping of counts, had the defendant been convicted of
both counts. Therefore, subsection (a)(2) applies and the total amount of cocaine (45
grams) involved is used to determine the offense level.".
Amendment 389 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003
– 262 –
The Commentary to §1B1.3 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 4 by inserting
"; Property Damage by Use of Explosives" immediately following "Arson".
The Commentary to §1B1.3 captioned "Application Notes is amended in Note 5 by deleting:
"E.g., in §2K2.2, a base offense level of 16 is used ‘if the defendant is convicted under
18 U.S.C. § 922(o) or 26 U.S.C. § 5861.’",
and inserting in lieu thereof:
"For example, in §2K1.5, subsection (b)(1) applies ‘If the defendant is convicted under
49 U.S.C. § 1472(l)(2).’";
by deleting:
"Examples of this usage are found in §2K1.3(b)(4) (‘If the defendant was a person
prohibited from receiving explosives under 18 U.S.C. § 842(i), or if the defendant
knowingly distributed explosives to a person prohibited from receiving explosives under
18 U.S.C. § 842(i), increase by 10 levels’); and",
and inserting in lieu thereof "An example of this usage is found in"; and by inserting the
following additional paragraph at the end:
"An express direction to apply a particular factor only if the defendant was convicted of
a particular statute includes the determination of the offense level where the defendant
was convicted of conspiracy, attempt, solicitation, aiding or abetting, accessory after the
fact, or misprision of felony in respect to that particular statute. For example,
§2K1.5(b)(1) (which is applicable only if the defendant is convicted under
49 U.S.C. § 1472(l)(2)) would be applied in determining the offense level under §2X3.1
(Accessory After the Fact) where the defendant was convicted of accessory after the fact
to a violation of 49 U.S.C. § 1472(l)(2).".
The Commentary to §1B1.3 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by inserting the
following additional notes:
"6. In the case of a partially completed offense (e.g., an offense involving an
attempted theft of $800,000 and a completed theft of $30,000), the offense level
is to be determined in accordance with §2X1.1 (Attempt, Solicitation, or
Conspiracy) whether the conviction is for the substantive offense, the inchoate
offense (attempt, solicitation, or conspiracy), or both. See Application Note 4 in
the Commentary to §2X1.1. Note, however, that Application Note 4 is not
applicable where the offense level is determined under §2X1.1(c)(1).
7. For the purposes of subsection (a)(2), offense conduct associated with a sentence
that was imposed prior to the acts or omissions constituting the instant federal
offense (the offense of conviction) is not considered as part of the same course
of conduct or common scheme or plan as the offense of conviction.
November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment 390
– 263 –
Examples: (1) The defendant was convicted for the sale of cocaine and sentenced
to state prison. Immediately upon release from prison, he again sold cocaine to
the same person, using the same accomplices and modus operandi. The instant
federal offense (the offense of conviction) charges this latter sale. In this
example, the offense conduct relevant to the state prison sentence is considered
as prior criminal history, not as part of the same course of conduct or common
scheme or plan as the offense of conviction. The prior state prison sentence is
counted under Chapter Four (Criminal History and Criminal Livelihood). (2) The
defendant engaged in two cocaine sales constituting part of the same course of
conduct or common scheme or plan. Subsequently, he is arrested by state
authorities for the first sale and by federal authorities for the second sale. He is
convicted in state court for the first sale and sentenced to imprisonment; he is
then convicted in federal court for the second sale. In this case, the cocaine sales
are not separated by an intervening sentence. Therefore, under subsection (a)(2),
the cocaine sale associated with the state conviction is considered as relevant
conduct to the instant federal offense. The state prison sentence for that sale is
not counted as a prior sentence; see §4A1.2(a)(1).
Note, however, in certain cases, offense conduct associated with a previously
imposed sentence may be expressly charged in the offense of conviction. Unless
otherwise provided, such conduct will be considered relevant conduct under
subsection (a)(1), not (a)(2).".
The Commentary to §1B1.3 captioned "Background" is amended by deleting the last paragraph
as follows:
"This guideline and §1B1.4 clarify the intent underlying §1B1.3 as originally
promulgated.".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment makes editorial improvements in Application
Notes 1 and 2; inserts an additional paragraph in Application Note 2 to clarify that "offenses
of a character for which §3D1.2(d) would require grouping of multiple counts" is not limited
to offenses proscribed by the same statutory provision; conforms a reference in Application
Note 4 to the correct title of the guideline; conforms examples in Application Note 5 to
amended guidelines and clarifies how a direction to apply a particular factor only if the
defendant is convicted of a particular statute applies to the offenses of conspiracy, attempt,
solicitation, aiding or abetting, accessory after the fact, and misprision of felony; inserts an
additional application note (Note 6) that highlights the provision in §2X1.1 dealing with cases
of partially completed conduct; inserts an additional application note (Note 7) that clarifies the
treatment of conduct for which the defendant has previously been sentenced; and deletes a
surplus sentence of Background Commentary more appropriately contained in Appendix C in
the paragraph describing the reason for amendment 3.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1991.
390. Amendment: The Commentary to §1B1.8 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by
inserting the following additional notes:
Amendment 390 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003
– 264 –
"5. This guideline limits the use of certain incriminating information furnished by a
defendant in the context of a defendant-government agreement for the defendant
to provide information concerning the unlawful activities of other persons. The
guideline operates as a limitation on the use of such incriminating information in
determining the applicable guideline range, and not merely as a restriction of the
government’s presentation of such information (e.g., where the defendant,
subsequent to having entered into a cooperation agreement, repeats such
information to the probation officer preparing the presentence report, the use of
such information remains protected by this section).
6. Unless the cooperation agreement relates to the provision of information
concerning the unlawful activities of others, this guideline does not apply (i.e.,
an agreement by the defendant simply to detail the extent of his own unlawful
activities, not involving an agreement to provide information concerning the
unlawful activity of another person, is not covered by this guideline).".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment clarifies the operation of this guideline.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1991.
391. Amendment: The Commentary to §2A2.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by
inserting the following additional note:
"3. If the offense created a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury to more
than one person, an upward departure may be warranted.".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment adds commentary to address the case in which an
attempted murder results in a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury to more than one
person.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1991.
392. Amendment: The Commentary to §2A3.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by
inserting the following additional note:
"3. If the adjustment in subsection (b)(3) applies, do not apply §3B1.3 (Abuse of
Position of Trust or Use of Special Skill).".
Section 2A3.2(b)(1) is amended by deleting "1 level" and inserting in lieu thereof "2 levels".
The Commentary to §2A3.2 captioned "Application Note" is amended by inserting the
following additional note:
"2. If the adjustment in subsection (b)(1) applies, do not apply §3B1.3 (Abuse of
Position of Trust or Use of Special Skill).";
and in the caption by deleting "Note" and inserting in lieu thereof "Notes".
Section 2A3.4(b) is amended by inserting the following additional subdivision:
November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment 393
– 265 –
"(3) If the victim was in the custody, care, or supervisory control of the defendant,
increase by 2 levels.".
The Commentary to §2A3.4 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by inserting the
following additional note:
"3. If the adjustment in subsection (b)(3) applies, do not apply §3B1.3 (Abuse of
Position of Trust or Use of Special Skill).".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment provides for consistency among §§2A3.1, 2A3.2,
and 2A3.4 with respect to an adjustment for a victim in the custody, care, or supervisory control
of the defendant. In addition, the amendment adds an application note clarifying that when this
adjustment applies, an adjustment from §3B1.3 will not apply.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1991.
393. Amendment: The Commentary to §2B1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note
2 by deleting:
"In cases of partially completed conduct, the loss is to be determined in accordance with
the provisions of §2X1.1 (Attempt, Solicitation, or Conspiracy). E.g., in the case of the
theft of a government check or money order, loss refers to the loss level that would have
occurred if the check or money order had been cashed. Similarly, if a defendant is
apprehended in the process of taking a vehicle, the loss refers to the value of the vehicle
even if the vehicle is recovered immediately.",
and inserting in lieu thereof:
"Examples: (1) In the case of a theft of a check or money order, the loss is the loss that
would have occurred if the check or money order had been cashed. (2) In the case of a
defendant apprehended taking a vehicle, the loss is the value of the vehicle even if the
vehicle is recovered immediately.
In the case of a partially completed offense (e.g., an offense involving a completed theft
that is part of a larger, attempted theft), the offense level is to be determined in
accordance with the provisions of §2X1.1 (Attempt, Solicitation, or Conspiracy) whether
the conviction is for the substantive offense, the inchoate offense (attempt, solicitation,
or conspiracy), or both; see Application Note 4 in the Commentary to §2X1.1.".
The Commentary to §2B1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 4 by deleting
"Attempts" and inserting in lieu thereof "Attempt, Solicitation, or Conspiracy"; and by inserting
"and Deceit" immediately following "Fraud".
The Commentary to §2F1.1 is amended by deleting Notes 7 and 8 as follows:
"7. Valuation of loss is discussed in the Commentary to §2B1.1 (Larceny,
Embezzlement, and Other Forms of Theft). In keeping with the Commission’s
policy on attempts, if a probable or intended loss that the defendant was
attempting to inflict can be determined, that figure would be used if it was larger
Amendment 393 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003
– 266 –
than the actual loss. For example, if the fraud consisted of attempting to sell
$40,000 in worthless securities, or representing that a forged check for $40,000
was genuine, the ‘loss’ would be treated as $40,000 for purposes of this
guideline.
8. The amount of loss need not be precise. The court is not expected to identify
each victim and the loss he suffered to arrive at an exact figure. The court need
only make a reasonable estimate of the range of loss, given the available
information. The estimate may be based on the approximate number of victims
and an estimate of the average loss to each victim, or on more general factors,
such as the nature and duration of the fraud and the revenues generated by similar
operations. Estimates based upon aggregate ‘market loss’ (e.g., the aggregate
decline in market value of a stock resulting from disclosure of information that
was wrongfully withheld or misrepresented) are especially appropriate for
securities cases. The offender’s gross gain from committing the fraud is an
alternative estimate that ordinarily will understate the loss.";
by deleting Note 10 as follows:
"10. In a few instances, the total dollar loss that results from the offense may overstate
its seriousness. Such situations typically occur when a misrepresentation is of
limited materiality or is not the sole cause of the loss. Examples would include
understating debts to a limited degree in order to obtain a substantial loan which
the defendant genuinely expected to repay; attempting to negotiate an instrument
that was so obviously fraudulent that no one would seriously consider honoring
it; and making a misrepresentation in a securities offering that enabled the
securities to be sold at inflated prices, but where the value of the securities
subsequently declined in substantial part for other reasons. In such instances, a
downward departure may be warranted.";
by renumbering Note 9 as Note 10; by inserting the following as Notes 7, 8 and 9:
"7. Valuation of loss is discussed in the Commentary to §2B1.1 (Larceny,
Embezzlement, and Other Forms of Theft). Consistent with the provisions of
§2X1.1 (Attempt, Solicitation or Conspiracy), if an intended loss that the
defendant was attempting to inflict can be determined, this figure will be used if
it is greater than the actual loss. Frequently, loss in a fraud case will be the same
as in a theft case. For example, if the fraud consisted of selling or attempting to
sell $40,000 in worthless securities, or representing that a forged check for
$40,000 was genuine, the loss would be $40,000.
There are, however, instances where additional factors are to be considered in
determining the loss or intended loss:
(a) Fraud Involving Misrepresentation of the Value of an Item or Product
Substitution
A fraud may involve the misrepresentation of the value of an item that
does have some value (in contrast to an item that is worthless). Where,
for example, a defendant fraudulently represents that stock is worth
November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment 393
– 267 –
$40,000 and the stock is worth only $10,000, the loss is the amount by
which the stock was overvalued (i.e., $30,000). In a case involving a
misrepresentation concerning the quality of a consumer product, the loss
is the difference between the amount paid by the victim for the product
and the amount for which the victim could resell the product received.
(b) Fraudulent Loan Application and Contract Procurement Cases
In fraudulent loan application cases and contract procurement cases where
the defendant’s capabilities are fraudulently represented, the loss is the
actual loss to the victim (or if the loss has not yet come about, the
expected loss). For example, if a defendant fraudulently obtains a loan
by misrepresenting the value of his assets, the loss is the amount of the
loan not repaid at the time the offense is discovered, reduced by the
amount the lending institution has recovered, or can expect to recover,
from any assets pledged to secure the loan.
In some cases, the loss determined above may significantly understate or
overstate the seriousness of the defendant’s conduct. For example, where
the defendant substantially understated his debts to obtain a loan, which
he nevertheless repaid, the loss determined above (zero loss) will tend not
to reflect adequately the risk of loss created by the defendant’s conduct.
Conversely, a defendant may understate his debts to a limited degree to
obtain a loan (e.g., to expand a grain export business), which he genuinely
expected to repay and for which he would have qualified at a higher
interest rate had he made truthful disclosure, but he is unable to repay the
loan because of some unforeseen event (e.g., an embargo imposed on
grain exports) which would have caused a default in any event. In such
a case, the loss determined above may overstate the seriousness of the
defendant’s conduct.
(c) Consequential Damages in Procurement Fraud and Product Substitution
Cases
In contrast to other types of cases, loss in a procurement fraud or product
substitution case includes not only direct damages, but also consequential
damages that were reasonably foreseeable. For example, in a case
involving a defense product substitution offense, the loss includes the
government’s reasonably foreseeable costs of making substitute
transactions and handling or disposing of the product delivered or
retrofitting the product so that it can be used for its intended purpose, plus
the government’s reasonably foreseeable cost of rectifying the actual or
potential disruption to government operations caused by the product
substitution. Similarly, in the case of fraud affecting a defense contract
award, loss includes the reasonably foreseeable administrative cost to the
government and other participants of repeating or correcting the
procurement action affected, plus any increased cost to procure the
product or service involved that was reasonably foreseeable. Inclusion of
reasonably foreseeable consequential damages directly in the calculation
Amendment 393 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003
– 268 –
of loss in procurement fraud and product substitution cases reflects that
such damages frequently are substantial in such cases.
(d) Diversion of Government Program Benefits
In a case involving diversion of government program benefits, loss is the
value of the benefits diverted from intended recipients or uses.
(e) Davis-Bacon Act Cases
In a case involving a Davis-Bacon Act violation (a violation of 40 U.S.C.
§ 276a, criminally prosecuted under 18 U.S.C. § 1001), the loss is the
difference between the legally required and actual wages paid.
8. For the purposes of subsection (b)(1), the loss need not be determined with
precision. The court need only make a reasonable estimate of the loss, given the
available information. This estimate, for example, may be based on the
approximate number of victims and an estimate of the average loss to each
victim, or on more general factors, such as the nature and duration of the fraud
and the revenues generated by similar operations. The offender’s gain from
committing the fraud is an alternative estimate that ordinarily will underestimate
the loss.
9. In the case of a partially completed offense (e.g., an offense involving a
completed fraud that is part of a larger, attempted fraud), the offense level is to
be determined in accordance with the provisions of §2X1.1 (Attempt,
Solicitation, or Conspiracy) whether the conviction is for the substantive offense,
the inchoate offense (attempt, solicitation, or conspiracy), or both; see
Application Note 4 in the Commentary to §2X1.1.";
and in the renumbered Note 10 (formerly Note 9) by deleting:
"Dollar loss often does not fully capture the harmfulness and seriousness of the conduct.
In such instances, an upward departure may be warranted.",
and inserting in lieu thereof:
"In cases in which the loss determined under subsection (b)(1) does not fully capture the
harmfulness and seriousness of the conduct, an upward departure may be warranted.";
by deleting subdivision (f) as follows:
"(f) completion of the offense was prevented, or the offense was interrupted before
it caused serious harm.";
by deleting the semicolon at the end of subdivision (e) and inserting in lieu thereof a period; and
by inserting the following additional paragraph at the end:
November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment 395
– 269 –
"In a few instances, the loss determined under subsection (b)(1) may overstate the
seriousness of the offense. This may occur, for example, where a defendant attempted
to negotiate an instrument that was so obviously fraudulent that no one would seriously
consider honoring it.".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment provides a more precise reference in the
commentary of these guidelines to the discussion in §2X1.1 that applies in the case of a
partially completed offense. In addition, the amendment reorders the material in these notes,
and divides them into separate paragraphs for greater clarity. The amendment also conforms
the wording of Application Note 7 of the Commentary to §2F1.1 to Application Note 2 of the
Commentary to §2B1.1 to make clear that the treatment of attempts in cases of fraud and theft
is identical. Finally, this amendment provides additional guidance with respect to the
determination of loss, and makes editorial improvements.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1991.
394. Amendment: Section 2D1.1(b)(1) is amended by deleting "during commission of the offense"
immediately after "possessed".
The Commentary to §2D1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 3 by deleting
". The adjustment is to be applied even if several counts are involved and the weapon was
present in any of them." and inserting in lieu thereof ", 2D1.6, 2D1.7(b)(1).".
Section 2D1.8(b)(1) is amended by deleting "during commission of the offense" immediately
after "possessed".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment clarifies that the provisions of §1B1.3(a)(2) apply
to the adjustments in §§2D1.1(b)(1) and 2D1.8(b)(1), and updates the list of referenced offense
guidelines in Application Note 3 of the Commentary to §2D1.1.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1991.
395. Amendment: Section 2D1.1(c) is amended in the Drug Quantity Table by deleting "Pure PCP"
wherever it appears and inserting in lieu thereof "PCP (actual)"; and by deleting "Pure
Methamphetamine" wherever it appears and inserting in lieu thereof "Methamphetamine
(actual)".
Section 2D1.1(c) is amended in the note designated by a single asterisk by inserting the
following additional sentences as the third and fourth sentences of the first paragraph:
"The terms ‘PCP (actual)’ and ‘Methamphetamine (actual)’ refer to the weight of the
controlled substance, itself, contained in the mixture or substance. For example, a

Amendment 395 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003
– 270 –
Section 2D1.1(c) is amended by deleting "Schedule I or II Depressants" wherever it appears and
inserting in lieu thereof "Secobarbital (or the equivalent amount of other Schedule I or II
Depressants)".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment clarifies the operation of the guideline in cases
involving methamphetamine or PCP by replacing the terms "Pure PCP" and "pure
methamphetamine" with "PCP (actual)" and "methamphetamine (actual)," and by providing an
example of their application. This amendment also clarifies the interaction of the guideline and
drug equivalency tables with respect to Schedule I and II Depressants by using Secobarbital as
the referenced substance.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1991.
396. Amendment: The Commentary to §2D1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note
10 in the first paragraph by deleting "grams of a substance containing heroin" and inserting in
lieu thereof "kilograms of marihuana"; in the second paragraph by deleting:
"If all the drugs are ‘equivalents’ of the same drug, e.g., stimulants that are grouped with
cocaine, convert them to that drug. In other cases, convert each of the drugs to either the
heroin or marihuana equivalents, add the quantities, and look up the total in the Drug
Quantity Table to obtain the combined offense level. Use the marihuana equivalents
when the only substances involved are ‘Schedule I Marihuana,’ ‘Schedule III
Substances,’ ‘Schedule IV Substances,’ ‘Schedule V Substances’ or ‘Schedule I or II
Depressants.’ Otherwise, use the heroin equivalents.",
and inserting in lieu thereof:
"In each case, convert each of the drugs to its marihuana equivalent, add the quantities,
and look up the total in the Drug Quantity Table to obtain the combined offense level.";
in the first example by deleting:
"a. The defendant is convicted of selling seventy grams of a substance containing
PCP (Level 22) and 250 milligrams of a substance containing LSD (Level 18).
Both PCP and LSD are grouped together in the Drug Equivalency Tables under
the heading ‘LSD, PCP, and Other Schedule I and II Hallucinogens,’ which
provide PCP equivalencies. The 250 milligrams of LSD is equivalent to twenty-
five grams of PCP. The total is therefore ninety-five grams of PCP, for which the
Drug Quantity Table provides an offense level of 24.",
and inserting in lieu thereof:
"a. The defendant is convicted of selling 70 grams of a substance containing PCP
(Level 22) and 250 milligrams of a substance containing LSD (Level 18). The
PCP converts to 70 kilograms of marihuana; the LSD converts to 25 kilograms
of marihuana. The total is therefore equivalent to 95 kilograms of marihuana, for
which the Drug Quantity Table provides an offense level of 24.";
November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment 396
– 271 –
and in the third example by deleting:
"c. The defendant is convicted of selling eighty grams of cocaine (Level 16) and five
kilograms of marihuana (Level 14). The cocaine is equivalent to sixteen grams
of heroin; the marihuana, to five grams of heroin. The total equivalent is twenty-
one grams of heroin, which has an offense level of 18 in the Drug Quantity
Table.",
and inserting in lieu thereof:
"c. The defendant is convicted of selling 80 grams of cocaine (Level 16) and five
kilograms of marihuana (Level 14). The cocaine is equivalent to 16 kilograms
of marihuana. The total is therefore equivalent to 21 kilograms of marihuana,
which has an offense level of 18 in the Drug Quantity Table.".
The Commentary to §2D1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 10 by inserting
the following additional paragraph as the third paragraph:
"For certain types of controlled substances, the marihuana equivalencies in the Drug
Equivalency Tables are ‘capped’ at specified amounts (e.g., the combined equivalent
weight of all Schedule V controlled substances shall not exceed 999 grams of
marihuana). Where there are controlled substances from more than one schedule (e.g.,
a quantity of a Schedule IV substance and a quantity of a Schedule V substance),
determine the marihuana equivalency for each schedule separately (subject to the cap,
if any, applicable to that schedule). Then add the marihuana equivalencies to determine
the combined marihuana equivalency (subject to the cap, if any, applicable to the
combined amounts).".
The Commentary to §2D1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 10 by inserting
the following additional example immediately after example (c):
"d. The defendant is convicted of selling 28 kilograms of a Schedule III substance,
50 kilograms of a Schedule IV substance, and 100 kilograms of a Schedule V
substance. The marihuana equivalency for the Schedule III substance is
56 kilograms of marihuana (below the cap of 59.99 kilograms of marihuana set
forth as the maximum equivalent weight for Schedule III substances). The
marihuana equivalency for the Schedule IV substance is subject to a cap of 4.99
kilograms of marihuana set forth as the maximum equivalent weight for Schedule
IV substances (without the cap it would have been 6.25 kilograms). The
marihuana equivalency for the Schedule V substance is subject to the cap of 999
grams of marihuana set forth as the maximum equivalent weight for Schedule V
substances (without the cap it would have been 1.25 kilograms). The combined
equivalent weight, determined by adding together the above amounts, is subject
to the cap of 59.99 kilograms of marihuana set forth as the maximum combined
equivalent weight for Schedule III, IV, and V substances. Without the cap, the
combined equivalent weight would have been 61.99 (56 + 4.99 + .999)
kilograms.".

The Commentary to §2D1.1 captioned "Background" is amended by inserting the following
additional paragraph as the fourth paragraph:
" In cases involving fifty or more marihuana plants, an equivalency of one plant to
one kilogram of marihuana is derived from the statutory penalty provisions of 21 U.S.C.
§ 841(b)(1)(A), (B), and (D). In cases involving fewer than fifty plants, the statute is
silent as to the equivalency. For cases involving fewer than fifty plants, the Commission
has adopted an equivalency of 100 grams per plant, or the actual weight of the usable
marihuana, whichever is greater. The decision to treat each plant as equal to 100 grams
is premised on the fact that the average yield from a mature marihuana plant equals 100
grams of marihuana. In controlled substance offenses, an attempt is assigned the same
offense level as the object of the attempt (see §2D1.4). Consequently, the Commission
adopted the policy that, in the case of fewer than fifty marihuana plants, each plant is to
be treated as the equivalent of an attempt to produce 100 grams of marihuana, except
where the actual weight of the usable marihuana is greater.".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment substitutes a single conversion for Schedule III
substances (1 gm of a Schedule III substance = 2 gms of marihuana) that will simplify
application of the guidelines as well as address currently unlisted Schedule III substances.
Because the equivalencies for Schedule III substances are not statutorily based, nor are the
pharmacological equivalencies as clear as with Schedule I or II Substances, a generic listing
was deemed appropriate. For the same reasons, the amendment provides a single conversion
Amendment 396 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003
– 276 –
for Schedule IV substances (1 gm of a Schedule IV substance = 0.125 gm of marihuana) and
Schedule V substances (1 gm of a Schedule V substance = 0.0125 gm of marihuana). The
amendment also adds a conversion for anabolic steroids consistent with their treatment in the
Drug Quantity Table. In addition, the amendment adds footnotes to the Drug Equivalency
Tables for Schedule I or II depressants and Schedule III, IV, and V substances to remove an
ambiguity in guideline application by expressly limiting the combined equivalent weight of
such substances to the marihuana amount consistent with the highest offense level for such
substances provided in the Drug Quantity Table. See United States v. Gurgliolo, 894 F.2d 56
(3d Cir. 1990). The amendment inserts an additional listing under "Secobarbital and Other
Schedule I and II Depressants" to reflect that glutethimide has been changed from a Schedule
III to a Schedule II controlled substance under 21 C.F.R. §1308.12. In addition, the amendment
simplifies the application of the Drug Equivalency Table by referencing the conversions to one
substance (marihuana) rather than to four substances; the use of one referent rather than four
makes no substantive change but will make the required computations easier and reduce the
likelihood of computational error. Finally, the amendment sets forth the rationale for the
Commission’s treatment of fewer than fifty marihuana plants.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1991.
397. Amendment: Section 2D1.7 is amended in the title by deleting "Interstate Sale and
Transporting" and inserting in lieu thereof "Sale or Transportation".
Section 2D1.7 is amended by inserting the following additional subsection:
"(b) Cross Reference
(1) If the offense involved a controlled substance, apply §2D1.1 (Unlawful
Manufacturing, Importing, Exporting, or Trafficking) or §2D2.1
(Unlawful Possession), as appropriate, if the resulting offense level is
greater than that determined above.".
The Commentary to §2D1.7 captioned "Statutory Provision" is amended by deleting "21 U.S.C.
§ 857" and inserting in lieu thereof "21 U.S.C. § 863 (formerly 21 U.S.C. § 857)".
The Commentary to §2D1.7 is amended by inserting the following at the end:
"Application Note:
1. The typical case addressed by this guideline involves small-scale trafficking in
drug paraphernalia (generally from a retail establishment that also sells items that
are not unlawful). In a case involving a large-scale dealer, distributor, or
manufacturer, an upward departure may be warranted. Conversely, where the
offense was not committed for pecuniary gain (e.g., transportation for the
defendant’s personal use), a downward departure may be warranted.".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment revises the title of the guideline to address the
expanded coverage of the underlying statute, as amended by Section 2401 of the Crime Control
Act of 1990 (Public Law 101-647), adds a cross reference to address cases in which the
November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment 400

person who exercises any discretionary authority or control in respect to the
management of such plan or exercises authority or control in respect to
management or disposition of its assets, or who renders investment advice for a
fee or other direct or indirect compensation with respect to any moneys or other

"(2) If the offense involved criminal sexual abuse, attempted criminal sexual abuse,
or assault with intent to commit criminal sexual abuse, apply §2A3.1 (Criminal
Sexual Abuse; Attempt or Assault with the Intent to Commit Criminal Sexual
Abuse).
(3) If neither subsection (c)(1) nor (c)(2) is applicable, and the offense did not
involve transportation for the purpose of prostitution, apply §2A3.2 (Criminal
Sexual Abuse of a Minor or Attempt to Commit Such Acts) or §2A3.4 (Abusive
Sexual Contact or Attempt to Commit Abusive Sexual Contact), as appropriate.".
Section 2G1.2(c)(1) (formerly §2G1.2(d)(1)) is amended by deleting "the defendant"
immediately before "causing".
The Commentary to §2G1.2 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by renumbering Note
5 as Note 7, and by inserting the following additional notes:
"5. Subsection (b)(4) is intended to have broad application and includes offenses
involving a minor entrusted to the defendant, whether temporarily or
permanently. For example, teachers, day care providers, baby-sitters, or other
temporary caretakers are among those who would be subject to this enhancement.
In determining whether to apply this adjustment, the court should look to the
actual relationship that existed between the defendant and the child and not
simply to the legal status of the defendant-child relationship.
6. If the adjustment in subsection (b)(4) applies, do not apply §3B1.3 (Abuse of
Position of Trust or Use of Special Skill).".
The commentary to §2G1.2 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 1 by deleting
"(c)(1)" and inserting in lieu thereof "(d)(1)"; and in Note 7 (formerly Note 5) by deleting
"(d)(1)" and inserting in lieu thereof "subsection (c)(1)".
The Commentary to §2G2.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 2 by deleting
"Specific offense characteristic" and inserting in lieu thereof "Subsection".
The Commentary to §2G2.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by deleting:
"3. If specific offense characteristic (b)(2) applies, no adjustment is to be made under
§3B1.3 (Abuse of Position of Trust or Use of Special Skill).",
and inserting in lieu thereof:
"3. If the adjustment in subsection (b)(2) applies, do not apply §3B1.3 (Abuse of
Position of Trust or Use of Special Skill).".
November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment 401
– 279 –
Reason for Amendment: This amendment adds a specific offense characteristic and
commentary to provide consistent treatment for similar conduct among the guidelines in this
part, conforms the language used in §2G1.2(c)(1) (formerly §2G1.2(d)(1)) with the language
used elsewhere in the guidelines, and makes editorial changes to improve clarity. In addition,
as statutes referenced to §2G1.2 may be used as "jurisdictional" statutes in some cases to
prosecute conduct that is more appropriately covered under other guidelines (§§2A3.1, 2A3.2,
and 2A3.4), this amendment inserts cross references as §2G1.2(c)(2) and (3) to provide
consistent offense levels in such cases.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1991.
401. Amendment: The Commentary to §2J1.2 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note
1 by deleting:
", an indictment or verdict based upon perjury, false testimony, or other false evidence,"
and inserting in lieu thereof:
"; an indictment, verdict, or any judicial determination based upon perjury, false
testimony, or other false evidence;".
The Commentary to §2J1.2 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by inserting the
following additional note:
"5. The inclusion of ‘property damage’ under subsection (b)(1) is designed to address
cases in which property damage is caused or threatened as a means of
intimidation or retaliation (e.g., to intimidate a witness from, or retaliate against
a witness for, testifying). Subsection (b)(1) is not intended to apply, for example,
where the offense consisted of destroying a ledger containing an incriminating
entry.".
The Commentary to §2J1.2 captioned "Background" is amended in the second paragraph by
deleting:
"assist another person to escape punishment for a crime he has committed, an alternative
reference to the guideline for accessory after the fact is made",
and inserting in lieu thereof:
"avoid punishment for an offense that the defendant has committed or to assist another
person to escape punishment for an offense, a cross reference to §2X3.1 (Accessory After
the Fact) is provided. Use of this cross reference will provide an enhanced offense level
when the obstruction is in respect to a particularly serious offense, whether such offense
was committed by the defendant or another person".
The Commentary to §2J1.3 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 1 by deleting:
", an indictment or verdict based upon perjury, false testimony, or other false evidence,"
Amendment 401 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003
– 280 –
and inserting in lieu thereof:
"; an indictment, verdict, or any judicial determination based upon perjury, false
testimony, or other false evidence;".
The Commentary to §2J1.5 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 1 by deleting:
", an indictment or verdict based upon perjury, false testimony, or other false evidence,"
and inserting in lieu thereof:
"; an indictment, verdict, or any judicial determination based upon perjury, false
testimony, or other false evidence;".
The Commentary to §2J1.8 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 1 by deleting:
", an indictment or verdict based upon perjury, false testimony, or other false evidence,"
and inserting in lieu thereof:
"; an indictment, verdict, or any judicial determination based upon perjury, false
testimony, or other false evidence;".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment clarifies the types of circumstances to which
§§2J1.2(b)(1) and 2J1.2(c)(1) apply. This amendment also clarifies the scope of the
enhancement for "substantial interference with the administration of justice" in §§2J1.2, 2J1.3,
2J1.5, and 2J1.8.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1991.
402. Amendment: Section 2J1.3 is amended by inserting the following additional subsection:
"(d) Special Instruction
(1) In the case of counts of perjury or subornation of perjury arising from
testimony given, or to be given, in separate proceedings, do not group the
counts together under §3D1.2 (Groups of Closely-Related Counts).".
The Commentary to §2J1.3 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by inserting the
following additional note:
"5. ‘Separate proceedings,’ as used in subsection (d)(1), includes different
proceedings in the same case or matter (e.g., a grand jury proceeding and a trial,
or a trial and retrial), and proceedings in separate cases or matters (e.g., separate
trials of codefendants), but does not include multiple grand jury proceedings in
the same case.".
November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment 403
– 281 –
Reason for Amendment: This amendment provides a special instruction addressing the
appropriate treatment of multiple instances of perjury under Chapter Three, Part D (Multiple
Counts).
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1991.
403. Amendment: The Commentary to §2J1.6 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by
deleting:
"2. By statute, a term of imprisonment imposed for this offense runs consecutively
to any other term of imprisonment imposed. 18 U.S.C. § 3146(b)(1).";
by renumbering Note 3 as Note 2; and by inserting the following additional notes:
"3. In the case of a failure to appear for service of sentence, any term of
imprisonment imposed on the failure to appear count is to be imposed
consecutively to any term of imprisonment imposed for the underlying offense.
See §5G1.3(a). The guideline range for the failure to appear count is to be
determined independently and the grouping rules of §§ 3D1.2-3D1.5 do not
apply.
Otherwise, in the case of a conviction on both the underlying offense and the
failure to appear, the failure to appear is treated under §3C1.1 (Obstructing or
Impeding the Administration of Justice) as an obstruction of the underlying
offense; and the failure to appear count and the count(s) for the underlying
offense are grouped together under §3D1.2(c). Note that although 18 U.S.C. §
3146(b)(2) does not require a sentence of imprisonment on a failure to appear
count, it does require that any sentence of imprisonment on a failure to appear
count be imposed consecutively to any other sentence of imprisonment.
Therefore, in such cases, the combined sentence must be constructed to provide
a ‘total punishment’ that satisfies the requirements both of §5G1.2 (Sentencing
on Multiple Counts of Conviction) and 18 U.S.C. § 3146(b)(2). For example,
where the combined applicable guideline range for both counts is 30-37 months
and the court determines a ‘total punishment’ of 36 months is appropriate, a
sentence of thirty months for the underlying offense plus a consecutive six
months sentence for the failure to appear count would satisfy these requirements.
4. In some cases, the defendant may be sentenced on the underlying offense (the
offense in respect to which the defendant failed to appear) before being sentenced
on the failure to appear offense. In such cases, criminal history points for the
sentence imposed on the underlying offense are to be counted in determining the
guideline range on the failure to appear offense only where the offense level is
determined under subsection (a)(1) (i.e., where the offense constituted a failure
to report for service of sentence).".
Amendment 403 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003
– 282 –
Reason for Amendment: This amendment inserts an application note (Note 3) to clarify the
interaction of §§2J1.6, 3C1.1, 5G1.2, and 5G1.3; and inserts an application note (Note 4) to
clarify the interaction of §§2J1.6 and 4A1.1.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1991.
404. Amendment: Section 2K1.1 is amended in the title by deleting "Explosives" and inserting in
lieu thereof "Explosive Materials".
Section 2K1.2 is amended in the title by deleting "Explosives" and inserting in lieu thereof
"Explosive Materials".
The Commentary to §2K1.4 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by inserting the
following additional note:
"3. ‘Explosives,’ as used in the title of this guideline, includes any explosive,
explosive material, or destructive device.".
Section 2K1.5(c)(1) is amended by inserting "or possessed" immediately following "used"; and
by inserting ", as appropriate," immediately before "if the".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment revises the titles of §2K1.1 and §2K1.2, and the
Commentary to §2K1.4 to clarify that the term explosives, as used in those guidelines, includes
explosives materials. In addition, this amendment clarifies the application of the cross reference
in §2K1.5(c)(1).
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1991.
405. Amendment: The Commentary to §2K2.4 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note
2 by deleting "§2B3.1(b)(2)" and inserting in lieu thereof "§2B3.1(b)(2)(A)-(F)"; and by
inserting the following additional paragraphs at the end:
"Provided, that where the maximum of the guideline range from Chapter Five, Part A
(Sentencing Table) determined by an offense level adjusted under the procedure
described in the preceding paragraph, plus the term of imprisonment required under
18 U.S.C. § 924(c) or § 929(a), is less than the maximum of the guideline range that
would apply to the underlying offense absent such adjustment, the procedure described
in the preceding paragraph does not apply. Instead, the guideline range applicable to the
underlying offense absent such adjustment is to be used after subtracting the term of
imprisonment imposed under 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) or § 929(a) from both the minimum and
maximum of such range.
Example: A defendant, is to be sentenced under the robbery guideline; his unadjusted
offense level from §2B3.1 is 30, including a 7-level enhancement for discharging a
firearm; no Chapter Three adjustments are applicable; and his criminal history category
is Category IV. His unadjusted guideline range from Chapter Five, Part A (Sentencing
Table) is 135-168 months. This defendant has also been convicted under 18 U.S.C. §
924(c) arising from the possession of a weapon during the robbery, and therefore must
be sentenced to an additional consecutive five-year term of imprisonment. The
November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment 408
– 283 –
defendant’s adjusted guideline range, which takes into account the conviction under 18
U.S.C. § 924(c) by eliminating the 7-level weapon enhancement, is 70-87 months.
Because the maximum of the defendant’s adjusted guideline range plus the five year
consecutive sentence (87 months + 60 months = 147 months) is less than the maximum
of the defendant’s unadjusted guideline range (168 months), the defendant is to be
sentenced using the unadjusted guideline range after subtracting the 60 month sentence
to be imposed under 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) from both the minimum and maximum of the
unadjusted range (e.g., 135 months - 60 months = 75 months; 168 months - 60 months
= 108 months). A sentence imposed for the underlying offense using the guideline range
determined in this manner (75-108 months) when combined with the consecutive
sentence imposed under 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) or § 929(a), will produce the appropriate
total term of imprisonment.".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment provides an additional instruction for the
determination of the offense level in cases in which the defendant is convicted under
18 U.S.C. § 924(c) or §929(a) in addition to a count for the offense in respect to which the
firearm was used or possessed. The amendment is designed to prevent the anomalous result of
the total punishment being less when there are convictions on both such counts than if the
defendant was convicted only of the offense in respect to which the weapon was used or
possessed.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1991.
406. Amendment: The Commentary to §2P1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by
inserting the following additional note:
"6. If the adjustment in subsection (b)(1) applies as a result of conduct that involves
an official victim, do not apply §3A1.2 (Official Victim).".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment addresses the issue raised in United States v.
Dugan, 912 F.2d 942 (8th Cir. 1990) concerning the interaction between §2P1.1(b)(1) and
§3A1.2 by expressly providing that where an enhancement from subsection (b)(1) applies,
§3A1.2 does not apply.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1991.
407. Amendment: Section 2Q2.1(b)(3)(A) is amended by deleting "specially protected"
immediately before "fish".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment removes language inadvertently retained when this
guideline was consolidated with the former §2Q2.2.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1991.
408. Amendment: The Commentary to §2T1.2 captioned "Background" is amended in the third
paragraph by deleting:
"difficulty of computing the tax loss, which may become the subject of protracted civil
litigation. It is expected that the measure used will generally understate the tax due, and
Amendment 408 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003
– 284 –
will not call for a sentence approaching the maximum unless very large incomes are
involved. Thus, the burden will remain on the prosecution to provide a more accurate
estimate of the tax loss if it seeks enhanced punishment",
and inserting in lieu thereof:
"potential difficulty of determining the amount of tax the taxpayer owed. It is expected
that this alternative measure generally will understate the amount of tax owed".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment clarifies the meaning of the commentary and
deletes surplus material.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1991.
409. Amendment: Section 2T1.6 is amended by inserting the following additional subsection:
"(b) Cross Reference
(1) Where the offense involved embezzlement by withholding tax from an
employee’s earnings and willfully failing to account to the employee for
it, apply §2B1.1 (Larceny, Embezzlement, and Other Forms of Theft) if
the resulting offense level is greater than that determined above.".
The Commentary to §2T1.6 captioned "Application Note" is amended in Note 1 by deleting "In
such instances, an upward departure may be warranted" and inserting in lieu thereof
"Subsection (b)(1) addresses such cases".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment replaces the recommendation in the commentary
of this guideline concerning consideration of an upward departure where the court finds that
the offense involved embezzlement of an employee’s funds with a cross reference that provides
for the application of §2B1.1 (Larceny, Embezzlement, and Other Forms of Theft) in such cases
where that guideline results in the greater offense level.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1991.
410. Amendment: Section 2T3.1(a) is amended by deleting "Level from §2T4.1 (Tax Table)
corresponding to the tax loss." and inserting in lieu thereof:
"(1) The level from §2T4.1 (Tax Table) corresponding to the tax loss, if the tax loss
exceeded $1,000; or
(2) 5, if the tax loss exceeded $100 but did not exceed $1,000; or
(3) 4, if the tax loss did not exceed $100.".
Section 2T3.1 is amended by inserting the following additional subsection:
"(b) Specific Offense Characteristic
November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment 411
– 285 –
(1) If sophisticated means were used to impede discovery of the nature or
existence of the offense, increase by 2 levels.".
Section 2T3.2(a) is amended by deleting "Level from §2T4.1 (Tax Table) corresponding to the
tax loss." and inserting in lieu thereof:
"(1) The level from §2T4.1 (Tax Table) corresponding to the tax loss, if the tax loss
exceeded $1,000; or
(2) 5, if the tax loss exceeded $100 but did not exceed $1,000; or
(3) 4, if the tax loss did not exceed $100.".
Section 2T3.2 is amended by inserting the following additional subsection:
"(b) Specific Offense Characteristic
(1) If sophisticated means were used to impede discovery of the nature or
existence of the offense, increase by 2 levels.".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment lowers the offense level for the least serious
offenses (evasion of import duty of $1,000 or less without use of sophisticated means) to
provide an offense level equal to the offense level for theft of the same amount without more
than minimal planning. In addition, it adds an adjustment for "sophisticated means" to conform
with other tax evasion guidelines (e.g., §2T1.1).
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1991.
411. Amendment: Section 2X1.1(a) and (b)(3) are amended by deleting "object" wherever it
appears and inserting in lieu thereof in each instance "substantive".
Section 2X1.1(b)(1) is amended by inserting "substantive" immediately before "offense".
Section 2X1.1(b)(2) is amended by inserting "substantive" immediately before "offense".
Section 2X1.1(b)(3) is amended by deleting "the offense" the first two times it appears and
inserting in lieu thereof in each instance "the substantive offense".
The Commentary to §2X1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 2 by deleting:
"Under §2X1.1(a) the base offense level will be the same as that for the object offense
which the defendant solicited, or conspired or attempted to commit.",
and inserting in lieu thereof:
"‘Substantive offense,’ as used in this guideline, means the offense that the defendant
was convicted of soliciting, attempting, or conspiring to commit. Under §2X1.1(a), the
base offense level will be the same as that for the substantive offense.".
Amendment 411 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003
– 286 –
The Commentary to §2X1.1 is amended by deleting "object" wherever it appears and inserting
in lieu thereof "substantive".
The Commentary to §2X1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 4 in the second
paragraph by deleting "or (2)" and inserting in lieu thereof ", (b)(2), or (b)(3)(A)".
The Commentary to §2X1.1 captioned "Background" is amended by deleting "necessary acts
of" and inserting in lieu thereof "acts necessary for".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment replaces the term "object offense" with the more
commonly used term "substantive offense," and makes clarifying and editorial changes.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1991.
412. Amendment: Section 2X5.1 is amended by inserting, immediately before the period at the end
of the second sentence, the following:
", except that any guidelines and policy statements that can be applied meaningfully in
the absence of a Chapter Two offense guideline shall remain applicable".
The Commentary to §2X5.1 is amended by inserting, immediately after "Commentary", the
following:
"Application Note:
1. Guidelines and policy statements that can be applied meaningfully in the absence
of a Chapter Two offense guideline include: §5B1.3 (Conditions of Probation);
§5B1.4 (Recommended Conditions of Probation and Supervised Release);
§5D1.1 (Imposition of a Term of Supervised Release); §5D1.2 (Term of
Supervised Release); §5D1.3 (Conditions of Supervised Release); §5E1.1
(Restitution); §5E1.3 (Special Assessments); §5E1.4 (Forfeiture); Chapter Five,
Part F (Sentencing Options); §5G1.3 (Imposition of a Sentence on a Defendant
Subject to an Undischarged Term of Imprisonment); Chapter Five, Part H
(Specific Offender Characteristics); Chapter Five, Part J (Relief from Disability);
Chapter Five, Part K (Departures); Chapter Six, Part A (Sentencing Procedures);
Chapter Six, Part B (Plea Agreements).".
The Commentary to §2X5.1 captioned "Background" is amended by inserting the following
additional paragraph:
" The sentencing guidelines apply to convictions under 18 U.S.C. § 13
(Assimilative Crimes Act) and 18 U.S.C. § 1153 (Indian Major Crimes Act); see
18 U.S.C. § 3551(a), as amended by section 1602 of Public Law 101-647.".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment inserts an application note to clarify that, in the
case of an offense for which there is no sufficiently analogous offense guideline, any guidelines
and policy statements that can be meaningfully applied in the absence of a Chapter Two offense
guideline remain applicable. This amendment also clarifies the applicability of the sentencing
guidelines to convictions under 18 U.S.C. §§ 13 (Assimilative Crimes Act) and 1153 (Indian
November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment 416
– 287 –
Major Crimes Act). Section 1602 of the Crime Control Act of 1990 (Public Law 101-647)
resolved this issue by amending 18 U.S.C. § 3551(a) to provide expressly that Chapter 227 of
Title 18, United States Code (including the sentencing guidelines) applies to convictions under
these statutes.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1991.
413. Amendment: The Commentary to §3A1.3 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by
deleting:
"2. This adjustment applies to any offense in which a victim was physically
restrained in the course of the offense, except where such restraint is an element
of the offense, specifically incorporated into the base offense level, or listed as
a specific offense characteristic.",
and inserting in lieu thereof:
"2. Do not apply this adjustment where the offense guideline specifically
incorporates this factor, or where the unlawful restraint of a victim is an element
of the offense itself (e.g., this adjustment does not apply to offenses covered by
§2A4.1 (Kidnapping, Abduction, Unlawful Restraint)).".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment clarifies the application of this guideline.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1991.
414. Amendment: The Commentary to §3B1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note
1 by inserting the following additional sentence at the end:
"A person who is not criminally responsible for the commission of the offense (e.g., an
undercover law enforcement officer) is not a participant.".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment clarifies the operation of this guideline in accord
with the holding in United States v. Carroll, 893 F.2d 1502 (6th Cir. 1990).
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1991.
415. Amendment: The Commentary to §3C1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note
1 in the last sentence by deleting ", the defendant’s testimony and" and inserting in lieu thereof
"in respect to alleged false testimony or statements by the defendant, such testimony or".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment more precisely states the meaning of this
commentary.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1991.
416. Amendment: The Commentary to §3C1.2 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by
redesignating note 3 as note 4; and by inserting the following additional note:
Amendment 416 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003
– 288 –
"3. ‘During flight’ is to be construed broadly and includes preparation for flight.
Therefore, this adjustment also is applicable where the conduct occurs in the
course of resisting arrest.".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment clarifies that reckless endangerment in the course
of resisting arrest that does not receive a 3-level enhancement under §3A1.2 (Official Victim)
may be considered under this section.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1991.
417. Amendment: Section 3D1.2(d) is amended in the second paragraph by inserting ", 2C1.7"
immediately following "2C1.2"; by inserting ", 2D1.11, 2D1.13" immediately following
"2D1.5"; and by deleting "2K2.2" and inserting in lieu thereof "2K2.1".
The Commentary to §3D1.2 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 2 by inserting
the following immediately after the second sentence:
"For offenses in which there are no identifiable victims (e.g., drug or immigration
offenses, where society at large is the victim), the ‘victim’ for purposes of subsections
(a) and (b) is the societal interest that is harmed. In such cases, the counts are grouped
together when the societal interests that are harmed are closely related. Where one count,
for example, involves unlawfully entering the United States and the other involves
possession of fraudulent evidence of citizenship, the counts are grouped together because
the societal interests harmed (the interests protected by laws governing immigration) are
closely related. In contrast, where one count involves the sale of controlled substances
and the other involves an immigration law violation, the counts are not grouped together
because different societal interests are harmed.";
and by deleting the last sentence as follows:
"Thus, for so-called ‘victimless’ crimes (crimes in which society at large is the victim),
the grouping decision must be based primarily upon the nature of the interest invaded by
each offense.".
The Commentary to §3D1.2 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by deleting Note 8,
inserting the text of deleted Note 8 as the second paragraph of Note 5, and by renumbering Note
9 as Note 8.
The Commentary to §3D1.2 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in the third (formerly
second) paragraph of Note 5 by deleting "accessory after the fact for" and inserting in lieu
thereof "a conspiracy to commit".
The Commentary to §3D1.2 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 6 by inserting
the following additional paragraph as the second paragraph:
"A conspiracy, attempt, or solicitation to commit an offense is covered under subsection
(d) if the offense that is the object of the conspiracy, attempt, or solicitation is covered
under subsection (d).".
November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment 419
– 289 –
The Commentary following §3D1.5 captioned "Illustrations of the Operation of the Multiple-
Count Rules" is amended in example 1 by deleting "gun was discharged" and inserting in lieu
thereof "firearm was displayed".
The Commentary following §3D1.5 captioned "Illustrations of the Operation of the Multiple-
Count Rules" is amended in example 2 by deleting:
"The base offense level is 6, and there is an aggravator of 1 level for property value.
However, because the conduct involved repeated acts with some planning, the offense
level is raised to 8 (§2F1.1(b)(2)(B)). The combined offense level therefore is 8.",
and inserting in lieu thereof:
"The base offense level is 6; 1 level is added because of the value of the property
(§2F1.1(b)(1)); and 2 levels are added because the conduct involved repeated acts with
some planning (§2F1.1(b)(2)(A)). The resulting offense level is 9.".
The Commentary following §3D1.5 captioned "Illustrations of the Operation of the Multiple-
Count Rules" is amended in example 4 by deleting "§2B4.1 (Commercial Bribery)" and
inserting in lieu thereof "§2B4.1 (Bribery in Procurement of Bank Loan and Other Commercial
Bribery)".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment revises §3D1.2(d) to reflect amendments to the
offense guidelines of Chapter Two; clarifies the commentary in Note 1 to expressly state that
a conspiracy, attempt, or solicitation to commit an offense covered under subsection (d) is also
covered under subsection (d); clarifies the commentary in Note 2 with respect to the meaning
of the term "victim" where society at large is the victim; merges former Note 8 with Note 5 for
greater clarity; conforms two illustrations of the operation of the guidelines to the guidelines,
as amended; corrects an inaccurate illustration; and corrects a reference to the title of an offense
guideline.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1991.
418. Amendment: The Commentary to Chapter Five, Part A (Sentencing Table) captioned
"Application Notes" is amended in Note 3 by inserting ", except as provided in §§4B1.1 (Career
Offender) and 4B1.4 (Armed Career Criminal)" immediately before the period at the end of the
first sentence.
Reason for Amendment: This amendment conforms the commentary of this section to the
provisions concerning the determination of the criminal history category set forth in §§4B1.1
and 4B1.4. No substantive change results.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1991.
419. Amendment: Section 5F1.3 is amended by deleting:
"If the defendant was convicted of a felony and sentenced to probation, the court must
order one or more of the following sanctions: a fine, restitution, or community service.
18 U.S.C. § 3563(a)(2).".
Amendment 419 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003

Fine), use the greatest of: (A) the value of the unlawful payment; (B) the
value of the benefit received or to be received in return for the unlawful
payment; or (C) the consequential damages resulting from the unlawful
payment.".
Section 2C1.2 is amended by inserting the following additional subsection:
"(c) Special Instruction for Fines - Organizations

November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment 422
– 295 –
Section 2E5.1 is amended by inserting the following additional subsection:
"(c) Special Instruction for Fines - Organizations
(1) In lieu of the pecuniary loss under subsection (a)(3) of §8C2.4 (Base
Fine), use the greatest of: (A) the value of the unlawful payment; (B) if
a bribe, the value of the benefit received or to be received in return for the
unlawful payment; or (C) if a bribe, the consequential damages resulting
from the unlawful payment.".
Section 2E5.6 is amended by inserting the following additional subsection:
"(c) Special Instruction for Fines - Organizations
(1) In lieu of the pecuniary loss under subsection (a)(3) of §8C2.4 (Base
Fine), use the greatest of: (A) the value of the unlawful payment; (B) if
a bribe, the value of the benefit received or to be received in return for the
unlawful payment; or (C) if a bribe, the consequential damages resulting
from the unlawful payment.".
Section 2R1.1 is amended by inserting the following additional subsection:
"(d) Special Instructions for Fines - Organizations
(1) In lieu of the pecuniary loss under subsection (a)(3) of §8C2.4 (Base
Fine), use 20 percent of the volume of affected commerce.
(2) When applying §8C2.6 (Minimum and Maximum Multipliers), neither
the minimum nor maximum multiplier shall be less than 0.75.
(3) In a bid-rigging case in which the organization submitted one or more
complementary bids, use as the organization’s volume of commerce the
greater of (A) the volume of commerce done by the organization in the
goods or services that were affected by the violation, or (B) the largest
contract on which the organization submitted a complementary bid in
connection with the bid-rigging conspiracy.".
The Commentary to §2R1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by deleting:
"3. In setting the fine for an organization, the court should consider whether the
organization encouraged or took steps to prevent the violation, whether high-level
management was aware of the violation, and whether the organization previously
engaged in antitrust violations.",
and inserting in lieu thereof:
"3. The fine for an organization is determined by applying Chapter Eight (Sentencing
of Organizations). In selecting a fine for an organization within the guideline fine
range, the court should consider both the gain to the organization from the
Amendment 422 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003
– 296 –
offense and the loss caused by the organization. It is estimated that the average
gain from price-fixing is 10 percent of the selling price. The loss from price-
fixing exceeds the gain because, among other things, injury is inflicted upon
consumers who are unable or for other reasons do not buy the product at the
higher prices. Because the loss from price-fixing exceeds the gain, subsection
(d)(1) provides that 20 percent of the volume of affected commerce is to be used
in lieu of the pecuniary loss under §8C2.4(a)(3). The purpose for specifying a
percent of the volume of commerce is to avoid the time and expense that would
be required for the court to determine the actual gain or loss. In cases in which
the actual monopoly overcharge appears to be either substantially more or
substantially less than 10 percent, this factor should be considered in setting the
fine within the guideline fine range.".
The Commentary to §2R1.1 captioned "Background" is amended by deleting the last paragraph
as follows:
" Substantial fines are an essential part of the sanction. It is estimated that the
average additional profit attributable to price fixing is 10 percent of the selling price. The
Commission has specified that a fine from two to five times that amount be imposed on
organizational defendants as a deterrent because of the difficulty in identifying violators.
Additional monetary penalties can be provided through private treble damage actions.
A lower fine is specified for individuals. The Commission believes that most antitrust
defendants have the resources and earning capacity to pay these fines, at least over time.
The statutory maximum fine is $250,000 for individuals and $1,000,000 for
organizations, but is increased when there are convictions on multiple counts.",
and inserting in lieu thereof:
" Substantial fines are an essential part of the sentence. For an individual, the
guideline fine range is from one to five percent of the volume of commerce, but not less
than $20,000. For an organization, the guideline fine range is determined under Chapter
Eight (Sentencing of Organizations), but pursuant to subsection (d)(2), the minimum
multiplier is at least 0.75. This multiplier, which requires a minimum fine of 15 percent
of the volume of commerce for the least serious case, was selected to provide an effective
deterrent to antitrust offenses. At the same time, this minimum multiplier maintains
incentives for desired organizational behavior. Because the Department of Justice has
a well-established amnesty program for organizations that self-report antitrust offenses,
no lower minimum multiplier is needed as an incentive for self-reporting. A minimum
multiplier of at least 0.75 ensures that fines imposed in antitrust cases will exceed the
average monopoly overcharge.
The Commission believes that most antitrust defendants have the resources and earning
capacity to pay the fines called for by this guideline, at least over time on an installment
basis. The statutory maximum fine is $350,000 for individuals and $10,000,000 for
organizations, but is increased when there are convictions on multiple counts.".
Section 2S1.1 is amended by inserting the following additional subsection:
"(c) Special Instruction for Fines - Organizations
November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment 422
– 297 –
(1) In lieu of the applicable amount from the table in subsection (d) of
§8C2.4 (Base Fine), use:

if subsections (a)(1) and (b)(1) are used to determine the offense
level; or
(B) the greater of $200,000 or 70 percent of the value of the funds if
subsections (a)(2) and (b)(1) are used to determine the offense
level; or
(C) the greater of $200,000 or 70 percent of the value of the funds if
subsection (a)(1) but not (b)(1) is used to determine the offense
level; or
(D) the greater of $150,000 or 50 percent of the value of the funds if
subsection (a)(2) but not (b)(1) is used to determine the offense
level.".
Section 2S1.2 is amended by inserting the following additional subsection:
"(c) Special Instruction for Fines - Organizations
(1) In lieu of the applicable amount from the table in subsection (d) of
§8C2.4 (Base Fine), use:
(A) the greater of $175,000 or 60 percent of the value of the funds if
subsection (b)(1)(A) is used to determine the offense level; or
(B) the greater of $150,000 or 50 percent of the value of the funds if
subsection (b)(1)(B) is used to determine the offense level.".
Section 2S1.3 is amended by inserting the following additional subsection:
"(c) Special Instruction for Fines - Organizations
(1) In lieu of the applicable amount from the table in subsection (d) of
§8C2.4 (Base Fine), use:
(A) the greater of $125,000 or 30 percent of the value of the funds if
subsections (a)(1) and (b)(1) are used to determine the offense
level; or
(B) the greater of $50,000 or 20 percent of the value of the funds if
subsection (a)(1) but not (b)(1) are used to determine the offense
level.".
Amendment 422 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003
– 298 –
Section 2S1.4 is amended by inserting the following additional subsection:
"(c) Special Instruction for Fines - Organizations

§8C2.4 (Base Fine), use:
(A) the greater of $50,000 or 20 percent of the value of the funds if
subsection (b)(1) or (b)(2) is used to determine the offense level;
or
(B) the greater of $15,000 or 10 percent of the value of the funds,
otherwise.".

the sentencing of organizational defendants.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1991.
423. Amendment: Section 1B1.10(c) is amended by deleting:

six months; and
(2) may, in no event, exceed the number of months by which the maximum
of the guideline range applicable to the defendant (from Chapter Five,
Part A) has been lowered.",
and inserting in lieu thereof:
"(c) Provided, that a reduction in a defendant’s term of imprisonment may, in no
event, exceed the number of months by which the maximum of the guideline
range applicable to the defendant (from Chapter Five, Part A) has been lowered.".
Section 1B1.10(d) is amended by deleting "and 341" and inserting in lieu thereof "341, 379, and
380".
The Commentary to §1B1.10 captioned "Background" is amended in the fourth paragraph by
deleting:
"The requirement in subsection (c)(1) that the maximum of the guideline range be
lowered by at least six months for a reduction to be considered",
and inserting in lieu thereof:
November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment 426
– 299 –
"The Commission has not included in this policy statement amendments that generally
reduce the maximum of the guideline range by less than six months. This criterion".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment expands the listing in subsection (d) to implement
the directive in 28 U.S.C. § 994(u) in respect to the guideline amendments effective November
1, 1991. In addition, the amendment modifies subsection (c) to simplify the operation of this
policy statement, expand eligibility under the policy statement to a few additional cases, and
remove the potential for an anomalous result.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1991.
424. Amendment: Chapter Five, Part F, is amended by inserting an additional policy statement as
§5F1.7 (Shock Incarceration Program (Policy Statement)).

provisions and implementation of 18 U.S.C. § 4046.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1991.
425. Amendment: The Commentary to §6A1.2 is amended by inserting, immediately after
"Commentary", the following:
"Application Note:
1. Under Rule 32, Fed.R.Crim. P., if the court intends to consider a sentence outside
the applicable guideline range on a ground not identified as a ground for
departure either in the presentence report or a pre-hearing submission, it shall
provide reasonable notice that it is contemplating such ruling, specifically
identifying the ground for the departure. Burns v. United States, U.S. , 111
S.Ct. 2182 (1991).";
and by inserting "Background:" immediately before "In order".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment adds an application note to reflect the recent
Supreme Court decision in Burns v. United States, U.S. , 111 S.Ct. 2182 (1991).
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1991.
426. Amendment: The Commentary to §2T1.3 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by
inserting the following additional note:
"4. The amount by which the greater of gross income and taxable income was
understated, plus 100 percent of the total amount of any false credits claimed
against tax is calculated as follows: (1) determine the amount, if any, by which
the gross income was understated; (2) determine the amount, if any, by which the
taxable income was understated; and (3) determine the amount of any false
credit(s) claimed (a tax ‘credit’ is an item that reduces the amount of tax directly;
in contrast, a ‘deduction’ is an item that reduces the amount of taxable income).
Amendment 426 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003
– 300 –
Use the amount determined under step (1) or (2), whichever is greater, plus any
amount determined under step (3).".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment clarifies the operation of the guideline.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1991.
427. Amendment: Section 7B1.3 is amended by redesignating subsection (c)(1)(1) as (c)(1)(A),
(c)(1)(2) as (c)(1)(B), (c)(2)(1) as (c)(2)(A), and (c)(2)(2) as (c)(2)(B).
The Commentary to §7B1.3 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 2 by deleting
"§7B1.3(f)(2)" and inserting in lieu thereof "§7B1.3(g)(2)".
The Commentary to §7B1.3 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 3 by deleting
"No. 89-10529 (9th Cir. July 3, 1990)" and inserting in lieu thereof "907 F.2d 896 (9th Cir.
1990)".
The Commentary to §7B1.3 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by inserting the
following additional note:
"7. ‘Maximum term of imprisonment imposable upon revocation,’ as used in
subsection (g)(2), refers to the maximum term of imprisonment authorized by
statute for the violation of supervised release, not to the maximum of the
guideline range.".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment clarifies the operation of this policy statement,
makes editorial improvements, and corrects a clerical error.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1991.
428. Amendment: The Commentary to §5F1.5 captioned "Background" is amended by deleting the
last paragraph as follows:
" The Comprehensive Crime Control Act expressly authorizes promulgation of
policy statements regarding the appropriate use of conditions of probation and supervised
release. 28 U.S.C. § 994(a)(2)(B). The Act does not expressly grant the authority to
issue guidelines on the subject. The appellate review provisions of the Act, however,
authorize appeals of occupational restrictions that deviate from the minimum and
maximum limitations ‘established in the guideline’ (emphasis added).".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment deletes an outdated paragraph. Section 7103(b)(3)
of Public Law 100-690 amended 28 U.S.C. § 994 by adding subsection (a)(1)(E), which
expressly authorizes the Commission to promulgate guidelines addressing occupational
restrictions as a condition of probation or supervised release.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1991.

"§2A4.1(b)(7)"; and by inserting the following additional paragraph:
"A reference may also be to a specific subsection of another guideline; e.g., the reference
in §2D1.10(a)(1) to ‘3 plus the offense level from the Drug Quantity Table in §2D1.1’.
In such case, only the specific subsection of that other guideline is used.".
The Commentary to §1B1.5 captioned "Application Note" is amended by inserting the
following additional notes:
"2. A reference may require that the offense level be determined under another
offense guideline. In such case, the adjustments in Chapter Three, Parts A
(Victim-Related Adjustments), B (Role in the Offense), and E (Acceptance of
Responsibility) are also to be determined in respect to that other offense
guideline. For example, a defendant convicted of possession of a firearm by a
felon, to which §2K2.1 (Unlawful Receipt, Possession, or Transportation of
Firearms or Ammunition; Prohibited Transactions Involving Firearms or
Ammunition) applies, is found to have used that firearm in the commission of a
robbery. The cross reference at §2K2.1(c) directs that the robbery offense
guideline be used. The adjustments in Chapter Three, Parts A, B and E are to be
applied as if the offense of conviction had directly referenced the robbery
guideline.
3. A reference to another guideline may direct that such reference is to be used only
if it results in a greater offense level. In such cases, the greater offense level
means the greater final offense level (i.e., the greater offense level taking into
account both the Chapter Two offense level and any applicable Chapter Three
adjustments). Although the offense guideline that results in the greater offense
level under Chapter Two will most frequently result in the greater final offense
level, this will not always be the case. If, for example, a role or abuse of trust
adjustment applies to the cross-referenced offense guideline, but not to the
guideline initially applied, the greater Chapter Two offense level may not
necessarily result in a greater final offense level.
4. A reference may direct that, if the conduct involved another offense, the offense
guideline for such other offense is to be applied. Where there is more than one
such other offense, the most serious such offense (or group of closely-related
offenses in the case of offenses that would be grouped together under §3D1.2(d))
is to be used. For example, if a defendant convicted of possession of a firearm
by a felon, to which §2K2.1 (Unlawful Receipt, Possession, or Transportation of
Firearms or Ammunition; Prohibited Transactions Involving Firearms or
Ammunition) applies, is found to have possessed that firearm during commission
of a series of offenses, the cross reference at §2K2.1(c) is applied to the offense
resulting in the greatest offense level.";
Amendment 429 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003
– 302 –
and in the caption by deleting "Note" and inserting in lieu thereof "Notes".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment clarifies the operation of this guideline.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1991.
430. Amendment: The Commentary to §2H1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by
inserting the following additional paragraph as the first paragraph of Note 1:
"‘Underlying offense,’ as used in this guideline, includes any offense under federal, state,
or local law other than an offense that is itself covered under Chapter Two, Part H,
Subpart 1, 2, or 4. For example, in the case of a conspiracy to interfere with a person’s
civil rights (a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 241) that involved an aggravated assault (the use
of force) to deny certain rights or benefits in furtherance of discrimination (a violation
of 18 U.S.C. § 245), the underlying offense in respect to both the violation of 18 U.S.C.
§ 241 (to which §2H1.1 applies) and the violation of 18 U.S.C. § 245 (to which §2H1.3
applies) would be the aggravated assault.".
The Commentary to §2H1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 1 by inserting
the following additional paragraph at the end:
"In certain cases, the count of which the defendant is convicted may set forth conduct
that constitutes more than one underlying offense (e.g., two instances of assault, or one
instance of assault and one instance of arson). In such cases, determine the offense level
for the underlying offense by treating each underlying offense as if contained in a
separate count of conviction. To determine which of the alternative base offense levels
(e.g., §2H1.1(a)(1) or (a)(2)) results in the greater offense level, apply Chapter Three,
Parts A, B, C, and D to each alternative base offense level. Use whichever results in the
greater offense level. Example: The defendant is convicted of one count of conspiracy
to violate civil rights that included two level 12 underlying offenses (of a type not
grouped together under Chapter Three, Part D). No adjustment from Chapter Three,
Parts A, B, or C applies. The base offense level from §2H1.1(a)(1) is 15. The offense
level for each underlying offense from §2H1.1(a)(2) is 14 (2 + 12). Under Chapter
Three, Part D (Multiple Counts), the two level 14 underlying offenses result in a
combined offense level of 16. This offense level is greater than the alternative base
offense level of 15 under §2H1.1(a)(1). Therefore, the case is treated as if there were two
counts, one for each underlying offense, with a base offense level under §2H1.1(a)(2) of
14 for each underlying offense.".
The Commentary to §2H1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in the first sentence of
the second paragraph of Note 1 (formerly the first paragraph) by deleting "contained in the
particular guideline in Chapter Two) for any underlying criminal conduct" and inserting in lieu
thereof "and cross references) from the offense guideline in Chapter Two that most closely
corresponds to the underlying offense"; in the last sentence of the second paragraph of Note 1
(formerly the first paragraph) by deleting "an offense" and "that offense" and inserting in lieu
thereof "arson" in each instance.
November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment 433
– 303 –
Reason for Amendment: This amendment clarifies the operation of this guideline.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1991.
431. Amendment: The Commentary to §2J1.7 captioned "Background" is amended by deleting the
first paragraph as follows:
"An enhancement under 18 U.S.C. § 3147 may be imposed only upon application of the
government; it cannot be imposed on the court’s own motion. In this respect, it is similar
to a separate count of conviction and, for this reason, is placed in Chapter Two of the
guidelines.",
and inserting in lieu thereof:
"An enhancement under 18 U.S.C. § 3147 may be imposed only after sufficient notice
to the defendant by the government or the court, and applies only in the case of a
conviction for a federal offense that is committed while on release on another federal
charge.".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment corrects the description in the Background
Commentary of the operation of the statute to which this guideline applies.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1991.
432. Amendment: The Commentary to §2N2.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note
1 by inserting "or reckless" immediately before "conduct".
The Commentary to §2N2.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 4 by deleting
"anabolic steroids" and inserting in lieu thereof "human growth hormones", and by inserting
at the end:
"Offenses involving anabolic steroids are covered by Chapter Two, Part D (Offenses
Involving Drugs). In the case of an offense involving a substance purported to be an
anabolic steroid, but not containing any active ingredient, apply §2F1.1 (Fraud and
Deceit) with ‘loss’ measured by the amount paid, or to be paid, by the victim for such
substance.".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment clarifies Application Note 1 with respect to
reckless conduct, conforms Application Note 4 to reflect that offenses involving anabolic
steroids will be covered under §2D1.1 (Amendment 369), and clarifies the treatment of an
offense involving a substance purported to be an anabolic steroid, but containing no active
ingredient.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1991.
433. Amendment: Section 4B1.2(2) is amended by deleting "or distribution" and inserting in lieu
thereof "distribution, or dispensing"; and by deleting "or distribute" and inserting in lieu thereof
"distribute, or dispense".
Amendment 433 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003
– 304 –
Section 4B1.2(3) is amended by deleting "Part A of this Chapter" and inserting in lieu thereof
"§4A1.1(a), (b), or (c)".
The Commentary to §4B1.2 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 2 by inserting
"(i.e., expressly charged)" immediately following "set forth"; by inserting the following at the
end:
"Under this section, the conduct of which the defendant was convicted is the focus of
inquiry.
The term ‘crime of violence’ does not include the offense of unlawful possession of a
firearm by a felon. Where the instant offense is the unlawful possession of a firearm by
a felon, the specific offense characteristics of §2K2.1 (Unlawful Receipt, Possession, or
Transportation of Firearms or Ammunition; Prohibited Transactions Involving Firearms
or Ammunition) provide an increase in offense level if the defendant has one or more
prior felony convictions for a crime of violence or controlled substance offense; and, if
the defendant is sentenced under the provisions of 18 U.S.C. § 924(e), §4B1.4 (Armed
Career Criminal) will apply.".
The Commentary to §4B1.2 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 2 by inserting
"(including any explosive material or destructive device)" immediately following "explosives".
The Commentary to §4B1.2 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 3 by inserting
the following additional sentences at the end:
"A conviction for an offense committed at age eighteen or older is an adult conviction.
A conviction for an offense committed prior to age eighteen is an adult conviction if it
is classified as an adult conviction under the laws of the jurisdiction in which the
defendant was convicted (e.g., a federal conviction for an offense committed prior to the
defendant’s eighteenth birthday is an adult conviction if the defendant was expressly
proceeded against as an adult).".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment clarifies that the application of §4B1.2 is
determined by the offense of conviction (i.e., the conduct charged in the count of which the
defendant was convicted); clarifies that the offense of unlawful possession of a weapon is not
a crime of violence for the purposes of this section; clarifies the definition of a prior adult
conviction; makes the definitions in §4B1.2(2) more comprehensive; and clarifies the
application of §4B1.2(3) by specifying the particular provisions of Chapter Four, Part A to
which this subsection refers.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1991.
434. Amendment: The Commentary to §1B1.2 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note
1 in the second sentence of the second paragraph by deleting "as part of a plea of guilty or nolo
contendere" and inserting in lieu thereof "that is set forth in a written plea agreement or made
between the parties on the record during a plea proceeding"; in the second sentence of the third
paragraph by deleting "the plea" and inserting in lieu thereof "a plea agreement"; and in the
third sentence of the third paragraph by inserting "agreement" immediately following "plea".

The Commentary to §2G2.2 captioned "Statutory Provisions" is amended by deleting "2252"
and inserting in lieu thereof "2252(a)(1)-(3)".
The Commentary to §2G2.2 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by redesignating Note
4 as Note 5; by inserting the following as Note 4:
"‘Pattern of activity involving the sexual abuse or exploitation of a minor,’ for the
purposes of subsection (b)(4), means any combination of two or more separate instances
of the sexual abuse or the sexual exploitation of a minor, whether involving the same or
different victims.";
and in Note 5 (formerly Note 4) by inserting "exploited or" immediately before "abused"; by
deleting "is warranted" and inserting in lieu thereof "may be warranted"; and by inserting ", as
well as whether the defendant has received an enhancement under subsection (b)(4) on account
of such conduct" immediately after "conduct".

The Commentary to §2G2.4 captioned "Application Note" is deleted in its entirety as follows:
"Application Note:
1. This guideline assumes that the offense involved a small number of prohibited
items. If the defendant possessed 50 or more books, magazines, periodicals,
films, video tapes, or other items containing a visual depiction involving the
sexual exploitation of a minor, and subsection (c)(1) or (c)(2) does not apply, an
upward departure may be warranted.".

The Commentary to §1B1.2 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 5 by deleting
"jury’s verdict" and inserting in lieu thereof "verdict or plea".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment revises the language of this guideline to clarify the
meaning of the term "stipulation," complementing an amendment to the commentary of this
guideline effective November 1, 1991 (amendment 434). Both this amendment and amendment
434 were made in response to Braxton v. United States, 111 S.Ct. 1854 (1991). In addition, the
term "jury’s verdict" in the commentary of this section is deleted and replaced with the more
appropriate term "verdict or plea".

439. Amendment: Section 1B1.3(a) is amended by deleting:
"(1) all acts and omissions committed or aided and abetted by the defendant, or for
which the defendant would be otherwise accountable, that occurred during the
commission of the offense of conviction, in preparation for that offense, or in the
course of attempting to avoid detection or responsibility for that offense, or that
otherwise were in furtherance of that offense;
(2) solely with respect to offenses of a character for which §3D1.2(d) would require
grouping of multiple counts, all such acts and omissions that were part of the
same course of conduct or common scheme or plan as the offense of conviction;
(3) all harm that resulted from the acts or omissions specified in subsections (a)(1)
and (a)(2) above, and all harm that was the object of such acts or omissions; and",
and inserting in lieu thereof:
"(1) (A) all acts and omissions committed, aided, abetted, counseled, commanded,
induced, procured, or willfully caused by the defendant; and
(B) in the case of a jointly undertaken criminal activity (a criminal plan,
scheme, endeavor, or enterprise undertaken by the defendant in concert
with others, whether or not charged as a conspiracy), all reasonably
foreseeable acts and omissions of others in furtherance of the jointly
undertaken criminal activity,
that occurred during the commission of the offense of conviction, in preparation
for that offense, or in the course of attempting to avoid detection or responsibility
for that offense;
(2) solely with respect to offenses of a character for which §3D1.2(d) would require
grouping of multiple counts, all acts and omissions described in subdivisions
(1)(A) and (1)(B) above that were part of the same course of conduct or common
scheme or plan as the offense of conviction;
Amendment 439 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003
– 308 –
(3) all harm that resulted from the acts and omissions specified in subsections (a)(1)
and (a)(2) above, and all harm that was the object of such acts and omissions;
and".
The Commentary to §1B1.3 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by renumbering Notes
2-7 as Notes 3-8, respectively; and by deleting Note 1 as follows:
"1. Conduct ‘for which the defendant would be otherwise accountable,’ as used in
subsection (a)(1), includes conduct that the defendant counseled, commanded,
induced, procured, or willfully caused. (Cf. 18 U.S.C. § 2.) In the case of
criminal activity undertaken in concert with others, whether or not charged as a
conspiracy, the conduct for which the defendant ‘would be otherwise
accountable’ also includes conduct of others in furtherance of the execution of
the jointly-undertaken criminal activity that was reasonably foreseeable by the
defendant. Because a count may be broadly worded and include the conduct of
many participants over a substantial period of time, the scope of the jointly-
undertaken criminal activity, and hence relevant conduct, is not necessarily the
same for every participant. Where it is established that the conduct was neither
within the scope of the defendant’s agreement, nor was reasonably foreseeable
in connection with the criminal activity the defendant agreed to jointly undertake,
such conduct is not included in establishing the defendant’s offense level under
this guideline.
In the case of solicitation, misprision, or accessory after the fact, the conduct for which
the defendant ‘would be otherwise accountable’ includes all conduct relevant to
determining the offense level for the underlying offense that was known, or reasonably
should have been known, by the defendant.
Illustrations of Conduct for Which the Defendant is Accountable
a. Defendant A, one of ten off-loaders hired by Defendant B, was convicted
of importation of marihuana, as a result of his assistance in off-loading a boat
containing a one-ton shipment of marihuana. Regardless of the number of bales
of marihuana that he actually unloaded, and notwithstanding any claim on his
part that he was neither aware of, nor could reasonably foresee, that the boat
contained this quantity of marihuana, Defendant A is held accountable for the
entire one-ton quantity of marihuana on the boat because he aided and abetted the
unloading, and hence the importation, of the entire shipment.
b. Defendant C, the getaway driver in an armed bank robbery in which
$15,000 is taken and a teller is injured, is convicted of the substantive count of
bank robbery. Defendant C is accountable for the money taken because he aided
and abetted the taking of the money. He is accountable for the injury inflicted
because he participated in concerted criminal conduct that he could reasonably
foresee might result in the infliction of injury.
November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment 439
– 309 –
c. Defendant D pays Defendant E a small amount to forge an endorsement
on an $800 stolen government check. Unknown to Defendant E, Defendant D
then uses that check as a down payment in a scheme to fraudulently obtain
$15,000 worth of merchandise. Defendant E is convicted of forging the $800
check. Defendant E is not accountable for the $15,000 because the fraudulent
scheme to obtain $15,000 was beyond the scope of, and not reasonably
foreseeable in connection with, the criminal activity he jointly undertook with
Defendant D.
d. Defendants F and G, working together, design and execute a scheme to
sell fraudulent stocks by telephone. Defendant F fraudulently obtains $20,000.
Defendant G fraudulently obtains $35,000. Each is convicted of mail fraud.
Each defendant is accountable for the entire amount ($55,000) because each
aided and abetted the other in the fraudulent conduct. Alternatively, because
Defendants F and G engaged in concerted criminal activity, each is accountable
for the entire $55,000 loss because the conduct of each was in furtherance of the
jointly undertaken criminal activity and was reasonably foreseeable.
e. Defendants H and I engaged in an ongoing marihuana importation
conspiracy in which Defendant J was hired only to help off-load a single
shipment. Defendants H, I, and J are included in a single count charging
conspiracy to import marihuana. For the purposes of determining the offense
level under this guideline, Defendant J is accountable for the entire single
shipment of marihuana he conspired to help import and any acts or omissions in
furtherance of the importation that were reasonably foreseeable. He is not
accountable for prior or subsequent shipments of marihuana imported by
Defendants H or I if those acts were beyond the scope of, and not reasonably
foreseeable in connection with, the criminal activity he agreed to jointly
undertake with Defendants H and I (i.e., the importation of the single shipment
of marihuana).",
and inserting in lieu thereof:
"1. The principles and limits of sentencing accountability under this guideline are not
always the same as the principles and limits of criminal liability. Under
subsections (a)(1) and (a)(2), the focus is on the specific acts and omissions for
which the defendant is to be held accountable in determining the applicable
guideline range, rather than on whether the defendant is criminally liable for an
offense as a principal, accomplice, or conspirator.
2. A ‘jointly undertaken criminal activity’ is a criminal plan, scheme, endeavor, or
enterprise undertaken by the defendant in concert with others, whether or not
charged as a conspiracy.
In the case of a jointly undertaken criminal activity, subsection (a)(1)(B) provides
that a defendant is accountable for the conduct (acts and omissions) of others that
was both:
(i) in furtherance of the jointly undertaken criminal activity; and
(ii) reasonably foreseeable in connection with that criminal activity.
Because a count may be worded broadly and include the conduct of many
participants over a period of time, the scope of the criminal activity jointly
Amendment 439 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003
– 310 –
undertaken by the defendant (the ‘jointly undertaken criminal activity’) is not
necessarily the same as the scope of the entire conspiracy, and hence relevant
conduct is not necessarily the same for every participant. In order to determine
the defendant’s accountability for the conduct of others under subsection
(a)(1)(B), the court must first determine the scope of the criminal activity the
particular defendant agreed to jointly undertake (i.e., the scope of the specific
conduct and objectives embraced by the defendant’s agreement). The conduct
of others that was both in furtherance of, and reasonably foreseeable in
connection with, the criminal activity jointly undertaken by the defendant is
relevant conduct under this provision. The conduct of others that was not in
furtherance of the criminal activity jointly undertaken by the defendant, or was
not reasonably foreseeable in connection with that criminal activity, is not
relevant conduct under this provision.
In determining the scope of the criminal activity that the particular defendant
agreed to jointly undertake (i.e., the scope of the specific conduct and objectives
embraced by the defendant’s agreement), the court may consider any explicit
agreement or implicit agreement fairly inferred from the conduct of the defendant
and others.
Note that the criminal activity that the defendant agreed to jointly undertake, and
the reasonably foreseeable conduct of others in furtherance of that criminal
activity, are not necessarily identical. For example, two defendants agree to
commit a robbery and, during the course of that robbery, the first defendant
assaults and injures a victim. The second defendant is accountable for the assault
and injury to the victim (even if the second defendant had not agreed to the
assault and had cautioned the first defendant to be careful not to hurt anyone)
because the assaultive conduct was in furtherance of the jointly undertaken
criminal activity (the robbery) and was reasonably foreseeable in connection with
that criminal activity (given the nature of the offense).
With respect to offenses involving contraband (including controlled substances),
the defendant is accountable for all quantities of contraband with which he was
directly involved and, in the case of a jointly undertaken criminal activity, all
reasonably foreseeable quantities of contraband that were within the scope of the
criminal activity that he jointly undertook.
The requirement of reasonable foreseeability applies only in respect to the
conduct (i.e., acts and omissions) of others under subsection (a)(1)(B). It does
not apply to conduct that the defendant personally undertakes, aids, abets,
counsels, commands, induces, procures, or willfully causes; such conduct is
addressed under subsection (a)(1)(A).
Illustrations of Conduct for Which the Defendant is Accountable
(a) Acts and omissions aided or abetted by the defendant
(1) Defendant A is one of ten persons hired by Defendant B to off-
load a ship containing marihuana. The off-loading of the ship is
interrupted by law enforcement officers and one ton of
marihuana is seized (the amount on the ship as well as the
amount off-loaded). Defendant A and the other off-loaders are
arrested and convicted of importation of marihuana. Regardless
of the number of bales he personally unloaded, Defendant A is
November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment 439
– 311 –
accountable for the entire one-ton quantity of marihuana.
Defendant A aided and abetted the off-loading of the entire
shipment of marihuana by directly participating in the off-
loading of that shipment (i.e., the specific objective of the
criminal activity he joined was the off-loading of the entire
shipment). Therefore, he is accountable for the entire shipment
under subsection (a)(1)(A) without regard to the issue of
reasonable foreseeability. This is conceptually similar to the case
of a defendant who transports a suitcase knowing that it contains
a controlled substance and, therefore, is accountable for the
controlled substance in the suitcase regardless of his knowledge
or lack of knowledge of the actual type or amount of that
controlled substance.
In certain cases, a defendant may be accountable for particular
conduct under more than one subsection of this guideline. As
noted in the preceding paragraph, Defendant A is accountable for
the entire one-ton shipment of marihuana under subsection
(a)(1)(A). Defendant A also is accountable for the entire one-ton
shipment of marihuana on the basis of subsection
(a)(1)(B)(applying to a jointly undertaken criminal activity).
Defendant A engaged in a jointly undertaken criminal activity
(the scope of which was the importation of the shipment of
marihuana). A finding that the one-ton quantity of marihuana
was reasonably foreseeable is warranted from the nature of the
undertaking itself (the importation of marihuana by ship typically
involves very large quantities of marihuana). The specific
circumstances of the case (the defendant was one of ten persons
off-loading the marihuana in bales) also support this finding. In
an actual case, of course, if a defendant’s accountability for
particular conduct is established under one provision of this
guideline, it is not necessary to review alternative provisions
under which such accountability might be established.
(b) Acts and omissions aided or abetted by the defendant; requirement that
the conduct of others be in furtherance of the jointly undertaken criminal
activity and reasonably foreseeable
(1) Defendant C is the getaway driver in an armed bank robbery in
which $15,000 is taken and a teller is assaulted and injured.
Defendant C is accountable for the money taken under
subsection (a)(1)(A) because he aided and abetted the act of
taking the money (the taking of money was the specific objective
of the offense he joined). Defendant C is accountable for the
injury to the teller under subsection (a)(1)(B) because the assault
on the teller was in furtherance of the jointly undertaken criminal
activity (the robbery) and was reasonably foreseeable in
connection with that criminal activity (given the nature of the
offense).
As noted earlier, a defendant may be accountable for particular
conduct under more than one subsection. In this example,
Defendant C also is accountable for the money taken on the basis
of subsection (a)(1)(B) because the taking of money was in
Amendment 439 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003
– 312 –
furtherance of the jointly undertaken criminal activity (the
robbery) and was reasonably foreseeable (as noted, the taking of
money was the specific objective of the jointly undertaken
criminal activity).
(c) Requirement that the conduct of others be in furtherance of the jointly
undertaken criminal activity and reasonably foreseeable; scope of the
criminal activity
(1) Defendant D pays Defendant E a small amount to forge an
endorsement on an $800 stolen government check. Unknown to
Defendant E, Defendant D then uses that check as a down
payment in a scheme to fraudulently obtain $15,000 worth of
merchandise. Defendant E is convicted of forging the $800
check and is accountable for the forgery of this check under
subsection (a)(1)(A). Defendant E is not accountable for the
$15,000 because the fraudulent scheme to obtain $15,000 was
not in furtherance of the criminal activity he jointly undertook
with Defendant D (i.e., the forgery of the $800 check).
(2) Defendants F and G, working together, design and execute a
scheme to sell fraudulent stocks by telephone. Defendant F
fraudulently obtains $20,000. Defendant G fraudulently obtains
$35,000. Each is convicted of mail fraud. Defendants F and G
each are accountable for the entire amount ($55,000). Each
defendant is accountable for the amount he personally obtained
under subsection (a)(1)(A). Each defendant is accountable for
the amount obtained by his accomplice under subsection
(a)(1)(B) because the conduct of each was in furtherance of the
jointly undertaken criminal activity and was reasonably
foreseeable in connection with that criminal activity.
(3) Defendants H and I engaged in an ongoing marihuana
importation conspiracy in which Defendant J was hired only to
help off-load a single shipment. Defendants H, I, and J are
included in a single count charging conspiracy to import
marihuana. Defendant J is accountable for the entire single
shipment of marihuana he helped import under subsection
(a)(1)(A) and any acts and omissions in furtherance of the
importation of that shipment that were reasonably foreseeable
(see the discussion in example (a)(1) above). He is not
accountable for prior or subsequent shipments of marihuana
imported by Defendants H or I because those acts were not in
furtherance of his jointly undertaken criminal activity (the
importation of the single shipment of marihuana).
(4) Defendant K is a wholesale distributor of child pornography.
Defendant L is a retail-level dealer who purchases child
pornography from Defendant K and resells it, but otherwise
operates independently of Defendant K. Similarly, Defendant M
is a retail-level dealer who purchases child pornography from
Defendant K and resells it, but otherwise operates independently
of Defendant K. Defendants L and M are aware of each other’s
criminal activity but operate independently. Defendant N is
November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment 439
– 313 –
Defendant K’s assistant who recruits customers for Defendant K
and frequently supervises the deliveries to Defendant K’s
customers. Each defendant is convicted of a count charging
conspiracy to distribute child pornography. Defendant K is
accountable under subsection (a)(1)(A) for the entire quantity of
child pornography sold to Defendants L and M. Defendant N
also is accountable for the entire quantity sold to those
defendants under subsection (a)(1)(B) because the entire quantity
was within the scope of his jointly undertaken criminal activity
and reasonably foreseeable. Defendant L is accountable under
subsection (a)(1)(A) only for the quantity of child pornography
that he purchased from Defendant K because the scope of his
jointly undertaken criminal activity is limited to that amount.
For the same reason, Defendant M is accountable under
subsection (a)(1)(A) only for the quantity of child pornography
that he purchased from Defendant K.
(5) Defendant O knows about her boyfriend’s ongoing drug-
trafficking activity, but agrees to participate on only one occasion
by making a delivery for him at his request when he was ill.
Defendant O is accountable under subsection (a)(1)(A) for the
drug quantity involved on that one occasion. Defendant O is not
accountable for the other drug sales made by her boyfriend
because those sales were not in furtherance of her jointly
undertaken criminal activity (i.e., the one delivery).
(6) Defendant P is a street-level drug dealer who knows of other
street-level drug dealers in the same geographic area who sell the
same type of drug as he sells. Defendant P and the other dealers
share a common source of supply, but otherwise operate
independently. Defendant P is not accountable for the quantities
of drugs sold by the other street-level drug dealers because he is
not engaged in a jointly undertaken criminal activity with them.
In contrast, Defendant Q, another street-level drug dealer, pools
his resources and profits with four other street-level drug dealers.
Defendant Q is engaged in a jointly undertaken criminal activity
and, therefore, he is accountable under subsection (a)(1)(B) for
the quantities of drugs sold by the four other dealers during the
course of his joint undertaking with them because those sales
were in furtherance of the jointly undertaken criminal activity
and reasonably foreseeable in connection with that criminal
activity.
(7) Defendant R recruits Defendant S to distribute 500 grams of
cocaine. Defendant S knows that Defendant R is the prime
figure in a conspiracy involved in importing much larger
quantities of cocaine. As long as Defendant S’s agreement and
conduct is limited to the distribution of the 500 grams, Defendant
S is accountable only for that 500 gram amount (under
subsection (a)(1)(A)), rather than the much larger quantity
imported by Defendant R.
(8) Defendants T, U, V, and W are hired by a supplier to backpack
Amendment 439 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003
– 314 –
a quantity of marihuana across the border from Mexico into the
United States. Defendants T, U, V, and W receive their
individual shipments from the supplier at the same time and
coordinate their importation efforts by walking across the border
together for mutual assistance and protection. Each defendant is
accountable for the aggregate quantity of marihuana transported
by the four defendants. The four defendants engaged in a jointly
undertaken criminal activity, the object of which was the
importation of the four backpacks containing marihuana
(subsection (a)(1)(B)), and aided and abetted each other’s actions
(subsection (a)(1)(A)) in carrying out the jointly undertaken
criminal activity. In contrast, if Defendants T, U, V, and W were
hired individually, transported their individual shipments at
different times, and otherwise operated independently, each
defendant would be accountable only for the quantity of
marihuana he personally transported (subsection (a)(1)(A)). As
this example illustrates, in cases involving contraband (including
controlled substances), the scope of the jointly undertaken
criminal activity (and thus the accountability of the defendant for
the contraband that was the object of that jointly undertaken
activity) may depend upon whether, in the particular
circumstances, the nature of the offense is more appropriately
viewed as one jointly undertaken criminal activity or as a number
of separate criminal activities.".
The Commentary to §1B1.3 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 3 (formerly
Note 2) by deleting the first sentence as follows:
"‘Such acts and omissions that were part of the same course of conduct or common
scheme or plan as the offense of conviction,’ as used in subsection (a)(2), refers to acts
and omissions committed or aided and abetted by the defendant, or for which the
defendant would be otherwise accountable, that were part of the same course of conduct
or common scheme or plan as the offense of conviction.".
The Commentary to §1B1.3 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 6 (formerly
Note 5) in the first paragraph by deleting:
"For example, in §2K1.5, subsection (b)(1) applies ‘If the defendant is convicted under
49 U.S.C. § 1472(l)(2).’",
and inserting in lieu thereof:
"For example, in §2S1.1, subsection (a)(1) applies if the defendant ‘is convicted under
18 U.S.C. § 1956(a)(1)(A), (a)(2)(A), or (a)(3)(A).’";
and in the second paragraph by deleting:
"For example, §2K1.5(b)(1) (which is applicable only if the defendant is convicted under
49 U.S.C. § 1472(l)(2)) would be applied in determining the offense level under §2X3.1
(Accessory After the Fact) where the defendant was convicted of accessory after the fact
to a violation of 49 U.S.C. § 1472(l)(2).",
and inserting in lieu thereof:
November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment 439
– 315 –
"For example, §2S1.1(a)(1) (which is applicable only if the defendant is convicted under
18 U.S.C. § 1956(a)(1)(A), (a)(2)(A), or (a)(3)(A)) would be applied in determining the
offense level under §2X3.1 (Accessory After the Fact) where the defendant was
convicted of accessory after the fact to a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1956(a)(1)(A),
(a)(2)(A), or (a)(3)(A).".
The Commentary to §1B1.3 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by inserting the
following additional notes:
"9. ‘Common scheme or plan’ and ‘same course of conduct’ are two closely-related
concepts.
(A) Common scheme or plan. For two or more offenses to constitute part of a
common scheme or plan, they must be substantially connected to each other by
at least one common factor, such as common victims, common accomplices,
common purpose, or similar modus operandi. For example, the conduct of five
defendants who together defrauded a group of investors by computer
manipulations that unlawfully transferred funds over an eighteen-month period
would qualify as a common scheme or plan on the basis of any of the above listed
factors; i.e., the commonality of victims (the same investors were defrauded on
an ongoing basis), commonality of offenders (the conduct constituted an ongoing
conspiracy), commonality of purpose (to defraud the group of investors), or
similarity of modus operandi (the same or similar computer manipulations were
used to execute the scheme).
(B) Same course of conduct. Offenses that do not qualify as part of a common
scheme or plan may nonetheless qualify as part of the same course of conduct if
they are sufficiently connected or related to each other as to warrant the
conclusion that they are part of a single episode, spree, or ongoing series of
offenses. Factors that are appropriate to the determination of whether offenses
are sufficiently connected or related to each other to be considered as part of the
same course of conduct include the degree of similarity of the offenses and the
time interval between the offenses. The nature of the offenses may also be a
relevant consideration (e.g., a defendant’s failure to file tax returns in three
consecutive years appropriately would be considered as part of the same course
of conduct because such returns are only required at yearly intervals).
10. In the case of solicitation, misprision, or accessory after the fact, the conduct for
which the defendant is accountable includes all conduct relevant to determining
the offense level for the underlying offense that was known, or reasonably should
have been known, by the defendant.".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment clarifies and more fully illustrates the operation
of this guideline. Material is moved from the commentary to the guideline itself and rephrased
for greater clarity, the discussion of the application of this provision in the commentary is
expanded, and additional examples are inserted. In addition, this amendment provides
definitions of the terms "same course of conduct" and "common scheme or plan." Finally, this
amendment conforms an example in Application Note 6 of the Commentary to a revision of a
Chapter Two offense guideline.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1992.
440. Amendment: Section 1B1.5 is amended by deleting:
Amendment 440 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003
– 316 –
"Unless otherwise expressly indicated, a reference to another guideline, or an instruction
to apply another guideline, refers to the entire guideline, i.e., the base offense level plus
all applicable specific offense characteristics and cross references.",
and inserting in lieu thereof:
"(a) A cross reference (an instruction to apply another offense guideline) refers to the
entire offense guideline (i.e., the base offense level, specific offense
characteristics, cross references, and special instructions).
(b) (1) An instruction to use the offense level from another offense guideline
refers to the offense level from the entire offense guideline (i.e., the base
offense level, specific offense characteristics, cross references, and special
instructions), except as provided in subdivision (2) below.
(2) An instruction to use a particular subsection or table from another offense
guideline refers only to the particular subsection or table referenced, and
not to the entire offense guideline.
(c) If the offense level is determined by a reference to another guideline under
subsection (a) or (b)(1) above, the adjustments in Chapter Three (Adjustments)
also are determined in respect to the referenced offense guideline, except as
otherwise expressly provided.
(d) A reference to another guideline under subsection (a) or (b)(1) above may direct
that it be applied only if it results in the greater offense level. In such case, the
greater offense level means the greater final offense level (i.e., the greater offense
level taking into account both the Chapter Two offense level and any applicable
Chapter Three adjustments).".
The Commentary to §1B1.5 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 1 by deleting:
"are to be construed to incorporate the specific offense characteristics and cross
references",
and inserting in lieu thereof:
"incorporate the specific offense characteristics, cross references, and special
instructions".
The Commentary to §1B1.5 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by deleting Note 2 as
follows:
"2. A reference may require that the offense level be determined under another
offense guideline. In such case, the adjustments in Chapter Three, Parts A
(Victim-Related Adjustments), B (Role in the Offense), and E (Acceptance of
Responsibility) are also to be determined in respect to that other offense
guideline. For example, a defendant convicted of possession of a firearm by a
felon, to which §2K2.1 (Unlawful Receipt, Possession, or Transportation of
Firearms or Ammunition; Prohibited Transactions Involving Firearms or
Ammunition) applies, is found to have used that firearm in the commission of a
robbery. The cross reference at §2K2.1(c) directs that the robbery offense
guideline be used. The adjustments in Chapter Three, Parts A, B and E are to be
applied as if the offense of conviction had directly referenced the robbery

guideline.";
and by renumbering Notes 3 and 4 as Notes 2 and 3, respectively.
Reason for Amendment: This amendment clarifies the operation of this guideline and moves
an instruction currently contained in the commentary into the guideline itself.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1992.
441. Amendment: Section 1B1.8(b) is amended in subdivision (3) by deleting "or" immediately
following the semicolon; in subdivision (4) by deleting the period at the end and inserting in
lieu thereof "; or"; and by inserting the following additional subdivision:
"(5) in determining whether, or to what extent, a downward departure from the
guidelines is warranted pursuant to a government motion under §5K1.1
(Substantial Assistance to Authorities).".
The Commentary to §1B1.8 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 1 by deleting
the third sentence as follows:
"Although this guideline, consistent with the general structure of these guidelines, affects
only the determination of the guideline range, the policy of the Commission is that where
a defendant as a result of a cooperation agreement with the government to assist in the
investigation or prosecution of other offenders reveals information that implicates him
in unlawful conduct not already known to the government, such defendant should not be
subject to an increased sentence by virtue of that cooperation where the government
agreed that the information revealed would not be used for such purpose.",
and inserting in lieu thereof:
"Although the guideline itself affects only the determination of the guideline range, the
policy of the Commission, as a corollary, is that information prohibited from being used
to determine the applicable guideline range shall not be used to increase the defendant’s
sentence above the applicable guideline range by upward departure. In contrast,
subsection (b)(5) provides that consideration of such information is appropriate in
determining whether, and to what extent, a downward departure is warranted pursuant
to a government motion under §5K1.1 (Substantial Assistance to Authorities); e.g., a
court may refuse to depart below the applicable guideline range on the basis of such
information.".
The Commentary to §1B1.8 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 3 in the second
sentence by deleting:
"is governed by the provisions of Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure and
Rule 410",
and inserting in lieu thereof:
"in a sentencing proceeding is restricted by Rule 11(e)(6) (Inadmissibility of Pleas, Plea
Discussions, and Related Statements) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure and
Rule 410 (Inadmissibility of Pleas, Plea Discussions, and Related Statements)".
The Commentary to §1B1.8 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 5 in the second
sentence by deleting "repeats" and inserting in lieu thereof "provides".
Amendment 441 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003
– 318 –
Reason for Amendment: This amendment clarifies the operation of this guideline.
Information protected by this guideline may not be used to determine the applicable guideline
range. An upward departure on the basis of such information would be contrary to the
Commission’s policy (and, consequently, would be appealable under 18 U.S.C. § 3742(a)(2)
and (3). See Williams v. United States, 112 S.Ct. 1112 (1992)). In contrast, the use of
information covered by this guideline is appropriate in considering whether, and to what extent,
a downward departure under §5K1.1 (Substantial Assistance to Authorities) is appropriate. In
addition, this amendment makes minor editorial improvements.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1992.
442. Amendment: Chapter One, Part B, is amended by inserting an additional policy statement with
accompanying commentary as §1B1.11 (Use of Guidelines Manual in Effect on Date of
Sentencing (Policy Statement)).
Reason for Amendment: This amendment inserts a policy statement addressing the use of the
Guidelines Manual when the Guidelines Manual has been amended between the date the
offense was committed and the date of sentencing.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1992.
443. Amendment: Section 2A2.4(c)(1) is amended by deleting "defendant is convicted under 18
U.S.C. § 111 and the" immediately before "conduct".
Section 2K1.5(b)(1) is amended by deleting:
"defendant is convicted under 49 U.S.C. § 1472(l)(2) (i.e., the defendant acted willfully
and without regard for the safety of human life, or with reckless disregard for the safety
of human life)",
and inserting in lieu thereof:
"offense was committed willfully and without regard for the safety of human life, or with
reckless disregard for the safety of human life".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment deletes the requirement of a conviction under a
specific statute for these specific offense characteristics to apply and, consistent with the overall
structure of the guidelines, provides for their application on the basis of the underlying conduct.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1992.
444. Amendment: Section 2A3.1 is amended in the title by deleting "or Assault with the Intent"
immediately following "Attempt".
Section 2A3.1(b)(3) is amended by deleting:
"in the custody, care, or supervisory control of the defendant, was a corrections
employee, or",
and by inserting in lieu thereof:
"(A) in the custody, care, or supervisory control of the defendant; or (B)".
Section 2A3.1 is amended by inserting the following additional subsection:
November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment 444
– 319 –
"(c) Special Instruction
(1) If the offense occurred in a correctional facility and the victim was a
corrections employee, the offense shall be deemed to have an official
victim for purposes of subsection (a) of §3A1.2 (Official Victim).".
The Commentary to §2A3.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by renumbering Note
3 as Note 4; and by inserting the following additional note:
"3. Subsection (b)(3), as it pertains to a victim in the custody, care, or supervisory
control of the defendant, is intended to have broad application and is to be
applied whenever the victim is entrusted to the defendant, whether temporarily
or permanently. For example, teachers, day care providers, baby-sitters, or other
temporary caretakers are among those who would be subject to this enhancement.
In determining whether to apply this enhancement, the court should look to the
actual relationship that existed between the defendant and the victim and not
simply to the legal status of the defendant-victim relationship.".
Section 2A3.2 is amended by inserting the following additional subsection:
"(c) Cross Reference
(1) If the offense involved criminal sexual abuse or attempt to commit
criminal sexual abuse (as defined in 18 U.S.C. § 2241 or § 2242), apply
§2A3.1 (Criminal Sexual Abuse; Attempt to Commit Criminal Sexual
Abuse).".
The Commentary to §2A3.2 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by renumbering Note
2 as Note 3; and by inserting the following as Note 2:
"2. Subsection (b)(1) is intended to have broad application and is to be applied
whenever the victim is entrusted to the defendant, whether temporarily or
permanently. For example, teachers, day care providers, baby-sitters, or other
temporary caretakers are among those who would be subject to this enhancement.
In determining whether to apply this enhancement, the court should look to the
actual relationship that existed between the defendant and the victim and not
simply to the legal status of the defendant-victim relationship.".
Section 2A3.4 is amended by inserting the following additional subsection:
"(c) Cross References
(1) If the offense involved criminal sexual abuse or attempt to commit
criminal sexual abuse (as defined in 18 U.S.C. § 2241 or § 2242), apply
§2A3.1 (Criminal Sexual Abuse; Attempt to Commit Criminal Sexual
Abuse).
(2) If the offense involved criminal sexual abuse of a minor or attempt to
commit criminal sexual abuse of a minor (as defined in 18 U.S.C.
§ 2243(a)), apply §2A3.2 (Criminal Sexual Abuse of a Minor or Attempt
to Commit Such Acts), if the resulting offense level is greater than that
determined above.".
The Commentary to §2A3.4 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by renumbering Note
Amendment 444 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003
– 320 –
3 as Note 4; and by inserting the following as Note 3:
"3. Subsection (b)(3) is intended to have broad application and is to be applied
whenever the victim is entrusted to the defendant, whether temporarily or
permanently. For example, teachers, day care providers, baby-sitters, or other
temporary caretakers are among those who would be subject to this enhancement.
In determining whether to apply this enhancement, the court should look to the
actual relationship that existed between the defendant and the victim and not
simply to the legal status of the defendant-victim relationship.".
Section 2G1.2(c)(2) is amended by deleting "or Assault with the Intent" immediately before "to
Commit Criminal Sexual Abuse".
The Commentary to §2X1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 1 in the second
paragraph by deleting "or Assault with the Intent" immediately before "to Commit Criminal
Sexual Abuse".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment cross references §2A3.2 to §2A3.1, and §2A3.4
to §§2A3.1 and 2A3.2. A review of cases sentenced under these guidelines indicated that a
significant proportion of cases sentenced under §2A3.2 and §2A3.4 clearly involved conduct
that would more appropriately be covered under an offense guideline applicable to more serious
sexual abuse cases. The addition of these cross references is designed to address this issue. In
addition, this amendment removes an anomaly between §2A3.1(b)(3) and §3A1.2(a), and adds
application notes to clarify the scope of §§2A3.1(b)(3), 2A3.2(b)(1), and 2A3.4(b)(3), using
language derived from application notes pertaining to similar specific offense characteristics
in Chapter Two, Part G.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1992.
445. Amendment: The Commentary to §2A4.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by
inserting the following additional note:
"5. In the case of a conspiracy, attempt, or solicitation to kidnap, §2X1.1 (Attempt,
Solicitation, or Conspiracy) requires that the court apply any adjustment that can
be determined with reasonable certainty. Therefore, for example, if an offense
involved conspiracy to kidnap for the purpose of committing murder, subsection
(b)(7) would reference first degree murder (resulting in an offense level of 43,
subject to a possible 3-level reduction under §2X1.1(b)). Similarly, for example,
if an offense involved a kidnapping during which a participant attempted to
murder the victim under circumstances that would have constituted first degree
murder had death occurred, the offense referenced under subsection (b)(7) would
be the offense of first degree murder.".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment clarifies the operation of this guideline.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1992.
446. Amendment: Section 2D1.1(b)(2) is amended by deleting "is convicted of violating 21 U.S.C.
§ 960(a)" and inserting in lieu thereof "unlawfully imported or exported a controlled
substance"; and by inserting "or export" immediately following "to import".
The Commentary to §2D1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 10 in the "Drug
Equivalency Tables" in the subdivision captioned "Cocaine and Other Schedule I and II
Stimulants" by inserting the following additional entries at the end:
November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment 446
– 321 –
"1 gm of Aminorex = 100 gm of marihuana
1 gm of Methcathinone = 380 gm of marihuana
1 gm of N-N-Dimethylamphetamine = 40 gm of marihuana";
and in the subdivision captioned "LSD, PCP, and Other Schedule I and II Hallucinogens" by
inserting the following additional entry as the last entry:
"1 gm of Phenylcyclohexamine (PCE) = 5.79 kg of marihuana".
The Commentary to §2D1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 10 in the "Drug
Equivalency Tables" by inserting an asterisk immediately following each of the following
subdivision captions: "Schedule I or II Opiates", "Cocaine and Other Schedule I or II
Stimulants (and their immediate precursors)", and "LSD, PCP, and Other Schedule I and II
Hallucinogens (and their immediate precursors)"; and by inserting the following additional
sentence at the end of each of the above noted subdivisions:
"*Provided, that the minimum offense level from the Drug Quantity Table for any of
these controlled substances individually, or in combination with another controlled
substance, is level 12.".
The Commentary to §2D1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by inserting the
following additional note:
"15. Certain pharmaceutical preparations are classified as Schedule III, IV, or V
controlled substances by the Drug Enforcement Administration under 21 C.F.R.
§ 1308.13-15 even though they contain a small amount of a Schedule I or II
controlled substance. For example, Tylenol 3 is classified as a Schedule III
controlled substance even though it contains a small amount of codeine, a
Schedule II opiate. For the purposes of the guidelines, the classification of the
controlled substance under 21 C.F.R. § 1308.13-15 is the appropriate
classification.".
The Commentary to §2D1.1 captioned "Background" is amended in the fifth paragraph by
deleting "mandated by" and inserting in lieu thereof "derived from".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment deletes the requirement of a conviction under a
specific statute for the specific offense characteristic in subsection (b)(2) to apply and,
consistent with the overall structure of the guidelines, provides for the application of this
specific offense characteristic on the basis of the underlying conduct. In addition, this
amendment adds equivalencies for four controlled substances to make the Drug Equivalency
Tables more comprehensive, adds notes to the Drug Equivalency Tables to make clear the
interaction between the minimum offense level for certain types of controlled substances in the
Drug Quantity Table and the instructions for determining a combined offense level in a case
with multiple controlled substances, and clarifies the treatment of certain pharmaceutical
preparations that are classified as Schedule III, IV, or V substances under 21 C.F.R. § 1308.13-
15.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1992.
447. Amendment: Sections 2D1.1, 2D1.2, 2D1.5, 2D1.6, 2D1.7, 2D1.8, 2D1.9, 2D1.10, 2D1.11,
2D1.12, 2D1.13, 2D2.1, 2D2.2, 2D3.1, 2D3.2, 2D3.3, 2D3.4, and 2D3.5 are amended in their
titles by inserting at the end thereof in each instance "; Attempt or Conspiracy".
Amendment 447 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003

Section 2D1.4, including accompanying commentary, is deleted as follows:
"§2D1.4. Attempts and Conspiracies
(a) Base Offense Level: If a defendant is convicted of a conspiracy
or an attempt to commit any offense involving a controlled
substance, the offense level shall be the same as if the object of
the conspiracy or attempt had been completed.
Commentary
Statutory Provisions: 21 U.S.C. §§ 846, 963. For additional statutory provision(s), see
Appendix A (Statutory Index).
Application Notes:
1. If the defendant is convicted of a conspiracy that includes transactions in
controlled substances in addition to those that are the subject of substantive
counts of conviction, each conspiracy transaction shall be included with those of
the substantive counts of conviction to determine scale. If the defendant is
convicted of an offense involving negotiation to traffic in a controlled substance,
the weight under negotiation in an uncompleted distribution shall be used to
calculate the applicable amount. However, where the court finds that the
defendant did not intend to produce and was not reasonably capable of producing
the negotiated amount, the court shall exclude from the guideline calculation the
amount that it finds the defendant did not intend to produce and was not
reasonably capable of producing. If the defendant is convicted of conspiracy, see
Application Note 1 to §1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct).
2. Where there is no drug seizure or the amount seized does not reflect the scale of
the offense, the sentencing judge shall approximate the quantity of the controlled
substance. In making this determination, the judge may consider, for example,
the price generally obtained for the controlled substance, financial or other
records, similar transactions in controlled substances by the defendant, and the
size or capability of any laboratory involved.
3. See Commentary to §2D1.1 regarding weapon possession.".
The Commentary to §2D1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 3 by deleting
"reference §2D1.1, i.e., §§2D1.2, 2D1.4, 2D1.5, 2D1.6, 2D1.7(b)(1)" and inserting in lieu
thereof "are referenced to §2D1.1; see §§2D1.2(a)(1) and (2), 2D1.5(a)(1), 2D1.6, 2D1.7(b)(1),
2D1.8, 2D1.11(c)(1), 2D1.12(b)(1), and 2D2.1(b)(1)".
The Commentary to §2D1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 12 by deleting:

this determination, the court may consider, for example, the price generally obtained for
the controlled substance, financial or other records, similar transactions in controlled
substances by the defendant, and the size or capability of any laboratory involved.
If the offense involved both a substantive drug offense and an attempt or conspiracy (e.g.,
sale of five grams of heroin and an attempt to sell an additional ten grams of heroin), the
total quantity involved shall be aggregated to determine the scale of the offense.
In an offense involving negotiation to traffic in a controlled substance, the weight under
negotiation in an uncompleted distribution shall be used to calculate the applicable
amount. However, where the court finds that the defendant did not intend to produce and
was not reasonably capable of producing the negotiated amount, the court shall exclude
from the guideline calculation the amount that it finds the defendant did not intend to
produce and was not reasonably capable of producing.".
The Commentary to §2D1.1 captioned "Background" is amended in the fifth sentence of the
fourth paragraph by deleting "(see §2D1.4)" immediately following "object of the attempt".
The Commentary to §2D1.6 captioned "Application Note" is amended in the first sentence of
Note 1 by deleting "Commentary to §2D1.1, and Application Notes 1 and 2 of the Commentary
to §2D1.4," and inserting in lieu thereof "Commentary to §2D1.1".
Section 2D1.11(c) is amended by deleting ", or §2D1.4 (Attempts and Conspiracies), as
appropriate," immediately before "if the resulting".
Section 2D1.12(b) is amended by deleting ", or §2D1.4 (Attempts and Conspiracies), as
appropriate," immediately before "if the resulting".
The Commentary to §2X1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 1 by deleting
"§2D1.4 (Attempts and Conspiracies)" wherever it appears and inserting in lieu thereof in each
instance:
"§2D1.1 (Unlawful Manufacturing, Importing, Exporting, or Trafficking, Including
Possession with Intent to Commit These Offenses; Attempt or Conspiracy); §2D1.2
(Drug Offenses Occurring Near Protected Locations or Involving Underage or Pregnant
Individuals; Attempt or Conspiracy); §2D1.5 (Continuing Criminal Enterprise; Attempt
or Conspiracy); §2D1.6 (Use of Communication Facility in Committing Drug Offense;
Attempt or Conspiracy); §2D1.7 (Unlawful Sale or Transportation of Drug
Paraphernalia; Attempt or Conspiracy); §2D1.8 (Renting or Managing a Drug
Establishment; Attempt or Conspiracy); §2D1.9 (Placing or Maintaining Dangerous
Devices on Federal Property to Protect the Unlawful Production of Controlled

Authorized Person; Attempt or Conspiracy); §2D3.4 (Illegal Transfer or Transshipment
of a Controlled Substance; Attempt or Conspiracy); and §2D3.5 (Violation of
Recordkeeping or Reporting Requirements for Listed Chemicals and Certain Machines;
Attempt or Conspiracy)".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment clarifies and simplifies the guideline provisions
dealing with attempts and conspiracies in drug cases and conforms the structure of these
provisions to that of other offense guidelines that specifically address attempts and conspiracies
(i.e., offense guidelines referenced by §2X1.1(c)).
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1992.
448. Amendment: Section 2D1.8 is amended by deleting subsections (a) and (b) as follows:
"(a) Base Offense Level: 16
(b) Specific Offense Characteristic
(1) If a firearm or other dangerous weapon was possessed, increase by
2 levels.",
and inserting in lieu thereof:
"(a) Base Offense Level:
(1) The offense level from §2D1.1 applicable to the underlying controlled
substance offense, except as provided below.
(2) If the defendant had no participation in the underlying controlled
substance offense other than allowing use of the premises, the offense
level shall be 4 levels less than the offense level from §2D1.1 applicable
to the underlying controlled substance offense, but not greater than level
16.
(b) Special Instruction
(1) If the offense level is determined under subsection (a)(2), do not apply an
adjustment under §3B1.2 (Mitigating Role).".
The Commentary to §2D1.8 captioned "Application Note" is amended by deleting Note 1 as
follows:
"1. Definitions of ‘firearm’ and ‘dangerous weapon’ are found in the Commentary
to §1B1.1 (Application Instructions).",
and inserting in lieu thereof:
"1. Subsection (a)(2) does not apply unless the defendant had no participation in the
underlying controlled substance offense other than allowing use of the premises.
For example, subsection (a)(2) would not apply to a defendant who possessed a
dangerous weapon in connection with the offense, a defendant who guarded the
cache of controlled substances, a defendant who arranged for the use of the
premises for the purpose of facilitating a drug transaction, a defendant who
November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment 450
– 325 –
allowed the use of more than one premises, a defendant who made telephone calls
to facilitate the underlying controlled substance offense, or a defendant who
otherwise assisted in the commission of the underlying controlled substance
offense. Furthermore, subsection (a)(2) does not apply unless the defendant
initially leased, rented, purchased, or otherwise acquired a possessory interest in
the premises for a legitimate purpose. Finally, subsection (a)(2) does not apply
if the defendant had previously allowed any premises to be used as a drug
establishment without regard to whether such prior misconduct resulted in a
conviction.".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment is designed to reduce unwarranted disparity by
requiring consideration in the guideline of the scale of the underlying controlled substance
offense. The amendment parallels an amendment to §2D1.6 made in 1990 (amendment 320).
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1992.
449. Amendment: The Commentary to §2E1.4 captioned "Background" is amended by deleting:
"The statute does not require that a murder covered by this section has been committed.
The maximum term of imprisonment authorized by statute ranges from five years to life
imprisonment.",
and inserting in lieu thereof:
"This guideline and the statute to which it applies do not require that a murder actually
have been committed.".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment makes editorial improvements, and deletes a
reference to the length of the maximum term of imprisonment authorized by statute for the
offense covered by this section that is no longer accurate.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1992.
450. Amendment: Section 2L1.1(b)(2) is amended by deleting:
"If the defendant previously has been convicted of smuggling, transporting, or harboring
an unlawful alien, or a related offense, increase by 2 levels.",
and inserting in lieu thereof:
"If the offense involved the smuggling, transporting, or harboring of six or more
unlawful aliens, increase as follows:
Number of Unlawful Aliens
Smuggled, Transported, or
Harbored Increase in Level
(A) 6-24 add 2
(B) 25-99 add 4
(C) 100 or more add 6.".
The Commentary to §2L1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 1 by inserting
the following additional sentence at the end:
Amendment 450 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003
– 326 –
"The ‘number of unlawful aliens smuggled, transported, or harbored’ does not include
the defendant.".
The Commentary to §2L1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by deleting Notes 2, 3,
and 4 as follows:
"2. ‘Convicted of smuggling, transporting, or harboring an unlawful alien, or a
related offense’ includes any conviction for smuggling, transporting, or harboring
an unlawful alien, and any conviction for aiding and abetting, conspiring or
attempting to commit such offense.
3. If the defendant was convicted under 8 U.S.C. § 1328, apply the applicable
guideline from Part G (see Statutory Index) rather than this guideline.
4. The adjustment under §2L1.1(b)(2) for a previous conviction is in addition to any
points added to the criminal history score for such conviction in Chapter Four,
Part A (Criminal History). This adjustment is to be applied only if the previous
conviction occurred prior to the last overt act of the instant offense.";
and by renumbering Notes 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9, as Notes 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, respectively.
The Commentary to §2L1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 4 (formerly
Note 7) by inserting "drug trafficking, or other serious criminal behavior," immediately
following "subversive activity,".
The Commentary to §2L1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by deleting the text of
Note 5 (formerly Note 8) as follows:
"The Commission has not considered offenses involving large numbers of aliens or
dangerous or inhumane treatment. An upward departure should be considered in those
circumstances.",
and inserting in lieu thereof:
"If the offense involved dangerous or inhumane treatment, death or bodily injury,
possession of a dangerous weapon, or substantially more than 100 aliens, an upward
departure may be warranted.".
The Commentary to §2L1.1 captioned "Background" is amended by deleting:
"A second specific offense characteristic provides an enhancement if the defendant was
previously convicted of a similar offense.",
and inserting in lieu thereof:
"The offense level increases with the number of unlawful aliens smuggled, transported,
or harbored. In large scale cases, an additional adjustment from §3B1.1 (Aggravating
Role) typically will apply to the most culpable defendants.".
The title of §2L2.1 is amended by deleting "Evidence of Citizenship or Documents Authorizing
Entry" and inserting in lieu thereof "Documents Relating to Naturalization, Citizenship, or
Legal Resident Status; False Statement in Respect to the Citizenship or Immigration Status of
Another; Fraudulent Marriage to Assist Alien to Evade Immigration Law".
November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment 450
– 327 –
Section 2L2.1(b) is amended by deleting "Characteristic" and inserting in lieu thereof
"Characteristics"; and by inserting the following additional specific offense characteristic:
"(2) If the offense involved six or more sets of documents, increase as follows:
Number of Sets
of Documents Increase in Level
(A) 6-24 add 2
(B) 25-99 add 4
(C) 100 or more add 6.".
The Commentary to §2L2.1 captioned "Statutory Provisions" is amended by deleting "18
U.S.C. §§ 1425-1427, 1546. For additional statutory provision(s), see Appendix A (Statutory
Index)" and inserting in lieu thereof "8 U.S.C. §§ 1160(b)(7)(A), 1185(a)(3), (4), 1325(b), (c);
18 U.S.C. §§ 1015, 1028, 1425-1427, 1546".
The Commentary to §2L2.1 captioned "Application Note" is amended by deleting "Note" and
inserting in lieu thereof "Notes"; and by inserting the following additional note:
"2. Where it is established that multiple documents are part of a set intended for use
by a single person, treat the set as one document.".
The title of §2L2.2 is amended by deleting "Evidence of Citizenship or Documents Authorizing
Entry for Own Use" and inserting in lieu thereof "Documents Relating to Naturalization,
Citizenship, or Legal Resident Status for Own Use; False Personation or Fraudulent Marriage
by Alien to Evade Immigration Law".
The Commentary to §2L2.2 captioned "Statutory Provisions" is amended by deleting "18
U.S.C. §§ 1423, 1425, 1546. For additional statutory provision(s), see Appendix A (Statutory
Index)" and inserting in lieu thereof "8 U.S.C. §§ 1160(b)(7)(A), 1185(a)(3), (5), 1325(b), (c);
18 U.S.C. §§ 911, 1015, 1028, 1423-1426, 1546".
Section 2L2.3(b) is amended by deleting "Characteristic" and inserting in lieu thereof
"Characteristics"; and by inserting the following additional specific offense characteristic:
"(2) If the offense involved six or more passports, increase as follows:
Number of
Passports Increase in Level
(A) 6-24 add 2
(B) 25-99 add 4
(C) 100 or more add 6.".
Reason for Amendment: Prior to this amendment, §2L1.1 provided the same offense level
for a defendant who smuggles, transports, or harbors 1, 5, 25, 50, or any number of unlawful
aliens. The inclusion of specific offense characteristic (b)(2) in §2L1.1 in the guidelines as
initially promulgated in April 1987 was intended to conform the guidelines to the offense level
indicated by past practices data for "ongoing criminal conduct." However, further study has
convinced the Commission that the specific offense characteristic "prior conviction for the same
or similar offense" is not a good proxy for such conduct. Moreover, the inclusion of a prior
criminal record variable in the offense guideline is inconsistent with the general treatment of
prior record as a separate dimension in the guidelines.
Amendment 450 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003
– 328 –
This amendment addresses these issues by providing an enhancement in the guideline for the
number of aliens smuggled, transported, or harbored as a more direct measure of the scope of
the offense. Consistent with the Commission’s general approach throughout the guidelines, the
offense level increases gradually with the number of aliens. It should be noted that §3B1.1
(Aggravating Role) generally provides an additional increase of 2, 3, or 4 levels for organizers,
managers, and supervisors in large-scale cases. The enhancement in this amendment pertaining
to the number of aliens is designed to work in conjunction with the operation of the role
enhancements from §3B1.1. Sections 2L2.1 and 2L2.3 are amended to follow the same
structure.
In addition, this amendment expands the titles of §§2L2.1 and 2L2.2, and the statutory
provisions to these sections, to include additional statutes appropriately covered by these
guidelines.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1992.
451. Amendment: Section 2N2.1 is amended by inserting the following additional subsection:
"(b) Cross References
(1) If the offense involved fraud, apply §2F1.1 (Fraud and Deceit).
(2) If the offense was committed in furtherance of, or to conceal, an offense
covered by another offense guideline, apply that other offense guideline
if the resulting offense level is greater than that determined above.".
The Commentary to §2N2.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by deleting Note 2 as
follows:
"2. If the offense involved theft, fraud, bribery, revealing trade secrets, or destruction
of property, apply the guideline applicable to the underlying conduct, rather than
this guideline.",
and inserting in lieu thereof:
"2. The cross reference at subsection (b)(1) addresses cases in which the offense
involved fraud. The cross reference at subsection (b)(2) addresses cases in which
the offense was committed in furtherance of, or to conceal, an offense covered by
another offense guideline (e.g., theft, bribery, revealing trade secrets, or
destruction of property).".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment inserts cross references to cover cases more
appropriately addressed by other offense guidelines. Previously, a similar instruction
addressing such cases was contained in the commentary to this section.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1992.
452. Amendment: Section 2Q2.1(b)(1) is amended by deleting "involved a commercial purpose"
and inserting in lieu thereof "(A) was committed for pecuniary gain or otherwise involved a
commercial purpose; or (B) involved a pattern of similar violations".
Section 2Q2.1(b)(2) is amended by deleting:
November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment 452
– 329 –
"involved fish, wildlife, or plants that were not quarantined as required by law",
and inserting in lieu thereof:
"(A) involved fish, wildlife, or plants that were not quarantined as required by law; or (B)
otherwise created a significant risk of infestation or disease transmission potentially
harmful to humans, fish, wildlife, or plants".
Section 2Q2.1(b)(3)(B) is amended by deleting:
"a quantity of fish, wildlife, or plants that was substantial in relation either to the overall
population of the species or to a discrete subpopulation",
and inserting in lieu thereof:
"(i) marine mammals that are listed as depleted under the Marine Mammal Protection Act
(as set forth in 50 C.F.R. § 216.15); (ii) fish, wildlife, or plants that are listed as
endangered or threatened by the Endangered Species Act (as set forth in 50 C.F.R. Part
17); or (iii) fish, wildlife, or plants that are listed in Appendix I to the Convention on
International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna or Flora (as set forth in 50
C.F.R. Part 23)".
The Commentary to §2Q2.1 is amended by inserting, immediately before "Background", the
following:
"Application Notes:
1. ‘For pecuniary gain’ means for receipt of, or in anticipation of receipt of,
anything of value, whether monetary or in goods or services. Thus, offenses
committed for pecuniary gain include both monetary and barter transactions.
Similarly, activities designed to increase gross revenue are considered to be
committed for pecuniary gain.
2. The acquisition of fish, wildlife, or plants for display to the public, whether for
a fee or donation and whether by an individual or an organization, including a
governmental entity, a private non-profit organization, or a private for-profit
organization, shall be considered to involve a ‘commercial purpose.’
3. For purposes of subsection (b)(2), the quarantine requirements include those set
forth in 9 C.F.R. Part 92, and 7 C.F.R. Chapter III. State quarantine laws are
included as well.
4. When information is reasonably available, ‘market value’ under subsection
(b)(3)(A) shall be based on the fair-market retail price. Where the fair-market
retail price is difficult to ascertain, the court may make a reasonable estimate
using any reliable information, such as the reasonable replacement or restitution
cost or the acquisition and preservation (e.g., taxidermy) cost. Market value,
however, shall not be based on measurement of aesthetic loss (so called
‘contingent valuation’ methods).
5. If the offense involved the destruction of a substantial quantity of fish, wildlife,
or plants, and the seriousness of the offense is not adequately measured by the
market value, an upward departure may be warranted.".
Amendment 452 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003
– 330 –
The Commentary to §2Q2.1 captioned "Background" is amended by deleting the last two
sentences as follows:
"Enhancements are provided where the offense involved a commercial purpose, and
where the fish, wildlife, or plants were not quarantined as required by law. An additional
enhancement is provided where the market value of the species exceeded $2,000 or the
offense involved a quantity of fish, wildlife, or plants that was substantial in relation
either to the population of the species or to a discrete subpopulation of the species.".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment is designed to strengthen the deterrent effect of the
sanctions for violations covered by this guideline. The amendment expands the specific offense
characteristic in subsection (b)(1) to cover categories of offenses that appear to be equally
serious to those committed for a commercial purpose. In addition, the amendment expands the
specific offense characteristic in subsection (b)(2) to cover other comparable types of risk of
harm. Furthermore, the amendment modifies the specific offense characteristic in subsection
(b)(3) to better encompass the types of cases that the Commission intended to cover.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1992.
453. Amendment: The Introductory Commentary to Chapter Two, Part T, Subpart 3, is amended
by deleting "This part" and inserting in lieu thereof "This Subpart"; by deleting:
". These guidelines are primarily aimed at revenue collection or trade regulation. They
are",
and inserting in lieu thereof:
", and is designed to address violations involving revenue collection or trade regulation.
It is";
by deleting "legislation generally applies" and inserting in lieu thereof "criminal statutes apply";
and by deleting:
"or for imposing a sentence above that specified in these guidelines",
and inserting in lieu thereof:
"if applicable, or for imposing a sentence above that specified in the guideline in this
Subpart".
Section 2T3.1 is amended in the title by inserting at the end "; Receiving or Trafficking in
Smuggled Property".
Section 2T3.1 is amended by inserting the following additional subsection:
"(c) Cross Reference
(1) If the offense involves a contraband item covered by another offense
guideline, apply that offense guideline if the resulting offense level is
greater than that determined above.".
The Commentary to §2T3.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in the third sentence of
Note 2 by deleting "the court should impose a sentence above the guideline" and inserting in
lieu thereof "an upward departure may be warranted".
November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment 453
– 331 –
Section 2T3.2, including accompanying commentary, is deleted as follows:
"§2T3.2. Receiving or Trafficking in Smuggled Property
(a) Base Offense Level:
(1) The level from §2T4.1 (Tax Table) corresponding to the
tax loss, if the tax loss exceeded $1,000; or
(2) 5, if the tax loss exceeded $100 but did not exceed
$1,000; or
(3) 4, if the tax loss did not exceed $100.
For purposes of this guideline, the ‘tax loss’ is the amount of the
duty.
(b) Specific Offense Characteristic
(1) If sophisticated means were used to impede discovery of
the nature or existence of the offense, increase by 2
levels.
Commentary
Statutory Provision: 18 U.S.C. § 545. For additional statutory provision(s), see
Appendix A (Statutory Index).
Application Note:
1. Particular attention should be given to those items for which entry is prohibited,
limited, or restricted. Especially when such items are harmful or protective
quotas are in effect, the duties evaded on such items may not adequately reflect
the harm to society or protected industries resulting from their importation. In
such instances, the court should impose a sentence above the guideline. A
sentence based upon an alternative measure of the ‘duty’ evaded, such as the
increase in market value due to importation, or 25 percent of the items’ fair
market value in the United States if the increase in market value due to
importation is not readily ascertainable, might be considered.".
Section 8C2.1(a) is amended by deleting ", 2T3.2" immediately following "2T3.1".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment inserts a cross reference in §2T3.1 to cover cases
more appropriately addressed by other offense guidelines. Previously, a similar instruction was
set forth in the Introductory Commentary to this part. In addition, this amendment consolidates
§§2T3.1 and 2T3.2 into one guideline as each contains the same offense levels and adjustments.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1992.
454. Amendment: The Commentary to §3A1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note
1 by inserting the following additional sentence at the end:
"Similarly, for example, a bank teller is not an unusually vulnerable victim solely by
Amendment 453 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003
– 332 –
virtue of the teller’s position in a bank.".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment clarifies the circumstances in which the vulnerable
victim adjustment is intended to be applied.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1992.
455. Amendment: Section 3A1.2(a) is amended by deleting:
"a law enforcement or corrections officer; a former law enforcement or corrections
officer; an officer or employee included in 18 U.S.C. § 1114; a former officer or
employee included in 18 U.S.C. § 1114",
and inserting in lieu thereof:
"a government officer or employee; a former government officer or employee".
The Commentary to §3A1.2 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 2 by deleting:
"are not expressly covered by this section. The court should make an upward departure
of at least three levels in those unusual cases in which such persons are victims",
and inserting in lieu thereof:
"although covered by this section, do not represent the heartland of the conduct covered.
An upward departure to reflect the potential disruption of the governmental function in
such cases typically would be warranted".
The Commentary to §3A1.2 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 4 by deleting
"law enforcement or corrections officer or other person covered under 18 U.S.C. § 1114" and
inserting in lieu thereof "government officer or employee"; and by inserting the following
additional sentence at the end:
"This adjustment also would not apply in the case of a robbery of a postal employee
because the offense guideline for robbery contains an enhancement (§2B3.1(a)) that takes
such conduct into account.".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment expands the coverage of this guideline to apply in
the case of any government officer or employee, former government officer or employee, or a
member of the immediate family of any of the above, who is targeted because of the official
conduct or position of that officer or employee.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1992.
456. Amendment: The Introductory Commentary to Chapter Three, Part B is amended by deleting
the third sentence of the first paragraph as follows:
"However, where the defendant has received mitigation by virtue of being convicted of
an offense significantly less serious than his actual criminal conduct, e.g., the defendant
is convicted of unlawful possession of a controlled substance but his actual conduct
involved drug trafficking, a further reduction in the offense level under §3B1.2
(Mitigating Role) ordinarily is not warranted because the defendant is not substantially
less culpable than a defendant whose only conduct involved the less serious offense.".
November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment 457
– 333 –
The Commentary to §3B1.2 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by inserting the
following additional note:
"4. If a defendant has received a lower offense level by virtue of being convicted of
an offense significantly less serious than warranted by his actual criminal
conduct, a reduction for a mitigating role under this section ordinarily is not
warranted because such defendant is not substantially less culpable than a
defendant whose only conduct involved the less serious offense. For example,
if a defendant whose actual conduct involved a minimal role in the distribution
of 25 grams of cocaine (an offense having a Chapter Two offense level of 14
under §2D1.1) is convicted of simple possession of cocaine (an offense having
a Chapter Two offense level of 6 under §2D2.1), no reduction for a mitigating
role is warranted because the defendant is not substantially less culpable than a
defendant whose only conduct involved the simple possession of cocaine.".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment clarifies a situation in which a defendant is not
ordinarily eligible for a reduction under §3B1.2 (Mitigating Role) and moves the discussion of
this issue from the Introductory Commentary of Chapter Three, Part B, to the Commentary of
§3B1.2, where it more appropriately belongs.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1992.
457. Amendment: The Commentary to §3C1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by
inserting the following additional note:
"7. Under this section, the defendant is accountable for his own conduct and for
conduct that he aided or abetted, counseled, commanded, induced, procured, or
willfully caused.".
The Commentary to §3C1.2 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by inserting the
following additional notes:
"5. Under this section, the defendant is accountable for his own conduct and for
conduct that he aided or abetted, counseled, commanded, induced, procured, or
willfully caused.
6. If death or bodily injury results or the conduct posed a substantial risk of death
or bodily injury to more than one person, an upward departure may be warranted.
See Chapter Five, Part K (Departures).".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment clarifies the scope of the conduct for which the
defendant is accountable under §§3C1.1 and 3C1.2. In addition, this amendment adds an
application note to the Commentary of §3C1.2 that describes circumstances in which an upward
departure may be warranted.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1992.
458. Amendment: Section 3D1.2(d) is amended in the second paragraph by inserting "§§2L1.1,
2L2.1, 2L2.3;" in the appropriate place by section; by inserting "§2Q2.1" in the appropriate
place by section; and by deleting ", 2T3.2" immediately following "2T3.1".
Section 3D1.2(d) is amended in the third paragraph by deleting "§§2L1.1, 2L2.1, 2L2.2, 2L2.3"
Amendment 457 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003
– 334 –
and inserting in lieu thereof "2L2.2".
The Commentary to §3D1.2 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 3 by deleting
example 7 as follows:
"(7) The defendant is convicted of two counts, each for unlawfully bringing one alien
into the United States, but on different occasions. The counts are not to be grouped
together.".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment revises §3D1.2(d) to reflect amendments to
§§2L1.1, 2L2.1, and 2L2.3 (amendment 450); to clarify that offenses under §2Q2.1 are to be
grouped under this subsection; and to delete the reference to §2T3.2 made obsolete by the
deletion of that guideline (amendment 453).
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1992.
459. Amendment: Section 3E1.1 is amended by deleting:
"(a) If the defendant clearly demonstrates a recognition and affirmative acceptance of
personal responsibility for his criminal conduct, reduce the offense level by
2 levels.
(b) A defendant may be given consideration under this section without regard to
whether his conviction is based upon a guilty plea or a finding of guilt by the
court or jury or the practical certainty of conviction at trial.
(c) A defendant who enters a guilty plea is not entitled to a sentencing reduction
under this section as a matter of right.",
and inserting in lieu thereof:
"(a) If the defendant clearly demonstrates acceptance of responsibility for his offense,
decrease the offense level by 2 levels.
(b) If the defendant qualifies for a decrease under subsection (a), the offense level
determined prior to the operation of subsection (a) is level 16 or greater, and the
defendant has assisted authorities in the investigation or prosecution of his own
misconduct by taking one or more of the following steps:
(1) timely providing complete information to the government concerning his
own involvement in the offense; or
(2) timely notifying authorities of his intention to enter a plea of guilty,
thereby permitting the government to avoid preparing for trial and
permitting the court to allocate its resources efficiently,
decrease the offense level by 1 additional level.".
The Commentary to §3E1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 1 by deleting
"for this provision" and inserting in lieu thereof "under subsection (a)"; by deleting subdivision
(c) as follows:
"(c) voluntary and truthful admission to authorities of involvement in the offense and
related conduct;";
November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment 459
– 335 –
by redesignating subdivisions (a) and (b) as subdivisions (b) and (c), respectively; by inserting
the following as subdivision (a):
"(a) truthfully admitting the conduct comprising the offense(s) of conviction, and
truthfully admitting or not falsely denying any additional relevant conduct for
which the defendant is accountable under §1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct). Note that
a defendant is not required to volunteer, or affirmatively admit, relevant conduct
beyond the offense of conviction in order to obtain a reduction under subsection
(a). A defendant may remain silent in respect to relevant conduct beyond the
offense of conviction without affecting his ability to obtain a reduction under this
subsection. However, a defendant who falsely denies, or frivolously contests,
relevant conduct that the court determines to be true has acted in a manner
inconsistent with acceptance of responsibility;";
in subdivision (f) by deleting "and" immediately following "offense;";
by redesignating subdivision (g) as subdivision (h); and by inserting the following as
subdivision (g):
"(g) post-offense rehabilitative efforts (e.g., counseling or drug treatment); and".
The Commentary to §3E1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by deleting Note 3 as
follows:
"3. Entry of a plea of guilty prior to the commencement of trial combined with
truthful admission of involvement in the offense and related conduct will
constitute significant evidence of acceptance of responsibility for the purposes of
this section. However, this evidence may be outweighed by conduct of the
defendant that is inconsistent with such acceptance of responsibility.",
and by inserting in lieu thereof:
"3. Entry of a plea of guilty prior to the commencement of trial combined with
truthfully admitting the conduct comprising the offense of conviction, and
truthfully admitting or not falsely denying any additional relevant conduct for
which he is accountable under §1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct) (see Application Note
1(a)), will constitute significant evidence of acceptance of responsibility for the
purposes of subsection (a). However, this evidence may be outweighed by
conduct of the defendant that is inconsistent with such acceptance of
responsibility. A defendant who enters a guilty plea is not entitled to an
adjustment under this section as a matter of right.".
The Commentary to §3E1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by inserting the
following additional note:
"6. Subsection (a) provides a 2-level decrease in offense level. Subsection (b)
provides an additional 1-level decrease in offense level for a defendant at offense
level 16 or greater prior to the operation of subsection (a) who both qualifies for
a decrease under subsection (a) and who has assisted authorities in the
investigation or prosecution of his own misconduct by taking one or both of the
steps set forth in subsection (b). The timeliness of the defendant’s acceptance of
responsibility is a consideration under both subsections, and is context specific.
In general, the conduct qualifying for a decrease in offense level under subsection
(b)(1) or (2) will occur particularly early in the case. For example, to qualify
Amendment 459 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003
– 336 –
under subsection (b)(2), the defendant must have notified authorities of his
intention to enter a plea of guilty at a sufficiently early point in the process so that
the government may avoid preparing for trial and the court may schedule its
calendar efficiently.".
The Commentary to §3E1.1 captioned "Background" is amended by deleting "a recognition and
affirmative acceptance of personal responsibility for the offense and related conduct" and
inserting in lieu thereof "acceptance of responsibility for his offense"; and by inserting the
following additional paragraph at the end:
" Subsection (a) provides a 2-level decrease in offense level. Subsection (b)
provides an additional 1-level decrease for a defendant at offense level 16 or greater prior
to operation of subsection (a) who both qualifies for a decrease under subsection (a) and
has assisted authorities in the investigation or prosecution of his own misconduct by
taking one or more of the steps specified in subsection (b). Such a defendant has
accepted responsibility in a way that ensures the certainty of his just punishment in a
timely manner, thereby appropriately meriting an additional reduction. Subsection (b)
does not apply, however, to a defendant whose offense level is level 15 or lower prior to
application of subsection (a). At offense level 15 or lower, the reduction in the guideline
range provided by a 2-level decrease in offense level under subsection (a) (which is a
greater proportional reduction in the guideline range than at higher offense levels due to
the structure of the Sentencing Table) is adequate for the court to take into account the
factors set forth in subsection (b) within the applicable guideline range.".
Section 4B1.1 is amended in the last sentence by deleting "2-levels" and inserting in lieu thereof
"the number of levels corresponding to that adjustment".
Section 4B1.4(b) is amended by deleting the last sentence as follows:
"*If §3E1.1 (Acceptance of Responsibility) applies, reduce by 2 levels.",
and inserting in lieu thereof:
"*If an adjustment from §3E1.1 (Acceptance of Responsibility) applies, decrease the
offense level by the number of levels corresponding to that adjustment.".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment provides an additional reduction of one level for
certain defendants whose acceptance of responsibility includes assistance to the government
in the investigation or prosecution of their own misconduct. In addition, it replaces the term
"offense and related conduct" with the term "offense" and provides guidance as to the meaning
of this term in the context of this guideline.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1992.
460. Amendment: Section 4A1.3 is amended in the fourth paragraph by deleting "a Category IV
criminal history" wherever it appears and inserting in lieu thereof in each instance "Criminal
History Category IV"; and by deleting:
"The Commission contemplates that there may, on occasion, be a case of an egregious,
serious criminal record in which even the guideline range for a Category VI criminal
history is not adequate to reflect the seriousness of the defendant’s criminal history. In
such a case, a decision above the guideline range for a defendant with a Category VI
criminal history may be warranted. However, this provision is not symmetrical. The
lower limit of the range for a Category I criminal history is set for a first offender with
November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment 462
– 337 –
the lowest risk of recidivism. Therefore, a departure below the lower limit of the
guideline range for a Category I criminal history on the basis of the adequacy of criminal
history cannot be appropriate.",
and inserting in lieu thereof:
"The Commission contemplates that there may, on occasion, be a case of an egregious,
serious criminal record in which even the guideline range for Criminal History Category
VI is not adequate to reflect the seriousness of the defendant’s criminal history. In such
a case, a departure above the guideline range for a defendant with Criminal History
Category VI may be warranted. In determining whether an upward departure from
Criminal History Category VI is warranted, the court should consider that the nature of
the prior offenses rather than simply their number is often more indicative of the
seriousness of the defendant’s criminal record. For example, a defendant with five prior
sentences for very large-scale fraud offenses may have 15 criminal history points, within
the range of points typical for Criminal History Category VI, yet have a substantially
more serious criminal history overall because of the nature of the prior offenses. On the
other hand, a defendant with nine prior 60-day jail sentences for offenses such as petty
larceny, prostitution, or possession of gambling slips has a higher number of criminal
history points (18 points) than the typical Criminal History Category VI defendant, but
not necessarily a more serious criminal history overall. Where the court determines that
the extent and nature of the defendant’s criminal history, taken together, are sufficient
to warrant an upward departure from Criminal History Category VI, the court should
structure the departure by moving incrementally down the sentencing table to the next
higher offense level in Criminal History Category VI until it finds a guideline range
appropriate to the case.
However, this provision is not symmetrical. The lower limit of the range for Criminal
History Category I is set for a first offender with the lowest risk of recidivism.
Therefore, a departure below the lower limit of the guideline range for Criminal History
Category I on the basis of the adequacy of criminal history cannot be appropriate.".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment provides additional guidance concerning upward
departure from Criminal History Category VI on the basis of adequacy of criminal history
category, and makes minor editorial changes.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1992.
461. Amendment: Section 4B1.2(3) is amended by deleting the last sentence as follows:
"The date that a defendant sustained a conviction shall be the date the judgment of
conviction was entered.",
and inserting in lieu thereof:
"The date that a defendant sustained a conviction shall be the date that the guilt of the
defendant has been established, whether by guilty plea, trial, or plea of nolo contendere.".
The Commentary to §4B1.2 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by deleting the text of
Note 2 as follows:
"‘Crime of violence’ includes murder, manslaughter, kidnapping, aggravated assault,
forcible sex offenses, robbery, arson, extortion, extortionate extension of credit, and
burglary of a dwelling. Other offenses are included where (A) that offense has as an
Amendment 461 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003
– 338 –
element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of
another, or (B) the conduct set forth (i.e., expressly charged) in the count of which the
defendant was convicted involved use of explosives (including any explosive material
or destructive device) or, by its nature, presented a serious potential risk of physical
injury to another. Under this section, the conduct of which the defendant was convicted
is the focus of inquiry.
The term ‘crime of violence’ does not include the offense of unlawful possession of a
firearm by a felon. Where the instant offense is the unlawful possession of a firearm by
a felon, the specific offense characteristics of §2K2.1 (Unlawful Receipt, Possession, or
Transportation of Firearms or Ammunition; Prohibited Transactions Involving Firearms
or Ammunition) provide an increase in offense level if the defendant has one or more
prior felony convictions for a crime of violence or controlled substance offense; and, if
the defendant is sentenced under the provisions of 18 U.S.C. § 924(e), §4B1.4 (Armed
Career Criminal) will apply.",
and inserting in lieu thereof:
"‘Crime of violence’ includes murder, manslaughter, kidnapping, aggravated assault,
forcible sex offenses, robbery, arson, extortion, extortionate extension of credit, and
burglary of a dwelling. Other offenses are included where (A) that offense has as an
element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of
another, or (B) the conduct set forth (i.e., expressly charged) in the count of which the

crime of violence or controlled substance offense; and, if the defendant is sentenced
under the provisions of 18 U.S.C. § 924(e), §4B1.4 (Armed Career Criminal) will
apply.".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment conforms the definition of "sustaining a
conviction" in §4B1.2 to the definition of "convicted of an offense" in §4A1.2. In addition, this
amendment ratifies a previous amendment to the commentary to §4B1.2 (amendment 433,
effective November 1, 1991) and corrects a clerical error in a reference in that commentary to
§2K2.1. The previous amendment to the text of Application Note 2 clarified that application
of §4B1.2 is governed by the offense of conviction, and that the offense of being a felon in
possession of a firearm is not a crime of violence within the meaning of this guideline. As a
clarifying and conforming change, the previous commentary amendment reflected Commission
intent that the term "crime of violence," as that term is used in §§4B1.1 and 4B1.2, be
interpreted consistently with that term as used in other provisions of the Guidelines Manual.
For example, §4B1.4, as promulgated by amendment 355, effective November 1, 1990,
provides an increased offense level for a "felon-in-possession" defendant who is subject to an
enhanced sentence under 18 U.S.C. § 924(e) and who used or possessed the firearm in
connection with a crime of violence (§4B1.4(b)(3)(A)). This action to ratify a previous
commentary amendment was taken because of concerns raised by United States v. Stinson, 957
November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment 462
– 339 –
F.2d 813 (11th Cir. 1992), in which the court stated it would not follow amendment 433
because the commentary amendment was not submitted to Congress.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1992.
462. Amendment: Chapter Five, Part A, is amended in the Sentencing Table at Offense Level 7,
Criminal History Category I, by deleting "1-7" and inserting in lieu thereof "0-6"; and at
Offense Level 8, Criminal History Category I, by deleting "2-8" and inserting in lieu thereof
"0-6".
Chapter Five, Part A is amended in the Sentencing Table by designating four zones as follows:
Zone A (containing all guideline ranges having a minimum of zero months); Zone B
(containing all guideline ranges having a minimum of at least one but not more than six
months); Zone C (containing all guideline ranges having a minimum of eight, nine, or ten
months); and Zone D (containing all guideline ranges having a minimum of twelve months or
more).
Section 5B1.1 is amended by deleting:
"(a) Subject to the statutory restrictions in subsection (b) below, sentence of probation
is authorized:
(1) if the minimum term of imprisonment in the range specified by the
Sentencing Table in Part A, is zero months;
(2) if the minimum term of imprisonment specified by the Sentencing Table
is at least one but not more than six months, provided that the court
imposes a condition or combination of conditions requiring intermittent
confinement, community confinement, or home detention as provided in
§5C1.1(c)(2) (Imposition of a Term of Imprisonment).",
and inserting in lieu thereof:
"(a) Subject to the statutory restrictions in subsection (b) below, a sentence of
probation is authorized if:

(2) the applicable guideline range is in Zone B of the Sentencing Table and
the court imposes a condition or combination of conditions requiring
intermittent confinement, community confinement, or home detention as
provided in subsection (c)(3) of §5C1.1 (Imposition of a Term of
Imprisonment).".
The Commentary to §5B1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 1 by deleting:
"(a) Where the minimum term of imprisonment specified in the guideline range from
the Sentencing Table is zero months. In such case, a condition requiring a period
of community confinement, home detention, or intermittent confinement may be
imposed but is not required.
(b) Where the minimum term of imprisonment specified in the guideline range from

the minimum term of imprisonment specified in the applicable guideline range is eight
months or more)".
The Commentary to §5B1.1 captioned "Background" is amended by deleting "1st Sess. 89).
Subsection" and inserting in lieu thereof "1st Sess. 89 (1983)). Section".
Section 5C1.1(a) is amended by inserting "applicable" immediately before "guideline range".
Section 5C1.1(b) is amended by deleting "minimum term of imprisonment in the applicable
guideline range in the Sentencing Table is zero months" and inserting in lieu thereof "applicable
guideline range is in Zone A of the Sentencing Table".
Sections 5C1.1 is amended by deleting:
"(c) If the minimum term of imprisonment in the applicable guideline range in the
Sentencing Table is at least one but not more than six months, the minimum term
may be satisfied by (1) a sentence of imprisonment; (2) a sentence of probation
that includes a condition or combination of conditions that substitute intermittent
confinement, community confinement, or home detention for imprisonment
according to the schedule in §5C1.1(e); or (3) a sentence of imprisonment that
includes a term of supervised release with a condition that substitutes community
confinement or home detention according to the schedule in §5C1.1(e), provided
that at least one-half of the minimum term, but in no event less than one month,
is satisfied by imprisonment.
(d) If the minimum term of imprisonment in the applicable guideline range in the

Section 5C1.1 is amended by deleting:
"(f) If the minimum term of imprisonment in the applicable guideline range in the
Sentencing Table is more than ten months, the guidelines require that the

the first sentence as follows:
"Subsection 5C1.1(a) provides that a sentence conforms with the guidelines for
imprisonment if it is within the minimum and maximum terms of the guideline range

Sentencing Table (i.e., the minimum term of imprisonment specified in the applicable
guideline range is zero months)";
and by deleting "may, for example," and inserting in lieu thereof ", for example, may".
The Commentary to §5C1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 3 by deleting:
"Subsection 5C1.1(c) provides that where the minimum term of imprisonment specified

imprisonment substitutes in subsection (e).".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment expands the number of categories in the Sentencing
Table in Criminal History Category I in which the court has discretion to impose a sentence
without imprisonment or confinement conditions. In addition, it removes the requirement that
a "split sentence" include a term of imprisonment of at least one-half of the minimum of the
guideline range for less serious categories of offenses and offenders and substitutes a
requirement that such term of imprisonment be at least one month. Finally, this amendment
reformats these sections to make their operation clearer.

465. Amendment: Section 5G1.3 is amended by deleting subsection (b) as follows:
"(b) If subsection (a) does not apply, and the undischarged term of imprisonment
resulted from offense(s) that constituted part of the same course of conduct as the
instant offense and have been fully taken into account in the determination of the
offense level for the instant offense, or if the prior undischarged term of
imprisonment resulted from a federal offense and was imposed pursuant to the
Sentencing Reform Act, the sentence for the instant offense shall be imposed to
result in a combined sentence equal to the total punishment that would have been
imposed under §5G1.2 (Sentencing on Multiple Counts of Conviction) had all the
sentences been imposed at the same time.",
and inserting in lieu thereof:
"(b) If subsection (a) does not apply, and the undischarged term of imprisonment
resulted from offense(s) that have been fully taken into account in the
determination of the offense level for the instant offense, the sentence for the
instant offense shall be imposed to run concurrently to the undischarged term of
imprisonment.".
Section 5G1.3(c) is amended by inserting "(Policy Statement)" immediately before "In"; and
by deleting "unexpired" and inserting in lieu thereof "undischarged".
The Commentary to §5G1.3 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by deleting Notes 2-4
as follows:
"2. Subsection (b) (which applies only if subsection (a) does not apply), applies in
two situations. First, it applies if the sentence resulting in the undischarged term
of imprisonment was a federal sentence imposed pursuant to the Sentencing
Reform Act. In such cases, the court shall fashion a sentence equal to the total
punishment that would have been imposed had both sentences been imposed at
the same time. Second, it applies if the conduct resulting in the undischarged
term of imprisonment was part of the same course of conduct as the instant
offense and has been fully taken into account in determining the offense level for
the instant offense (e.g., where a defendant is prosecuted in both federal and state
November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment 465
– 345 –
court for the same criminal conduct; or where a defendant is prosecuted in federal
and state court for different criminal transactions that are part of the same course
of conduct, such as two drug sales, but the conduct underlying both transactions
is fully taken into account under §1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct) in determining the
offense level for the instant offense).
3. When a sentence is imposed pursuant to subsection (b), the court should adjust
for any term of imprisonment already served as a result of the conduct taken into
account in determining the instant sentence (e.g., if the appropriate total
punishment determined under this subsection for all offenses is 30 months and
the defendant has already served 10 months of the prior undischarged term of
imprisonment, the court should impose a sentence of 20 months concurrent with
the prior undischarged term).
4. Where the defendant is serving an unexpired term of imprisonment in
circumstances other than those set forth in subsections (a) or (b), the court shall
impose a consecutive sentence to the extent necessary to fashion a sentence
resulting in incremental punishment for the multiple offenses. To the extent
practicable, the court shall impose a sentence for the instant offense that results
in a combined sentence that approximates the total punishment that would have
been imposed under §5G1.2 (Sentencing on Multiple Counts of Conviction) had
all of the offenses been federal offenses for which sentences were being imposed
at the same time. Where the defendant is serving a term of imprisonment for a
state offense, the information available may permit only a rough estimate of the
total punishment that would have been imposed under the guidelines. It is not
intended that the above methodology be applied in a manner that unduly
complicates or prolongs the sentencing process. In fashioning an appropriate
incremental punishment, the court should consider whether the offense was
committed while the defendant was on bail or other release status from another
offense. In such cases, a reasonable incremental penalty appropriately would
include an additional enhancement equivalent to that provided in §2J1.7
(Commission of Offense While on Release).",
and inserting in lieu thereof:
"2. Subsection (b) (which may apply only if subsection (a) does not apply), addresses
cases in which the conduct resulting in the undischarged term of imprisonment
has been fully taken into account under §1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct) in
determining the offense level for the instant offense. This can occur, for
example, where a defendant is prosecuted in both federal and state court, or in
two or more federal jurisdictions, for the same criminal conduct or for different
criminal transactions that were part of the same course of conduct.
When a sentence is imposed pursuant to subsection (b), the court should adjust
for any term of imprisonment already served as a result of the conduct taken into
account in determining the sentence for the instant offense. Example: The
defendant has been convicted of a federal offense charging the sale of 40 grams
of cocaine. Under §1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct), the defendant is held accountable
for the sale of an additional 15 grams of cocaine that is part of the same course
of conduct for which the defendant has been convicted and sentenced in state
court (the defendant received a nine-month sentence of imprisonment, of which
he has served six months at the time of sentencing on the instant federal offense).
The guideline range applicable to the defendant is 10-16 months (Chapter Two
offense level of 14 for sale of 55 grams of cocaine; 2-level reduction for
Amendment 465 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003
– 346 –
acceptance of responsibility; final offense level of 12; Criminal History Category
I). The court determines that a sentence of 13 months provides the appropriate
total punishment. Because the defendant has already served six months on the
related state charge, a sentence of seven months, imposed to run concurrently
with the remainder of the defendant’s state sentence, achieves this result. For
clarity, the court should note on the Judgment in a Criminal Case Order that the
sentence imposed is not a departure from the guidelines because the defendant
has been credited for guideline purposes under §5G1.3(b) with six months served
in state custody.
3. Where the defendant is subject to an undischarged term of imprisonment in
circumstances other than those set forth in subsections (a) or (b), subsection (c)
applies and the court shall impose a consecutive sentence to the extent necessary
to fashion a sentence resulting in a reasonable incremental punishment for the
multiple offenses. In some circumstances, such incremental punishment can be
achieved by the imposition of a sentence that is concurrent with the remainder of
the unexpired term of imprisonment. In such cases, a consecutive sentence is not
required. To the extent practicable, the court should consider a reasonable
incremental penalty to be a sentence for the instant offense that results in a
combined sentence of imprisonment that approximates the total punishment that
would have been imposed under §5G1.2 (Sentencing on Multiple Counts of
Conviction) had all of the offenses been federal offenses for which sentences
were being imposed at the same time. It is recognized that this determination
frequently will require an approximation. Where the defendant is serving a term
of imprisonment for a state offense, the information available may permit only
a rough estimate of the total punishment that would have been imposed under the
guidelines. Where the offense resulting in the undischarged term of
imprisonment is a federal offense for which a guideline determination has
previously been made, the task will be somewhat more straightforward, although
even in such cases a precise determination may not be possible.
It is not intended that the above methodology be applied in a manner that unduly
complicates or prolongs the sentencing process. Additionally, this methodology
does not, itself, require the court to depart from the guideline range established
for the instant federal offense. Rather, this methodology is meant to assist the
court in determining the appropriate sentence (e.g., the appropriate point within
the applicable guideline range, whether to order the sentence to run concurrently
or consecutively to the undischarged term of imprisonment, or whether a
departure is warranted). Generally, the court may achieve an appropriate
sentence through its determination of an appropriate point within the applicable
guideline range for the instant federal offense, combined with its determination
of whether that sentence will run concurrently or consecutively to the
undischarged term of imprisonment.
Illustrations of the Application of Subsection (c):
(A) The guideline range applicable to the instant federal offense is 24-30
months. The court determines that a total punishment of 36 months’
imprisonment would appropriately reflect the instant federal offense and
the offense resulting in the undischarged term of imprisonment. The
undischarged term of imprisonment is an indeterminate sentence of
imprisonment with a 60-month maximum. At the time of sentencing on
the instant federal offense, the defendant has served ten months on the
undischarged term of imprisonment. In this case, a sentence of 26
November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment 468
– 347 –
months’ imprisonment to be served concurrently with the remainder of
the undischarged term of imprisonment would (1) be within the guideline
range for the instant federal offense, and (2) achieve an appropriate total
punishment (36 months).
(B) The applicable guideline range for the instant federal offense is 24-30
months. The court determines that a total punishment of 36 months’
imprisonment would appropriately reflect the instant federal offense and
the offense resulting in the undischarged term of imprisonment. The
undischarged term of imprisonment is a six-month determinate sentence.
At the time of sentencing on the instant federal offense, the defendant has
served three months on the undischarged term of imprisonment. In this
case, a sentence of 30 months’ imprisonment to be served consecutively
to the undischarged term of imprisonment would (1) be within the
guideline range for the instant federal offense, and (2) achieve an
appropriate total punishment (36 months).
(C) The applicable guideline range for the instant federal offense is 24-30
months. The court determines that a total punishment of 60 months’
imprisonment would appropriately reflect the instant federal offense and
the offense resulting in the undischarged term of imprisonment. The
undischarged term of imprisonment is a 12-month determinate sentence.
In this case, a sentence of 30 months’ imprisonment to be served
consecutively to the undischarged term of imprisonment would be the
greatest sentence imposable without departure for the instant federal
offense.
(D) The applicable guideline range for the instant federal offense is 24-30
months. The court determines that a total punishment of 36 months’
imprisonment would appropriately reflect the instant federal offense and
the offense resulting in the undischarged term of imprisonment. The
undischarged term of imprisonment is an indeterminate sentence with a
60-month maximum. At the time of sentencing on the instant federal
offense, the defendant has served 22 months on the undischarged term of
imprisonment. In this case, a sentence of 24 months to be served
concurrently with the remainder of the undischarged term of
imprisonment would be the lowest sentence imposable without departure
for the instant federal offense.".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment deletes the prong of §5G1.3(b) pertaining to the
sentencing of a defendant subject to an undischarged term of imprisonment previously imposed
pursuant to the Sentencing Reform Act because the Commission found a number of problems
in implementation. Cases previously addressed by this prong henceforth will be addressed by
subsection (c), which is designed to produce a similar result but requires less precise
calculations. Consistent with the structure of the Guidelines Manual, subsection (c) is expressly
designated a policy statement. In addition, this amendment provides additional commentary
explaining, and providing examples of, the operation of this section.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1992.
466. Amendment: Chapter 5, Part H is amended by inserting an additional policy statement as
§5H1.12 (Lack of Guidance as a Youth and Similar Circumstances (Policy Statement)).
Chapter 1, Part A, Subpart 4(b) is amended in the first paragraph by inserting "§5H1.12 (Lack

– 348 –
of Guidance as a Youth and Similar Circumstances)," immediately following "§5H1.10 (Race,
Sex, National Origin, Creed, Religion, and Socio-Economic Status),".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment provides that the factors specified are not
appropriate grounds for departure.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1992.
467. Amendment: Section 6B1.2(a) is amended by inserting "or the sentencing guidelines"
immediately following "statutory purposes of sentencing".
Section 6B1.2(a) is amended by inserting the following additional paragraph at the end:
"Provided, that a plea agreement that includes the dismissal of a charge or a plea
agreement not to pursue a potential charge shall not preclude the conduct underlying such
charge from being considered under the provisions of §1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct) in
connection with the count(s) of which the defendant is convicted.".
The Commentary to §6B1.2 is amended in the first paragraph by deleting:
"This section makes clear that a court may accept a plea agreement provided that the
judge complies with the obligations imposed by Rule 11(e), Fed. R. Crim. P. A judge",
and inserting in lieu thereof "The court".
The Commentary to §6B1.2 is amended in the second paragraph by deleting:
"will accept a recommended sentence or a plea agreement requiring imposition of a
specific sentence only if the court is satisfied either that the contemplated sentence is
within the guidelines or, if not, that the recommended sentence or agreement",
and inserting in lieu thereof:
"should accept a recommended sentence or a plea agreement requiring imposition of a
specific sentence only if the court is satisfied either that such sentence is an appropriate
sentence within the applicable guideline range or, if not, that the sentence".
The Commentary to §6B1.2 is amended by inserting the following additional paragraphs at the
end:
" A defendant who enters a plea of guilty in a timely manner will enhance the
likelihood of his receiving a reduction in offense level under §3E1.1 (Acceptance of
Responsibility). Further reduction in offense level (or sentence) due to a plea agreement
will tend to undermine the sentencing guidelines.
The second paragraph of subsection (a) provides that a plea agreement that
includes the dismissal of a charge, or a plea agreement not to pursue a potential charge,
shall not prevent the conduct underlying that charge from being considered under the
provisions of §1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct) in connection with the count(s) of which the
defendant is convicted. This paragraph prevents a plea agreement from restricting
consideration of conduct that is within the scope of §1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct) in respect
to the count(s) of which the defendant is convicted; it does not in any way expand or
modify the scope of §1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct).".
November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment 471
– 349 –
Reason for Amendment: This amendment clarifies that a plea agreement to dismiss a charge
or not to pursue a potential charge does not insulate the conduct underlying such charge from
the operation of §1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct) in respect to the count(s) of which the defendant
is convicted. In addition, this amendment makes clearer the Commission’s policy that plea
agreements should not undermine the sentencing guidelines.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1992.
468. Amendment: Appendix A (Statutory Index) is amended by deleting:

Reason for Amendment: This amendment makes the statutory index more comprehensive,
and conforms it to the amendments of the Chapter Two offense guidelines. In addition, it
corrects clerical errors and makes an editorial improvement.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1992.
469. Amendment: Section 1B1.10(d) is amended by deleting "and 380" and inserting in lieu thereof

Reason for Amendment: This amendment expands the listing in subsection (d) to implement
the directive in 28 U.S.C. § 994(u) in respect to guideline amendments that may be considered
for retroactive application.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1992.
470. Amendment: The Commentary to §2F1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note
7 in the first paragraph by inserting the following additional sentence as the second sentence:
"As in theft cases, loss is the value of the money, property, or services unlawfully taken;
it does not, for example, include interest the victim could have earned on such funds had
the offense not occurred.".
The Commentary to §2F1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 7(b) by deleting:
November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment
– 351 –
"In fraudulent loan application cases and contract procurement cases where the
defendant’s capabilities are fraudulently represented, the loss is the actual loss to the
victim (or if the loss has not yet come about, the expected loss). For example, if a
defendant fraudulently obtains a loan by misrepresenting the value of his assets, the loss
is the amount of the loan not repaid at the time the offense is discovered, reduced by the
amount the lending institution has recovered, or can expect to recover, from any assets
pledged to secure the loan.",
and inserting in lieu thereof:
"In fraudulent loan application cases and contract procurement cases, the loss is the
actual loss to the victim (or if the loss has not yet come about, the expected loss). For

assets, the loss is the amount of the loan not repaid at the time the offense is discovered,
reduced by the amount the lending institution has recovered (or can expect to recover)
from any assets pledged to secure the loan. However, where the intended loss is greater
than the actual loss, the intended loss is to be used.".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment clarifies that interest is not included in the
determination of loss. In, addition, it clarifies that in fraudulent loan application cases, as in
other types of fraud, if the intended loss is greater than the actual loss, the intended loss is used.
Finally, it makes an editorial improvement in this commentary by deleting an unnecessary
phrase.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1992.
471. Amendment: The Commentary to §2K1.3 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by
inserting the following additional note:
"11. As used in subsections (b)(3) and (c)(1), ‘another felony offense’ and ‘another
offense’ refer to offenses other than explosives or firearms possession or
trafficking offenses. However, where the defendant used or possessed a firearm
or explosive to facilitate another firearms or explosives offense (e.g., the
defendant used or possessed a firearm to protect the delivery of an unlawful
shipment of explosives), an upward departure under §5K2.6 (Weapons and
Dangerous Instrumentalities) may be warranted.".
The Commentary to §2K2.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 15 by deleting
"or (a)(5)" and inserting in lieu thereof "(a)(4)(B), or (a)(6)".
The Commentary to §2K2.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by inserting the
following additional note:
"18. As used in subsections (b)(5) and (c)(1), ‘another felony offense’ and ‘another
offense’ refer to offenses other than explosives or firearms possession or
trafficking offenses. However, where the defendant used or possessed a firearm
or explosive to facilitate another firearms or explosives offense (e.g., the
defendant used or possessed a firearm to protect the delivery of an unlawful
shipment of explosives), an upward departure under §5K2.6 (Weapons and
Dangerous Instrumentalities) may be warranted.".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment clarifies the meaning of the terms "another felony
offense’ and "another offense," and corrects a clerical error.
Amendment 471 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003
– 352 –
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1992.
472. Amendment: The Commentary to §4A1.2 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note
8 by deleting the last sentence as follows:
"If the government is able to show that a sentence imposed outside this time period is
evidence of similar misconduct or the defendant’s receipt of a substantial portion of
income from criminal livelihood, the court may consider this information in determining
whether to depart and sentence above the applicable guideline range.",
and by inserting in lieu thereof:
"If the court finds that a sentence imposed outside this time period is evidence of similar,
or serious dissimilar, criminal conduct, the court may consider this information in
determining whether an upward departure is warranted under §4A1.3 (Adequacy of
Criminal History Category).".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment clarifies that dissimilar, serious prior offenses
outside the applicable time period may be considered in determining whether an upward
departure is warranted under §4A1.3. The amendment provides additional Commission
guidance on an issue that has produced conflicting decisions among the courts of appeals.
Compare, e.g., United States v. Leake, 908 F.2d 550, 554 (9th Cir. 1990) (upward departure
impermissible for remote prior convictions dissimilar to instant offense) and United States v.
Samuels, 938 F.2d 210, 215 (D.C. Cir. 1991) (suggesting the same) with United States v.
Williams, 910 F.2d 1574, 1579 (7th Cir. 1990) (although older prior crimes dissimilar to instant
offense, upward departure permissible if convictions are reliable information of increased
recidivism risk), rev’d on other grounds, 112 S. Ct. 1112 (1992) and United States v. Russell,
905 F.2d 1439, 1444 (10th Cir. 1990) (same).
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1992.
473. Amendment: The Commentary to §7B1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by
deleting Notes 2 and 3 as follows:
"2. ‘Crime of violence’ has the same meaning as set forth in §4B1.2(1), and includes
any offense under federal or state law punishable by imprisonment for a term
exceeding one year that --
(i) has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical
force against the person of another; or
(ii) is burglary of a dwelling, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives,
or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of
physical injury to another.
November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment 474
– 353 –
A crime of violence includes murder, manslaughter, kidnapping, aggravated
assault, forcible sex offenses, robbery, arson, extortion, extortionate extension of
credit, and burglary of a dwelling. Other offenses are included where (A) that
offense has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical
force against the person of another, or (B) the conduct set forth in the violation
charged involved use of explosives or, by its nature, presented a serious potential
risk of physical injury to another. A crime of violence also includes the offenses
of aiding and abetting, conspiring, and attempting to commit such offenses.
3. ‘Controlled substance offense’ includes any offense under a federal or state law
prohibiting the manufacture, import, export, distribution, or dispensing of a
controlled substance (or a counterfeit substance) or the possession of a controlled
substance (or a counterfeit substance) with the intent to manufacture, import,
export, distribute, or dispense. A controlled substance offense also includes the
offenses of aiding and abetting, conspiring, and attempting to commit such
offenses.",
and by inserting in lieu thereof:
"2. ‘Crime of violence’ is defined in §4B1.2 (Definitions of Terms Used in Section
4B1.1). See §4B1.2(1) and Application Notes 1 and 2 of the Commentary to
§4B1.2.
3. ‘Controlled substance offense’ is defined in §4B1.2 (Definitions of Terms Used
in Section 4B1.1). See §4B1.2(2) and Application Note 1 of the Commentary to
§4B1.2.".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment clarifies the Commission’s intent that the terms
"crime of violence" and "controlled substance offense" in §7B1.1 have the same meaning as
these terms have in §4B1.2.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1992.
474. Amendment: Section 1B1.11(b) is amended by inserting the following additional subdivision:
"(3) If the defendant is convicted of two offenses, the first committed before, and the
second after, a revised edition of the Guidelines Manual became effective, the
revised edition of the Guidelines Manual is to be applied to both offenses.".
The Commentary to §1B1.11 captioned "Application Note" is amended by inserting the
following additional note:
"2. Under subsection (b)(1), the last date of the offense of conviction is the
controlling date for ex post facto purposes. For example, if the offense of
conviction (i.e., the conduct charged in the count of the indictment or information
of which the defendant was convicted) was determined by the court to have been
committed between October 15, 1991 and October 28, 1991, the date of October
28, 1991 is the controlling date for ex post facto purposes. This is true even if the
defendant’s conduct relevant to the determination of the guideline range under
Amendment 474 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003
– 354 –
§1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct) included an act that occurred on November 2, 1991
(after a revised Guideline Manual took effect).";
and in the caption by deleting "Note" and inserting in lieu thereof "Notes".
The Commentary to §1B1.11 captioned "Background" is amended by inserting the following
additional sentence as the first sentence of the first paragraph:
"Subsections (a) and (b)(1) provide that the court should apply the Guidelines Manual
in effect on the date the defendant is sentenced unless the court determines that doing so
would violate the ex post facto clause in Article I, § 9 of the United States Constitution.";
and by inserting the following additional paragraphs at the end:
" Subsection (b)(2) provides that the Guidelines Manual in effect on a particular
date shall be applied in its entirety.
Subsection (b)(3) provides that where the defendant is convicted of two offenses,
the first committed before, and the second after, a revised edition of the Guidelines
Manual became effective, the revised edition of the Guidelines Manual is to be applied
to both offenses, even if the revised edition results in an increased penalty for the first
offense. Because the defendant completed the second offense after the amendment to the
guidelines took effect, the ex post facto clause does not prevent determining the sentence
for that count based on the amended guidelines. For example, if a defendant pleads
guilty to a single count of embezzlement that occurred after the most recent edition of the
Guidelines Manual became effective, the guideline range applicable in sentencing will
encompass any relevant conduct (e.g., related embezzlement offenses that may have
occurred prior to the effective date of the guideline amendments) for the offense of
conviction. The same would be true for a defendant convicted of two counts of
embezzlement, one committed before the amendments were enacted, and the second
after. In this example, the ex post facto clause would not bar application of the amended
guideline to the first conviction; a contrary conclusion would mean that such defendant
was subject to a lower guideline range than if convicted only of the second offense.
Decisions from several appellate courts addressing the analogous situation of the
constitutionality of counting pre-guidelines criminal activity as relevant conduct for a
guidelines sentence support this approach. See United States v. Ykema, 887 F.2d 697
(6th Cir. 1989) (upholding inclusion of pre-November 1, 1987, drug quantities as
relevant conduct for the count of conviction, noting that habitual offender statutes
routinely augment punishment for an offense of conviction based on acts committed
before a law is passed), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 1062 (1990); United States v. Allen, 886
F.2d 143 (8th Cir. 1989) (similar); see also United States v. Cusack, 901 F.2d 29 (4th Cir.
1990) (similar).
Moreover, the approach set forth in subsection (b)(3) should be followed
regardless of whether the offenses of conviction are the type in which the conduct is
grouped under §3D1.2(d). The ex post facto clause does not distinguish between
groupable and nongroupable offenses, and unless that clause would be violated,
Congress’ directive to apply the sentencing guidelines in effect at the time of sentencing
must be followed. Under the guideline sentencing system, a single sentencing range is
November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment 476
– 355 –
determined based on the defendant’s overall conduct, even if there are multiple counts
of conviction (see §§3D1.1-3D1.5, 5G1.2). Thus, if a defendant is sentenced in January
1992 for a bank robbery committed in October 1988 and one committed in November
1991, the November 1991 Guidelines Manual should be used to determine a combined
guideline range for both counts. See generally United States v. Stephenson, 921 F.2d
438 (2d Cir. 1990) (holding that the Sentencing Commission and Congress intended that
the applicable version of the guidelines be applied as a ‘cohesive and integrated whole’
rather than in a piecemeal fashion).
Consequently, even in a complex case involving multiple counts that occurred
under several different versions of the Guidelines Manual, it will not be necessary to
compare more than two manuals to determine the applicable guideline range -- the
manual in effect at the time the last offense of conviction was completed and the manual
in effect at the time of sentencing.".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment expands §1B1.11 to address what has become a
frequently asked hotline question and troublesome application issue -- the application of
amended guidelines to multiple count cases in which the effective date of guideline revision(s)
occurs between the offenses of conviction. The issue has also produced litigation before several
appellate courts. See United States v. Castro, 972 F.2d 1107 (9th Cir. 1992), cert. denied, 113
S. Ct. 1350 (1993); United States v. Seligsohn, 981 F.2d 1418 (3d Cir. 1992); United States v.
Hartzog, 983 F.2d 604 (4th Cir. 1993). This amendment extends the Commission’s "one book"
rule to multiple count cases and sets forth the rationale for this policy.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1993.
475. Amendment: Chapter One, Part B, is amended by inserting an additional policy statement as
§1B1.12 (Persons Sentenced Under the Federal Juvenile Delinquency Act (Policy Statement)).
Section 5H1.1 is amended by deleting the last paragraph as follows:
"The guidelines are not applicable to a person sentenced as a juvenile delinquent under
the provisions of 18 U.S.C. § 5037.".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment adds a policy statement as §1B1.12 to address the
determination of the maximum imposable sentence in the case of a juvenile delinquent. The
Supreme Court’s decision in United States v. R.L.C., 112 S. Ct. 1329 (1992), requires
calculation of the guideline range in order to determine the maximum sentence imposable on
a juvenile delinquent.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1993.
476. Amendment: The Commentary to §2A1.1 captioned "Background" is deleted as follows:
"Background: The maximum penalty authorized by 18 U.S.C. § 1111 for first degree
murder is death or life imprisonment. Whether a mandatory minimum term of life
imprisonment is applicable to every defendant convicted of first degree murder under 18
U.S.C. § 1111 is a matter of statutory interpretation for the courts. The discussion in
Application Note 1, supra, regarding circumstances in which a downward departure may
Amendment 476 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003
– 356 –
be warranted is relevant in the event the penalty provisions of 18 U.S.C. § 1111 are
construed to permit a sentence less than life imprisonment, or in the event the defendant
is convicted under a statute that expressly authorizes a sentence of less than life
imprisonment (e.g., 18 U.S.C. §§ 2113(e), 2118(c)(2), 21 U.S.C. § 848(e)).
The maximum penalty authorized under 21 U.S.C. § 848(e) is death or life
imprisonment. If a term of imprisonment is imposed, the statutorily required minimum
term is twenty years.".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment deletes commentary that highlighted the question
of whether 18 U.S.C. § 1111 provides a mandatory minimum term of life imprisonment. Since
this commentary was written, appellate courts uniformly have held that 18 U.S.C. § 1111 does
provide a mandatory minimum term of life imprisonment. See United States v. Sands, 968 F.2d
1058 (10th Cir. 1992), cert. denied, 113 S. Ct. 987 (1993); United States v. LaFleur, 952 F.2d
1537 (9th Cir), modfied and reh’g denied, 971 F.2d 200 (9th Cir. 1991); United States v.
Gonzalez, 922 F.2d 1044 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 112 S. Ct. 660 (1991); United States v. Donley,
878 F.2d 735 (3d Cir. 1989), cert. denied, 494 U.S. 1058 (1990). In addition, this amendment
deletes, as unnecessary, several sentences of commentary that merely recite statutory penalties.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1993.
477. Amendment: Section 2A3.1 is amended by redesignating subsection (c) as subsection (d); and
by inserting the following additional subsection:
"(c) Cross Reference
(1) If a victim was killed under circumstances that would constitute murder
under 18 U.S.C. § 1111 had such killing taken place within the territorial
or maritime jurisdiction of the United States, apply §2A1.1 (First Degree
Murder).".
Section 2A3.1(b)(2) is amended by deleting "otherwise, (B) if the victim was under the age of
sixteen" and inserting in lieu thereof "or (B) if the victim had attained the age of twelve years
but had not attained the age of sixteen years".
The Commentary to §2A3.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by inserting the
following additional note:
"5. If the defendant was convicted (A) of more than one act of criminal sexual abuse
and the counts are grouped under §3D1.2 (Groups of Closely Related Counts),
or (B) of only one such act but the court determines that the offense involved
multiple acts of criminal sexual abuse of the same victim or different victims, an
upward departure would be warranted.".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment adds a cross reference to §2A3.1 to address the
circumstance in which a victim is murdered during the offense. In addition, an editorial change
in §2A3.1(b)(2) is made to conform the phraseology used in this subsection to that used
elsewhere in the guidelines. This amendment also authorizes an upward departure where the
offense involved multiple acts of criminal sexual abuse that do not result in an increase in
November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment 478
– 357 –
offense level under the multiple count rules in Chapter Three, Part D.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1993.
478. Amendment: The Commentary to §2A4.1 captioned "Background" is amended in the third
paragraph by deleting:
"or to facilitate the commission of another offense. Should the application of this
guideline result in a penalty less than the result achieved by applying the guideline for
the underlying offense, apply the guideline for the underlying offense (e.g., §2A3.1,
Criminal Sexual Abuse).",
and inserting in lieu thereof:
"(subsection (b)(1)) or involves another federal, state, or local offense that results in a
greater offense level (subsections (b)(7) and (c)(1)).".
The Commentary to §2K1.3 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 4 by inserting
"(federal, state, or local)" immediately following "any offense".

"(which may be a federal, state, or local offense)" immediately before "is".
The Commentary to §2K2.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by inserting the
following additional note:
"19. The enhancement under subsection (b)(4) for a stolen firearm or a firearm with
an altered or obliterated serial number applies whether or not the defendant knew
or had reason to believe that the firearm was stolen or had an altered or
obliterated serial number.".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment clarifies that the terms "another offense" and "other
offense" in §2A4.1(b)(7), and "felony offense," "another felony offense," "another offense," and
"other offense" in §§2K1.3 and 2K2.1, refer to federal, state, or local offenses. In addition, this
amendment clarifies that the enhancement in §2K2.1(b)(4) applies whether or not the defendant
knew or had reason to believe the firearm was stolen or had an altered or obliterated serial
number.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1993.
479. Amendment: Section 2A4.2 is amended by inserting the following additional subsection:
Amendment 479 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003
– 358 –
"(b) Cross Reference
(1) If the defendant was a participant in the kidnapping offense, apply
§2A4.1 (Kidnapping; Abduction; Unlawful Restraint).".
The Commentary to §2A4.2 is amended by inserting the following immediately before
"Background".
"Application Note:
1. A ‘participant’ is a person who is criminally responsible for the commission of
the offense, but need not have been convicted.".
Section 2B3.2(c) is amended by deleting "Reference" and inserting in lieu thereof "References";
by renumbering subdivision (1) as subdivision (2); and by inserting the following additional
subdivision:
"(1) If a victim was killed under circumstances that would constitute murder under 18
U.S.C. § 1111 had such killing taken place within the territorial or maritime
jurisdiction of the United States, apply §2A1.1 (First Degree Murder).".
Section 2B3.3 is amended by inserting the following additional subsection:
"(c) Cross References
(1) If the offense involved extortion under color of official right, apply
§2C1.1 (Offering, Giving, Soliciting, or Receiving a Bribe; Extortion
Under Color of Official Right).
(2) If the offense involved extortion by force or threat of injury or serious
damage, apply §2B3.2 (Extortion by Force or Threat of Injury or Serious
Damage).".
Section 2D1.1 is amended by inserting the following additional subsection:
"(d) Cross Reference
(1) If a victim was killed under circumstances that would constitute murder
under 18 U.S.C. § 1111 had such killing taken place within the territorial
or maritime jurisdiction of the United States, apply §2A1.1 (First Degree
Murder).".
Section 2E2.1 is amended by inserting the following additional subsection:
"(c) Cross Reference
(1) If a victim was killed under circumstances that would constitute murder

or maritime jurisdiction of the United States, apply §2A1.1 (First Degree
November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment 481
– 359 –
Murder).".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment adds a cross reference to §2A4.2 to address the
circumstance in which the defendant was a participant in the underlying kidnapping offense.
This amendment also adds cross references to §§2B3.2, 2D1.1, and 2E2.1 to address the
circumstance in which a victim is murdered during the offense. Finally, this amendment adds
cross references to §2B3.3 to ensure the selection of the appropriate guideline.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1993.
480. Amendment: Section 2A5.2(a)(1) is amended by deleting "defendant intentionally
endangered" and inserting in lieu thereof "offense involved intentionally endangering".

"offense involved".
Section 2A6.1(b)(2) is amended by deleting "the defendant’s conduct" and inserting in lieu
thereof "the offense".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment deletes language that could be construed as a
limitation on the scope of conduct for which a defendant is accountable under §1B1.3 (Relevant
Conduct) and replaces it with language consistent with that used in other offense guidelines.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1993.

transported, transferred, transmitted, or possessed was a firearm, destructive device, or
controlled substance," immediately following "taken,".
Section 2B1.1(b)(4) is amended by inserting "(A)" immediately following "If"; and by inserting
"or the taking of such item was an object of the offense; or (B) the stolen property received,
transported, transferred, transmitted, or possessed was undelivered United States mail,"
immediately following "taken,".
Section 2B1.1(b)(5) is amended by inserting "(A)" immediately before "If"; and by inserting

The Commentary to §2B1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 2 by inserting
the following additional paragraph as the next to the last paragraph:

a theft offense.".
The Commentary to §2B1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by inserting the
following additional note:

welfare benefit plan (a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 664) and the defendant was a
fiduciary of the benefit plan, an adjustment under §3B1.3 (Abuse of Position of

deleting "property taken" and inserting in lieu thereof "the property stolen"; by deleting "theft
offenses," and inserting in lieu thereof "theft and other offenses involving stolen property"; and

additional statutory provision(s), see Appendix A (Statutory Index).
Application Notes:
1. ‘More than minimal planning,’ ‘firearm,’ and ‘destructive device’ are defined in
the Commentary to §1B1.1 (Application Instructions).
2. Valuation of property is discussed in the Commentary to §2B1.1.
3. ‘Undelivered United States mail’ means mail that has not actually been received
by the addressee or his agent (e.g., it includes mail that is in the addressee’s mail
box).
4. Subsection (b)(5), referring to an ‘organized scheme to receive stolen vehicles or
vehicle parts,’ provides an alternative minimum measure of loss in the case of an
ongoing, sophisticated operation such as an auto theft ring or ‘chop shop.’
‘Vehicles’ refers to all forms of vehicles, including aircraft and watercraft. See
Commentary to §2B1.1 (Larceny, Embezzlement, and Other Forms of Theft).
Background: The treatment accorded receiving stolen property parallels that given theft.
Persons who receive stolen property for resale receive a sentence enhancement because
the amount of property is likely to underrepresent the scope of their criminality and the
extent to which they encourage or facilitate other crimes.".
Section 2B2.1 is amended in the title by inserting "or a Structure Other than a Residence" at the
end thereof.

statutory provision(s), see Appendix A (Statutory Index).
Application Notes:

Embezzlement, and Other Forms of Theft).
3. Subsection (b)(4) does not apply to possession of a dangerous weapon (including
a firearm) that was stolen during the course of the offense.
Background: The offense level for burglary is significantly higher than that for theft for
low losses, but is approximately the same for very high losses. Weapon possession, but
not use, is a specific offense characteristic because use of a weapon (including to
threaten) ordinarily would make the offense robbery. Weapon use would be a ground

Section 2K1.7 is deleted in its entirety as follows:
"§2K1.7. Use of Fire or Explosives to Commit a Federal Felony
(a) If the defendant, whether or not convicted of another crime, was

that required by statute.
(b) Special Instruction for Fines
(1) Where there is a federal conviction for the underlying
offense, the fine guideline shall be the fine guideline that
would have been applicable had there only been a
conviction for the underlying offense. This guideline
November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment 481
– 371 –
shall be used as a consolidated fine guideline for both the
underlying offense and the conviction underlying this
section.
Commentary
Statutory Provision: 18 U.S.C. § 844(h).
Application Notes:
1. The statute requires a term of imprisonment imposed under this section to run
consecutively to any other term of imprisonment.
2. Imposition of a term of supervised release is governed by the provisions of
§5D1.1 (Imposition of a Term of Supervised Release).
3. Where a sentence under this section is imposed in conjunction with a sentence for
an underlying offense, any specific offense characteristic for the use of fire or
explosives is not to be applied in respect to the guideline for the underlying
offense.
4. Subsection (b) sets forth special provisions concerning the imposition of fines.
Where there is also a conviction for the underlying offense, a consolidated fine
guideline is determined by the offense level that would have applied to the
underlying offense absent a conviction under 18 U.S.C. § 844(h). This is
required because the offense level for the underlying offense may be reduced in
that any specific offense characteristic for use of fire or explosives would not be
applied (see Application Note 3). The Commission has not established a fine
guideline range for the unusual case in which there is no conviction for the
underlying offense, although a fine is authorized under 18 U.S.C. § 3571.".

Section 2Q1.2 is amended in the title by inserting "; Unlawfully Transporting Hazardous

The Commentary to §2Q1.2 captioned "Statutory Provisions" is amended by inserting ";
49 U.S.C. § 1809(b)" immediately following "1822(b)".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment deletes 25 offense guidelines by consolidating
them with other offense guidelines that cover similar offense conduct and have identical or very
similar base offense levels and adjustments. Consolidation of offense guidelines in this manner
has a number of practical advantages: it shortens and simplifies the Guidelines Manual and
reduces the likelihood of inconsistency in phraseology and definitions from section to section;
it will reduce possible confusion and litigation as to which guideline applies to particular
conduct; it will reduce the number of conforming amendments required whenever similar
sections are amended; and it will aid the development of case law because cases involving
similar or identical concepts and definitions can be referenced under one guideline rather than
different guidelines.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1993.
482. Amendment: The Commentary to §2B1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note
2 by inserting the following additional sentence as the fourth sentence of the first paragraph:
"Loss does not include the interest that could have been earned had the funds not been
stolen.";
and by inserting the following additional paragraphs as the second and third paragraphs:
"Where the offense involved making a fraudulent loan or credit card application, or other
unlawful conduct involving a loan or credit card, the loss is to be determined under the
principles set forth in the Commentary to §2F1.1 (Fraud and Deceit).
In certain cases, an offense may involve a series of transactions without a corresponding
increase in loss. For example, a defendant may embezzle $5,000 from a bank and
conceal this embezzlement by shifting this amount from one account to another in a
series of nine transactions over a six-month period. In this example, the loss is $5,000
(the amount taken), not $45,000 (the sum of the nine transactions), because the additional
transactions did not increase the actual or potential loss.".
The Commentary to §2B1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by deleting Note 3 as
follows:
"3. The loss need not be determined with precision, and may be inferred from any
reasonably reliable information available, including the scope of the operation.",
November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment 482
– 377 –
and inserting in lieu thereof:
"3. For the purposes of subsection (b)(1), the loss need not be determined with
precision. The court need only make a reasonable estimate of the loss, given the
available information. This estimate, for example, may be based upon the
approximate number of victims and the average loss to each victim, or on more
general factors such as the scope and duration of the offense.".
The Commentary to §2B5.3 is amended by inserting the following immediately before
"Background":
"Application Note:
1. ‘Infringing items’ means the items that violate the copyright or trademark laws
(not the legitimate items that are infringed upon).".
The Commentary to §2B6.1 captioned "Application Note" is amended in the caption by deleting
"Note" and inserting in lieu thereof "Notes"; and by inserting the following additional Note:
"2. The ‘corresponding number of levels from the table in §2F1.1 (Fraud and
Deceit),’ as used in subsection (b)(1), refers to the number of levels
corresponding to the retail value of the motor vehicles or parts involved.".
Section 2F1.1(b)(3) is amended by deleting "or process" and by inserting in lieu thereof ", or
process not addressed elsewhere in the guidelines".
The Commentary to §2F1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 5 in the first
sentence by inserting a comma immediately following "decree"; and by inserting the following
additional sentence at the end:
"This subsection does not apply to conduct addressed elsewhere in the guidelines; e.g.,
a violation of a condition of release (addressed in §2J1.7 (Offense Committed While on
Release)) or a violation of probation (addressed in §4A1.1 (Criminal History
Category)).".
The Commentary to §2F1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 7(b) in the
second paragraph by inserting the following additional sentence at the end:
"Where the loss determined above significantly understates or overstates the seriousness
of the defendant’s conduct, an upward or downward departure may be warranted.".
The Commentary to §2F1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 10 by deleting
"the primary" and inserting in lieu thereof "a primary"; by inserting "; or the fraud caused or
risked reasonably foreseeable, substantial non-monetary harm" immediately following "was
non-monetary"; by deleting "physical or psychological harm" and inserting in lieu thereof
"reasonably foreseeable, physical or psychological harm or severe emotional trauma"; by
deleting the period immediately following "institution" and inserting in lieu thereof a
semicolon; by inserting a new subdivision, immediately following subdivision (e), as follows:
Amendment 482 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003
– 378 –
"(f) the offense involved the knowing endangerment of the solvency of one or more
victims.";
and by inserting the following additional sentence at the end of the last paragraph:
"In such cases, a downward departure may be warranted.".
The Commentary to §2F1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 11 by deleting
the last two sentences as follows:
"The statutes provide for increased maximum terms of imprisonment for the use or
possession of device-making equipment and the production or transfer of more than five
identification documents or fifteen access devices. The court may find it appropriate to
enhance the sentence for violations of these statutes in a manner similar to the treatment
of analogous counterfeiting offenses under Part B of this Chapter.",
and inserting in lieu thereof:
"Where the primary purpose of the offense involved the unlawful production, transfer,
possession, or use of identification documents for the purpose of violating, or assisting
another to violate, the laws relating to naturalization, citizenship, or legal resident status,
apply §2L2.1 or §2L2.2, as appropriate, rather than §2F1.1. In the case of an offense
involving false identification documents or access devices, an upward departure may be
warranted where the actual loss does not adequately reflect the seriousness of the
conduct.".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment makes the definitions of loss in §§2B1.1 (Larceny,
Embezzlement, and Other Forms of Theft) and 2F1.1 (Fraud and Deceit) more consistent.
Although the term "reasonably reliable information" is deleted from §2B1.1 (there is no
corresponding term in §2F1.1), no substantive change results because the reliability of the
information considered in respect to all cases is already addressed in §6A1.3 (Resolution of
Disputed Factors). In addition, this amendment provides additional guidance for the
determination of loss in cases that are referenced to §2B1.1, but have loss characteristics closely
resembling offenses referenced to §2F1.1, and in cases in which simply adding the amounts
from a series of transactions does not reflect the amount taken or put at risk. This amendment
also clarifies the meaning of the term "infringing items" in §2B5.3, and expressly provides that
the reference in §2B6.1 to the table in §2F1.1 is to be applied using the retail value of the stolen
parts. In addition, this amendment clarifies the operation of §2F1.1(b)(3) to avoid inappropriate
double counting. Finally, this amendment revises the Commentary to §2F1.1 by expanding
Application Note 10 to provide guidance in cases in which the monetary loss does not
adequately reflect the seriousness of the offense, and by clarifying Application
Note 11 and conforming the phraseology in this application note to that used elsewhere in the
guidelines.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1993.
483. Amendment: Section 2B3.1(b)(1) is amended by inserting "(A)" immediately following "If";
and by inserting "or (B) the offense involved carjacking," immediately before "increase".
November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment 484
– 379 –
Section 2B3.1 is amended by inserting the following additional subsection:
"(c) Cross Reference
(1) If a victim was killed under circumstances that would constitute murder
under 18 U.S.C. § 1111 had such killing taken place within the territorial
or maritime jurisdiction of the United States, apply §2A1.1 (First Degree
Murder).".
The Commentary to §2B3.1 captioned "Statutory Provisions" is amended by inserting ", 2119"
immediately following "2118(a)".
The Commentary to §2B3.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 1 by inserting
the following additional paragraph at the end:
"‘Carjacking’ means the taking or attempted taking of a motor vehicle from the person
or presence of another by force and violence or by intimidation.".
The Commentary to §2B3.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by deleting Note 6 as
follows:
"6. If the defendant was convicted under 18 U.S.C. § 2113(e) and in committing the
offense or attempting to flee or escape, a participant killed any person, apply
§2A1.1 (First Degree Murder). Otherwise, if death results, see Chapter Five, Part
K (Departures).";
and by renumbering Note 7 as Note 6.
Reason for Amendment: This amendment adds a specific offense characteristic for carjacking
to §2B3.1, references 18 U.S.C. § 2119 (carjacking offenses) to this guideline, and adds a cross
reference to this guideline to address the circumstance in which a victim is murdered during the
offense.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1993.
484. Amendment: The Commentary to §2D1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note
1 by deleting "21 U.S.C. § 841." and inserting in lieu thereof:
"21 U.S.C. § 841, except as expressly provided. Mixture or substance does not include
materials that must be separated from the controlled substance before the controlled
substance can be used. Examples of such materials include the fiberglass in a
cocaine/fiberglass bonded suitcase, beeswax in a cocaine/beeswax statue, and waste
water from an illicit laboratory used to manufacture a controlled substance. If such
material cannot readily be separated from the mixture or substance that appropriately is
counted in the Drug Quantity Table, the court may use any reasonable method to
approximate the weight of the mixture or substance to be counted.
An upward departure nonetheless may be warranted when the mixture or substance
counted in the Drug Quantity Table is combined with other, non-countable material in
Amendment 484 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003
– 380 –
an unusually sophisticated manner in order to avoid detection.".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment addresses an inter-circuit conflict regarding the
meaning of the term "mixture or substance," as used in §2D1.1 by expressly providing that this
term does not include portions of a drug mixture that have to be separated from the controlled
substance before the controlled substance can be used. This issue has arisen, subsequent to the
United States Supreme Court decision in Chapman v. United States, 111 S. Ct. 1919 (1991),
in two types of cases. The first type of case involves a controlled substance bonded to, or
suspended in, another substance (e.g., cocaine mixed with beeswax); however, the controlled
substance is not usable until it is separated from the other substance. See, e.g., United States
v. Mahecha-Onofre, 936 F.2d 623 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 112 S. Ct. 648 (1991); United States
v. Restrepo-Contreras, 942 F.2d 96 (1st Cir. 1991), cert. denied, 112 S. Ct. 955 (1992). The
second type of case involves the waste produced from an illicit laboratory used to manufacture
a controlled substance or chemicals confiscated before the chemical processing of the controlled
substance is completed. The waste product is typically water or chemicals used to either
remove impurities or form a precipitate (the precipitate, in some cases, being the controlled
substance). Typically, a small amount of controlled substance remains in the waste water; often
this amount is too small to quantify and is listed as a trace amount (no weight given) in DEA
reports. In these types of cases, the waste product is not consumable. The chemicals seized
before the end of processing are also not usable in that form because further processing must
take place before they can be used. See, e.g., United States v. Sherrod, 964 F.2d 1501 (5th
Cir.), cert. denied sub nom. Cooper v. United States, 113 S. Ct. 832 (1992) (White and
Blackmun, JJ., dissenting from denial of cert.), and cert. denied sub nom. United States v.
Sewell, 113 S. Ct. 1367 (1993) (White and Blackmun, JJ., opinion dissenting from denial of
cert.).
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1993.
485. Amendment: The Commentary to §2D1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by
inserting the following additional note:
"16. Where (A) the amount of the controlled substance for which the defendant is
accountable under §1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct) results in a base offense level
greater than 36, (B) the court finds that this offense level overrepresents the
defendant’s culpability in the criminal activity, and (C) the defendant qualifies
for a mitigating role adjustment under §3B1.2 (Mitigating Role), a downward
departure may be warranted. The court may depart to a sentence no lower than
the guideline range that would have resulted if the defendant’s Chapter Two
offense level had been offense level 36. Provided, that a defendant is not eligible
for a downward departure under this provision if the defendant:
(a) has one or more prior felony convictions for a crime of violence or a
controlled substance offense as defined in §4B1.2 (Definitions of Terms
Used in Section 4B1.1);
(b) qualifies for an adjustment under §3B1.3 (Abuse of Position of Trust or
Use of Special Skill);
(c) possessed or induced another participant to use or possess a firearm in the
November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment 486

offense;
(d) had decision-making authority;
(e) owned the controlled substance or financed any part of the offense; or
(f) sold the controlled substance or played a substantial part in negotiating
the terms of the sale.
Example: A defendant, who the court finds meets the criteria for a downward
departure under this provision, has a Chapter Two offense level of 40, a 2-level
reduction for a minor role from §3B1.2, and a 3-level reduction for acceptance
of responsibility from §3E1.1. His final offense level is 35. If the defendant’s
Chapter Two offense level had been 36, the 2-level reduction for a minor role and
3-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility would have resulted in a final
offense level of 31. Therefore, under this provision, a downward departure not
to exceed 4 levels (from level 35 to level 31) would be authorized.".
Reason for Amendment: Where a defendant’s base offense level is greater than level 36 and
the defendant had a minimal or minor role in the offense (and meets certain other
qualifications), the quantity of the controlled substance for which the defendant is held
accountable under §1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct) may overrepresent the defendant’s culpability
in the criminal activity. To address this issue, this amendment adds an application note to
§2D1.1 that authorizes a downward departure in the specific circumstances described and sets
forth the extent of a departure authorized on this basis.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1993.
486. Amendment: The Commentary to §2D1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by
inserting the following additional note:
"17. If, in a reverse sting (an operation in which a government agent sells or negotiates
to sell a controlled substance to a defendant), the court finds that the government
agent set a price for the controlled substance that was substantially below the
market value of the controlled substance, thereby leading to the defendant’s
purchase of a significantly greater quantity of the controlled substance than his
available resources would have allowed him to purchase except for the artificially
low price set by the government agent, a downward departure may be
warranted.".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment adds an application note to §2D1.1 authorizing a
downward departure if, in a reverse sting operation, the court finds that the government agent
set a price for the controlled substance that was substantially below market value and thereby
significantly inflated the quantity of controlled substance purchased by the defendant beyond
the amount the defendant otherwise could have afforded.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1993.
487. Amendment: Section 2D1.1(c) is amended in the notes following the Drug Quantity Table by
Amendment 486 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003
– 382 –
inserting the following additional paragraph as the third paragraph.
"‘Cocaine base,’ for the purposes of this guideline, means ‘crack.’ ‘Crack’ is the street
name for a form of cocaine base, usually prepared by processing cocaine hydrochloride
and sodium bicarbonate, and usually appearing in a lumpy, rocklike form.".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment provides that, for purposes of the guidelines,
"cocaine base" means "crack." The amendment addresses an inter-circuit conflict. Compare,
e.g., United States v. Shaw, 936 F.2d 412 (9th Cir. 1991) (cocaine base means crack) with
United States v. Jackson, 968 F.2d 158 (2d Cir) (cocaine base has a scientific, chemical
definition that is more inclusive than crack), cert. denied, 113 S. Ct. 664 (1992). Under this
amendment, forms of cocaine base other than crack (e.g., coca paste, an intermediate step in the
processing of coca leaves into cocaine hydrochloride, scientifically is a base form of cocaine,
but it is not crack) will be treated as cocaine.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1993.
488. Amendment: Section 2D1.1(c) is amended in the notes following the Drug Quantity Table by
inserting the following additional paragraph at the end:
"In the case of LSD on a carrier medium (e.g., a sheet of blotter paper), do not use the
weight of the LSD/carrier medium. Instead, treat each dose of LSD on the carrier
medium as equal to 0.4 mg of LSD for the purposes of the Drug Quantity Table.".
The Commentary to §2D1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in note 11 by deleting
the first entry in the "Typical Weight Per Unit Table" as follows:
"LSD (Lysergic acid diethylamide) 0.05 mg".
The Commentary to §2D1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by inserting the
following additional note:
"18. LSD on a blotter paper carrier medium typically is marked so that the number of
doses (‘hits’) per sheet readily can be determined. When this is not the case, it
is to be presumed that each 1/4 inch by 1/4 inch section of the blotter paper is
equal to one dose.
In the case of liquid LSD (LSD that has not been placed onto a carrier medium),
using the weight of the LSD alone to calculate the offense level may not
adequately reflect the seriousness of the offense. In such a case, an upward
departure may be warranted.".
The Commentary to §2D1.1 captioned "Background" is amended by inserting the following
paragraphs at the end:
"Because the weights of LSD carrier media vary widely and typically far exceed
the weight of the controlled substance itself, the Commission has determined that basing
offense levels on the entire weight of the LSD and carrier medium would produce
unwarranted disparity among offenses involving the same quantity of actual LSD (but
November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment 488
– 383 –
different carrier weights), as well as sentences disproportionate to those for other, more
dangerous controlled substances, such as PCP. Consequently, in cases involving LSD
contained in a carrier medium, the Commission has established a weight per dose of 0.4
milligram for purposes of determining the base offense level.
The dosage weight of LSD selected exceeds the Drug Enforcement
Administration’s standard dosage unit for LSD of 0.05 milligram (i.e., the quantity of
actual LSD per dose) in order to assign some weight to the carrier medium. Because
LSD typically is marketed and consumed orally on a carrier medium, the inclusion of
some weight attributable to the carrier medium recognizes (A) that offense levels for
most other controlled substances are based upon the weight of the mixture containing the
controlled substance without regard to purity, and (B) the decision in Chapman v. United
States, 111 S. Ct. 1919 (1991) (holding that the term ‘mixture or substance’ in 21 U.S.C.
§ 841(b)(1) includes the carrier medium in which LSD is absorbed). At the same time,
the weight per dose selected is less than the weight per dose that would equate the
offense level for LSD on a carrier medium with that for the same number of doses of
PCP, a controlled substance that comparative assessments indicate is more likely to
induce violent acts and ancillary crime than is LSD. (Treating LSD on a carrier medium
as weighing 0.5 milligram per dose would produce offense levels equivalent to those for
PCP.) Thus, the approach decided upon by the Commission will harmonize offense
levels for LSD offenses with those for other controlled substances and avoid an undue
influence of varied carrier weight on the applicable offense level. Nonetheless, this
approach does not override the applicability of ‘mixture or substance’ for the purpose of
applying any mandatory minimum sentence (see Chapman; §5G1.1(b)).".
Reason for Amendment: The Commission has found that the weights of LSD carrier media
vary widely and typically far exceed the weight of the controlled substance itself (e.g., LSD is
typically placed on blotter paper which generally weighs from 5 to 10 milligrams per dose; the
weight of the LSD itself per dose is generally from 0.02 to 0.08 milligram; the Drug
Enforcement Administration describes a standard dose of LSD as containing 0.05 milligram of
LSD). As a result, basing the offense level on the entire weight of the LSD and carrier medium
produces unwarranted disparity among offenses involving the same quantity of actual LSD but
different carrier weights, as well as sentences that are disproportionate to those for other, more
dangerous controlled substances, such as PCP, heroin, and cocaine. Under the guidelines prior
to the amendment, for example, 100 grams of heroin or 500 grams of cocaine (weights that
correspond to several thousand doses, the number depending upon the purity) result in the same
offense level as 125 doses of LSD on blotter paper (which has an average weight of 8
milligrams per dose) or 1 dose of LSD on a sugar cube (2000 milligrams per dose).
Consequently, in cases involving LSD contained in a carrier medium, this amendment
establishes a weight per dose of 0.4 milligram to be used for purposes of determining the base
offense level. The dosage weight of LSD selected by the Commission exceeds the Drug
Enforcement Administration’s standard dosage unit for LSD of 0.05 milligram (i.e., the quantity
of actual LSD per dose) in order to assign some weight to the carrier medium. Because LSD
typically is marketed and consumed orally on a carrier medium, the inclusion of some weight
attributable to the carrier medium recognizes (A) that offense levels for most other controlled
substances are based upon the weight of the mixture containing the controlled substance
without regard to purity, and (B) the decision in Chapman v. United States, 111 S. Ct. 1919
(1991) (holding that the term "mixture or substance" in 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1) includes the
carrier medium in which LSD is absorbed). At the same time, the weight per dose selected is
Amendment 488 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003
– 384 –
less than the weight per dose that would equate the offense level for LSD on a carrier medium
with that for the same number of doses of PCP, a controlled substance that comparative
assessments indicate is more likely to induce violent acts and ancillary crime than is LSD.
Treating LSD on a carrier medium as weighing 0.5 milligram per dose would produce offense
levels equivalent to those for PCP (for example, 2000 doses of LSD at 0.5 milligram per dose
equals 1 gram of LSD -- corresponding to the lower limit of offense level 26; similarly, 2000
doses of PCP at 5 milligrams per dose, the standard amount of actual PCP in a dose, equals 10
grams of actual PCP -- corresponding to the lower limit of offense level 26). Thus, the approach
decided upon by the Commission will harmonize offense levels for LSD offenses with those
for other controlled substances and avoid an undue influence of varied carrier weight on the
applicable offense level. Nonetheless, this approach does not override the definition of mixture
or substance for purposes of applying any mandatory minimum sentence (see Chapman;
§5G1.1(b)).
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1993.
489. Amendment: The Commentary to §2K2.4 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note
2 by deleting:
"Provided, that where the maximum of the guideline range from Chapter Five, Part A
(Sentencing Table) determined by an offense level adjusted under the procedure
described in the preceding paragraph, plus the term of imprisonment required under
18 U.S.C. § 924(c) or § 929(a), is less than the maximum of the guideline range that
would apply to the underlying offense absent such adjustment, the procedure described
in the preceding paragraph does not apply. Instead, the guideline range applicable to the
underlying offense absent such adjustment is to be used after subtracting the term of
imprisonment imposed under 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) or § 929(a) from both the minimum and
maximum of such range.
Example: A defendant, is to be sentenced under the robbery guideline; his unadjusted
offense level from §2B3.1 is 30, including a 7-level enhancement for discharging a
firearm; no Chapter Three adjustments are applicable; and his criminal history category
is Category IV. His unadjusted guideline range from Chapter Five, Part A (Sentencing
Table) is 135-168 months. This defendant has also been convicted under 18 U.S.C. §
924(c) arising from the possession of a weapon during the robbery, and therefore must
be sentenced to an additional consecutive five-year term of imprisonment. The
defendant’s adjusted guideline range, which takes into account the conviction under 18
U.S.C. § 924(c) by eliminating the 7-level weapon enhancement, is 70-87 months.
Because the maximum of the defendant’s adjusted guideline range plus the five year
consecutive sentence (87 months + 60 months = 147 months) is less than the maximum
of the defendant’s unadjusted guideline range (168 months), the defendant is to be
sentenced using the unadjusted guideline range after subtracting the 60 month sentence
to be imposed under 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) from both the minimum and maximum of the
unadjusted range (e.g., 135 months - 60 months = 75 months; 168 months - 60 months
= 108 months). A sentence imposed for the underlying offense using the guideline range
determined in this manner (75-108 months) when combined with the consecutive
sentence imposed under 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) or § 929(a), will produce the appropriate
total term of imprisonment.",
November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment 490
– 385 –
and inserting in lieu thereof:
"In a few cases, the offense level for the underlying offense determined under the
preceding paragraph may result in a guideline range that, when combined with the
mandatory consecutive sentence under 18 U.S.C. § 844(h), § 924(c), or § 929(a),
produces a total maximum penalty that is less than the maximum of the guideline range
that would have resulted had there not been a count of conviction under 18 U.S.C. §
844(h), § 924(c), or § 929(a) (i.e., the guideline range that would have resulted if the
enhancements for possession, use, or discharge of a firearm had been applied). In such
a case, an upward departure may be warranted so that the conviction under 18 U.S.C. §
844(h), § 924(c), or § 929(a) does not result in a decrease in the total punishment. An
upward departure under this paragraph shall not exceed the maximum of the guideline
range that would have resulted had there not been a count of conviction under 18 U.S.C.
§ 844(h), § 924(c), or § 929(a).".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment simplifies the operation of §2K2.4 in order to
reduce erroneous application by deleting the proviso in Application Note 2 and, in lieu thereof,
authorizing an upward departure in the unusual case in which the combined sentence for an
underlying offense and a firearms or explosives offense (under 18 U.S.C. § 844(h), §924(c), or
§ 929(a)) is less than the maximum of the guideline range that would have resulted if there had
been no additional conviction for the firearms or explosives offense.

Application Note:
1. ‘Criminally derived property’ means any property constituting, or derived from,
proceeds obtained from a criminal offense. See 18 U.S.C. § 1957(f)(2).
Background: The offenses covered by this guideline relate to records and reports of
certain transactions involving currency and monetary instruments. The maximum prison
sentence for these offenses is ten years if there is any pattern of unlawful activity, and
five years otherwise.
A base offense level of 13 is provided for those offenses where the defendant
either structured the transaction to evade reporting requirements or knowingly filed, or
caused another to file, a report containing materially false statements. A lower
alternative base offense level of 5 is provided in all other cases.
Where the defendant actually knew or believed that the funds were criminally
derived property, subsection (b)(1) provides for the greater of a 4-level increase or an
increase to level 13.
Except in rare cases, the dollar value of the transactions not reported is an
important indicator of several factors that are pertinent to the sentence, including the size
of the criminal enterprise, and the extent to which the defendant aided the enterprise.

Section 2T1.1 is amended by inserting the following additional subsection:
"(c) Special Instructions
For the purposes of this guideline --
(1) If the offense involved tax evasion or a fraudulent or false return,
statement, or other document, the tax loss is the total amount of loss that
was the object of the offense (i.e., the loss that would have resulted had
the offense been successfully completed).
Notes:
(A) If the offense involved filing a tax return in which gross income was
underreported, the tax loss shall be treated as equal to 28% of the
unreported gross income (34% if the taxpayer is a corporation) plus 100%
of any false credits claimed against tax, unless a more accurate
determination of the tax loss can be made.
(B) If the offense involved improperly claiming a deduction or an
exemption, the tax loss shall be treated as equal to 28% of the amount of
the improperly claimed deduction or exemption (34% if the taxpayer is
a corporation) plus 100% of any false credits claimed against tax, unless
a more accurate determination of the tax loss can be made.
(C) If the offense involved improperly claiming a deduction to provide a
basis for tax evasion in the future, the tax loss shall be treated as equal to
28% of the amount of the improperly claimed deduction (34% if the
November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment 491
– 389 –
taxpayer is a corporation) plus 100% of any false credits claimed against
tax, unless a more accurate determination of the tax loss can be made.
(2) If the offense involved failure to file a tax return, the tax loss is the
amount of tax that the taxpayer owed and did not pay.
Note: If the offense involved failure to file a tax return, the tax loss shall
be treated as equal to 20% of the gross income (25% if the taxpayer is a
corporation) less any tax withheld or otherwise paid, unless a more
accurate determination of the tax loss can be made.
(3) If the offense involved willful failure to pay tax, the tax loss is the amount
of tax that the taxpayer owed and did not pay.
(4) If the offense involved improperly claiming a refund to which the
claimant was not entitled, the tax loss is the amount of the claimed refund
to which the claimant was not entitled.
(5) The tax loss is not reduced by any payment of the tax subsequent to the
commission of the offense.".

– 390 –
sufficient information for a more accurate assessment of the tax loss. In cases involving
other types of taxes, the presumptions in the notes under subsections (c)(1) and (c)(2) do
not apply.
Example 1: A defendant files a tax return reporting income of $40,000 when his income
was actually $90,000. Under Note (A) to subsection (c)(1), the tax loss is treated as
$14,000 ($90,000 of actual gross income minus $40,000 of reported gross income =
$50,000 x 28%) unless sufficient information is available to make a more accurate
assessment of the tax loss.
Example 2: A defendant files a tax return reporting income of $60,000 when his income
was actually $130,000. In addition, the defendant claims $10,000 in false tax credits.
Under Note (A) to subsection (c)(1), the tax loss is treated as $29,600 ($130,000 of actual
gross income minus $60,000 of reported gross income = $70,000 x 28% = $19,600, plus
$10,000 of false tax credits) unless sufficient information is available to make a more
accurate assessment of the tax loss.
Example 3: A defendant fails to file a tax return for a year in which his salary was
$24,000, and $2,600 in income tax was withheld by his employer. Under the note to
subsection (c)(2), the tax loss is treated as $2,200 ($24,000 of gross income x 20% =
$4,800, minus $2,600 of tax withheld) unless sufficient information is available to make
a more accurate assessment of the tax loss.
In determining the tax loss attributable to the offense, the court should use as many
methods set forth in subsection (c) and this commentary as are necessary given the
circumstances of the particular case. If none of the methods of determining the tax loss
set forth fit the circumstances of the particular case, the court should use any method of
determining the tax loss that appears appropriate to reasonably calculate the loss that
would have resulted had the offense been successfully completed.".

The Commentary to §2T1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by inserting the
following additional notes:
"5. A ‘credit claimed against tax’ is an item that reduces the amount of tax directly.
In contrast, a ‘deduction’ is an item that reduces the amount of taxable income.
6. ‘Gross income,’ for the purposes of this section, has the same meaning as it has
in 26 U.S.C. § 61 and 26 C.F.R. § 1.61.
7. If the offense involves both individual and corporate tax returns, the tax loss is
the aggregate tax loss from the offenses taken together.".
November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment 491
– 391 –
The Commentary to §2T1.1 captioned "Background" is amended by deleting:
" This guideline relies most heavily on the amount of tax evaded because the chief
interest protected by the statute is the collection of taxes. A greater evasion is obviously
more harmful to the treasury, and more serious than a smaller one with otherwise similar
characteristics. Furthermore, as the potential benefit from tax evasion increases, the
sanction necessary to deter also increases.
The overlapping imprisonment ranges in the Sentencing Table are intended to
minimize the significance of disputes. The consequence of an inexact estimate of the tax
loss is never severe, even when the tax loss is near the boundary of a range. For
example, although the difference between $39,999 and $40,001 results in a change from
level 10 to level 11, any sentence of eight to twelve months would be within the
guidelines regardless of the offense level determination made by the court. Indeed, any
sentence between ten and twelve months would be within the guidelines for a tax loss
ranging from $20,000 to $150,000. As a consequence, for all dollar amounts, the
Sentencing Table affords the court considerable latitude in evaluating other factors, even
when the amount of the tax loss is uncertain.
Under pre-guidelines practice, roughly half of all tax evaders were sentenced to
probation without imprisonment, while the other half received sentences that required
them to serve an average prison term of twelve months. This guideline is intended to
reduce disparity in sentencing for tax evasion and to somewhat increase average sentence
length. As a result, the number of purely probationary sentences will be reduced. The
Commission believes that any additional costs of imprisonment that may be incurred as
a result of the increase in the average term of imprisonment for tax evasion are
inconsequential in relation to the potential increase in revenue. According to estimates
current at the time this guideline was originally developed (1987), income taxes are
underpaid by approximately $90 billion annually.
Although under pre-guidelines practice some large-scale evaders served as much
as five years in prison, the average sentence length for defendants sentenced to a term of
imprisonment did not increase rapidly with the amount of tax evaded. Thus, the average
time served by those sentenced to a term of imprisonment for evading less than $10,000
in taxes was about nine months, while the corresponding figure for those evading over
$100,000 in taxes was about sixteen months. Guideline sentences should result in small
increases in the average length of imprisonment for most tax cases that involve less than
$100,000 in tax evaded. The increase is expected to be somewhat larger for cases
involving more taxes.
Failure to report criminally derived income is included as a factor for deterrence
purposes. Criminally derived income is generally difficult to establish, so that the tax
loss in such cases will tend to be substantially understated. An enhancement for
offenders who violate the tax laws as part of a pattern of criminal activity from which
they derive a substantial portion of their income also serves to implement the mandate
of 28 U.S.C. § 994(i)(2). Estimates from pre-guidelines practice were that, on average,
the presence of this factor increased time served by the equivalent of 2 levels.
Although tax evasion always involves some planning, unusually sophisticated
Amendment 491 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003
– 392 –
efforts to conceal the evasion decrease the likelihood of detection and therefore warrant
an additional sanction for deterrence purposes. Analyses of pre-guidelines data for other
frauds and property crimes showed that careful planning or sophistication generally
resulted in an average increase of at least 2 levels.",
and inserting in lieu thereof:
" This guideline relies most heavily on the amount of loss that was the object of the
offense. Tax offenses, in and of themselves, are serious offenses; however, a greater tax
loss is obviously more harmful to the treasury and more serious than a smaller one with
otherwise similar characteristics. Furthermore, as the potential benefit from the offense
increases, the sanction necessary to deter also increases.
Under pre-guidelines practice, roughly half of all tax evaders were sentenced to
probation without imprisonment, while the other half received sentences that required
them to serve an average prison term of twelve months. This guideline is intended to
reduce disparity in sentencing for tax offenses and to somewhat increase average
sentence length. As a result, the number of purely probationary sentences will be
reduced. The Commission believes that any additional costs of imprisonment that may
be incurred as a result of the increase in the average term of imprisonment for tax
offenses are inconsequential in relation to the potential increase in revenue. According
to estimates current at the time this guideline was originally developed (1987), income
taxes are underpaid by approximately $90 billion annually. Guideline sentences should
result in small increases in the average length of imprisonment for most tax cases that
involve less than $100,000 in tax loss. The increase is expected to be somewhat larger
for cases involving more taxes.
Failure to report criminally derived income is included as a factor for deterrence
purposes. Criminally derived income is generally difficult to establish, so that the tax
loss in such cases will tend to be substantially understated. An enhancement for
offenders who violate the tax laws as part of a pattern of criminal activity from which
they derive a substantial portion of their income also serves to implement the mandate
of 28 U.S.C. § 994(i)(2).
Although tax offenses always involve some planning, unusually sophisticated
efforts to conceal the offense decrease the likelihood of detection and therefore warrant
an additional sanction for deterrence purposes.".
Sections 2T1.2 and 2T1.3 are deleted in their entirety as follows:
"§2T1.2. Willful Failure To File Return, Supply Information, or Pay Tax
(a) Base Offense Level:
(1) 1 level less than the level from §2T4.1 (Tax Table)
corresponding to the tax loss; or
(2) 5, if there is no tax loss.
November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment 491
– 393 –
For purposes of this guideline, ‘tax loss’ means the total amount
of tax that the taxpayer owed and did not pay, but, in the event
of a failure to file in any year, not less than 10 percent of the
amount by which the taxpayer’s gross income for that year
exceeded $20,000.
(b) Specific Offense Characteristics
(1) If the defendant failed to report or to correctly identify
the source of income exceeding $10,000 in any year from
criminal activity, increase by 2 levels. If the resulting
offense level is less than level 12, increase to level 12.
(2) If sophisticated means were used to impede discovery of
the nature or extent of the offense, increase by 2 levels.
(c) Cross Reference
(1) If the defendant is convicted of a willful violation of
26 U.S.C. § 6050I, apply §2S1.3 (Failure to Report
Monetary Transactions) in lieu of this guideline.
Commentary
Statutory Provision: 26 U.S.C. § 7203 (other than a willful violation of 26 U.S.C.
§ 6050I).
Application Notes:
1. ‘Criminal activity’ means any conduct constituting a criminal offense under
federal, state, or local law.
2. ‘Sophisticated means,’ as used in §2T1.2(b)(2), includes conduct that is more
complex or demonstrates greater intricacy or planning than a routine tax-evasion
case. An enhancement would be applied, for example, where the defendant used
offshore bank accounts or transactions through corporate shells.
3. In determining the total tax loss attributable to the offense (see §1B1.3(a)(2)), all
conduct violating the tax laws should be considered as part of the same course of
conduct or common scheme or plan unless the evidence demonstrates that the
conduct is clearly unrelated. See Application Note 3 of the Commentary to
§2T1.1.
Background: Violations of 26 U.S.C. § 7203 are usually serious misdemeanors that are
similar to tax evasion, except that there need be no affirmative act in support of the
offense. They are rarely prosecuted unless the defendant also owed taxes that he failed
to pay.
Because the conduct generally is tantamount to tax evasion, the guideline is
Amendment 491 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003
– 394 –
similar to §2T1.1. Because the offense is a misdemeanor, the offense level has been set
at one below the level corresponding to evasion of the same amount of taxes.
An alternative measure of the tax loss, 10 percent of gross income in excess of
$20,000, has been provided because of the potential difficulty of determining the amount
of tax the taxpayer owed. It is expected that this alternative measure generally will
understate the amount of tax owed.
The intended impact of this guideline is to increase the average time served for
this offense, and to increase significantly the number of violators who receive a term of
imprisonment. Under pre-guidelines practice, the average time served for this offense
was approximately 2.5 months, including those who were not sentenced to prison.
Considering only those who did serve a term of imprisonment, the average term was
about six to seven months.
§2T1.3. Fraud and False Statements Under Penalty of Perjury
(a) Base Offense Level:
(1) Level from §2T4.1 (Tax Table) corresponding to the tax
loss, if the offense was committed in order to facilitate
evasion of a tax; or
(2) 6, otherwise.
For purposes of this guideline, the ‘tax loss’ is 28 percent of the
amount by which the greater of gross income and taxable income
was understated, plus 100 percent of the total amount of any false
credits claimed against tax. If the taxpayer is a corporation, use
34 percent in lieu of 28 percent.
(b) Specific Offense Characteristics
(1) If the defendant failed to report or to correctly identify
the source of income exceeding $10,000 in any year from
criminal activity, increase by 2 levels. If the resulting
offense level is less than level 12, increase to level 12.
(2) If sophisticated means were used to impede discovery of
the nature or extent of the offense, increase by 2 levels.
Commentary
Statutory Provision: 26 U.S.C. § 7206, except § 7206(2). For additional statutory
provision(s), see Appendix A (Statutory Index).
Application Notes:
1. ‘Criminal activity’ means any conduct constituting a criminal offense under
November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment 491
– 395 –
federal, state, or local law.
2. ‘Sophisticated means,’ as used in §2T1.3(b)(2), includes conduct that is more
complex or demonstrates greater intricacy or planning than a routine tax-evasion
case. An enhancement would be applied, for example, where the defendant used
offshore bank accounts or transactions through corporate shells.
3. In determining the total tax loss attributable to the offense (see §1B1.3(a)(2)), all
conduct violating the tax laws should be considered as part of the same course of
conduct or common scheme or plan unless the evidence demonstrates that the
conduct is clearly unrelated. See Application Note 3 of the Commentary to
§2T1.1.
4. The amount by which the greater of gross income and taxable income was
understated, plus 100 percent of the total amount of any false credits claimed
against tax is calculated as follows: (1) determine the amount, if any, by which
the gross income was understated; (2) determine the amount, if any, by which the
taxable income was understated; and (3) determine the amount of any false
credit(s) claimed (a tax ‘credit’ is an item that reduces the amount of tax directly;
in contrast, a ‘deduction’ is an item that reduces the amount of taxable income).
Use the amount determined under step (1) or (2), whichever is greater, plus any
amount determined under step (3).
Background: This guideline covers conduct that usually is analogous to tax evasion,
although the elements differ. Accordingly, the offense is treated much like tax evasion.
Existence of a tax loss is not an element of these offenses. Furthermore, in
instances where the defendant is setting the groundwork for evasion of a tax that is
expected to become due in the future, he may make false statements that underreport
income that as of the time of conviction may not yet have resulted in a tax loss. In order
to gauge the seriousness of these offenses, the guidelines establish a rule for determining
a ‘tax loss’ based on the nature and magnitude of the false statements made. Use of this
approach also avoids complex problems of proof and invasion of privacy when returns
of persons other than the defendant and co-defendants are involved.".
Section 2T1.4(a)(1) is amended by deleting "resulting tax loss, if any" and inserting in lieu
thereof "tax loss".
Section 2T1.4(a)(2) is amended by deleting "otherwise" and inserting in lieu thereof "if there

Section 2T1.4(b) is amended by deleting:
"(3) If the defendant was in the business of preparing or assisting in the preparation
of tax returns, increase by 2 levels.".
The Commentary to §2T1.4 captioned "Statutory Provision" is amended by inserting "(other
than a violation based upon 26 U.S.C. § 6050I)" immediately following "§ 7206(2)".
The Commentary to §2T1.4 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by deleting Notes 1, 3,
and 4 as follows:
"1. Subsection (b)(1) applies to persons who derive a substantial portion of their
income through the promotion of tax fraud or tax evasion, e.g., through
promoting fraudulent tax shelters.",
"3. Subsection (b)(3) applies to persons who regularly act as tax preparers or advisers
for profit. Do not employ §3B1.3 (Abuse of Position of Trust or Use of Special
Skill) if this adjustment applies. Subsection (b)(1) may also apply to such
persons.
4. In certain instances, such as promotion of a tax shelter scheme, the defendant may
advise other persons to violate their tax obligations through filing returns that
find no support in the tax laws. If this type of conduct can be shown to have
resulted in the filing of false returns (regardless of whether the principals were
aware of their falsity), the misstatements in all such returns will contribute to one
aggregate ‘tax loss.’";
by renumbering Note 2 as Note 3; and by inserting the following as Notes 1 and 2:
"1. For the general principles underlying the determination of tax loss, see §2T1.1(c)
and Application Note 1 of the Commentary to §2T1.1 (Tax Evasion; Willful
Failure to File Return, Supply Information, or Pay Tax; Fraudulent or False
Returns, Statements, or Other Documents). In certain instances, such as
promotion of a tax shelter scheme, the defendant may advise other persons to
violate their tax obligations through filing returns that find no support in the tax
laws. If this type of conduct can be shown to have resulted in the filing of false
returns (regardless of whether the principals were aware of their falsity), the
misstatements in all such returns will contribute to one aggregate ‘tax loss.’
2. Subsection (b)(1) has two prongs. The first prong applies to persons who derive
a substantial portion of their income through the promotion of tax schemes, e.g.,
through promoting fraudulent tax shelters. The second prong applies to persons
who regularly prepare or assist in the preparation of tax returns for profit. If an
enhancement from this subsection applies, do not apply §3B1.3 (Abuse of
Position of Trust or Use of Special Skill).".
The Commentary to §2T1.4 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 3 (formerly
Note 2) by inserting "or fictitious entities" immediately following "corporate shells".

deleting "§2T1.3" and inserting in lieu thereof "§2T1.1".
Section 2T1.5 is deleted in its entirety as follows:
"§2T1.5. Fraudulent Returns, Statements, or Other Documents

Commentary
Statutory Provision: 26 U.S.C. § 7207.
Background: The offense is a misdemeanor. It is to be distinguished from 26 U.S.C.
§ 7206(1) (§2T1.3), which is a felony involving a false statement under penalty of
perjury. The offense level has been set at 6 in order to give the sentencing judge
considerable latitude because the conduct could be similar to tax evasion.".
Section 2T1.9 is amended in the title by deleting "Impair, Impede" and inserting in lieu thereof
"Impede, Impair, Obstruct,".
Section 2T1.9(a)(1) is amended by deleting "§2T1.3, as applicable" and inserting in lieu thereof

ascertainment, computation, assessment, or collection of revenue" immediately following
"violence".
Section 2T1.9(b)(2) is amended by deleting "impede or impair the Internal Revenue Service in
the assessment and" and inserting in lieu thereof "impede, impair, obstruct, or defeat the
ascertainment, computation, assessment, or"; and by inserting the following additional sentence
at the end:
"Do not, however, apply this adjustment if an adjustment from §2T1.4(b)(1) is applied.".
The Commentary to §2T1.9 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 2 by deleting
"§2T1.3 (whichever is applicable to the underlying conduct)" and inserting in lieu thereof
"§2T1.4 (whichever guideline most closely addresses the harm that would have resulted had
the conspirators succeeded in impeding, impairing, obstructing, or defeating the Internal
Revenue Service)".
The Commentary to §2T1.9 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by inserting the
following additional note:
"4. Subsection (b)(2) provides an enhancement where the conduct was intended to
encourage persons, other than the participants directly involved in the offense, to
violate the tax laws (e.g., an offense involving a ‘tax protest’ group that

Reason for Amendment: This amendment consolidates §§2T1.1, 2T1.2, 2T1.3, and 2T1.5,
thereby eliminating the confusion that has arisen in some cases regarding which guideline
applies. In addition, by adopting a uniform definition of tax loss, this amendment eliminates
the anomaly of using actual tax loss in some cases and an amount that differs from actual tax
loss in others. Furthermore, this amendment consolidates §2T1.4(b)(1) and (b)(3) to reflect the
substantial overlap between these subsections. Finally, this amendment adopts a revised "tax
loss" table to provide increased deterrence for tax offenses.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1993.
492. Amendment: The Commentary to §3B1.3 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by
deleting Note 1 as follows:
"1. The position of trust must have contributed in some substantial way to facilitating
the crime and not merely have provided an opportunity that could as easily have
been afforded to other persons. This adjustment, for example, would not apply
to an embezzlement by an ordinary bank teller.",
and inserting in lieu thereof:
"1. ‘Public or private trust’ refers to a position of public or private trust characterized
by professional or managerial discretion (i.e., substantial discretionary judgment
that is ordinarily given considerable deference). Persons holding such positions
ordinarily are subject to significantly less supervision than employees whose
responsibilities are primarily non-discretionary in nature. For this enhancement
to apply, the position of trust must have contributed in some significant way to
facilitating the commission or concealment of the offense (e.g., by making the
detection of the offense or the defendant’s responsibility for the offense more
difficult). This adjustment, for example, would apply in the case of an
embezzlement of a client’s funds by an attorney serving as a guardian, a bank
executive’s fraudulent loan scheme, or the criminal sexual abuse of a patient by
a physician under the guise of an examination. This adjustment would not apply
in the case of an embezzlement or theft by an ordinary bank teller or hotel clerk
because such positions are not characterized by the above-described factors.
Notwithstanding the preceding paragraph, because of the special nature of the
United States mail an adjustment for an abuse of a position of trust will apply to
any employee of the U.S. Postal Service who engages in the theft or destruction
of undelivered United States mail.".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment reformulates the definition of an abuse of position
of trust to better distinguish cases warranting this enhancement.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1993.
Amendment 492 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003
– 400 –
493. Amendment: The Commentary to §4A1.2 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note
1 by inserting the following additional sentence at the end of the first paragraph:
"Conduct that is part of the instant offense means conduct that is relevant conduct to the
instant offense under the provisions of §1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct).".
The Commentary to §4A1.2 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 6 in the first
sentence of the first paragraph by inserting "(A)" immediately before "have been reversed"; by
deleting the comma following "law"; and by inserting "or (B) have been ruled constitutionally
invalid in a prior case" immediately before "are not to be counted";
The Commentary to §4A1.2 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 6 by deleting
the second sentence as follows:
"Also, sentences resulting from convictions that a defendant shows to have been
previously ruled constitutionally invalid are not to be counted.",
and inserting in lieu thereof:
"With respect to the current sentencing proceeding, this guideline and commentary do
not confer upon the defendant any right to attack collaterally a prior conviction or
sentence beyond any such rights otherwise recognized in law (e.g., 21 U.S.C. § 851
expressly provides that a defendant may collaterally attack certain prior convictions).";
and by beginning a new paragraph with the third sentence.
The Commentary to §4A1.2 captioned "Background" is amended by deleting the second
paragraph as follows:
"The Commission leaves for court determination the issue of whether a defendant may
collaterally attack at sentencing a prior conviction.".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment expressly provides that the term "part of the instant
offense" in §4A1.2(a)(1) means relevant conduct as defined in §1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct) to
avoid double counting and ensure consistency with other guideline provisions.
This amendment also clarifies the Commission’s intent with respect to whether §4A1.2 confers
on defendants a right to attack prior convictions collaterally at sentencing, an issue on which
the appellate courts have differed. Compare, e.g., United States v. Canales, 960 F.2d 1311,
1316 (5th Cir. 1992) (Section 4A1.2 commentary indicates Commission intended to grant
sentencing courts discretion to entertain initial defendant challenges to prior convictions);
United States v. Jacobetz, 955 F.2d 786, 805 (2d Cir.) (similar), cert. denied, 113 S. Ct. 104
(1992); United States v. Cornog, 945 F.2d 1504, 1511 (11th Cir. 1991) (similar) with United
States v. Hewitt, 942 F.2d 1270, 1276 (8th Cir. 1991) (commentary indicates defendants may
only challenge use of prior convictions at sentencing by showing such conviction previously
ruled invalid). This amendment addresses this inter-circuit conflict in interpreting the
commentary by stating more clearly that the Commission does not intend to enlarge a
defendant’s right to attack collaterally a prior conviction at the current sentencing proceeding
beyond any right otherwise recognized in law.
November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment 495
– 401 –
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1993.
494. The Commentary to §5G1.3 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in the second paragraph
of Note 2 by deleting "40" and inserting in lieu thereof "30", and by deleting "55" and inserting
in lieu thereof "45".
The Commentary to §5G1.3 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by inserting the
following additional note:
"4. If the defendant was on federal or state probation, parole, or supervised release
at the time of the instant offense, and has had such probation, parole, or
supervised release revoked, the sentence for the instant offense should be
imposed to be served consecutively to the term imposed for the violation of
probation, parole, or supervised release in order to provide an incremental penalty
for the violation of probation, parole, or supervised release (in accord with the
policy expressed in §§7B1.3 and 7B1.4).".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment adds an application note to §5G1.3 to provide
guidance in the case of a defendant who was on federal or state probation, parole, or supervised
release at the time of the instant federal offense and has had such term of supervision revoked
prior to sentencing on the instant federal offense. In addition, this amendment corrects a
mathematical error in an example.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1993.
495. Amendment: The Commentary to §6B1.2 is amended by inserting the following additional
paragraph at the end:
" The Commission encourages the prosecuting attorney prior to the entry of a plea
of guilty or nolo contendere under Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure
to disclose to the defendant the facts and circumstances of the offense and offender
characteristics, then known to the prosecuting attorney, that are relevant to the
application of the sentencing guidelines. This recommendation, however, shall not be
construed to confer upon the defendant any right not otherwise recognized in law.".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment adds commentary to §6B1.2 recommending that
the prosecuting attorney disclose to the defendant the facts and circumstances of the offense and
offender characteristics then known to the prosecuting attorney that are relevant to the
application of the guidelines in order to encourage plea negotiations that realistically reflect
probable outcomes.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1993.
496. Amendment: Appendix A (Statutory Index) is amended in the second paragraph of the
introduction by deleting "or an attempt" and inserting in lieu thereof ", attempt, or solicitation".

references to several Class B and C misdemeanor offenses to which the guidelines do not apply.
In addition, this amendment conforms §3D1.2(d), §8C2.1, and the Commentary to §§2X1.1,
3C1.1, and 8C2.4 to the consolidation of offense guidelines under amendments 481, 490, and

Reason for Amendment: This amendment clarifies the Commission’s intent that, absent an
instruction to the contrary, adjustments from different guideline sections are to be applied
November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment 503
– 411 –
cumulatively.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1993.
498. Amendment: The Commentary to §1B1.7 is amended by deleting the second paragraph as
follows:
" In stating that failure to follow certain commentary ‘could constitute an incorrect
application of the guidelines,’ the Commission simply means that in seeking to
understand the meaning of the guidelines courts likely will look to the commentary for
guidance as an indication of the intent of those who wrote them. In such instances, the
courts will treat the commentary much like legislative history or other legal material that
helps determine the intent of a drafter.",
and inserting in lieu thereof:
" ‘[C]ommentary in the Guidelines Manual that interprets or explains a guideline
is authoritative unless it violates the Constitution or a federal statute, or is inconsistent
with, or a plainly erroneous reading of, that guideline.’ Stinson v. United States, 113 S.
Ct. 1913, 1915 (1993).".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment revises the commentary to this section to reflect
the decision of the Supreme Court in Stinson v. United States, 113 S. Ct. 1913, 1915 (1993).
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1993.

10 in the "Drug Equivalency Tables" in the subdivision captioned "LSD, PCP, and other

"Phenylcyclohexamine (PCE) = 5.79 kg of marihuana"
and inserting in lieu thereof:
"N-ethyl-1-phenylcyclohexylamine (PCE)= 1 kg of marihuana".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment revises the equivalency for PCE to reflect a
reassessment of the potency of this controlled substance by the Drug Enforcement
Administration. In addition, this amendment corrects an error in the scientific name for this
controlled substance.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1993.
500. Amendment: The Commentary to §3B1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by
renumbering Notes 2 and 3 as 3 and 4, respectively; and by inserting the following additional
note:
"2. To qualify for an adjustment under this section, the defendant must have been the
organizer, leader, manager, or supervisor of one or more other participants. An
Amendment 499 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003
– 412 –
upward departure may be warranted, however, in the case of a defendant who did
not organize, lead, manage, or supervise another participant, but who nevertheless
exercised management responsibility over the property, assets, or activities of a
criminal organization.".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment clarifies the operation of this section to resolve a
split among the courts of appeal. Compare United States v. Carroll, 893 F.2d 1502 (6th Cir.
1990) (requiring degree of control over other persons for §3B1.1 to apply); United States v.
Fuller, 897 F.2d 1217 (1st Cir. 1990) (same); United States v. Mares-Molina, 913 F.2d 770 (9th
Cir. 1990) (same) and United States v. Fuentes, 954 F.2d 151 (3d Cir.) (same), cert. denied, 112
S.Ct. 2950 (1992) with United States v. Chambers, 985 F.2d 1263 (4th Cir.) (defendant may
be a "manager" even though he did not directly supervise other persons), petition for cert. filed,
No. 92-8737 (U.S. May 17, 1993).
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1993.
501. Amendment: The Commentary to §5E1.1 captioned "Background" is amended in the second
paragraph by inserting the following additional sentence as the first sentence:
"A court’s authority to decline to order restitution is limited.";
by inserting, immediately after "18 U.S.C. § 3663(d).", the following:
"The legislative history of 18 U.S.C. § 3579, the precursor of 18 U.S.C. § 3663, states
that even ‘[i]n those unusual cases where the precise amount owed is difficult to
determine, the section authorizes the court to reach an expeditious, reasonable
determination of appropriate restitution by resolving uncertainties with a view toward
achieving fairness to the victim.’ S. Rep. No. 532, 97th Cong., 2d Sess. 31, reprinted in
1982 U.S. Code Cong. & Ad. News 2515, 2537.";
and by inserting the following additional sentence as the last sentence:
"Subsection (a)(2) provides for restitution as a condition of probation or supervised
release for offenses not set forth in Title 18, United States Code, or 49 U.S.C. § 1472(h),
(i), (j), or (n).".
The Commentary to §5E1.1 captioned "Background" is amended by deleting the fifth paragraph
as follows:
" A court’s authority to deny restitution is limited. Even ‘in those unusual cases
where the precise amount owed is difficult to determine, section 3579(d) authorizes the
court to reach an expeditious, reasonable determination of appropriate restitution by
resolving uncertainties with a view toward achieving fairness to the victim.’ S. Rep. No.
532, 97th Cong., 2d Sess. 31, reprinted in 1982 U.S. Code Cong. & Ad. News 2515,
2537.";
and by deleting the seventh paragraph as follows:
November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment 503
– 413 –
" Subsection (a)(2) provides for restitution as a condition of probation or supervised
release for offenses not set forth in Title 18, United States Code, or 49 U.S.C. § 1472(h),
(i), (j), or (n).".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment updates the background commentary of §5E1.1 to
reflect the redesignation of 18 U.S.C. § 3579 as 18 U.S.C. § 3663. In addition, it moves
material from the fifth and seventh paragraphs to the second paragraph to enhance clarity.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1993.
502. Amendment: Section 1B1.10(d) is amended by deleting "and 461" and inserting in lieu thereof
"454, 461, 484, 488, 490, and 499".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment expands the listing in §1B1.10(d) to implement the
directive in 28 U.S.C. § 994(u) in respect to guideline amendments that may be considered for
retroactive application.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1993.
503. Amendment: The Commentary to §1B1.3 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note
2 by inserting the following additional paragraph as the eighth paragraph:
"A defendant’s relevant conduct does not include the conduct of members of a
conspiracy prior to the defendant joining the conspiracy, even if the defendant knows of
that conduct (e.g., in the case of a defendant who joins an ongoing drug distribution
conspiracy knowing that it had been selling two kilograms of cocaine per week, the
cocaine sold prior to the defendant joining the conspiracy is not included as relevant
conduct in determining the defendant’s offense level). The Commission does not
foreclose the possibility that there may be some unusual set of circumstances in which
the exclusion of such conduct may not adequately reflect the defendant’s culpability; in
such a case, an upward departure may be warranted.".
The Commentary to §1B1.3 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 9(B) by deleting
"and the time interval between the offenses" and inserting in lieu thereof:
", the regularity (repetitions) of the offenses, and the time interval between the offenses.
When one of the above factors is absent, a stronger presence of at least one of the other
factors is required. For example, where the conduct alleged to be relevant is relatively
remote to the offense of conviction, a stronger showing of similarity or regularity is
necessary to compensate for the absence of temporal proximity".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment clarifies the operation of §1B1.3 with respect to
the defendant’s accountability for the actions of other conspirators prior to the defendant joining
the conspiracy. The amendment is in accord with the rule stated in recent caselaw. See, e.g.,
United States v. Carreon, 11 F.3d 1225 (5th Cir. 1994); United States v. Petty, 982 F.2d 1374,
1377 (9th Cir. 1993); United States v. O’Campo, 973 F.2d 1015, 1026 (1st Cir. 1992). Cf.
United States v. Miranda-Ortiz, 926 F.2d 172, 178 (2d Cir. 1991); United States v. Edwards,
945 F.2d 1387, 1393 (7th Cir. 1991)) (applying earlier versions of §1B1.3). In addition, this
amendment adds a well-phrased formulation, developed by the Ninth Circuit in United States
Amendment 503 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003
– 414 –
v. Hahn, 960 F.2d 903 (9th Cir. 1992), addressing the circumstances in which multiple acts
constitute the "same course of conduct."
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1994.
504. Amendment: Section 1B1.10(a) is amended by deleting "guidelines" and inserting in lieu
thereof "Guidelines Manual"; by deleting "may be considered" and inserting in lieu thereof "is
authorized"; by inserting "and thus is not authorized" immediately following "policy
statement"; and by deleting "subsection (d)" wherever it appears and inserting in lieu thereof
in each instance "subsection (c)".
Section 1B1.10(b) is amended by inserting ", and to what extent," immediately before "a
reduction"; and by deleting:
"originally imposed had the guidelines, as amended, been in effect at that time",
and inserting in lieu thereof:
"imposed had the amendment(s) to the guidelines listed in subsection (c) been in effect
at the time the defendant was sentenced".
Section 1B1.10 is amended by deleting:
"(c) Provided, that a reduction in a defendant’s term of imprisonment may, in no
event, exceed the number of months by which the maximum of the guideline
range applicable to the defendant (from Chapter Five, Part A) has been lowered.";
and by redesignating subsection (d) as subsection (c).
Section 1B1.10(c)(formerly subsection (d)) is amended by inserting "371," immediately before
"379"; and by deleting "and 499" and inserting in lieu thereof "499, and 506".
The Commentary to §1B1.10 captioned "Application Note" is amended by deleting "Note" and
inserting in lieu thereof "Notes"; and by deleting:
"1. Although eligibility for consideration under 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2) is triggered
only by an amendment listed in subsection (d) of this section, the amended
guideline range referred to in subsections (b) and (c) of this section is to be
determined by applying all amendments to the guidelines (i.e., as if the defendant
was being sentenced under the guidelines currently in effect).",
and inserting in lieu thereof:
"1. Eligibility for consideration under 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2) is triggered only by an
amendment listed in subsection (c) that lowers the applicable guideline range.
2. In determining the amended guideline range under subsection (b), the court shall
substitute only the amendments listed in subsection (c) for the corresponding
guideline provisions that were applied when the defendant was sentenced. All
November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment 505
– 415 –
other guideline application decisions remain unaffected.".
The Commentary to §1B1.10 captioned "Background" is amended in the third paragraph by
deleting "subsection (d)" and inserting in lieu thereof "subsection (c)".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment simplifies the operation of §1B1.10 by providing
that, in determining an amended guideline range, the court will use only those amendments
expressly designated as retroactive. In addition, this amendment deletes §1B1.10(c), a rather
complex subsection, as an unnecessary restriction on the court’s consideration of a revised
sentence, redesignates §1B1.10(d) as §1B1.10(c), and makes a number of minor clarifying
revisions. This amendment also expands the listing in §1B1.10(c) (formerly §1B1.10(d)) to
implement the directive in 28 U.S.C. § 994(u) with respect to guideline amendments that may
be considered for retroactive application.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1994.
505. Amendment: Section 2D1.1(c) is amended by deleting:
"(1) 300 KG or more of Heroin (or the equivalent amount of other Level 42
Schedule I or II Opiates);
1500 KG or more of Cocaine (or the equivalent amount of other
Schedule I or II Stimulants);
15 KG or more of Cocaine Base;
300 KG or more of PCP, or 30 KG or more of PCP (actual);

or at least 10 KG but less than 30 KG of Methamphetamine
(actual), or at least 10 KG but less than 30 KG of "Ice";

amount of other Schedule I or II Hallucinogens);
At least 40 KG but less than 120 KG of Fentanyl;
At least 10 KG but less than 30 KG of a Fentanyl Analogue;
At least 100,000 KG but less than 300,000 KG of Marihuana;
Amendment 505 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003
– 416 –
At least 20,000 KG but less than 60,000 KG of Hashish;
At least 2,000 KG but less than 6,000 KG of Hashish Oil.
(3) At least 30 KG but less than 100 KG of Heroin (or the Level 38
equivalent amount of other Schedule I or II Opiates);
At least 150 KG but less than 500 KG of Cocaine (or the
equivalent amount of other Schedule I or II Stimulants);
At least 1.5 KG but less than 5 KG of Cocaine Base;
At least 30 KG but less than 100 KG of PCP, or at least 3 KG
but less than 10 KG of PCP (actual);

At least 6,000 KG but less than 20,000 KG of Hashish;
At least 600 KG but less than 2,000 KG of Hashish Oil.",
and inserting in lieu thereof:

150 KG or more of Cocaine (or the
equivalent amount of other Schedule I or II

12 KG or more of Fentanyl;
3 KG or more of a Fentanyl Analogue;
30,000 KG or more of Marihuana;
6,000 KG or more of Hashish;
600 KG or more of Hashish Oil.";
and by renumbering subdivisions 4-19 as 2-17, respectively.
The Commentary to §2D1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 14 by deleting
"860(b)(4)" and inserting in lieu thereof "960(b)(4)".
The Commentary to §2D1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 16 by deleting
"40" and inserting in lieu thereof "38"; by deleting "35" wherever it appears and inserting in
November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment 506
– 417 –
lieu thereof in each instance "33"; and by deleting "4 levels" and inserting in lieu thereof "2
levels".
The Commentary to §2D1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by inserting the
following additional note:
"19. In an extraordinary case, an upward departure above offense level 38 on the basis
of drug quantity may be warranted. For example, an upward departure may be
warranted where the quantity is at least ten times the minimum quantity required
for level 38.".
The Commentary to §2D1.6 captioned "Application Note" is amended in Note 1 by deleting
"(§2D1.1(c)(16))" and inserting in lieu thereof "(§2D1.1(c)(14))"; and by deleting
"(§2D1.1(c)(19))" and inserting in lieu thereof "(§2D1.1(c)(17))".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment sets the upper limit of the Drug Quantity Table in
§2D1.1 at level 38. The Commission has determined that the extension of the Drug Quantity
Table above level 38 for quantity itself is not required to ensure adequate punishment given that
organizers, leaders, managers, and supervisors of such offenses will receive a 4-, 3-, or 2-level
enhancement for their role in the offense, and any participant will receive an additional 2-level
enhancement if a dangerous weapon is possessed in the offense. The Commission, however,
has not foreclosed the possibility of an upward departure above offense level 38 on the basis
of drug quantity in an extraordinary case. In addition, this amendment corrects a typographical
error in a statutory reference.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1994.
506. Amendment: The Commentary to §4B1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note
2 by deleting:
"‘Offense Statutory Maximum’ refers to the maximum term of imprisonment authorized
for the offense of conviction that is a crime of violence or controlled substance offense.",
and inserting in lieu thereof:
"‘Offense Statutory Maximum,’ for the purposes of this guideline, refers to the maximum
term of imprisonment authorized for the offense of conviction that is a crime of violence
or controlled substance offense, not including any increase in that maximum term under
a sentencing enhancement provision that applies because of the defendant’s prior
criminal record (such sentencing enhancement provisions are contained, for example, in
21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(A), (b)(1)(B), (b)(1)(C), and (b)(1)(D)). For example, where the
statutory maximum term of imprisonment under 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(C) is increased
from twenty years to thirty years because the defendant has one or more qualifying prior
drug convictions, the ‘Offense Statutory Maximum’ for the purposes of this guideline is
twenty years and not thirty years.".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment defines the term "offense statutory maximum" in
§4B1.1 to mean the statutory maximum prior to any enhancement based on prior criminal
record (i.e., an enhancement of the statutory maximum sentence that itself was based upon the
Amendment 506 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003
– 418 –
defendant’s prior criminal record will not be used in determining the alternative offense level
under this guideline). This rule avoids unwarranted double counting as well as unwarranted
disparity associated with variations in the exercise of prosecutorial discretion in seeking
enhanced penalties based on prior convictions. It is noted that when the instruction to the
Commission that underlies §4B1.1 (28 U.S.C. § 994(h)) was enacted by the Congress in 1984,
the enhanced maximum sentences provided for recidivist drug offenders (e.g., under 21 U.S.C.
§ 841) did not exist.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1994.
507. Amendment: The Commentary to §5G1.2 is amended in the fourth paragraph by deleting
"3D1.2" and inserting in lieu thereof "3D1.1"; and by inserting the following additional
sentences at the end:
"Note, however, that even in the case of a consecutive term of imprisonment imposed
under subsection (a), any term of supervised release imposed is to run concurrently with
any other term of supervised release imposed. See 18 U.S.C. § 3624(e).".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment revises the Commentary to §5G1.2 to clarify that
the Commission’s interpretation is that 18 U.S.C. § 3624(e) requires multiple terms of
supervised release to run concurrently in all cases. This interpretation is in accord with the
view stated in United States v. Gullickson, 982 F.2d 1231, 1236 (8th Cir. 1993). In contrast,
two courts of appeals have cited the current commentary as supporting the view that,
notwithstanding the language in 18 U.S.C. § 3624(e) stating that terms of supervised release
run concurrently, a court may order that supervised release terms run consecutively under
certain circumstances. See United States v. Shorthouse, 7 F.3d 149 (9th Cir. 1993); United
States v. Maxwell, 966 F.2d 545, 551 (10th Cir. 1992).
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1994.
508. Amendment: The Introductory Commentary to Chapter Five, Part H, is amended in the second
paragraph by inserting the following additional sentences at the end:
"Furthermore, although these factors are not ordinarily relevant to the determination of
whether a sentence should be outside the applicable guideline range, they may be
relevant to this determination in exceptional cases. See §5K2.0 (Grounds for
Departure).".
Section 5K2.0 is amended by inserting the following additional paragraph as the fourth
paragraph:
"An offender characteristic or other circumstance that is not ordinarily relevant in
determining whether a sentence should be outside the applicable guideline range may be
relevant to this determination if such characteristic or circumstance is present to an
unusual degree and distinguishes the case from the ‘heartland’ cases covered by the
guidelines in a way that is important to the statutory purposes of sentencing.".
Section 5K2.0 is amended by inserting the following commentary at the end:
November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment 509
– 419 –
"Commentary
The last paragraph of this policy statement sets forth the conditions under which
an offender characteristic or other circumstance that is not ordinarily relevant to a
departure from the applicable guideline range may be relevant to this determination. The
Commission does not foreclose the possibility of an extraordinary case that, because of
a combination of such characteristics or circumstances, differs significantly from the
‘heartland’ cases covered by the guidelines in a way that is important to the statutory
purposes of sentencing, even though none of the characteristics or circumstances
individually distinguishes the case. However, the Commission believes that such cases
will be extremely rare.
In the absence of a characteristic or circumstance that distinguishes a case as
sufficiently atypical to warrant a sentence different from that called for under the
guidelines, a sentence outside the guideline range is not authorized. See 18 U.S.C. §
3553(b). For example, dissatisfaction with the available sentencing range or a preference
for a different sentence than that authorized by the guidelines is not an appropriate basis
for a sentence outside the applicable guideline range.".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment revises §5K2.0 and the Introductory Commentary
to Chapter Five, Part H to provide guidance as to when an offender characteristic or other
circumstance (or combination of such characteristics or circumstances) that is not ordinarily
relevant to a determination of whether a sentence should be outside the applicable guideline
range may be relevant to this determination.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1994.
509. Amendment: The Commentary to §2D1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note
7 by inserting the following additional sentences at the end:
"In addition, 18 U.S.C. § 3553(f) provides an exception to the applicability of mandatory
minimum sentences in certain cases. See §5C1.2 (Limitation on Applicability of
Statutory Minimum Sentences in Certain Cases).".
The Commentary to §2D2.1 captioned "Background" is amended in the first paragraph by
inserting "(statutory)" immediately following "Mandatory"; and by deleting "§5G1.1(b)" and
inserting in lieu thereof:
Amendment 509 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003
– 420 –
"See §5G1.1(b). Note, however, that 18 U.S.C. § 3553(f) provides an exception to the
applicability of mandatory minimum sentences in certain cases. See §5C1.2 (Limitation
on Applicability of Statutory Minimum Sentences in Certain Cases).".
Chapter Five, Part C, is amended by inserting an additional guideline with accompanying
commentary as §5C1.2 (Limitation on Applicability of Statutory Minimum Sentences in Certain
Cases).
Reason for Amendment: This amendment adds a new guideline as §5C1.2, and revises the
commentary in §§2D1.1 and 2D1.2, to reflect the addition of 18 U.S.C. § 3553(f) by section
80001 of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is September 23, 1994.
510. Amendment: Section 2A2.3 is amended by inserting the following additional subsection:
"(b) Specific Offense Characteristic
(1) If the offense resulted in substantial bodily injury to an individual under
the age of sixteen years, increase by 4 levels.".
The Commentary to §2A2.3 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by inserting the
following additional note:
"3. ‘Substantial bodily injury’ means ‘bodily injury which involves - (A) a temporary
but substantial disfigurement; or (B) a temporary but substantial loss or
impairment of the function of any bodily member, organ, or mental faculty.’
18 U.S.C. § 113(b)(1).".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment addresses the enactment of 18 U.S.C. § 113(a)(7)
(pertaining to certain assaults against minors) by section 170201 of the Violent Crime Control
and Law Enforcement Act of 1994.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1995.
511. Amendment: The Commentary to §2A3.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by
inserting the following additional notes:
"6. If a victim was sexually abused by more than one participant, an upward
departure may be warranted. See §5K2.8 (Extreme Conduct).
7. If the defendant’s criminal history includes a prior sentence for conduct that is
similar to the instant offense, an upward departure may be warranted.".
The Commentary to §2A3.2 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by inserting the
following additional note:
"4. If the defendant’s criminal history includes a prior sentence for conduct that is
November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment 512
– 421 –
similar to the instant offense, an upward departure may be warranted.".
The Commentary to §2A3.3 captioned "Application Note" is amended by deleting "Note" and
inserting in lieu thereof "Notes"; and by inserting the following additional note:
"2. If the defendant’s criminal history includes a prior sentence for conduct that is
similar to the instant offense, an upward departure may be warranted.".
The Commentary to §2A3.4 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by inserting the
following additional note:
"5. If the defendant’s criminal history includes a prior sentence for conduct that is
similar to the instant offense, an upward departure may be warranted.".
Reason for Amendment: Section 40111 of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement
Act of 1994 doubles the authorized maximum term of imprisonment for defendants convicted
of sexual abuse offenses who have been convicted previously of aggravated sexual abuse,
sexual abuse, or aggravated sexual contact (18 U.S.C. § 2247) and directs the Sentencing
Commission to implement this provision by promulgating amendments, if appropriate, to the
applicable sentencing guidelines. Although the Chapter Two sexual abuse guidelines do not
provide for enhancement for repeat sex offenses, Chapter Four (Criminal History and Criminal
Livelihood) does include a determination of the seriousness of the defendant’s criminal record
based upon prior convictions (§4A1.1). Section 4B1.1 (Career Offender) also provides
substantially enhanced penalties for offenders who engage in a crime of violence (including
forcible sexual offenses) or controlled substance trafficking offense, having been sentenced
previously on two or more occasions for offenses of either type. Moreover, §4A1.3 (Adequacy
of Criminal History category) provides that an upward departure may be considered "[i]f
reliable information indicates that the criminal history category does not reflect the seriousness
of the defendant’s past criminal conduct or the likelihood that the defendant will commit other
crimes." This amendment strengthens the sexual offense guidelines by expressly listing as a
basis for upward departure the fact that the defendant has a prior sentence for conduct similar
to the instant sexual offense.
Section 40112 of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 directs the
Commission to conduct a study and consider the adequacy of the guidelines for sexual offenses
with respect to a number of factors. The provision also requires the preparation of a report to
Congress analyzing federal rape sentences and obtaining comment from independent experts.
See Report to Congress: Analysis of Penalties for Federal Rape Cases (March 13, 1995). The
Commission found that, in general, the current guidelines provide appropriate penalties for
these offenses. This amendment strengthens §2A3.1 (Criminal Sexual Abuse; Attempt to
Commit Criminal Sexual Abuse) in one respect by expressly listing as a basis for an upward
departure the fact that a victim was sexually abused by more than one participant.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1995.
512. Amendment: Section 2B1.1(b) is amended by deleting:
"(2) If (A) a firearm, destructive device, or controlled substance was taken, or the
Amendment 512 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003
– 422 –
taking of such item was an object of the offense; or (B) the stolen property
received, transported, transferred, transmitted, or possessed was a firearm,
destructive device, or controlled substance, increase by 1 level; but if the
resulting offense level is less than 7, increase to level 7.";
and by renumbering the remaining subdivisions accordingly.
Section 2B1.1 is amended by inserting the following additional subsection:
"(c) Cross Reference
(1) If (A) a firearm, destructive device, explosive material, or controlled
substance was taken, or the taking of such item was an object of the
offense, or (B) the stolen property received, transported, transferred,
transmitted, or possessed was a firearm, destructive device, explosive
material, or controlled substance, apply §2D1.1 (Unlawful

Materials; Prohibited Transactions Involving Explosive Materials), or
§2K2.1 (Unlawful Receipt, Possession, or Transportation of Firearms or
Ammunition; Prohibited Transactions Involving Firearms or
Ammunition), as appropriate, if the resulting offense level is greater than
that determined above.".
The Commentary to §2B1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 8 by deleting
"(b)(6)" and inserting in lieu thereof "(b)(5)".
The Commentary to §2B1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 11 by deleting
"(b)(7)(B)" and inserting in lieu thereof "(b)(6)(B)".
The Commentary to §2B1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 13 by deleting
"(b)(7)(A)" and inserting in lieu thereof "(b)(6)(A)".
The Commentary to §2B1.1 captioned "Background" is amended by deleting the fourth
paragraph as follows:
" Studies show that stolen firearms are used disproportionately in the commission
of crimes. The guidelines provide an enhancement for theft of a firearm to ensure that
some amount of imprisonment is required. An enhancement is also provided when
controlled substances are taken. Such thefts may involve a greater risk of violence, as
well as a likelihood that the substance will be abused.".
The Commentary to §2B1.1 captioned "Background" is amended in the sixth (formerly the
seventh) paragraph by deleting "(b)(7)(A)" and inserting in lieu thereof "(b)(6)(A)"; and in the
seventh (formerly the eighth) paragraph by deleting "(b)(7)(B)" and inserting in lieu thereof
"(b)(6)(B)".
November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment 513
– 423 –
Reason for Amendment: This amendment addresses an inconsistency in guideline penalties
between theft offenses involving the taking of firearms or controlled substances that are
sentenced under §2B1.1 (Larceny, Embezzlement, and Other Forms of Theft; Receiving,
Transporting, Transferring, Transmitting, or Possessing Stolen Property) and similar offenses
sentenced under §2D1.1 (Unlawful Manufacturing, Importing, Exporting, or Trafficking;
Attempt or Conspiracy), §2D2.1 (Unlawful Possession; Attempt or Conspiracy), §2K1.3
(Unlawful Receipt, Possession, or Transportation of Explosive Materials; Prohibited
Transactions Involving Explosive Materials), or §2K2.1 (Unlawful Receipt, Possession, or
Transportation of Firearms or Ammunition; Prohibited Transactions Involving Firearms or
Ammunition) by deleting the specific offense characteristic in §2B1.1 applicable in such
instances and inserting in lieu thereof a cross reference directing the application of §2D1.1,
§2D2.1, §2K1.3, or §2K2.1, as appropriate, if the resulting offense level is greater.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1995.
513. Amendment: Section 2B5.1(b) is amended by inserting the following additional subdivision:
"(3) If a dangerous weapon (including a firearm) was possessed in connection with the
offense, increase by 2 levels. If the resulting offense level is less than level 13,
increase to level 13.".
The Commentary to §2B5.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 2 by deleting
"2B5.2" and inserting in lieu thereof "2F1.1".
The Commentary to §2B5.1 captioned "Background" is amended by inserting the following
additional paragraph as the second paragraph:
" Subsection (b)(3) implements, in a broader form, the instruction to the
Commission in section 110512 of Public Law 103-322.".
Section 2F1.1(b)(4) is amended by inserting "(A)" immediately following "involved"; and by
inserting "or (B) possession of a dangerous weapon (including a firearm) in connection with the
offense," immediately following "injury,".
The Commentary to §2F1.1 captioned "Statutory Provisions" is amended by deleting "78d,"
immediately following "77x,".
The Commentary to §2F1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 12 by inserting
"Hate Crime Motivation or" immediately before "Vulnerable Victim".
The Commentary to §2F1.1 captioned "Background" is amended by inserting the following
additional paragraph as the sixth paragraph:
" Subsection (b)(4)(B) implements, in a broader form, the instruction to the
Commission in section 110512 of Public Law 103-322.".
Amendment 513 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003
– 424 –
Reason for Amendment: Section 110512 of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement
Act of 1994 directs the Commission to amend its sentencing guidelines to provide an appropriate
enhancement for a defendant convicted of a felony under Chapter 25 (Counterfeiting and
Forgery) of title 18, United States Code, if the defendant used or carried a firearm during and
in relation to the offense. This amendment implements this directive in a somewhat broader
form.
In addition, this amendment corrects an outdated reference in the Commentary to §2B5.1
(Offenses Involving Counterfeit Bearer Obligations of the United States) and conforms the
Commentary to §2F1.1 (Fraud and Deceit; Forgery; Offenses Involving Altered or Counterfeit
Instruments Other than Counterfeit Bearer Obligations of the United States) with respect to the
amended title of §3A1.1 (Hate Crime Motivation or Vulnerable Victim).
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1995.
514. Amendment: Section 2D1.1(b) is amended by inserting the following additional subdivision:
"(3) If the object of the offense was the distribution of a controlled substance in a
prison, correctional facility, or detention facility, increase by 2 levels.".
Section 2D2.1(b) is amended by deleting "Reference" and inserting in lieu thereof "References";
and by inserting the following new subdivision:
"(2) If the offense involved possession of a controlled substance in a prison,
correctional facility, or detention facility, apply §2P1.2 (Providing or Possessing
Contraband in Prison).".
Reason for Amendment: Section 90103 of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement
Act of 1994 directs the Commission to amend the guidelines to provide an adequate
enhancement for an offense under 21 U.S.C. § 841 that involves distributing a controlled
substance in a federal prison or detention facility. This amendment addresses this directive by
adding a two-level enhancement to §2D1.1 (Unlawful Manufacturing, Importing, Exporting, or
Trafficking; Attempt or Conspiracy) for an offense involving a prison or detention facility,
similar to the enhancement provided for drug distribution in other protected locations at §2D1.2
(Drug Offenses Occurring Near Protected Locations or Involving Underage or Pregnant
Individuals; Attempt or Conspiracy).
Section 90103 also directs the Commission to amend the guidelines to provide an appropriate
enhancement for an offense of simple possession of a controlled substance under 21 U.S.C. §
844 that occurs in a federal prison or detention facility. This amendment addresses this directive
by providing a cross reference in §2D2.1 (Unlawful Possession; Attempt or Conspiracy) that
references §2P1.2 (Providing or Possessing Contraband in Prison) in such cases.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1995.
515. Amendment: Section 2D1.1(b) is amended by inserting the following additional subdivision:
"(4) If the defendant meets the criteria set forth in subdivisions (1)-(5) of §5C1.2
November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment 516
– 425 –
(Limitation on Applicability of Statutory Minimum Sentences in Certain Cases)
and the offense level determined above is level 26 or greater, decrease by 2
levels.".
Section 5C1.2, effective September 23, 1994, is repromulgated with the editorial changes set
forth below.
The Commentary to §5C1.2 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 6 by deleting
"leader, organizer" and inserting in lieu thereof "organizer, leader".
The Commentary to §5C1.2 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 8 by deleting
"Rule 32(a)(1), Fed. R. Crim. P." and inserting in lieu thereof "Fed. R. Crim. P. 32(c)(1), (3).".
The Commentary to §5C1.2 captioned "Background" is amended by deleting "103-"
immediately before "460".
Reason for Amendment: Section 80001(b) of the Violent Crime Control and Law
Enforcement Act of 1994 directs the Commission to promulgate guidelines and policy
statements to implement section 80001(a) (providing an exception to otherwise applicable
statutory minimum sentences for certain defendants convicted of specified drug offenses).
Pursuant to this provision, the Commission promulgated §5C1.2 (Limitation on Applicability
of Statutory Minimum Sentences in Certain Cases) as an emergency amendment, effective
September 23, 1994. Under the terms of the congressionally-granted authority, this amendment
is temporary unless repromulgated in the next amendment cycle under regularly applicable
amendment procedures. See Pub. L. No. 100-182, § 21, set forth as an editorial note under 28
U.S.C. § 994. This amendment repromulgates §5C1.2, as set forth in the 1994 edition of the
Guidelines Manual, with minor editorial changes.
In addition, this amendment adds a new subsection to §2D1.1 to implement this provision by
providing a two-level decrease in offense level for cases meeting the criteria set forth in
§5C1.2(1)-(5).
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1995.
516. Amendment: Section 2D1.1(c) is amended in the fifth note immediately following the Drug
Quantity Table by deleting the first sentence as follows:
"In the case of an offense involving marihuana plants, if the offense involved (A) 50 or
more marihuana plants, treat each plant as equivalent to 1 KG of marihuana; (B) fewer
than 50 marihuana plants, treat each plant as equivalent to 100 G of marihuana.",
and by inserting in lieu thereof:
"In the case of an offense involving marihuana plants, treat each plant, regardless of sex,
as equivalent to 100 G of marihuana.".
The Commentary to §2D1.1 captioned "Background" is amended in the fourth paragraph by
deleting the first three sentences as follows:
Amendment 516 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003
– 426 –
"In cases involving fifty or more marihuana plants, an equivalency of one plant to one
kilogram of marihuana is derived from the statutory penalty provisions of 21 U.S.C.
§ 841(b)(1)(A), (B), and (D). In cases involving fewer than fifty plants, the statute is
silent as to the equivalency. For cases involving fewer than fifty plants, the Commission
has adopted an equivalency of 100 grams per plant, or the actual weight of the usable
marihuana, whichever is greater.",
and by inserting in lieu thereof:
" For marihuana plants, the Commission has adopted an equivalency of 100 grams
per plant, or the actual weight of the usable marihuana, whichever is greater.".
Reason for Amendment: For offenses involving 50 or more marihuana plants, the existing
§2D1.1 (Unlawful Manufacturing, Importing, Exporting, or Trafficking; Attempt or Conspiracy)
uses an equivalency of one plant = one kilogram of marihuana, reflecting the quantities
associated with the five- and ten-year mandatory minimum penalties in 21 U.S.C. § 841. For
offenses involving fewer than 50 marihuana plants, the guidelines use an equivalency of one
plant = 100 grams of marihuana, unless the weight of the actual marihuana is greater. In
actuality, a marihuana plant does not produce a yield of one kilogram of marihuana. The one
plant = 100 grams of marihuana equivalency used by the Commission for offenses involving
fewer than 50 marihuana plants was selected as a reasonable approximation of the actual average
yield of marihuana plants taking into account (1) studies reporting the actual yield of marihuana
plants (37.5 to 412 grams depending on growing conditions); (2) that all plants regardless of size
are counted for guideline purposes while, in actuality, not all plants will produce useable
marihuana (e.g., some plants may die of disease before maturity, and when plants are grown
outdoors some plants may be consumed by animals); and (3) that male plants, which are counted
for guideline purposes, are frequently culled because they do not produce the same quality of
marihuana as do female plants. To enhance fairness and consistency, this amendment adopts
the equivalency of 100 grams per marihuana plant for all guideline determinations.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1995.
517. Amendment: Section 2D1.1(c)(10) is amended by deleting:
"20 KG or more of Secobarbital (or the equivalent amount of other Schedule I or II
Depressants) or Schedule III substances (except Anabolic Steroids);
40,000 or more units of Anabolic Steroids.",
and by inserting in lieu thereof:

At least 20,000 but less than 40,000 units of Anabolic Steroids.",
November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment 517
– 427 –
and by inserting in lieu thereof:
"At least 20,000 but less than 40,000 units of Schedule I or II Depressants or Schedule
III substances.".
Section 2D1.1(c)(12) is amended by deleting:
"At least 5 KG but less than 10 KG of Secobarbital (or the equivalent amount of other

At least 8 KG but less than 20 KG of Schedule IV substances.",
and inserting in lieu thereof:

– 428 –
"At least 1,000 but less than 2,500 units of Schedule I or II Depressants or Schedule III
substances;
At least 16,000 but less than 40,000 units of Schedule IV substances.".

following additional note as the sixth note:
"In the case of Schedule I or II Depressants, Schedule III substances (except anabolic
steroids), Schedule IV substances, and Schedule V substances, one ‘unit’ means one pill,
capsule, or tablet. If the substance is in liquid form, one ‘unit’ means 0.5 gms.".
The Commentary to §2D1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 10, Example d,
by deleting "28 kilograms" and inserting in lieu thereof "56,000 units"; by deleting "50
kilograms" and inserting in lieu thereof "100,000 units"; and by deleting "100 kilograms" and
inserting in lieu thereof "200,000 units".
The Commentary to §2D1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 10 in the Drug
Equivalency Tables in the subsection captioned "Secobarbital and Other Schedule I or II
Depressants" by deleting " Secobarbital and Other"; and by deleting:
November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment 517
– 429 –
"1 gm of Amobarbital = 2 gm of marihuana
1 gm of Glutethimide = 0.4 gm of marihuana
1 gm of Methaqualone = 0.7 gm of marihuana
1 gm of Pentobarbital = 2 gm of marihuana
1 gm of Secobarbital = 2 gm of marihuana",
and inserting in lieu thereof:
"1 unit of a Schedule I or II Depressant = 1 gm of marihuana".
The Commentary to §2D1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 10 in the Drug
Equivalency Tables in the subsection captioned "Schedule III Substances" by deleting:
"1 gm of a Schedule III Substance
(except anabolic steroids) = 2 gm of marihuana
1 unit of anabolic steroids = 1 gm of marihuana",
and inserting in lieu thereof:
"1 unit of a Schedule III Substance = 1 gm of marihuana".
The Commentary to §2D1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 10 in the Drug

and inserting in lieu thereof:
"1 unit of a Schedule IV Substance = 0.0625 gm of marihuana".
The Commentary to §2D1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 10 in the Drug
Equivalency Tables in the subsection captioned "Schedule V Substances" by deleting:
"1 gm of a Schedule V Substance = 0.0125 gm of marihuana",

The Commentary to §2D1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 11 in the
"Typical Weight Per Unit Table" by deleting the caption "Depressants"; and by deleting
"Methaqualone* 300 mg".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment modifies §2D1.1 (Unlawful Manufacturing,
Importing, Exporting, or Trafficking; Attempt or Conspiracy) with respect to the determination
of the offense levels for Schedule I and II Depressants and Schedule III, IV, and V controlled
substances by applying the Drug Quantity Table according to the number of pills, capsules, or
tablets rather than by the gross weight of the pills, capsules, or tablets. Schedule I and II
Depressants and Schedule III, IV, and V substances are almost always in pill, capsule, or tablet
Amendment 517 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003
– 430 –
form. The current guidelines use the total weight of the pill, capsule, or tablet containing the
controlled substance. This method leads to anomalies because the weight of most pills is
determined primarily by the filler rather than the controlled substance. Thus, heavy pills lead
to higher offense levels even though there is little or no relationship between gross weight and
the potency of the pill. Applying the Drug Quantity Table according to the number of pills will
both simplify guideline application and more fairly assess the scale and seriousness of the
offense.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1995.
518. Amendment: Section 2D1.1(c) is amended in the notes following the Drug Quantity Table
by inserting the following additional notes at the end:
"Hashish, for the purposes of this guideline, means a resinous substance of cannabis that
includes (i) one or more of the tetrahydrocannabinols (as listed in 21 C.F.R.
§ 1308.11(d)(25)), (ii) at least two of the following: cannabinol, cannabidiol, or
cannabichromene, and (iii) fragments of plant material (such as cystolith fibers).
Hashish oil, for the purposes of this guideline, means a preparation of the soluble
cannabinoids derived from cannabis that includes (i) one or more of the
tetrahydrocannabinols (as listed in 21 C.F.R. § 1308.11(d)(25)), (ii) at least two of the
following: cannabinol, cannabidiol, or cannabichromene, and (iii) is essentially free of
plant material (e.g., plant fragments). Typically, hashish oil is a viscous, dark colored
oil, but it can vary from a dry resin to a colorless liquid.".
Section 2D1.1(c) is amended by inserting "Notes to Drug Quantity Table:" immediately
following the asterisk at the beginning of the notes to the Drug Quantity Table; and by inserting
a letter designation immediately before each note in alphabetical order beginning with "(A)".
The Commentary to §2D1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 1 by inserting
the following additional paragraph at the end:
"Similarly, in the case of marihuana having a moisture content that renders the
marihuana unsuitable for consumption without drying (this might occur, for example,
with a bale of rain-soaked marihuana or freshly harvested marihuana that had not been
dried), an approximation of the weight of the marihuana without such excess moisture
content is to be used.".
The Commentary to §2D1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 8 by inserting
the following additional paragraph at the end:
"Note, however, that if an adjustment from subsection (b)(2)(B) applies, do not apply
§3B1.3 (Abuse of Position of Trust or Use of Special Skill).".
The Commentary to §2D1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 10 in the Drug
Equivalency Table in the subdivision captioned "Schedule I or II Opiates" by inserting at the
end:
November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment 518
– 431 –
"1 gm of Levo-alpha-acetylmethadol (LAAM)= 3 kg of marihuana".
The Commentary to §2D1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 10 in the Drug
Equivalency Tables in the subdivision captioned "Cocaine and Other Schedule I and II
Stimulants" by deleting:
"1 gm of L-Methamphetamine/Levo-methamphetamine/
L-Desoxyephedrine = 40 gm of marihuana",
and inserting in lieu thereof:
"1 gm of Khat = .01 gm of marihuana".
The Commentary to §2D1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 12 by deleting:
"In an offense involving negotiation to traffic in a controlled substance, the weight under
negotiation in an uncompleted distribution shall be used to calculate the applicable
amount. However, where the court finds that the defendant did not intend to produce
and was not reasonably capable of producing the negotiated amount, the court shall
exclude from the guideline calculation the amount that it finds the defendant did not
intend to produce and was not reasonably capable of producing.",
and inserting in lieu thereof:
"In an offense involving an agreement to sell a controlled substance, the agreed-upon
quantity of the controlled substance shall be used to determine the offense level unless
the sale is completed and the amount delivered more accurately reflects the scale of the
offense. For example, a defendant agrees to sell 500 grams of cocaine, the transaction
is completed by the delivery of the controlled substance - actually 480 grams of cocaine,
and no further delivery is scheduled. In this example, the amount delivered more
accurately reflects the scale of the offense. In contrast, in a reverse sting, the agreed-
upon quantity of the controlled substance would more accurately reflect the scale of the
offense because the amount actually delivered is controlled by the government, not by
the defendant. If, however, the defendant establishes that he or she did not intend to
provide, or was not reasonably capable of providing, the agreed-upon quantity of the
controlled substance, the court shall exclude from the offense level determination the
amount of controlled substance that the defendant establishes that he or she did not
intend to provide or was not reasonably capable of providing.".
The Commentary to §2D1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by deleting Note 13
as follows:
"13. If subsection (b)(2)(B) applies, do not apply §3B1.3 (Abuse of Position of Trust
or Use of Special Skill).".
The Commentary to §2D1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by deleting Note 14
as follows:
Amendment 518 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003
– 432 –
"14. D-lysergic acid, which is generally used to make LSD, is classified as a Schedule
III controlled substance (to which §2D1.1 applies) and as a listed precursor (to
which §2D1.11 applies). Where the defendant is convicted under 21 U.S.C.
§§ 841(b)(1)(D) or 960(b)(4) of an offense involving d-lysergic acid, apply
§2D1.1 or §2D1.11, whichever results in the greater offense level. See
Application Note 5 in the Commentary to §1B1.1 (Application Instructions).
Where the defendant is accountable for an offense involving the manufacture of
LSD, see Application Note 12 above pertaining to the determination of the scale
of the offense.",
and by renumbering the remaining notes accordingly.
The Commentary to §2D1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by inserting the
following additional note:
"18. For purposes of the guidelines, a ‘plant’ is an organism having leaves and a
readily observable root formation (e.g., a marihuana cutting having roots, a
rootball, or root hairs is a marihuana plant).".
Reason for Amendment: This is an eight-part amendment. First, this amendment adds
definitions of hashish and hashish oil to §2D1.1 (Unlawful Manufacturing, Importing,
Exporting, or Trafficking; Attempt or Conspiracy) in the notes following the Drug Quantity
Table. These terms are not defined by statute or in the existing guidelines, leading to litigation
as to which substances are to be classified as hashish or hashish oil, as opposed to marihuana.
See United States v. Gravelle, 819 F. Supp. 1076 (S.D. Fla. 1993); United States v. Schultz,
810 F. Supp. 230 (S.D. Ohio 1992).
Second, this amendment clarifies the treatment of marihuana that has a moisture content
sufficient to render it unusable without drying (e.g., a bale of marihuana left in the rain or
recently harvested marihuana that has not had time to dry). In such cases, using the weight of
the wet marihuana can increase the offense level for a factor that bears no relationship to the
scale of the offense or the marketable form of the marihuana. Prior to the effective date of the
1993 amendments, two circuits had approved weighing wet marihuana despite the fact that the
marihuana was not in a usable form. United States v. Pinedo-Montoya, 966 F.2d 591 (10th Cir.
1992); United States v. Garcia, 925 F.2d 170 (7th Cir. 1991). Although Application Note 1 in
the Commentary to §2D1.1, effective November 1, 1993 (pertaining to unusable parts of a
mixture or substance) should produce the appropriate result because marihuana must be dried
before being used, this type of case is sufficiently distinct to warrant a specific reference in this
application note to ensure correct application of the guideline.
Third, this amendment simplifies the Commentary to §2D1.1 by consolidating application notes
8 and 13.
Fourth, this amendment deletes an outdated application note in the Commentary to §2D1.1
pertaining to the classification of d-lysergic acid as a listed precursor chemical.
Fifth, this amendment addresses the issue of what constitutes a marihuana plant. Several
circuits have confronted the issue of when a cutting from a marihuana plant becomes a "plant."
November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment 519
– 433 –
The appellate courts generally have held that the term "plant" should be defined by "its plain
and ordinary dictionary meaning. . . . [A] marihuana ‘plant’ includes those cuttings
accompanied by root balls." United States v. Edge, 989 F.2d 871, 878 (6th Cir. 1993) (quoting
United States v. Eves, 932 F.2d 856, 860 (10th Cir. 1991), appeal after remand, 30 F.3d 134
(6th Cir. 1994)). See also United States v. Malbrough, 922 F.2d 458, 465 (8th Cir. 1990)
(acquiescing in the district court’s apparent determination that certain marihuana cuttings that
did not have their own "root system" should not be counted as plants), cert. denied, 501 S. Ct.
1258 (1991); United States v. Carlisle, 907 F.2d 94, 96 (9th Cir. 1990) (finding that cuttings
were plants where each cutting had previous degrees of root formation not clearly erroneous);
United States v. Angell, 794 F. Supp. 874, 875 (D. Minn. 1990) (refusing to count as plants
marihuana cuttings that have no visible root structure), aff’d in part and rev’d in part, 11 F.3d
806 (8th Cir.), cert. denied, 114 S. Ct. 3747 (1994); United States v. Fitol, 733 F. Supp. 1312,
1316 (D. Minn. 1990) ("individual cuttings, planted with the intent of growing full size plants,
and which had grown roots, are ‘plants’ both within common parlance and within Section
841(b)"); United States v. Speltz, 733 F. Supp. 1311, 1312 (D. Minn. 1990) (small marihuana
plants, e.g., cuttings with roots, are nonetheless still marihuana plants), aff’d, 938 F.2d 188 (8th
Cir. 1991). Because this issue arises frequently, this amendment adds an application note to
the Commentary of §2D1.1 setting forth the definition of a plant for guidelines purposes.
Sixth, this amendment provides equivalencies for two additional controlled substances: (1)
khat, and (2) levo-alpha-acetylmethadol (LAAM) in the Drug Equivalency Tables in the
Commentary to §2D1.1.
Seventh, this amendment deletes the distinction between d- and l-methamphetamine in the
Drug Equivalency Tables in the Commentary to §2D1.1. L-methamphetamine, which is a rather
weak form of methamphetamine, is rarely seen and is not made intentionally, but rather results
from a botched attempt to produce d-methamphetamine. Under this amendment,
l-methamphetamine would be treated the same as d-methamphetamine (i.e., as if an attempt to
manufacture or distribute d-methamphetamine). Currently, unless the methamphetamine is
specifically tested to determine its form, litigation can result over whether the
methamphetamine is l- methamphetamine or d-methamphetamine. In addition, there is another
form of methamphetamine (dl-methamphetamine) that is not listed in the Drug Equivalency
Table. The listing of l-methamphetamine as a separate form of methamphetamine has led to
litigation as to how dl-methamphetamine should be treated. In United States v. Carroll, 6 F.3d
735 (11th Cir. 1993), cert. denied, 114 S. Ct. 1234 (1994), a case in which the Eleventh Circuit
held that dl-methamphetamine should be treated as d-methamphetamine, the majority and
dissenting opinions both point out the complexity engendered by the current distinction
between d- and l- methamphetamine. Under this amendment, all forms of methamphetamine
are treated alike, thereby simplifying guideline application.
Eighth, this amendment revises the Commentary to §2D1.1 to provide that in a case involving
negotiation for a quantity of a controlled substance, the negotiated quantity is used to determine
the offense level unless the completed transaction establishes a different quantity, or the
defendant establishes that he or she was not reasonably capable of producing the negotiated
amount or otherwise did not intend to produce that amount. Disputes over the interpretation
of this application note have produced much litigation. See, e.g., United States v. Tillman,8
F.3d 17 (11th Cir. 1993); United States v. Smiley, 997 F.2d 475 (8th Cir. 1993); United States
v. Barnes, 993 F.2d 680 (9th Cir. 1993), cert. denied, 115 S. Ct. 96 (1994); United States v.

Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1995.
519. Amendment: Section 2D1.11(d) is amended in the Chemical Quantity Table by deleting
"Listed Precursor" wherever it occurs and inserting in lieu thereof "List I"; and by deleting
"Listed Essential" wherever it appears and inserting in lieu thereof "List II".
Section 2D1.11(d) is amended in subdivisions (1)-(9) by deleting the line referencing "D-
Lysergic Acid" from each subdivision as set forth below:
(1) "200 G or more of D-Lysergic Acid;",
(2) "At least 60 G but less than 200 G of D-Lysergic Acid;",

Section 2D1.11(d) is amended in subdivisions (1)-(9) by inserting the following list I chemicals
(formerly Listed Precursor Chemicals) in the appropriate place in alphabetical order by
subdivision as follows:
(1) "17.8 KG or more of Benzaldehyde;",
"12.6 KG or more of Nitroethane;",

Section 2D1.11 is amended in the List 1 Chemical Equivalency Table by inserting the
following chemicals, in the appropriate place in alphabetical order:
"1 gm of Benzaldehyde** = 1.124 gm of Ephedrine",
"1 gm of Nitroethane** = 1.592 gm of Ephedrine";
and by deleting "1 gm of D-lysergic acid = 1 gm of Ephedrine".
Section 2D1.11(d) is amended in the notes following the Chemical Quantity Table by deleting
Note (A) as follows:
"(A) If more than one listed precursor chemical is involved, use the Precursor
Chemical Equivalency Table to determine the offense level.",
and inserting in lieu thereof:
"(A) The List I Chemical Equivalency Table provides a method for combining
different precursor chemicals to obtain a single offense level. In a case involving
two or more list I chemicals used to manufacture different controlled substances
or to manufacture one controlled substance by different manufacturing processes,
convert each to its ephedrine equivalency from the table below, add the
quantities, and use the Chemical Quantity Table to determine the base offense
level. In a case involving two or more list I chemicals used together to
manufacture a controlled substance in the same manufacturing process, use the
quantity of the single list I chemical that results in the greatest base offense
level.";
in Notes (B) and (C) by deleting "listed essential" wherever it appears and inserting in lieu
thereof in each instance "list II"; in Note (C) by deleting "listed precursor" and inserting in lieu
thereof "list I"; by deleting Note (D) as follows:
"(D) The Precursor Chemical Equivalency Table provides a means for combining
different listed precursor chemicals to obtain a single offense level. In cases
Amendment 519 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003
– 436 –
involving multiple precursor chemicals, convert each to its ephedrine
equivalency from the table below, add the quantities, and apply the Chemical
Quantity Table to obtain the applicable offense level.",
and inserting in lieu thereof:
"(D) In a case involving ephedrine tablets, use the weight of the ephedrine contained
in the tablets, not the weight of the entire tablets, in calculating the base offense
level.";
and by deleting "PRECURSOR" and inserting in lieu thereof "(E) LIST I".
Section 2D1.11(d) is amended in the List I Chemical Equivalency Table (formerly the
Precursor Chemical Equivalency Table) by inserting "**" immediately after each of the
following substances: "Ethylamine", "N-Methylephedrine", "N-Methylpseudoephedrine",
"Norpseudoephedr ine" , "Pheny lpropano l amine" , "Pseudoephedr ine" ,
and "3,4-Methylenedioxyphenyl-2-propanone".
Section 2D1.11(d) is amended in the note following the List I Chemical Equivalency Table
(formerly the Precursor Chemical Equivalency Table) designated by two asterisks by deleting
"both hydriodic acid and ephedrine" and inserting in lieu thereof:
"(A) hydriodic acid and one of the following: ephedrine, N-methylephedrine, N-
methylpseudoephedrine, norpseudoephedrine, phenylpropanolamine, or
pseudoephedrine; or (B) ethylamine and 3,4-methylenedioxyphenyl-2-propanone; or (C)
benzaldehyde and nitroethane".
The Commentary to §2D1.11 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 3 by deleting
"3, 4 methylenedioxphenyl-2-propanone" wherever it appears and inserting in lieu thereof in
each instance "methylamine"; and by deleting "LSD, PCP, and other Schedule I and II
Hallucinogens" and inserting in lieu thereof "Cocaine and Other Schedule I and II Stimulants".
The Commentary to §2D1.11 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by deleting:
"4. Where there are multiple listed precursor chemicals, the quantities of all listed
precursors are added together for purposes of determining the base offense level,
except as expressly noted (see Note A to the Chemical Quantity Table). This
reflects that only one listed precursor typically is used in a given manufacturing
process. For example, in the case of an offense involving 300 grams of
piperidine and 800 grams of benzyl cyanide, the piperidine is converted to 600
grams of ephedrine and the benzyl cyanide is converted to 800 grams of
ephedrine, using the Precursor Chemical Equivalency Table, for a total of 1400
grams of ephedrine. Applying the Chemical Quantity Table to 1400 grams (1.4
kilograms) of ephedrine results in a base offense level of 22.",
and inserting in lieu thereof:
"4. When two or more list I chemicals are used together in the same manufacturing
November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment 519
– 437 –
process, calculate the offense level for each separately and use the quantity that
results in the greatest base offense level. In any other case, the quantities should
be added together (using the List I Chemical Equivalency Table) for the purpose
of calculating the base offense level.
Examples:
(a) The defendant was in possession of five kilograms of ephedrine and three
kilograms of hydriodic acid. Ephedrine and hydriodic acid typically are
used together in the same manufacturing process to manufacture
methamphetamine. Therefore, the base offense level for each listed
chemical is calculated separately and the list I chemical with the higher
base offense level is used. Five kilograms of ephedrine result in a base
offense level of 24; 300 grams of hydriodic acid result in a base offense
level of 14. In this case, the base offense level would be 24.
(b) The defendant was in possession of five kilograms of ephedrine and two
kilograms of phenylacetic acid. Although both of these chemicals are
used to manufacture methamphetamine, they are not used together in the
same manufacturing process. Therefore, the quantity of phenylacetic acid
should be converted to an ephedrine equivalency using the List I
Chemical Equivalency Table and then added to the quantity of ephedrine.
In this case, the two kilograms of phenylacetic acid convert to two
kilograms of ephedrine (see List I Chemical Equivalency Table),
resulting in a total equivalency of seven kilograms of ephedrine.".
The Commentary to §2D1.11 is amended by deleting "listed precursor" wherever it appears and
inserting in lieu thereof "list I"; and by deleting "listed essential" and inserting in lieu thereof
in each instance "list II".
The Commentary to §2D1.11 captioned "Background" is amended in the second sentence by
deleting "Listed precursor chemicals are critical to the formation of a controlled substance and"
and inserting in lieu thereof "List I chemicals are important to the manufacture of a controlled
substance and usually".
The Commentary to §2D1.11 captioned "Background" is amended by deleting the last sentence
as follows:
"Listed essential chemicals are generally solvents, catalysts, and reagents, and do not
become part of the finished product.",
and inserting in lieu thereof:
"List II chemicals are generally used as solvents, catalysts, and reagents.".
Reason for Amendment: The Domestic Chemical Diversion Act of 1993, Pub. L. 103-200,
107 Stat. 2333, changed the designations of the listed chemicals from "listed precursor
chemicals" and "listed essential chemicals" to "list I chemicals" and "list II chemicals,"
Amendment 519 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003
– 438 –
respectively. This amendment conforms §2D1.11 (Unlawfully Distributing, Importing,
Exporting or Possessing a Listed Chemical; Attempt or Conspiracy) to these statutory changes.
The Act also adds pills containing ephedrine as a list I chemical. Ephedrine itself is a list I
chemical under 21 U.S.C. § 802(34). Pills containing ephedrine previously were not covered
by the statute and, thus, legally could be purchased "over the counter." Purchases of these pills
were sometimes made in large quantities and the pills crushed and processed to extract the
ephedrine (which can be used to make methamphetamine). Unlike ephedrine, which is
purchased from a chemical company and is virtually 100 percent pure, these tablets contain a
substantially lower percentage of ephedrine (about 25 percent). To avoid unwarranted
disparity, this amendment adds a note to §2D1.11 providing that the amount of actual ephedrine
contained in a pill is to be used in determining the offense level.
In addition, the Act removes three chemicals from, and adds two others to, the listed chemicals
controlled under the Controlled Substances Act. Two of the chemicals removed from the list
are not currently listed in §2D1.11 because the Commission was aware that they are not used
in the manufacture of any controlled substance. The third chemical removed from the list, d-
lysergic acid, was listed both as a listed chemical in §2D1.11 and as a controlled substance in
§2D1.1 (Unlawful Manufacturing, Importing, Exporting, or Trafficking; Attempt or
Conspiracy). This amendment conforms §2D1.11 by deleting all references to d-lysergic acid.
The two chemicals added as listed chemicals are benzaldehyde and nitroethane. Both of these
chemicals are used to make methamphetamine. The base offense levels for listed chemicals
in §2D1.11 are determined by reference to the most common controlled substance the chemical
is used to manufacture; consequently, this amendment adds these chemicals to the Chemical
Quantity Table based on information provided by the Drug Enforcement Administration
regarding their use in the production of methamphetamine.
A number of the chemicals in the Chemical Quantity Table in §2D1.11 are used in the same
process to make a controlled substance. A note at the end of the existing Precursor Chemical
Equivalency Table addresses this situation for hydriodic acid and ephedrine. This amendment
expands this note to cover other chemicals that similarly are used together.
In addition, this amendment corrects Application Note 3 of the Commentary to §2D1.11 with
respect to an example of a listed chemical that is used with P2P to manufacture
methamphetamine and a reference to a subdivision of the Drug Equivalency Tables in the
Commentary to §2D1.1.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1995.
520. Amendment: Section 2D1.12(a) is amended by inserting "(Apply the greater)" immediately
after "Base Offense Level"; and by deleting "12" and inserting in lieu thereof:
"(1) 12, if the defendant intended to manufacture a controlled substance or knew or
believed the prohibited equipment was to be used to manufacture a controlled
substance; or
(2) 9, if the defendant had reasonable cause to believe the prohibited equipment was
to be used to manufacture a controlled substance.".
November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment 521
– 439 –
Reason for Amendment: The Domestic Chemical Diversion Act of 1993, Pub. L. 103-200,
107 Stat. 2333, broadens the prohibition in 21 U.S.C. § 843(a) to cover possessing,
manufacturing, distributing, exporting, or importing three-neck, round-bottom flasks, tableting
machines, encapsulating machines, or gelatin capsules having reasonable cause to believe they
will be used to manufacture a controlled substance. Section 2D1.12 (Unlawful Possession,
Manufacture, Distribution, or Importation of Prohibited Flask or Equipment; Attempt or
Conspiracy) applies to this conduct. Consistent with the treatment of similar conduct under
§§2D1.11(b)(2) and 2D1.13(b)(2), this amendment provides an alternative base offense level
in §2D1.12 to address the case in which the defendant had reasonable cause to believe, but not
actual knowledge or belief, that the equipment was to be used to manufacture a controlled
substance.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1995.
521. Amendment: Chapter Two, Part H, Subpart 1 is amended by deleting:
"Introductory Commentary
This subpart covers violations of civil rights statutes that typically penalize
conduct involving death or bodily injury more severely than discriminatory or
intimidating conduct not involving such injury.
The addition of two levels to the offense level applicable to the underlying
offense in this subpart reflects the fact that the harm involved both the underlying
conduct and activity intended to deprive a person of his civil rights. An added penalty
is imposed on an offender who was a public official at the time of the offense to reflect
the likely damage to public confidence in the integrity and fairness of government, and
the added likely force of the threat because of the official’s involvement.".
Sections 2H1.1, 2H1.3, 2H1.4, and 2H1.5 are deleted in their entirety as follows:
"§2H1.1. Conspiracy to Interfere with Civil Rights; Going in Disguise to Deprive
of Rights
(a) Base Offense Level (Apply the greater):
(1) 15; or
(2) 2 plus the offense level applicable to any underlying
offense.
(b) Specific Offense Characteristic

offense, increase by 4 levels.
Commentary
Amendment 521 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003
– 440 –
Statutory Provision: 18 U.S.C. § 241.
Application Notes:
1. ‘Underlying offense,’ as used in this guideline, includes any offense under
federal, state, or local law other than an offense that is itself covered under
Chapter Two, Part H, Subpart 1, 2, or 4. For example, in the case of a conspiracy
to interfere with a person’s civil rights (a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 241) that
involved an aggravated assault (the use of force) to deny certain rights or benefits
in furtherance of discrimination (a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 245), the underlying
offense in respect to both the violation of 18 U.S.C. § 241 (to which §2H1.1
applies) and the violation of 18 U.S.C. § 245 (to which §2H1.3 applies) would
be the aggravated assault.
‘2 plus the offense level applicable to any underlying offense’ means 2 levels
above the offense level (base offense level plus any applicable specific offense
characteristics and cross references) from the offense guideline in Chapter Two
that most closely corresponds to the underlying offense. For example, if the
underlying offense was second degree murder, which under §2A1.2 has an
offense level of 33, ‘2 plus the offense level applicable to any underlying
offense’ would be 33 + 2 = 35. If the underlying offense was assault, criminal
sexual conduct, kidnapping, abduction or unlawful restraint, the offense level
from the guideline for the most comparable offense in §§2A2.1-2A4.2 (Assault,
Criminal Sexual Abuse, and Kidnapping, Abduction, or Unlawful Restraint)
would first be determined, and 2 levels then would be added. If the underlying
offense was damage to property by means of arson or an explosive device, the
offense level from §2K1.4 (Arson; Property Damage By Use of Explosives)
would first be determined and 2 levels would be added. If the offense was
property damage by other means, the offense level from §2B1.3 (Property
Damage or Destruction) would first be determined and 2 levels would be added.
If the offense was a conspiracy or attempt to commit arson, ‘2 plus the offense
level applicable to any underlying offense’ would be the offense level from the
guideline applicable to a conspiracy or attempt to commit arson plus 2 levels.
In certain cases, the count of which the defendant is convicted may set forth
conduct that constitutes more than one underlying offense (e.g., two instances of
assault, or one instance of assault and one instance of arson). In such cases,
determine the offense level for the underlying offense by treating each
underlying offense as if contained in a separate count of conviction. To
determine which of the alternative base offense levels (e.g., §2H1.1(a)(1) or
(a)(2)) results in the greater offense level, apply Chapter Three, Parts A, B, C,
and D to each alternative base offense level. Use whichever results in the greater
offense level. Example: The defendant is convicted of one count of conspiracy
to violate civil rights that included two level 12 underlying offenses (of a type
not grouped together under Chapter Three, Part D). No adjustment from Chapter
Three, Parts A, B, or C applies. The base offense level from §2H1.1(a)(1) is 15.
The offense level for each underlying offense from §2H1.1(a)(2) is 14 (2 + 12).
Under Chapter Three, Part D (Multiple Counts), the two level 14 underlying
November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment 521
– 441 –
offenses result in a combined offense level of 16. This offense level is greater
than the alternative base offense level of 15 under §2H1.1(a)(1). Therefore, the
case is treated as if there were two counts, one for each underlying offense, with
a base offense level under §2H1.1(a)(2) of 14 for each underlying offense.
2. Where the adjustment in §2H1.1(b)(1) is applied, do not apply §3B1.3 (Abuse
of Position of Trust or Use of Special Skill).
Background: This section applies to intimidating activity by various groups, including
formally and informally organized groups as well as hate groups. The maximum term
of imprisonment authorized by statute is ten years; except where death results, the
maximum term of imprisonment authorized by statute is life imprisonment. The base
offense level for this guideline assumes threatening or otherwise serious conduct.
§2H1.3. Use of Force or Threat of Force to Deny Benefits or Rights in
Furtherance of Discrimination; Damage to Religious Real Property
(a) Base Offense Level (Apply the greatest):
(1) 10, if no injury occurred; or
(2) 15, if injury occurred; or
(3) 2 plus the offense level applicable to any underlying
offense.
(b) Specific Offense Characteristic
(1) If the defendant was a public official at the time of the
offense, increase by 4 levels.
Commentary
Statutory Provisions: 18 U.S.C. §§ 245, 247; 42 U.S.C. § 3631. For additional statutory
provision(s), see Appendix A (Statutory Index).
Application Notes:
1. ‘2 plus the offense level applicable to any underlying offense’ is defined in the
Commentary to §2H1.1.
2. ‘Injury’ means ‘bodily injury,’ ‘serious bodily injury,’ or ‘permanent or life-
threatening bodily injury’ as defined in the Commentary to §1B1.1 (Application
Instructions).
3. Where the adjustment in §2H1.3(b)(1) is applied, do not apply §3B1.3 (Abuse
of Position of Trust or Use of Special Skill).
Amendment 521 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003
– 442 –
4. In the case of a violation of 42 U.S.C. § 3631, apply this guideline where the
offense involved the threat or use of force. Otherwise, apply §2H1.5.
Background: The statutes covered by this guideline provide federal protection for the
exercise of civil rights in a variety of contexts (e.g., voting, employment, public
accommodations, etc.). The base offense level in §2H1.3(a) reflects that the threat or use
of force is inherent in the offense. The maximum term of imprisonment authorized by
statute is one year if no bodily injury results, ten years if bodily injury results, and life
imprisonment if death results.
§2H1.4. Interference with Civil Rights Under Color of Law
(a) Base Offense Level (Apply the greater):
(1) 10; or
(2) 6 plus the offense level applicable to any underlying
offense.
Commentary
Statutory Provision: 18 U.S.C. § 242.
Application Notes:
1. ‘6 plus the offense level applicable to any underlying offense’ means 6 levels
above the offense level for any underlying criminal conduct. See the discussion
in the Commentary to §2H1.1.
2. Do not apply the adjustment from §3B1.3 (Abuse of Position of Trust or Use of
Special Skill).
Background: This maximum term of imprisonment authorized by 18 U.S.C. § 242 is one
year if no bodily injury results, ten years if bodily injury results, and life imprisonment
if death results. A base offense level of 10 is prescribed at §2H1.4(a)(1) providing a
guideline sentence near the one-year statutory maximum for cases not resulting in death
or bodily injury because of the compelling public interest in deterring and adequately
punishing those who violate civil rights under color of law. The Commission intends to
recommend that this one-year statutory maximum penalty be increased. An alternative
base offense level is provided at §2H1.4(a)(2). The 6-level increase under subsection
(a)(2) reflects the 2-level increase that is applied to other offenses covered in this Part
plus a 4-level increase for the commission of the offense under actual or purported legal
authority. This 4-level increase is inherent in the base offense level of 10 under
subsection (a)(1).
Enhancement under §3B1.3 (Abuse of Position of Trust or Use of Special Skill) is
inappropriate because the base offense level in §2H1.4(a) reflects that the abuse of actual
or purported legal authority is inherent in the offense.

§2H1.5. Other Deprivations of Rights or Benefits in Furtherance of
Discrimination
(a) Base Offense Level (Apply the greater):
(1) 6; or
(2) 2 plus the offense level applicable to any underlying
offense.
(b) Specific Offense Characteristic
(1) If the defendant was a public official at the time of the
offense, increase by 4 levels.
Commentary
Statutory Provision: 18 U.S.C. § 246.
Application Notes:
1. ‘2 plus the offense level applicable to any underlying offense’ is defined in the
Commentary to §2H1.1.
2. Where the adjustment in §2H1.5(b)(1) is applied, do not apply §3B1.3 (Abuse
of Position of Trust or Use of Special Skill).
Background: Violations of the statutes covered by this provision do not necessarily
involve the use of force or threatening conduct or violations by public officials.
Accordingly, the minimum base offense level (level 6) provided is lower than that of the
other guidelines in this subpart.".
A replacement guideline with accompanying commentary is inserted as §2H1.1 (Offenses
Involving Individual Rights).
Section 3A1.1 (Vulnerable Victim) is deleted in its entirety as follows:
"§3A1.1. Vulnerable Victim
If the defendant knew or should have known that a victim of the offense
was unusually vulnerable due to age, physical or mental condition, or that
a victim was otherwise particularly susceptible to the criminal conduct,
increase by 2 levels.
Commentary
Application Notes:
Amendment 521 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003
– 444 –
1. This adjustment applies to offenses where an unusually vulnerable victim is
made a target of criminal activity by the defendant. The adjustment would apply,
for example, in a fraud case where the defendant marketed an ineffective cancer
cure or in a robbery where the defendant selected a handicapped victim. But it
would not apply in a case where the defendant sold fraudulent securities by mail
to the general public and one of the victims happened to be senile. Similarly, for
example, a bank teller is not an unusually vulnerable victim solely by virtue of
the teller’s position in a bank.
2. Do not apply this adjustment if the offense guideline specifically incorporates
this factor. For example, where the offense guideline provides an enhancement
for the age of the victim, this guideline should not be applied unless the victim
was unusually vulnerable for reasons unrelated to age.".
A replacement guideline with accompanying commentary is inserted as §3A1.1 (Hate Crime
Motivation or Vulnerable Victim).
The Commentary to §2H4.1 captioned "Application Note" is amended in Note 1 by deleting
"2 plus the offense" and inserting in lieu thereof "Offense".
Reason for Amendment: This is a five-part amendment. First, the amendment adds an
additional subsection to §3A1.1 (Vulnerable Victim) to implement the directive contained in
Section 280003 of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 by providing
a three-level increase in the offense level for offenses that are "hate crimes." Second, the
amendment consolidates §§2H1.1 (Offenses Involving Individual Rights), 2H1.3 (Use of Force
or Threat of Force to Deny Benefits or Rights in Furtherance of Discrimination; Damage to
Religious Real Property), 2H1.4 (Interference with Civil Rights Under Color of Law), and
2H1.5 (Other Deprivations of Rights Benefits in Furtherance of Discrimination) into a revised
§2H1.1 (Offenses Involving Individual Rights). This revised guideline provides greater
consistency in offense levels for similar conduct, reflects the additional enhancement now
contained in §3A1.1, and better reflects the seriousness of the underlying conduct. Third, the
amendment references violations of 18 U.S.C. § 248 (the Freedom of Access to Clinic
Entrances Act of 1994, Pub. L. 103-259, 108 Stat. 694) to the consolidated §2H1.1. Fourth,
the amendment clarifies the operation of §3A1.1 with respect to a vulnerable victim. Fifth, the
amendment addresses the directive to the Commission in section 240002 of the Violent Crime
Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 (pertaining to elderly victims of crimes of violence).
Section 280003 of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 directs the
Commission to provide a minimum enhancement of three levels for offenses that the finder of
fact at trial determines are hate crimes. This directive also instructs the Commission to ensure
that there is reasonable consistency with other guidelines and that duplicative punishments for
the same offense are avoided. The congressional directive in section 280003 requires that the
three-level hate crimes enhancement apply where "the finder of fact at trial determines beyond
a reasonable doubt" that the offense of conviction was a hate crime. This amendment makes
the enhancement applicable if either the finder of fact at trial or, in the case of a guilty or nolo
contendere plea, the court at sentencing determines that the offense was a hate crime. By
broadening the applicability of the congressionally mandated enhancement, this amendment
will avoid unwarranted sentencing disparity based on the mode of conviction. The
November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment 522
– 445 –
Commission’s general guideline promulgation authority, see 28 U.S.C. § 994, permits such a
broadening of the enhancement.
The addition of a generally applicable Chapter Three hate crimes enhancement requires
amendment of the civil rights offense guidelines to avoid duplicative punishments. In addition,
to further the Commission’s goal of simplifying the operation of the guidelines, the proposed
amendment consolidates the four current civil rights offense guidelines into one guideline and
adjusts these guidelines to take into account the new enhancement under §3A1.1(a).
The Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act of 1994 makes it a crime to interfere with
access to reproductive services or to interfere with certain religious activities. This Act
criminalizes a broad array of conduct, from non-violent obstruction of the entrance to a clinic
to murder. The amendment treats these violations in the same way as other offenses involving
individual rights.
Section 240002 of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 directs the
Commission to ensure that the guidelines provide sufficiently stringent penalties for crimes of
violence against elderly victims. Upon review of the guidelines, the Commission determined
that the penalties currently provided generally appear appropriate; however, this amendment
strengthens the Commentary to §3A1.1 in one area by expressly providing a basis for an
upward departure if both the current offense and a prior offense involved a vulnerable victim
(including an elderly victim), regardless of the type of offense.
Finally, Section 250003 of the Violent Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 directs the
Commission to review, and if necessary, amend the sentencing guidelines to ensure that victim-
related adjustments for fraud offenses against older victims are adequate. Section 250003 also
directs the Commission to study and report to the Congress on this issue. See Report to
Congress: Adequacy of Penalties for Fraud Offenses Involving Elderly Victims (March 13,
1995). Although the Commission found that the current guidelines generally provided
adequate penalties in these cases, it noted some inconsistency in the application of §3A1.1
regarding whether this adjustment required proof that the defendant had "targeted the victim
on account of the victim’s vulnerability." This amendment revises the Commentary of §3A1.1
to clarify application with respect to this issue.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1995.
522. Amendment: Section §2K2.1(a)(1) is amended by deleting:
"defendant had at least two prior felony convictions of either a crime of violence or a
controlled substance offense, and the instant offense involved a firearm listed in
26 U.S.C. § 5845(a)",
and inserting in lieu thereof:
"offense involved a firearm described in 26 U.S.C. § 5845(a) or 18 U.S.C. § 921(a)(30),
and the defendant had at least two prior felony convictions of either a crime of violence
or a controlled substance offense".
Amendment 522 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003
– 446 –
Section §2K2.1(a)(3) is amended by deleting:
"defendant had one prior felony conviction of either a crime of violence or a controlled
substance offense, and the instant offense involved a firearm listed in 26 U.S.C.
§ 5845(a)",
and inserting in lieu thereof:
"offense involved a firearm described in 26 U.S.C. § 5845(a) or 18 U.S.C. § 921(a)(30),
and the defendant had one prior conviction of either a crime of violence or controlled
substance offense".
Section §2K2.1(a)(4)(B) is amended by deleting "listed in 26 U.S.C. § 5845(a)" and inserting
in lieu thereof "described in 26 U.S.C. § 5845(a) or 18 U.S.C. § 921(a)(30)".
Section 2K2.1(a)(5) is amended by deleting "listed in 26 U.S.C. § 5845(a)" and inserting in lieu
thereof "described in 26 U.S.C. § 5845(a) or 18 U.S.C. § 921(a)(30)".
Section 2K2.1(a)(8) is amended by deleting "or (m)" and by inserting in lieu thereof "(m), (s),
(t), or (x)(1)".
The Commentary to §2K2.1 captioned "Statutory Provisions" is amended by deleting "(r)" and
inserting in lieu thereof "(r)-(w), (x)(1)"; and by deleting "(g)" and inserting in lieu thereof "(g),
(h), (j)-(n)".
The Commentary to §2K2.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by deleting:
"3. ‘Firearm listed in 26 U.S.C. § 5845(a)’ includes: (i) any short-barreled rifle or
shotgun or any weapon made therefrom; (ii) a machinegun; (iii) a silencer; (iv)
a destructive device; or (v) any ‘other weapon,’ as that term is defined by 26
U.S.C. § 5845(e). A firearm listed in 26 U.S.C. § 5845(a) does not include
unaltered handguns or regulation-length rifles or shotguns. For a more detailed
definition, refer to 26 U.S.C. § 5845.",
and inserting in lieu thereof:
"3. A ‘firearm described in 26 U.S.C. § 5845(a)’ includes: (i) a shotgun having a
barrel or barrels of less than 18 inches in length; a weapon made from a shotgun
if such weapon as modified has an overall length of less than 26 inches or a
barrel or barrels of less than 18 inches in length; a rifle having a barrel or barrels
of less than 16 inches in length; or a weapon made from a rifle if such weapon
as modified has an overall length of less than 26 inches or a barrel or barrels of
less than 16 inches in length; (ii) a machinegun; (iii) a silencer; (iv) a destructive
device; and (v) certain unusual weapons defined in 26 U.S.C. § 5845(e) (that are
not conventional, unaltered handguns, rifles, or shotguns). For a more detailed
definition, refer to 26 U.S.C. § 5845.
A ‘firearm described in 18 U.S.C. § 921(a)(30)’ (pertaining to semiautomatic
November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment 523
– 447 –
assault weapons) does not include a weapon exempted under the provisions of
18 U.S.C. § 922(v)(3).".
The Commentary to §2K2.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 6 by deleting:
"or (v) being an alien, is illegally or unlawfully in the United States",
and inserting in lieu thereof:
"(v) being an alien, is illegally or unlawfully in the United States; or (vi) is subject to a
court order that restrains such person from harassing, stalking, or threatening an intimate
partner of such person or child of such intimate partner or person, or engaging in other
conduct that would place an intimate partner in reasonable fear of bodily injury to the
partner or child as defined in 18 U.S.C. § 922(d)(8)".
The Commentary to §2K2.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by deleting:
"12. If the defendant is convicted under 18 U.S.C. § 922(i), (j), or (k), or 26 U.S.C.
§ 5861(g) or (h) (offenses involving stolen firearms or ammunition), and is
convicted of no other offense subject to this guideline, do not apply the
adjustment in subsection (b)(4) because the base offense level itself takes such
conduct into account.".
and inserting in lieu thereof:
"12. If the only offense to which §2K2.1 applies is 18 U.S.C. § 922 (i), (j), or (u), 18
U.S.C. § 924(j) or (k), or 26 U.S.C. § 5861(g) or (h) (offenses involving a stolen
firearm or stolen ammunition) and the base offense level is determined under
subsection (a)(7), do not apply the adjustment in subsection (b)(4) unless the
offense involved a firearm with an altered or obliterated serial number. This is
because the base offense level takes into account that the firearm or ammunition
was stolen.
Similarly, if the only offense to which §2K2.1 applies is 18 U.S.C. § 922(k)
(offenses involving an altered or obliterated serial number) and the base offense
level is determined under subsection (a)(7), do not apply the adjustment in
subsection (b)(4) unless the offense involved a stolen firearm or stolen
ammunition. This is because the base offense level takes into account that the
firearm had an altered or obliterated serial number.".
Reason for Amendment: This is a five-part amendment. First, the amendment revises §2K2.1
(Unlawful Receipt, Possession, or Transportation of Firearms or Ammunition; Prohibited
Transactions Involving Firearms or Ammunition) to provide increased offense levels for
possession of a semiautomatic assault weapon that correspond to the offense levels currently
provided for possession of machineguns and other firearms described in 26 U.S.C. § 5845(a).
Second, the amendment addresses section 110201 of the Violent Crime Control Law
Enforcement Act of 1994 by providing an offense level of six for the misdemeanor portion of
18 U.S.C. § 922(x)(1) (involving sale or transfer of a handgun or ammunition to a juvenile).
Amendment 523 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003
– 448 –
For an offense under the felony portion of 18 U.S.C. § 922(x)(1) (involving the sale or transfer
of a handgun or handgun ammunition to a juvenile knowing or having reasonable cause to
believe that the handgun or ammunition was intended to be used in a crime), the enhancement
in subsection (b)(5) will provide a minimum offense level of 18. Third, the amendment
addresses section 110401 of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 by
adding to the definition of a "prohibited person" in §2K2.1 a person under the court order
described in that section of the Act. Fourth, the amendment provides an offense level of six
for the misdemeanors set forth in 18 U.S.C. § 922 (s) and (t) (involving violations of the Brady
Act). Fifth, the amendment clarifies that Application Note 12 in §2K2.1 applies only to cases
in which the base offense level is determined under §2K2.1(a)(7).
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1995.
523. Amendment: The Commentary to §2L1.2 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note
2 by deleting:
"a sentence at or near the maximum of the applicable guideline range may be warranted",
and inserting in lieu thereof:
"an upward departure may be warranted. See §4A1.3 (Adequacy of Criminal History
Category)".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment revises §2L1.2 (Unlawfully Entering or Remaining
in the United States) to authorize the court to consider an upward departure in the case of a
defendant with repeated prior instances of deportation not resulting in a criminal conviction.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1995.
524. Amendment: Section 2L2.1(b)(2) is amended by deleting "sets of documents" and inserting
in lieu thereof "documents"; and by deleting "Sets of Documents" and inserting in lieu thereof
"Documents".
Section 2L2.1(b) is amended by inserting the following additional subdivision:
"(3) If the defendant knew, believed, or had reason to believe that a passport or visa
was to be used to facilitate the commission of a felony offense, other than an
offense involving violation of the immigration laws, increase by 4 levels.".
The Commentary to §2L2.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 2 by inserting
"of documents" immediately before "intended"; and by deleting "documents as one set" and
inserting in lieu thereof "set as one document".
The Commentary to §2L2.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by inserting the
following additional note:
"3. Subsection (b)(3) provides an enhancement if the defendant knew, believed, or
November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment 526
– 449 –
had reason to believe that a passport or visa was to be used to facilitate the
commission of a felony offense, other than an offense involving violation of the
immigration laws. If the defendant knew, believed, or had reason to believe that
the felony offense to be committed was of an especially serious type, an upward
departure may be warranted.".
Section 2L2.2 is amended by inserting the following additional subsection:
"(c) Cross Reference
(1) If the defendant used a passport or visa in the commission or attempted
commission of a felony offense, other than an offense involving violation
of the immigration laws, apply --
(A) §2X1.1 (Attempt, Solicitation, or Conspiracy) in respect to that
felony offense, if the resulting offense level is greater than that
determined above; or
(B) if death resulted, the most analogous offense guideline from
Chapter Two, Part A, Subpart 1 (Homicide), if the resulting
offense level is greater than that determined above.".
Reason for Amendment: This is a three-part amendment. First, this amendment provides an
enhancement in §2L2.1 (Trafficking in a Document Relating to Naturalization, Citizenship, or
Legal Resident Status, or a United States Passport; False Statement in Respect to the
Citizenship or Immigration Status of Another; Fraudulent Marriage to Assist Alien to Evade
Immigration Law) if the defendant trafficked in a passport or visa knowing, believing, or
having reason to believe that the passport or visa was to be used to facilitate the commission
of a felony offense, other than an offense involving violation of the immigration laws. Second,
this amendment corrects a technical error in §2L2.1(b)(2). Third, this amendment adds a cross
reference to §2L2.2 (Fraudulently Acquiring Documents Relating to Naturalization,
Citizenship, or Legal Resident Status for Own Use; False Personation or Fraudulent Marriage
by Alien to Evade Immigration Law; Fraudulently Acquiring or Improperly Using a United
States Passport) that addresses the case of a defendant who uses a passport or visa in the
commission or attempted commission of a felony offense, other than an offense involving
violation of the immigration laws.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1995.
525. Amendment: Section 2P1.2(a)(2) is amended by inserting "methamphetamine," immediately
following "PCP,".
Section 2P1.2(a)(3) is amended by inserting "methamphetamine," immediately following
"PCP,".
Section 2P1.2 is amended by deleting subsection (c)(1) as follows:
"(1) If the defendant is convicted under 18 U.S.C. § 1791(a)(1) and is punishable
Amendment 526 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003
– 450 –
under 18 U.S.C. § 1791(b)(1), the offense level is 2 plus the offense level from
§2D1.1, but in no event less than level 26.",
and inserting in lieu thereof:
"(1) If the object of the offense was the distribution of a controlled substance, apply
the offense level from §2D1.1 (Unlawful Manufacturing, Importing, Exporting,
or Trafficking; Attempt or Conspiracy). Provided, that if the defendant is
convicted under 18 U.S.C. § 1791(a)(1) and is punishable under 18 U.S.C.
§ 1791(b)(1), and the resulting offense level is less than level 26, increase to
level 26.".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment conforms the offense level for methamphetamine
offenses in a correctional or detention facility to that of other controlled substance offenses
committed in a correctional or detention facility that have the same statutory maximum penalty.
This change reflects the increase in the maximum penalty for methamphetamine offenses in
section 90101 of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994. In addition,
the amendment expands the cross reference in §2P1.2(c)(1) to cover distribution of all
controlled substances in a correctional or detention facility.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1995.
526. Amendment: Chapter Three, Part A, is amended by inserting an additional section as §3A1.4
(International Terrorism).
Section 5K2.15 (Terrorism) is deleted in its entirety as follows:
"§5K2.15. Terrorism (Policy Statement)
If the defendant committed the offense in furtherance of a terroristic
action, the court may increase the sentence above the authorized
guideline range.".
Reason for Amendment: Section 120004 of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement
Act of 1994 directs the Commission to provide an appropriate enhancement for any felony that
involves or is intended to promote international terrorism. The amendment addresses this
directive by adding a Chapter Three enhancement at §3A1.4 (International Terrorism) in place
of the upward departure provision at §5K2.15 (Terrorism).
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1995.
527. Amendment: Section 3B1.4 is deleted in its entirety as follows:
"§3B1.4. In any other case, no adjustment is made for role in the offense.
Commentary
Many offenses are committed by a single individual or by individuals of roughly
November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment 528
– 451 –
equal culpability so that none of them will receive an adjustment under this Part. In
addition, some participants in a criminal organization may receive increases under
§3B1.1 (Aggravating Role) while others receive decreases under §3B1.2 (Mitigating
Role) and still other participants receive no adjustment.".
A new §3B1.4 (Using a Minor To Commit a Crime) is inserted in lieu thereof.
Reason for Amendment: This amendment implements the directive in Section 140008 of the
Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 (pertaining to the use of a minor in
the commission of an offense) in a slightly broader form by adding a new §3B1.4 (Using a
Minor to Commit a Crime). The existing §3B1.4 (untitled) is deleted as unnecessary.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1995.
528. Amendment: The Commentary to §4B1.1 captioned "Background" is amended by deleting:
"28 U.S.C. § 994(h) mandates that the Commission assure that certain ‘career’ offenders,
as defined in the statute, receive a sentence of imprisonment ‘at or near the maximum
term authorized.’ Section 4B1.1 implements this mandate. The legislative history of this
provision suggests that the phrase ‘maximum term authorized’ should be construed as
the maximum term authorized by statute. See S. Rep. 98-225, 98th Cong., 1st Sess. 175
(1983), 128 Cong. Rec. 26, 511-12 (1982) (text of ‘Career Criminals’ amendment by
Senator Kennedy), 26, 515 (brief summary of amendment), 26, 517-18 (statement of
Senator Kennedy).",
and inserting in lieu thereof:
"Section 994(h) of Title 28, United States Code, mandates that the Commission assure
that certain ‘career’ offenders receive a sentence of imprisonment ‘at or near the
maximum term authorized.’ Section 4B1.1 implements this directive, with the definition
of a career offender tracking in large part the criteria set forth in 28 U.S.C. § 994(h).
However, in accord with its general guideline promulgation authority under 28 U.S.C.
§ 994(a)-(f), and its amendment authority under 28 U.S.C. § 994(o) and (p), the
Commission has modified this definition in several respects to focus more precisely on
the class of recidivist offenders for whom a lengthy term of imprisonment is appropriate
and to avoid ‘unwarranted sentencing disparities among defendants with similar records
who have been found guilty of similar criminal conduct . . . .’ 28 U.S.C. § 991(b)(1)(B).
The Commission’s refinement of this definition over time is consistent with Congress’s
choice of a directive to the Commission rather than a mandatory minimum sentencing
statute (‘The [Senate Judiciary] Committee believes that such a directive to the
Commission will be more effective; the guidelines development process can assure
consistent and rational implementation for the Committee’s view that substantial prison
terms should be imposed on repeat violent offenders and repeat drug traffickers.’ S.
Rep. No. 225, 98th Cong., 1st Sess. 175 (1983)).
The legislative history of this provision suggests that the phrase ‘maximum term
authorized’ should be construed as the maximum term authorized by statute. See S. Rep.
No. 225, 98th Cong., 1st Sess. 175 (1983); 128 Cong. Rec. 26,511-12 (1982) (text of
Amendment 529 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003
– 452 –
‘Career Criminals’ amendment by Senator Kennedy); id. at 26,515 (brief summary of
amendment); id. at 26,517-18 (statement of Senator Kennedy).".
Application Note 1 of the Commentary to §4B1.2 is repromulgated without change.
Reason for Amendment: This amendment repromulgates Application Note 1 of the
Commentary to §4B1.2 (Definition of Terms Used in Section 4B1.1) and inserts additional
background commentary in §4B1.1 (Career Offender) explaining the Commission’s rationale
and authority for its implementation of this guideline. The amendment responds to a decision
by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in United States v.
Price, 990 F.2d 1367 (D.C. Cir. 1993). In Price, the court invalidated application of the career
offender guideline to a defendant convicted of a drug conspiracy because 28 U.S.C. § 994(h),
which the Commission cites as the mandating authority for the career offender guideline, does
not expressly refer to inchoate offenses. The court indicated that it did not foreclose
Commission authority to include conspiracy offenses under the career offender guideline by
drawing upon its broader guideline promulgation authority in 28 U.S.C. § 994(a). See also
United States v. Mendoza-Figueroa, 28 F.3d 766 (8th Cir. 1994), vacated (Sept. 2, 1994);
United States v. Bellazerius, 24 F.3d 698 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 115 S. Ct. 375 (1994). Other
circuits have rejected the Price analysis and upheld the Commission’s definition of "controlled
substance offense." For example, the Ninth Circuit considered the legislative history to 994(h)
and determined that the Senate Report clearly indicated that 994(h) was not the sole enabling
statute for the career offender guidelines. United States v. Heim, 15 F.3d 830 (9th Cir.), cert.
denied, 115 S. Ct. 55 (1994). See also United States v. Hightower, 25 F.3d 182 (3d Cir.), cert.
denied, 115 S. Ct. 370 (1994); United States v. Damerville, 27 F.3d 254 (7th Cir.), cert. denied,
115 S. Ct. 445 (1994); United States v. Allen, 24 F.3d 1180 (10th Cir.), cert. denied, 115 S. Ct.
493 (1994); United States v. Baker, 16 F.3d 854 (8th Cir. 1994); United States v. Linnear, 40
F.3d 215 (7th Cir. 1994); United States v. Kennedy, 32 F.3d 876 (4th Cir. 1994), cert. denied,

Ct. 1118 (1995).
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1995.
529. Amendment: The Commentary to §5D1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by
deleting Note 1 as follows:
"Subsection 5D1.1(a) requires imposition of supervised release following any sentence
of imprisonment for a term of more than one year or if required by a specific statute.
While there may be cases within this category that do not require post release
supervision, these cases are the exception and may be handled by a departure from this
guideline.",
and inserting in lieu thereof:
"Under subsection (a), the court is required to impose a term of supervised release to
follow imprisonment if a sentence of imprisonment of more than one year is imposed or
if a term of supervised release is required by a specific statute. The court may depart
from this guideline and not impose a term of supervised release if it determines that
supervised release is neither required by statute nor required for any of the following
November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment 530
– 453 –
reasons: (1) to protect the public welfare; (2) to enforce a financial condition; (3) to
provide drug or alcohol treatment or testing; (4) to assist the reintegration of the
defendant into the community; or (5) to accomplish any other sentencing purpose
authorized by statute.".
The Commentary to §5D1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by deleting Note 2 as
follows:
"2. Under §5D1.1(b), the court may impose a term of supervised release in cases
involving imprisonment for a term of one year or less. The court may consider
the need for a term of supervised release to facilitate the reintegration of the
defendant into the community; to enforce a fine, restitution order, or other
condition; or to fulfill any other purpose authorized by statute.",
and inserting in lieu thereof:
"2. Under subsection (b), the court may impose a term of supervised release to
follow a term of imprisonment of one year or less for any of the reasons set forth
in Application Note 1.".
Section 5D1.2 is amended by deleting:
"(a) If a defendant is convicted under a statute that requires a term of supervised
release, the term shall be at least three years but not more than five years, or the
minimum period required by statute, whichever is greater.",
and by redesignating subsection (b) as subsection (a).
Section 5D1.2(a) (formerly §5D1.2(b)) is amended by deleting "Otherwise, when" and
inserting in lieu thereof "If".
Section 5D1.2 is amended by inserting the following additional subsection:
"(b) Provided, that the term of supervised release imposed shall in no event be less
than any statutorily required term of supervised release.".
The Commentary to §5D1.2 captioned "Background" is amended in the second sentence by
deleting "(a)" and inserting in lieu thereof "(b)"; and by deleting the third sentence as follows:
"Subsection (b) applies to all other statutes.".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment sets forth with greater specificity the
circumstances under which the court may depart from the requirements of §5D1.1 (Imposition
of a Term of Supervised Release) and impose no term of supervised release. In addition, the
amendment deletes, as unnecessary, the requirement in §5D1.2 (Term of Supervised Release)
of a term of supervised release of three to five years whenever a statute requires any term of
supervised release. Instead, the amendment provides that, in the case of a statute requiring a
term of supervised release, the length of the term of supervised release shall be determined by
Amendment 530 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003
– 454 –
the class of felony of which the defendant was convicted, but shall not be less than any
minimum term of supervised release required by statute.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1995.
530. Amendment: Section 5E1.1(a)(2) is amended by deleting "49 U.S.C. § 1472(h), (i), (j), or (n)"
and inserting in lieu thereof "49 U.S.C. § 46312, § 46502, or § 46504".

The Commentary to §5E1.1 is amended by inserting the following immediately before
"Background":
"Application Note:
1. In the case of a conviction under certain statutes, additional requirements
regarding restitution apply. See 18 U.S.C. §§ 2248 and 2259 (applying to
convictions under 18 U.S.C. §§ 2241-2258 for sexual-abuse offenses and sexual
exploitation of minors); 18 U.S.C. § 2327 (applying to convictions under 18
U.S.C. §§ 1028-1029, 1341-1344 for telemarketing-fraud offenses); 18 U.S.C.
§ 2264 (applying to convictions under 18 U.S.C. §§ 2261-2262 for domestic-
violence offenses). To the extent that any of the above-noted statutory
provisions conflict with the provisions of this guideline, the applicable statutory
provision shall control.".
Reason for Amendment: Section 40113 of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement
Act of 1994 requires "mandatory" restitution for offenses involving sexual abuse and sexual
exploitation of children under 18 U.S.C. §§ 2241-2258. Sections 40221 and 250002 add
similar "mandatory" restitution provisions for offenses involving domestic violence (18 U.S.C.
§ 2264) and telemarketing fraud (18 U.S.C. § 2327). These provisions also require that
compliance with a restitution order be a condition of probation or supervised release, have
broader definitions of loss than 18 U.S.C. § 3663, and apply "notwithstanding section 3663,
and in addition to any civil or criminal penalty authorized by law." This amendment adds
commentary to §5E1.1 (Restitution) to alert courts to these statutory provisions.
In addition, this amendment conforms §5E1.1 to the redesignation of 49 U.S.C. § 1472(h), (i),
(j), and (n) as 49 U.S.C. §§ 46312, 46502(a), (b), and 46504, and the redesignation of Rule
32(c)(2)(D) as Rule 32(b)(4)(D).
November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment 533
– 455 –
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1995.
531. Amendment: Chapter Five, Part K, Subpart Two is amended by inserting an additional policy
statement as §5K2.17 (High-Capacity, Semiautomatic Firearms).
Reason for Amendment: This amendment addresses the directive in section 110501 of the
Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 to provide an appropriate
enhancement for a crime of violence or drug trafficking crime if a semiautomatic firearm is
involved.
According to data reviewed by the Commission, semiautomatic firearms are used in 50-70
percent of offenses involving a firearm. Thus, offenses involving a semiautomatic firearm
represent the typical or "heartland" case under the guidelines. Consequently, the firearms
enhancements in the guidelines for crimes of violence and drug trafficking can be considered
to take into account the fact that firearms involved in these offenses typically are
semiautomatic. Moreover, the "firepower" or "dangerousness" of semiautomatic firearms,
compared to other types of firearms, varies substantially with caliber and magazine capacity.
For example, a .25 caliber, six-shot semiautomatic pistol is not considered as having as much
firepower as a .38 caliber, six-shot revolver or a .357 magnum, six-shot revolver. A nine-
millimeter semiautomatic pistol fires a somewhat more powerful cartridge than a .38 caliber
revolver and a somewhat less powerful cartridge than a .357 magnum revolver. But some nine-
millimeter semiautomatic pistols hold from 14-18 cartridges, compared to six cartridges for a
revolver. A high magazine capacity, nine-millimeter semiautomatic pistol can be said to have
significantly more firepower than a revolver because it can fire a significantly larger number
of shots without reloading.
If harm actually results (e.g., death or bodily injury), the guidelines generally take that harm
into account directly. Consequently, in considering any distinction between semiautomatic
firearms and other firearms, the issue is whether there is any significant difference in the risk
of harm. The difference in the risk of harm also varies widely with the circumstances of the
offense. For example, in a robbery at very close range, the difference in the likelihood of death
or bodily injury between a revolver and semiautomatic pistol would seem to be small. In
contrast, in a drive-by shooting the greater firepower of a semiautomatic weapon likely would
have a more significant effect on the likelihood of death or injury.
After considering the above factors, the Commission determined that the most appropriate
approach at this time was to provide a specific basis for an upward departure when a high-
capacity semiautomatic firearm is possessed in connection with a crime of violence or drug
trafficking offense, thereby allowing the courts the flexibility to take this factor into account
as appropriate in the circumstances of the particular case.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1995.
532. Amendment: Chapter Five, Part K, Subpart Two is amended by inserting an additional policy
statement as §5K1.18 (Violent Street Gangs).
Reason for Amendment: This amendment expressly provides a basis for an upward departure
in the case of a defendant subject to a statutorily enhanced maximum penalty under 18 U.S.C.
Amendment 533 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003
– 456 –
§ 521 (pertaining to criminal street gangs), as enacted by section 150000 of the Violent Crime
and Law Enforcement Act of 1994.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1995.
533. Amendment: Section 7B1.3(g)(2) is amended by deleting "the defendant may, to the extent
permitted by law, be ordered to recommence supervised release upon release from
imprisonment" and inserting in lieu thereof:
"the court may include a requirement that the defendant be placed on a term of
supervised release upon release from imprisonment. The length of such a term of
supervised release shall not exceed the term of supervised release authorized by statute
for the offense that resulted in the original term of supervised release, less any term of
imprisonment that was imposed upon revocation of supervised release. 18 U.S.C. §
3583(h)".
The Commentary to §7B1.3 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 2 by deleting:
". This statute, however, neither expressly authorizes nor precludes a court from
ordering that a term of supervised release recommence after revocation. Under
§7B1.3(g)(2), the court may order, to the extent permitted by law, the recommencement
of a supervised release term following revocation",
and inserting in lieu thereof:
", (g)-(i). Under 18 U.S.C. § 3583(h) (effective September 13, 1994), the court, in the
case of revocation of supervised release and imposition of less than the maximum
imposable term of imprisonment, may order an additional period of supervised release
to follow imprisonment".
The Commentary to §7B1.3 captioned "Application Notes is amended by deleting:
"3. Subsection (c) provides for the use of certain alternatives to imprisonment upon
revocation. It is to be noted, however, that a court may decide that not every
alternative is authorized by statute in every circumstance. For example, in
United States v. Behnezhad, 907 F.2d 896 (9th Cir. 1990), the Ninth Circuit held
that where a term of supervised release was revoked there was no statutory
authority to impose a further term of supervised release. Under this decision, in
the case of a revocation of a term of supervised release, an alternative that is
contingent upon imposition of a further term of supervised release (e.g., a period
of imprisonment followed by a period of community confinement or detention
as a condition of supervised release) cannot be implemented. The Commission
has transmitted to the Congress a proposal for a statutory amendment to address
this issue.";
and by renumbering the remaining notes accordingly.
The Commentary to §7B1.4 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by deleting:
November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment 534
– 457 –
"5. Under 18 U.S.C. § 3565(a), upon a finding that a defendant violated a condition
of probation by being in possession of a controlled substance, the court is
required ‘to revoke the sentence of probation and sentence the defendant to not
less than one-third of the original sentence.’ Under 18 U.S.C. § 3583(g), upon
a finding that a defendant violated a condition of supervised release by being in
possession of a controlled substance, the court is required ‘to terminate
supervised release and sentence the defendant to serve in prison not less than
one-third of the term of supervised release.’ The Commission leaves to the court
the determination of whether evidence of drug usage established solely by
laboratory analysis constitutes ‘possession of a controlled substance’ as set forth
in 18 U.S.C. §§ 3565(a) and 3583(g).
6. Under 18 U.S.C. § 3565(b), upon a finding that a defendant violated a condition
of probation by the actual possession of a firearm, the court is required ‘to revoke
the sentence of probation and impose any other sentence that was available ... at
the time of initial sentencing.’",
and inserting in lieu thereof:
"5. Upon a finding that a defendant violated a condition of probation or supervised
release by being in possession of a controlled substance or firearm or by refusing
to comply with a condition requiring drug testing, the court is required to revoke
probation or supervised release and impose a sentence that includes a term of
imprisonment. 18 U.S.C. §§ 3565(b), 3583(g).
6. In the case of a defendant who fails a drug test, the court shall consider whether
the availability of appropriate substance abuse programs, or a defendant’s current
or past participation in such programs, warrants an exception from the
requirement of mandatory revocation and imprisonment under 18 U.S.C. §§
3565(b) and 3583(g). 18 U.S.C. §§ 3563(a), 3583(d).".
Reason for Amendment: Section 110505 of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement
Act of 1994 amends 18 U.S.C. § 3583(e)(3) by specifying that a defendant whose supervised
release term is revoked may not be required to serve more than five years in prison if the
offense that resulted in the term of supervised release is a Class A felony. The provision also
amends section 3583(g) by eliminating the mandatory re-imprisonment period of at least one-
third of the term of supervised release if the defendant possesses a controlled substance.
Additionally, the provision requires the courts to revoke probation or supervised release and
impose a sentence that includes a term of imprisonment if the defendant is found to be in
possession of a firearm, or refuses to participate in drug testing. Finally, the provision
expressly authorizes the court to order an additional, limited period of supervision following
revocation of supervised release and re-imprisonment.
Section 20414 of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 makes
mandatory a condition of probation requiring that the defendant refrain from any unlawful use
of a controlled substance. 18 U.S.C. § 3563(a)(4). The section also establishes a condition that
the defendant, with certain exceptions, submit to periodic drug tests. The existing mandatory
condition of probation requiring the defendant not to possess a controlled substance remains
Amendment 534 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003
– 458 –
unchanged. 18 U.S.C. § 3563(a)(3). Similar requirements are made with respect to conditions
of supervised release. 18 U.S.C. § 3583(d).
Section 110506 of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 mandates
revocation of probation and imposition of a term of imprisonment if the defendant violates
probation by possessing a controlled substance or a firearm, or by refusing to comply with drug
testing. 18 U.S.C. § 3565(b). It does not require revocation in the case of use of a controlled
substance (although use presumptively may establish possession). No minimum term of
imprisonment is required other than a sentence that includes a "term of imprisonment"
consistent with the sentencing guidelines and revocation policy statements. Similar
requirements are set forth in 18 U.S.C. § 3583(g) with respect to conditions of supervised
release.
Section 20414 permits "an exception in accordance with United States Sentencing Commission
guidelines" from the mandatory revocation provisions of section 3565(b), "when considering
any action against a defendant who fails a drug test administered in accordance with [section
3563(a)(4)]." The exception from the mandatory revocation provisions appears limited to a
defendant who fails the test and does not appear to apply to a defendant who refuses to take the
test.
This amendment conforms §§7B1.3 (Revocation of Probation or Supervised Release) and
7B1.4 (Term of Imprisonment) to these revised statutory provisions.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1995.

535. Amendment: Section 5G1.3 is amended by deleting:
"(c) (Policy Statement) In any other case, the sentence for the instant offense shall be
imposed to run consecutively to the prior undischarged term of imprisonment to
the extent necessary to achieve a reasonable incremental punishment for the
instant offense.",
and inserting in lieu thereof:
"(c) (Policy Statement) In any other case, the sentence for the instant offense may be
imposed to run concurrently, partially concurrently, or consecutively to the prior
undischarged term of imprisonment to achieve a reasonable punishment for the
instant offense.".
The Commentary to §5G1.3 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 1 by inserting
"Consecutive sentence - subsection (a) cases." immediately before "Under"; and by deleting
"where the instant offense (or any part thereof)" and inserting in lieu thereof "when the instant
offense".
The Commentary to §5G1.3 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by deleting:
"2. Subsection (b) (which may apply only if subsection (a) does not apply),
addresses cases in which the conduct resulting in the undischarged term of
imprisonment has been fully taken into account under §1B1.3 (Relevant
Conduct) in determining the offense level for the instant offense. This can occur,
for example, where a defendant is prosecuted in both federal and state court, or
in two or more federal jurisdictions, for the same criminal conduct or for
different criminal transactions that were part of the same course of conduct.
When a sentence is imposed pursuant to subsection (b), the court should adjust
for any term of imprisonment already served as a result of the conduct taken into
account in determining the sentence for the instant offense. Example: The
defendant has been convicted of a federal offense charging the sale of 30 grams
November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment 535
– 465 –
of cocaine. Under §1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct), the defendant is held accountable
for the sale of an additional 15 grams of cocaine that is part of the same course
of conduct for which the defendant has been convicted and sentenced in state
court (the defendant received a nine-month sentence of imprisonment, of which
he has served six months at the time of sentencing on the instant federal offense).
The guideline range applicable to the defendant is 10-16 months (Chapter Two
offense level of 14 for sale of 45 grams of cocaine; 2-level reduction for
acceptance of responsibility; final offense level of 12; Criminal History Category
I). The court determines that a sentence of 13 months provides the appropriate
total punishment. Because the defendant has already served six months on the
related state charge, a sentence of seven months, imposed to run concurrently
with the remainder of the defendant’s state sentence, achieves this result. For
clarity, the court should note on the Judgment in a Criminal Case Order that the
sentence imposed is not a departure from the guidelines because the defendant
has been credited for guideline purposes under §5G1.3(b) with six months served
in state custody.
3. Where the defendant is subject to an undischarged term of imprisonment in
circumstances other than those set forth in subsections (a) or (b), subsection (c)
applies and the court shall impose a consecutive sentence to the extent necessary
to fashion a sentence resulting in a reasonable incremental punishment for the
multiple offenses. In some circumstances, such incremental punishment can be
achieved by the imposition of a sentence that is concurrent with the remainder
of the unexpired term of imprisonment. In such cases, a consecutive sentence is
not required. To the extent practicable, the court should consider a reasonable
incremental penalty to be a sentence for the instant offense that results in a
combined sentence of imprisonment that approximates the total punishment that
would have been imposed under §5G1.2 (Sentencing on Multiple Counts of
Conviction) had all of the offenses been federal offenses for which sentences
were being imposed at the same time. It is recognized that this determination
frequently will require an approximation. Where the defendant is serving a term
of imprisonment for a state offense, the information available may permit only
a rough estimate of the total punishment that would have been imposed under the
guidelines. Where the offense resulting in the undischarged term of
imprisonment is a federal offense for which a guideline determination has
previously been made, the task will be somewhat more straightforward, although
even in such cases a precise determination may not be possible.
It is not intended that the above methodology be applied in a manner that unduly
complicates or prolongs the sentencing process. Additionally, this methodology
does not, itself, require the court to depart from the guideline range established
for the instant federal offense. Rather, this methodology is meant to assist the
court in determining the appropriate sentence (e.g., the appropriate point within
the applicable guideline range, whether to order the sentence to run concurrently
or consecutively to the undischarged term of imprisonment, or whether a
departure is warranted). Generally, the court may achieve an appropriate
sentence through its determination of an appropriate point within the applicable
guideline range for the instant federal offense, combined with its determination
Amendment 535 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003
– 466 –
of whether that sentence will run concurrently or consecutively to the
undischarged term of imprisonment.
Illustrations of the Application of Subsection (c):
(A) The guideline range applicable to the instant federal offense is 24-30
months. The court determines that a total punishment of 36 months’
imprisonment would appropriately reflect the instant federal offense and
the offense resulting in the undischarged term of imprisonment. The
undischarged term of imprisonment is an indeterminate sentence of
imprisonment with a 60-month maximum. At the time of sentencing on
the instant federal offense, the defendant has served ten months on the
undischarged term of imprisonment. In this case, a sentence of 26
months’ imprisonment to be served concurrently with the remainder of
the undischarged term of imprisonment would (1) be within the guideline
range for the instant federal offense, and (2) achieve an appropriate total
punishment (36 months).
(B) The applicable guideline range for the instant federal offense is 24-30
months. The court determines that a total punishment of 36 months’
imprisonment would appropriately reflect the instant federal offense and
the offense resulting in the undischarged term of imprisonment. The
undischarged term of imprisonment is a six-month determinate sentence.
At the time of sentencing on the instant federal offense, the defendant has
served three months on the undischarged term of imprisonment. In this
case, a sentence of 30 months’ imprisonment to be served consecutively
to the undischarged term of imprisonment would (1) be within the
guideline range for the instant federal offense, and (2) achieve an
appropriate total punishment (36 months).
(C) The applicable guideline range for the instant federal offense is 24-30
months. The court determines that a total punishment of 60 months’
imprisonment would appropriately reflect the instant federal offense and
the offense resulting in the undischarged term of imprisonment. The
undischarged term of imprisonment is a 12-month determinate sentence.
In this case, a sentence of 30 months’ imprisonment to be served
consecutively to the undischarged term of imprisonment would be the
greatest sentence imposable without departure for the instant federal
offense.
(D) The applicable guideline range for the instant federal offense is 24-30
months. The court determines that a total punishment of 36 months’
imprisonment would appropriately reflect the instant federal offense and
the offense resulting in the undischarged term of imprisonment. The
undischarged term of imprisonment is an indeterminate sentence with a
60-month maximum. At the time of sentencing on the instant federal
offense, the defendant has served 22 months on the undischarged term of
imprisonment. In this case, a sentence of 24 months to be served
November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment 535
– 467 –
concurrently with the remainder of the undischarged term of
imprisonment would be the lowest sentence imposable without departure
for the instant federal offense.
4. If the defendant was on federal or state probation, parole, or supervised release
at the time of the instant offense, and has had such probation, parole, or
supervised release revoked, the sentence for the instant offense should be
imposed to be served consecutively to the term imposed for the violation of
probation, parole, or supervised release in order to provide an incremental
penalty for the violation of probation, parole, or supervised release (in accord
with the policy expressed in §§7B1.3 and 7B1.4)",
and inserting in lieu thereof:
"2. Adjusted concurrent sentence - subsection (b) cases. When a sentence is
imposed pursuant to subsection (b), the court should adjust the sentence for any
period of imprisonment already served as a result of the conduct taken into
account in determining the guideline range for the instant offense if the court
determines that period of imprisonment will not be credited to the federal
sentence by the Bureau of Prisons. Example: The defendant is convicted of a
federal offense charging the sale of 30 grams of cocaine. Under §1B1.3
(Relevant Conduct), the defendant is held accountable for the sale of an
additional 15 grams of cocaine, an offense for which the defendant has been
convicted and sentenced in state court. The defendant received a nine-month
sentence of imprisonment for the state offense and has served six months on that
sentence at the time of sentencing on the instant federal offense. The guideline
range applicable to the defendant is 10-16 months (Chapter Two offense level of
14 for sale of 45 grams of cocaine; 2-level reduction for acceptance of
responsibility; final offense level of 12; Criminal History Category I). The court
determines that a sentence of 13 months provides the appropriate total
punishment. Because the defendant has already served six months on the related
state charge as of the date of sentencing on the instant federal offense, a sentence
of seven months, imposed to run concurrently with the three months remaining
on the defendant’s state sentence, achieves this result. For clarity, the court
should note on the Judgment in a Criminal Case Order that the sentence imposed
is not a departure from the guideline range because the defendant has been
credited for guideline purposes under §5G1.3(b) with six months served in state
custody that will not be credited to the federal sentence under 18 U.S.C. §
3585(b).
3. Concurrent or consecutive sentence - subsection (c) cases. In circumstances not
covered under subsection (a) or (b), subsection (c) applies. Under this
subsection, the court may impose a sentence concurrently, partially concurrently,
or consecutively. To achieve a reasonable punishment and avoid unwarranted
disparity, the court should consider the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. § 3584
(referencing 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)) and be cognizant of:
(a) the type (e.g., determinate, indeterminate/parolable) and length of the
Amendment 535 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003
– 468 –
prior undischarged sentence;
(b) the time served on the undischarged sentence and the time likely to be
served before release;
(c) the fact that the prior undischarged sentence may have been imposed in
state court rather than federal court, or at a different time before the same
or different federal court; and
(d) any other circumstance relevant to the determination of an appropriate
sentence for the instant offense.
4. Partially concurrent sentence. In some cases under subsection (c), a partially
concurrent sentence may achieve most appropriately the desired result. To
impose a partially concurrent sentence, the court may provide in the Judgment
in a Criminal Case Order that the sentence for the instant offense shall commence
(A) when the defendant is released from the prior undischarged sentence, or (B)
on a specified date, whichever is earlier. This order provides for a fully
consecutive sentence if the defendant is released on the undischarged term of
imprisonment on or before the date specified in the order, and a partially
concurrent sentence if the defendant is not released on the undischarged term of
imprisonment by that date.
5. Complex situations. Occasionally, the court may be faced with a complex case
in which a defendant may be subject to multiple undischarged terms of
imprisonment that seemingly call for the application of different rules. In such
a case, the court may exercise its discretion in accordance with subsection (c) to
fashion a sentence of appropriate length and structure it to run in any appropriate
manner to achieve a reasonable punishment for the instant offense.
6. Revocations. If the defendant was on federal or state probation, parole, or
supervised release at the time of the instant offense, and has had such probation,
parole, or supervised release revoked, the sentence for the instant offense should
be imposed to run consecutively to the term imposed for the violation of
probation, parole, or supervised release in order to provide an incremental
penalty for the violation of probation, parole, or supervised release. See §7B1.3
(Revocation of Probation or Supervised Release) (setting forth a policy that any
imprisonment penalty imposed for violating probation or supervised release
should be consecutive to any sentence of imprisonment being served or
subsequently imposed).".
The Commentary to §5G1.3 captioned "Background" is amended by deleting:
"This guideline provides direction to the court when a term of imprisonment is imposed
on a defendant who is already subject to an undischarged term of imprisonment. See 18
U.S.C. § 3584. Except in the cases in which subsection (a) applies, this guideline is
intended to result in an appropriate incremental punishment for the instant offense that
most nearly approximates the sentence that would have been imposed had all the
November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment 535
– 469 –
sentences been imposed at the same time.",
and inserting in lieu thereof:
"In a case in which a defendant is subject to an undischarged sentence of imprisonment,
the court generally has authority to impose an imprisonment sentence on the current
offense to run concurrently with or consecutively to the prior undischarged term.
18 U.S.C. § 3584(a). Exercise of that authority, however, is predicated on the court’s
consideration of the factors listed in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a), including any applicable
guidelines or policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.".
Reason for Amendment: This is a two-part amendment. First, this amendment clarifies the
application of subsections (a) and (b) of this guideline. Second, in circumstances covered by
the policy statement in subsection (c), this amendment affords the sentencing court additional
flexibility to impose, as appropriate, a consecutive, concurrent, or partially concurrent sentence
in order to achieve a reasonable punishment for the instant offense.
Authority to impose a partially concurrent sentence is found in the Sentencing Reform Act of
1984 (SRA). In enacting 28 U.S.C. § 994(l)(1), Congress contemplated that 18 U.S.C. § 3584
would allow imposition of partially concurrent sentences, in addition to fully concurrent or
consecutive sentences. ("It is the Committee’s intent that, to the extent feasible, the sentences
for each of the multiple offenses be determined separately and the degree to which they should
overlap be specified.") S. Rep. No. 225, 98th Cong., 1st Sess. 177 (1983). Without the ability
to fashion such a sentence, the instruction to the Commission in 28 U.S.C. § 994(l)(1) to
provide a reasonable incremental penalty for additional offenses could not be implemented
successfully in certain situations, particularly when the defendant’s release date on an
undischarged term of imprisonment cannot be determined readily in advance (e.g., in the case
of an indeterminate sentence subject to parole release).
Prior to the SRA, only the Bureau of Prisons had the authority to commence a federal sentence
prior to the defendant’s release from imprisonment on a state sentence. See, e.g., United States
v. Segal, 549 F.2d 1293, 1301 (9th Cir. 1977). SRA legislative history pertaining to 18 U.S.C.
§ 3584 indicates that this new section was intended to authorize imposition of a federal prison
sentence to run concurrently or consecutively to a state prison sentence. "This . . . [section
3584] changes the law that now applies to a person sentenced for a Federal offense who is
already serving a term of imprisonment for a state offense." S. Rep. No. 225, supra at 127.
"Thus, it is intended that this provision be construed contrary to the holding in United States
v. Segal. . ." Id. (at 127 n.314). See United States v. Hardesty, 958 F.2d 910, 914 (stating that,
under section 3584, "Congress has expressly granted federal judges the discretion to impose
a sentence concurrent to a state prison term"), aff’d en banc, 977 F.2d 1347 (9th Cir. 1992).
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1995.
536. Amendment: Section 1B1.10(c) is amended by deleting "and 506" and inserting in lieu
thereof "505, 506, and 516".
The Commentary to §1B1.10 captioned "Background" is amended in the fourth paragraph by
inserting an asterisk immediately following "old guidelines"; and by inserting, as a note,
Amendment 537 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003

following the Background Commentary:
"*So in original. Probably should be ‘to fall above the amended guidelines’.".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment expands the listing in §1B1.10(d) to implement
the directive in 28 U.S.C. § 994(u) in respect to guideline amendments that may be considered
for retroactive application. The amendment also makes an editorial addition to the
Commentary to §1B1.10 (Retroactivity of Amended Guideline Range).
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1995.
537. Amendment: Section 2G2.1(a) is amended by deleting "25" and inserting in lieu thereof "27".
Section 2G2.1(b) is amended by deleting:

and inserting in lieu thereof:
"(1) If the offense involved a victim who had (A) not attained the age of twelve years,
increase by 4 levels; or (B) attained the age of twelve years but not attained the age of
sixteen years, increase by 2 levels.".
Section 2G2.1(b) is amended by inserting after subdivision (2) the following additional
subdivision:

subdivision:
"(5) If a computer was used for the transmission of the material or a notice or advertisement
of the material, increase by 2 levels.".
The Commentary to §2G2.2 captioned "Statutory Provisions" is amended by inserting ",

– 471 –
"1. ‘Distribution,’ as used in this guideline, includes any act related to distribution for
pecuniary gain, including production, transportation, and possession with intent to
distribute.
2. ‘Sexually explicit conduct,’ as used in this guideline, has the meaning set forth in 18
U.S.C. § 2256.",
and inserting in lieu thereof:
"1. For purposes of this guideline—
‘Distribution’ includes any act related to distribution for pecuniary gain, including
production, transportation, and possession with intent to distribute.
‘Pattern of activity involving the sexual abuse or exploitation of a minor’ means any
combination of two or more separate instances of the sexual abuse or sexual exploitation
of a minor by the defendant, whether or not the abuse or exploitation (A) occurred
during the course of the offense, (B) involved the same or different victims, or (C)
resulted in a conviction for such conduct.
‘Sexual abuse or exploitation’ means conduct constituting criminal sexual abuse of a
minor, sexual exploitation of a minor, abusive sexual contact of a minor, any similar
offense under state law, or an attempt or conspiracy to commit any of the above offenses.
‘Sexual abuse or exploitation’ does not include trafficking in material relating to the
sexual abuse or exploitation of a minor.
‘Sexually explicit conduct’ has the meaning set forth in 18 U.S.C. § 2256.
2. If the defendant engaged in the sexual abuse or exploitation of a minor at any time
(whether or not such abuse or exploitation occurred during the course of the offense or
resulted in a conviction for such conduct) and subsection (b)(4) does not apply, an
upward departure may be warranted. In addition, an upward departure may be warranted
if the defendant received an enhancement under subsection (b)(4) but that enhancement
does not adequately reflect the seriousness of the sexual abuse or exploitation involved.
Prior convictions taken into account under subsection (b)(4) are also counted for
purposes of determining criminal history points pursuant to Chapter Four, Part A
(Criminal History).".
The Commentary to §2G2.2 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 3 by deleting
"(c)(1)" and inserting in lieu thereof "subsection (c)(1)".
The Commentary to §2G2.2 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by deleting Notes 4 and

purposes of subsection (b)(4), means any combination of two or more separate instances
of the sexual abuse or the sexual exploitation of a minor, whether involving the same or
Amendment 537 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003
– 472 –
different victims.
5. If the defendant sexually exploited or abused a minor at any time, whether or not such
sexual abuse occurred during the course of the offense, an upward departure may be
warranted. In determining the extent of such a departure, the court should take into
consideration the offense levels provided in §§2A3.1, 2A3.2, and 2A3.4 most
commensurate with the defendant’s conduct, as well as whether the defendant has
received an enhancement under subsection (b)(4) on account of such conduct.".
Section 2G2.4(a) is amended by deleting "13" and inserting in lieu thereof "15".
Section 2G2.4(b) is amended by inserting after subdivision (2) the following additional
subdivision:
"(3) If the defendant’s possession of the material resulted from the defendant’s use of a
computer, increase by 2 levels.".
Reason for Amendment: This is a four-part amendment. First, the amendment implements
the congressional directives in section 2 of the Sex Crimes Against Children Prevention Act
of 1995, Pub. L. 104-71, 109 Stat. 774, by providing a two-level enhancement above the
currently prescribed offense level for offenses involving the sexual exploitation of minors. The
two-level enhancement is provided in the base offense levels under §§2G2.1, 2G2.2, and
2G2.4.
Second, the amendment implements the congressional directive in section 3 of the above-noted
Act by providing a two-level enhancement for offenses involving the sexual exploitation of a
minor if a computer was used to transmit certain notices or advertisements of material
involving minors engaged in sexually explicit conduct or to transport or ship that material. The
enhancement in §2G2.2(b)(5) applies to the transmission of the material or of the notice or
advertisement of the material. The enhancement in §2G2.4(b)(3) applies only if the
defendant’s possession of the material resulted from the defendant’s use of a computer. In
addition to these congressionally directed enhancements, the amendment adds a two-level
enhancement under §2G2.1(b)(3) if a computer was used to solicit participation in sexually
explicit conduct by or with a minor for the purpose of producing sexually explicit material.
Third, the amendment revises the Commentary to §2G2.2 to consolidate the definitions
applicable to this guideline in the first application note and address several additional issues.
The amendment revises the definition of "pattern of activity involving the sexual abuse or
exploitation of a minor" to clarify that "sexual abuse or exploitation," for purposes of
§2G2.2(b)(4), requires that the defendant personally had participated in such conduct. The
amendment defines "sexual abuse or exploitation" to mean conduct constituting criminal sexual
abuse, sexual exploitation, or abusive sexual contact and to exclude trafficking in child
pornography. These revisions are consistent with United States v. Chapman, 60 F.3d 894 (1st
Cir. 1995) and United States v. Ketcham, 80 F.3d 789 (3d Cir. 1996), both of which held that
the defendant’s transportation or distribution of child pornography is not sexual exploitation
within the meaning of the "pattern of activity" enhancement in §2G2.2(b)(4). In addition, the
amendment clarifies that the "pattern of activity" may include acts of sexual abuse or
exploitation that were not committed during the course of the offense or that did not result in
November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment 537
– 473 –
a conviction. This revision responds in part to the holding in Chapman, 60 F.3d at 901, that
the "pattern of activity" enhancement is inapplicable to past sexual abuse or exploitation
unrelated to the offense of conviction. The amended language expressly provides that such
conduct may be considered. Accordingly, the conduct considered for purposes of the "pattern
of activity" enhancement is broader than the scope of relevant conduct typically considered
under §1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct). In addition, the amendment provides that an upward
departure may be warranted if the defendant (1) did not engage in a "pattern of activity" but
nevertheless abused a minor at any time, or (2) engaged in a "pattern of activity" but the
enhancement does not adequately reflect the seriousness of the sexual abuse or exploitation.
In addition, the amendment clarifies that prior convictions counted as part of the "pattern of
activity" also may be counted as part of the defendant’s criminal history under Chapter Four,
if those convictions meet the criteria set forth in the relevant guidelines of that chapter.
Fourth, the amendment makes the "Statutory Provisions" in the Commentary to §§2G2.1 and
2G2.2 more comprehensive by adding 18 U.S.C. § 2258(a) and (b) to the list of statutory
provisions covered by those guidelines.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1996.
538. Amendment: Sections 2G1.1 and 2G1.2 are deleted in their entirety as follows:
"§2G1.1. Transportation for the Purpose of Prostitution or Prohibited Sexual Conduct
(a) Base Offense Level: 14
(b) Specific Offense Characteristic
(1) If the offense involved the use of physical force, or coercion by
threats or drugs or in any manner, increase by 4 levels.
(c) Special Instruction
(1) If the offense involved the transportation of more than one
person, Chapter Three, Part D (Multiple Counts) shall be applied
as if the transportation of each person had been contained in a
separate count of conviction.

Statutory Provisions: 8 U.S.C. § 1328; 18 U.S.C. §§ 2421, 2422.
Application Notes:
1. The base offense level assumes that the offense was committed for profit. In the
infrequent case where the defendant did not commit the offense for profit and the offense
did not involve physical force or coercion, the Commission recommends a downward
departure of 8 levels.
Amendment 538 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003
– 474 –
2. The enhancement for physical force, or coercion, anticipates no bodily injury. If bodily
injury results, an upward departure may be warranted. See Chapter Five, Part K
(Departures).
3. ‘Coercion,’ as used in this guideline, includes any form of conduct that negates the
voluntariness of the behavior of the person transported. This factor would apply, for
example, where the ability of the person being transported to appraise or control conduct
was substantially impaired by drugs or alcohol. In the case of transportation involving
an adult, rather than a minor, this characteristic generally will not apply where the
alcohol or drug was voluntarily taken.
4. For the purposes of §3B1.1 (Aggravating Role), the persons transported are considered
participants only if they assisted in the unlawful transportation of others.
5. For the purposes of Chapter Three, Part D (Multiple Counts), each person transported
is to be treated as a separate victim. Consequently, multiple counts involving the
transportation of different persons are not to be grouped together under §3D1.2 (Groups
of Closely Related Counts). Special instruction (c)(1) directs that if the relevant conduct
of an offense of conviction includes more than one person being transported, whether
specifically cited in the count of conviction or not, each such person shall be treated as
if contained in a separate count of conviction.
§2G1.2. Transportation of a Minor for the Purpose of Prostitution or Prohibited Sexual
Conduct
(a) Base Offense Level: 16
(b) Specific Offense Characteristics
(1) If the offense involved the use of physical force, or coercion by
threats or drugs or in any manner, increase by 4 levels.
(2) If the offense involved the transportation of a minor under the
age of twelve years, increase by 4 levels.
(3) If the offense involved the transportation of a minor at least
twelve years of age but under the age of sixteen years, increase
by 2 levels.
(4) If the defendant was a parent, relative, or legal guardian of the
minor involved in the offense, or if the minor was otherwise in
the custody, care, or supervisory control of the defendant,
increase by 2 levels.
(c) Cross References
(1) If the offense involved causing, transporting, permitting, or
offering or seeking by notice or advertisement, a minor to

– 475 –
engage in sexually explicit conduct for the purpose of producing
a visual depiction of such conduct, apply §2G2.1 (Sexually
Exploiting a Minor by Production of Sexually Explicit Visual or
Printed Material; Custodian Permitting Minor to Engage in
Sexually Explicit Conduct; Advertisement for Minors to Engage
in Production).
(2) If the offense involved criminal sexual abuse, attempted criminal
sexual abuse, or assault with intent to commit criminal sexual
abuse, apply §2A3.1 (Criminal Sexual Abuse; Attempt to
Commit Criminal Sexual Abuse).
(3) If neither subsection (c)(1) nor (c)(2) is applicable, and the
offense did not involve transportation for the purpose of
prostitution, apply §2A3.2 (Criminal Sexual Abuse of a Minor
or Attempt to Commit Such Acts) or §2A3.4 (Abusive Sexual
Contact or Attempt to Commit Abusive Sexual Contact), as
appropriate.
(d) Special Instruction
(1) If the offense involved the transportation of more than one
person, Chapter Three, Part D (Multiple Counts) shall be applied
as if the transportation of each person had been contained in a
separate count of conviction.
Commentary
Statutory Provisions: 8 U.S.C. § 1328; 18 U.S.C. §§ 2421, 2422, 2423.
Application Notes:
1. For the purposes of Chapter Three, Part D (Multiple Counts), each person transported
is to be treated as a separate victim. Consequently, multiple counts involving the
transportation of different persons are not to be grouped together under §3D1.2 (Groups
of Closely Related Counts). Special instruction (d)(1) directs that if the relevant conduct

2. The enhancement for physical force, or coercion, anticipates no bodily injury. If bodily

3. ‘Coercion,’ as used in this guideline, includes any form of conduct that negates the
voluntariness of the behavior of the person transported. This factor would apply, for
example, where the ability of the person being transported to appraise or control conduct
was substantially impaired by drugs or alcohol.
Amendment 538 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003
– 476 –
4. ‘Sexually explicit conduct,’ as used in this guideline, has the meaning set forth in 18
U.S.C. § 2256.
5. Subsection (b)(4) is intended to have broad application and includes offenses involving
a minor entrusted to the defendant, whether temporarily or permanently. For example,
teachers, day care providers, baby-sitters, or other temporary caretakers are among those
who would be subject to this enhancement. In determining whether to apply this
adjustment, the court should look to the actual relationship that existed between the
defendant and the child and not simply to the legal status of the defendant-child
relationship.
6. If the adjustment in subsection (b)(4) applies, do not apply §3B1.3 (Abuse of Position
of Trust or Use of Special Skill).
7. The cross reference in subsection (c)(1) is to be construed broadly to include all
instances where the offense involved employing, using, persuading, inducing, enticing,
coercing, transporting, permitting, or offering or seeking by notice or advertisement, a
minor to engage in sexually explicit conduct for the purpose of producing any visual
depiction of such conduct.".
A replacement guideline with accompanying commentary is inserted as §2G1.1 (Promoting
Prostitution or Prohibited Sexual Conduct).
Chapter 1, Part A, Subpart 4(b) is amended in the fourth paragraph by deleting:
"For example, the Commentary to §2G1.1 (Transportation for the Purpose of Prostitution or
Prohibited Sexual Conduct) recommends a downward departure of eight levels where a
commercial purpose was not involved.".
Section 3D1.2(d) is amended in the third paragraph by deleting "2G1.2,".
Reason for Amendment: This is a three-part amendment. First, this amendment consolidates
§§2G1.1 (Transportation for the Purpose of Prostitution or Prohibited Sexual Conduct) and
2G1.2 (Transportation of a Minor for the Purpose of Prostitution or Prohibited Sexual Conduct)
in furtherance of the Commission’s goal of simplifying the operation of the guidelines. The
enhancement pertaining to the age of the victim in subsection (b)(2) is increased by two levels
to reflect the two-level higher base offense level of former §2G1.2. The consolidated offense
guideline incorporates the cross references of §2G1.2, provides a definition of the term
"victim," and clarifies that the guideline covers offenses under 18 U.S.C. § 2423(a), but not 18
U.S.C. § 2423(b) (a statutory provision referenced in Appendix A to §§2A3.1, 2A3.2, and
2A3.3).
Second, this amendment implements the congressional directive in section 4 of the Sex Crimes
Against Children Prevention Act of 1995, Pub. L. 104-71, 109 Stat. 774, by providing a three-
level increase in the enhancement for offenses involving the transportation of minors with
intent to engage in prostitution or other prohibited sexual conduct. This three-level increase
is provided in the specific offense characteristic pertaining to the age of the victim in subsection
(b)(2) and is in addition to the two-level increase in this enhancement described in the first part
November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment 538
– 477 –
of this amendment.
Third, this amendment addresses 18 U.S.C. § 2422(b), a new offense created by section 508
of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, Pub. L. 104-104, 110 Stat. 56. That offense makes
it unlawful, in interstate or foreign commerce, including through the mail, or within the special
maritime or territorial jurisdiction of the United States, to knowingly persuade, induce, entice,
or coerce an individual under the age of 18 years to engage in prostitution or other prohibited
sexual conduct. The amendment brings this new offense within the scope of the consolidated
guideline. As revised, the guideline is broadly applicable to offenses that involve "promoting
prostitution or prohibited sexual conduct." That term is defined to encompass conduct covered
by the new Telecommunications Act offense as well as conduct previously covered by the
guideline; i.e., transporting a person, or inducing a person to travel, for the purpose of
prostitution or other prohibited sexual conduct.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1996.
539. Amendment: Section 3A1.4 is amended in the title by deleting "International".
Section 3A1.4(a) is amended by deleting "international" and inserting in lieu thereof "a federal
crime of".
The Commentary to §3A1.4 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 1 in the first
sentence by deleting "international" and inserting in lieu thereof "a federal crime of"; and in
the second sentence by deleting "International" and inserting in lieu thereof "Federal crime of",
and by deleting "2331" and inserting in lieu thereof "2332b(g)".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment implements section 730 of the Antiterrorism and
Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, Pub. L. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1303. That section requires
the Commission to amend the sentencing guidelines so that the adjustment in §3A1.4 (relating
to international terrorism) applies more broadly to a "Federal crime of terrorism," as defined
in 18 U.S.C. § 2332b(g), and provides that the Commission shall have the authority to
promulgate this amendment as an emergency amendment under procedures set forth in section
21(a) of the Sentencing Act of 1987.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1996.
540. Amendment: Appendix A (Statutory Index) is amended by inserting at the appropriate place

and by inserting after Note 1the following additional notes:
"2. Under subsection (b)(4), ‘any other felony offense’ means any conduct that constitutes
a felony offense under federal, state, or local law (other than an offense that is itself
covered by this subpart). When there is more than one such other offense, the most
serious such offense (or group of closely related offenses in the case of offenses that
would be grouped together under §3D1.2(d)) is to be used. See Application Note 3 of
§1B1.5 (Interpretation of References to other Offense Guidelines).
3. If the offense involved the holding of more than ten victims in a condition of peonage
or involuntary servitude, an upward departure may be warranted.".
The Commentary to §2H4.1 captioned “Background” is deleted as follows:
"Background: This section covers statutes that prohibit peonage, involuntary servitude, and

both the defendant’s spouse and child), and (B) the base offense level is determined
under subsection (a)(2), decrease by 3 levels.".

payment or expectation of payment for the smuggling, transporting, or harboring of any
of the unlawful aliens."; and
by inserting at the end the following paragraphs:
"‘Aggravated felony’ is defined in the Commentary to §2L1.2 (Unlawfully Entering or
Remaining in the United States).

"3. For the purposes of §3B1.2 (Mitigating Role), a defendant who commits the
offense solely in return for his own entry or transportation is not entitled to a
reduction for a minor or minimal role. This is because the reduction at

6. Reckless conduct to which the adjustment from subsection (b)(5) applies includes
a wide variety of conduct (e.g., transporting persons in the trunk or engine
compartment of a motor vehicle, carrying substantially more passengers than the
rated capacity of a motor vehicle or vessel, or harboring persons in a crowded,
dangerous, or inhumane condition). If subsection (b)(5) applies solely on the
basis of conduct related to fleeing from a law enforcement officer, do not apply
an adjustment from §3C1.2 (Reckless Endangerment During Flight).
Additionally, do not apply the adjustment in subsection (b)(5) if the only reckless
conduct that created a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury is conduct
for which the defendant received an enhancement under subsection (b)(4).".
The Commentary to §2L1.1 captioned “Background” is amended by deleting:
"A specific offense characteristic provides a reduction if the defendant did not commit
the offense for profit. The offense level increases with the number of unlawful aliens
smuggled, transported, or harbored.".

– 500 –
similar offense under state law.".
The Commentary to §2A3.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 1 by inserting
"For purposes of this guideline—" before "‘Permanent"; and by inserting at the end the
following:
"However, for purposes of this guideline, ‘serious bodily injury’ means conduct other
than criminal sexual abuse, which already is taken into account in the base offense level
under subsection (a).
‘The means set forth in 18 U.S.C. § 2241(a) or (b)’ are: by using force against the
victim; by threatening or placing the victim in fear that any person will be subject to
death, serious bodily injury, or kidnaping; by rendering the victim unconscious; or by
administering by force or threat of force, or without the knowledge or permission of the
victim, a drug, intoxicant, or other similar substance and thereby substantially impairing
the ability of the victim to appraise or control conduct. This provision would apply, for
example, where any dangerous weapon was used, brandished, or displayed to intimidate
the victim.".
The Commentary to §2A3.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by deleting:
"2. ‘The means set forth in 18 U.S.C. § 2241(a) or (b)’ are: by using force against
the victim; by threatening or placing the victim in fear that any person will be

"(5) If the offense involved carjacking, increase by 2 levels.".
November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment 546
– 501 –
Reason for Amendment: This amendment implements, in a broader form, section 2 of the
Carjacking Correction Act of 1996, Pub.L. 104-217, 110 Stat. 3020. The Act amended 18
U.S.C. § 2119(2) to include aggravated sexual abuse under 18 U.S.C. § 2241 and sexual abuse
under 18 U.S.C. § 2242 within the meaning of "serious bodily injury." In implementing this
legislation, the Commission has elected to broaden the term "serious bodily injury," as used in
a number of offense conduct guidelines, so that such injury will be deemed to have occurred
in the case of a sexual assault. The amendment also makes a number of conforming changes
in other guidelines. In addition, this amendment amends §2B3.1(b)(1) to provide cumulative
enhancements if the offense involved both bank robbery and carjacking.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1997.
546. Amendment: Section 1B1.1(b) is amended by inserting ", cross references, and special
instructions" after "characteristics".
The Commentary to §1B1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 1(l) by
inserting at the end the following:
"The term ‘instant’ is used in connection with ‘offense,’ ‘federal offense,’ or ‘offense of
conviction,’ as the case may be, to distinguish the violation for which the defendant is
being sentenced from a prior or subsequent offense, or from an offense before another
court (e.g., an offense before a state court involving the same underlying conduct).".
Section 4B1.1 is amended by deleting "of the instant offense" and inserting in lieu thereof "the
defendant committed the instant offense of conviction".
Section 4B1.2(3) is amended by inserting "of conviction" before "subsequent".
The Commentary to §4B1.2 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 2 in the second
paragraph by inserting "of conviction" after "instant offense".
The Commentary to §8A1.2 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 3(a) by
inserting at the end the following:
"The term ‘instant’ is used in connection with ‘offense,’ ‘federal offense,’ or ‘offense of
conviction,’ as the case may be, to distinguish the violation for which the defendant is
being sentenced from a prior or subsequent offense, or from an offense before another
court (e.g., an offense before a state court involving the same underlying conduct).".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment has two primary purposes. First, it corrects a
technical error in §1B1.1(b). Second, it explains the purpose of the term "instant" as that term
is employed throughout the Guidelines Manual, as a modifier of the term "offense," "federal
offense," or "offense of conviction." It also clarifies the usage of the term "instant offense of
conviction" at several places in the Guidelines Manual.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1997.
547. Amendment: Section §1B1.5(d) is amended by deleting "final offense level (i.e., the greater
Amendment 548 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003
– 502 –
offense level taking into account both the Chapter Two offense level and any applicable
Chapter Three adjustments)" and inserting in lieu thereof "Chapter Two offense level, except
as otherwise expressly provided".
The Commentary to §1B1.5 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 1 by deleting
"§" before "2D1.2(a)(1)"; and by deleting ", (2), and 2H1.1(a)(1)" and inserting in lieu thereof
"and (2))".
The Commentary to §1B1.5 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 2 in the second
sentence by deleting "greater final"; by deleting "(i.e., the greater offense level"; and by
deleting "both" and inserting in lieu thereof "only".
The Commentary to §1B1.5 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 2 by deleting:
"and any applicable Chapter Three adjustments). Although the offense guideline that
results in the greater offense level under Chapter Two will most frequently result in the
greater final offense level, this will not always be the case. If, for example, a role or
abuse of trust adjustment applies to the cross-referenced offense guideline, but not to the
guideline initially applied, the greater Chapter Two offense level may not necessarily
result in a greater final offense level.",
and inserting in lieu thereof:
", unless the offense guideline expressly provides for consideration of both the Chapter
Two offense level and applicable Chapter Three adjustments. For situations in which
a comparison involving both Chapters Two and Three is necessary, see the Commentary
to §§2C1.1 (Offering, Giving, Soliciting, or Receiving a Bribe); 2C1.7 (Fraud Involving
Deprivation of the Intangible Right to the Honest Services of Public Officials); 2E1.1
(Unlawful Conduct Relating to Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations); and
2E1.2 (Interstate or Foreign Travel or Transportation in Aid of a Racketeering
Enterprise).".
The Commentary to §2C1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by inserting after Note
6 the following additional note:
"7. For the purposes of determining whether to apply the cross references in this
section, the ‘resulting offense level’ means the greater final offense level (i.e., the
offense level determined by taking into account both the Chapter Two offense
level and any applicable adjustments from Chapter Three, Parts A-D).".
The Commentary to §2C1.7 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by inserting after Note
5 the following additional note:
"6. For the purposes of determining whether to apply the cross references in this
section, the ‘resulting offense level’ means the greater final offense level (i.e., the
offense level determined by taking into account both the Chapter Two offense
level and any applicable adjustments from Chapter Three, Parts A-D).".
November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment 548
– 503 –
Reason for Amendment: This amendment simplifies the guidelines by restricting the cross-
reference comparison to the Chapter Two offense levels, unless a different procedure is
expressly specified. With respect to §§2C1.1, 2C1.7, 2E1.1, and 2E1.2, the amendment, and
an express provision in each of these guidelines, provide a different procedure because these
guidelines are the only four offense guidelines in which the inclusion of Chapter Three
adjustments in the comparison is likely to make a difference.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1997.
548. Amendment: Section 1B1.10 is amended in the title by deleting "Retroactivity" and inserting
in lieu thereof "Reduction in Term of Imprisonment as a Result".
Section 1B1.10(b) is amended by deleting "sentence" in both instances and inserting in lieu
thereof "the term of imprisonment"; and by inserting ", except that in no event may the reduced
term of imprisonment be less than the term of imprisonment the defendant has already served"
after "sentenced".
The Commentary to §1B1.10 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by inserting after Note
2 the following additional notes:
"3. Under subsection (b), the amended guideline range and the term of imprisonment
already served by the defendant limit the extent to which an eligible defendant’s
sentence may be reduced under 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2). When the original
sentence represented a downward departure, a comparable reduction below the
amended guideline range may be appropriate; however, in no case shall the term
of imprisonment be reduced below time served. Subject to these limitations, the
sentencing court has the discretion to determine whether, and to what extent, to
reduce a term of imprisonment under this section.
4. Only a term of imprisonment imposed as part of the original sentence is
authorized to be reduced under this section. This section does not authorize a
reduction in the term of imprisonment imposed upon revocation of supervised
release.
5. If the limitation in subsection (b) relating to time already served precludes a
reduction in the term of imprisonment to the extent the court determines
otherwise would have been appropriate as a result of the amended guideline
range, the court may consider any such reduction that it was unable to grant in
connection with any motion for early termination of a term of supervised release
under 18 U.S.C. § 3583(e)(1). However, the fact that a defendant may have
served a longer term of imprisonment than the court determines would have been
appropriate in view of the amended guideline range shall not, without more,
provide a basis for early termination of supervised release. Rather, the court
should take into account the totality of circumstances relevant to a decision to
terminate supervised release, including the term of supervised release that would
have been appropriate in connection with a sentence under the amended
guideline range.".
Amendment 549 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003
– 504 –
The Commentary to §1B1.10 captioned "Background" is amended in the third paragraph by
inserting "to determine an amended guideline range under subsection (b)" after "retroactively";
and by inserting before the fourth paragraph the following additional paragraph:
"The listing of an amendment in subsection (c) reflects policy determinations by the
Commission that a reduced guideline range is sufficient to achieve the purposes of
sentencing and that, in the sound discretion of the court, a reduction in the term of
imprisonment may be appropriate for previously sentenced, qualified defendants. The
authorization of such a discretionary reduction does not otherwise affect the lawfulness
of a previously imposed sentence, does not authorize a reduction in any other component
of the sentence, and does not entitle a defendant to a reduced term of imprisonment as
a matter of right.".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment makes a number of substantive and clarifying
changes in the policy statement relating to retroactive application of an amendment that reduces
a guideline range. The amendment provides that, in exercising discretion to reduce the term
of imprisonment of an incarcerated defendant, a court may not reduce the term of imprisonment
below time served (or, put differently, grant a greater reduction in imprisonment than the
imprisonment time remaining to be served). In those cases in which the combination of time
already served and this limitation preclude a defendant from receiving the full reduction the
court would be inclined to grant as a result of an amended guideline range, the amended
commentary instructs that the court may weigh the equities of such a situation in connection
with a separate motion for early termination of supervised release under 18 U.S.C. §
3583(e)(1). The amendment also makes clear that, contrary to the holding in United States v.
Etherton, 101 F.3d 80 (9th Cir. 1996), a reduction in the term of imprisonment imposed upon
revocation of supervised release is not authorized by the policy statement. Finally, the
amendment makes a number of changes in the title and text of the policy statement to improve
the precision of the language, adds commentary emphasizing court discretion in applying
amendments that the Commission has listed for possible retroactive application, and adds
background commentary more fully describing the legal consequences flowing from a
Commission decision to list an amendment for possible retroactive application.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1997.
549. Amendment: Section 2A2.2(b) is amended by inserting after subdivision (4) the following
additional subdivision:
"(5) If the offense involved the violation of a court protection order, increase by 2
levels.".
Chapter Two, Part A, Subpart 6 is amended in the title by inserting "or Harassing" after
"Threatening"; and by inserting ", Stalking, and Domestic Violence" after "Communications".
Section 2A6.1 is amended in the title by inserting "or Harassing" after "Threatening".
Section 2A6.1 is amended by deleting subsection (a) as follows:
"(a) Base Offense Level: 12",
November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment 549
– 505 –
and inserting in lieu thereof:
"(a) Base Offense Level:
(1) 12; or
(2) 6, if the defendant is convicted of an offense under 47 U.S.C.
§ 223(a)(1)(C), (D), or (E) that did not involve a threat to injure
a person or property.".
Section 2A6.1(b) is amended by redesignating subdivision (2) as subdivision (4); and by
inserting after subdivision (1) the following new subdivisions:
"(2) If the offense involved more than two threats, increase by 2 levels.
(3) If the offense involved the violation of a court protection order,
increase by 2 levels.".
Section 2A6.1(b)(4), as redesignated, is amended by deleting "If specific offense
characteristic §2A6.1(b)(1) does not apply, and" and inserting in lieu thereof "If (A)
subsection (a)(2) and subdivisions (1), (2), and (3) do not apply, and (B)".
The Commentary to §2A6.1 captioned "Statutory Provisions" is amended by inserting
"; 47 U.S.C. § 223(a)(1)(C)-(E)" after "879".
The Commentary to §2A6.1 captioned "Application Note" is amended by deleting "Note"
and inserting in lieu thereof "Notes"; and by inserting after Note 1 the following
additional note:
"2. In determining whether subsections (b)(1), (b)(2), and (b)(3) apply, the
court shall consider both conduct that occurred prior to the offense and
conduct that occurred during the offense; however, conduct that occurred
prior to the offense must be substantially and directly connected to the
offense, under the facts of the case taken as a whole. For example, if the
defendant engaged in several acts of mailing threatening letters to the same
victim over a period of years (including acts that occurred prior to the
offense), then for purposes of determining whether subsections (b)(1),
(b)(2), and (b)(3) apply, the court shall consider only those prior acts of
threatening the victim that have a substantial and direct connection to the
offense.
For purposes of Chapter Three, Part D (Multiple Counts), multiple counts
involving making a threatening or harassing communication to the same
victim are grouped together under §3D1.2 (Groups of Closely Related
Counts). Multiple counts involving different victims are not to be grouped
under §3D1.2.
If the conduct involved substantially more than two threatening
Amendment 549 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003
– 506 –
communications to the same victim or a prolonged period of making
harassing communications to the same victim, an upward departure may
be warranted.".
Chapter Two, Part A, Subpart 6 is amended by adding after §2A6.1 the following new
guideline:
"§2A6.2. Stalking or Domestic Violence
(a) Base Offense Level: 14
(b) Specific Offense Characteristic
(1) If the offense involved one of the following
aggravating factors: (A) the violation of a court
protection order; (B) bodily injury; (C)
possession, or threatened use, of a dangerous
weapon; or (D) a pattern of activity involving
stalking, threatening, harassing, or assaulting the
same victim, increase by 2 levels. If the offense
involved more than one of these aggravating
factors, increase by 4 levels.
(c) Cross Reference
(1) If the offense involved conduct covered by
another offense guideline from Chapter Two, Part
A (Offenses Against the Person), apply that
offense guideline, if the resulting offense level is
greater than that determined above.
Commentary
Statutory Provisions: 18 U.S.C. §§ 2261-2262.
Application Notes:
1. For purposes of this guideline—
‘Bodily injury’ and ‘dangerous weapon’ are defined in the Commentary to
§1B1.1 (Application Instructions).
‘Pattern of activity involving stalking, threatening, harassing, or assaulting the
same victim’ means any combination of two or more separate instances of
stalking, threatening, harassing, or assaulting the same victim, whether or not
such conduct resulted in a conviction. For example, a single instance of stalking
accompanied by a separate instance of threatening, harassing, or assaulting the
same victim constitutes a pattern of activity for purposes of this guideline.
November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment 549
– 507 –
‘Stalking’ means traveling with the intent to injure or harass another person and,
in the course of, or as a result of, such travel, placing the person in reasonable
fear of death or serious bodily injury to the person or the person’s immediate
family. See 18 U.S.C. § 2261A. ‘Immediate family’ has the meaning set forth
in 18 U.S.C. § 115(c)(2).
2. Subsection (b)(1) provides for a two-level or four-level enhancement based on
the degree to which the offense involved aggravating factors listed in that
subsection. If the offense involved aggravating factors more serious than the
factors listed in subsection (b)(1), the cross reference in subsection (c) most
likely will apply, if the resulting offense level is greater, because the more
serious conduct will be covered by another offense guideline from Chapter Two,
Part A. For example, §2A2.2 (Aggravated Assault) most likely would apply
pursuant to subsection (c) if the offense involved assaultive conduct in which
injury more serious than bodily injury occurred or if a dangerous weapon was
used rather than merely possessed.
3. In determining whether subsection (b)(1)(D) applies, the court shall consider,
under the totality of the circumstances, any conduct that occurred prior to or
during the offense; however, conduct that occurred prior to the offense must be
substantially and directly connected to the offense. For example, if a defendant
engaged in several acts of stalking the same victim over a period of years
(including acts that occurred prior to the offense), then for purposes of
determining whether subsection (b)(1)(D) applies, the court shall look to the
totality of the circumstances, considering only those prior acts of stalking the
victim that have a substantial and direct connection to the offense.
Prior convictions taken into account under subsection (b)(1)(D) are also counted
for purposes of determining criminal history points pursuant to Chapter Four,
Part A (Criminal History).
4. For purposes of Chapter Three, Part D (Multiple Counts), multiple counts
involving stalking, threatening, or harassing the same victim are grouped
together (and with counts of other offenses involving the same victim that are
covered by this guideline) under §3D1.2 (Groups of Closely Related Counts).
For example, if the defendant is convicted of two counts of stalking the
defendant’s ex-spouse under 18 U.S.C. § 2261A and one count of interstate
domestic violence involving an assault of the ex-spouse under 18 U.S.C. § 2261,
the stalking counts would be grouped together with the interstate domestic
violence count. This grouping procedure avoids unwarranted ‘double counting’
with the enhancement in subsection (b)(1)(D) (for multiple acts of stalking,
threatening, harassing, or assaulting the same victim) and recognizes that the
stalking and interstate domestic violence counts are sufficiently related to warrant
grouping.
Multiple counts that are cross referenced to another offense guideline pursuant
to subsection (c) are to be grouped together if §3D1.2 would require grouping
of those counts under that offense guideline. Similarly, multiple counts cross
Amendment 549 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003
– 508 –
referenced pursuant to subsection (c) are not to be grouped together if §3D1.2
would preclude grouping of the counts under that offense guideline. For
example, if the defendant is convicted of multiple counts of threatening an ex-
spouse in violation of a court protection order under 18 U.S.C. § 2262 and the
counts are cross referenced to §2A6.1 (Threatening or Harassing
Communications), the counts would group together because Application Note 2
of §2A6.1 specifically requires grouping. In contrast, if the defendant is
convicted of multiple counts of assaulting the ex-spouse in violation of a court
protection order under 18 U.S.C. § 2262 and the counts are cross referenced to
§2A2.2 (Aggravated Assault), the counts probably would not group together
inasmuch as §3D1.2(d) specifically precludes grouping of counts covered by
§2A2.2 and no other provision of §3D1.2 would likely apply to require grouping.
Multiple counts involving different victims are not to be grouped under §3D1.2.
5. If the defendant received an enhancement under subsection (b)(1) but that
enhancement does not adequately reflect the extent or seriousness of the conduct
involved, an upward departure may be warranted. For example, an upward
departure may be warranted if the defendant stalked the victim on many
occasions over a prolonged period of time.".
Reason for Amendment: This is a five-part amendment. First, this amendment addresses the
new offense of interstate stalking, 18 U.S.C. § 2261A, which was enacted as section 1069 of
the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1997, Pub. L. 104–201, 110 Stat. 2422.
That offense makes it unlawful to travel across a state line or within federal jurisdiction with
the intent to injure or harass another person and, in the course of, or as a result of, such travel,
to place that person in reasonable fear of death or serious bodily injury to that person or that
person’s immediate family.
The amendment adds a new guideline, §2A6.2 (Stalking or Domestic Violence), to cover the
stalking offense. The new guideline provides for a base offense level of 14 and an
enhancement for the presence of one or more aggravating factors that are often part of a
stalking offense, including the violation of a court protection order and the presence of a pattern
of stalking, harassing, threatening, or assaultive conduct. The new guideline also provides for
a cross reference to other Chapter Two guidelines if the offense involved more serious conduct,
such as aggravated assault or kidnapping, that would produce a greater offense level. In
addition, the new guideline permits the consideration of prior stalking, harassing, threatening,
or assaultive conduct if that conduct is directly and substantially related to the offense.
The new guideline also incorporates the definitions of “bodily injury” and “dangerous weapon”
found in §1B1.1 (Application Instructions). The definition of bodily injury found in the
guidelines differs from the definition of bodily injury in 18 U.S.C. § 2266 that is applicable to
interstate stalking and interstate domestic violence offenses. The definition of “bodily injury”
in 18 U.S.C. § 2266 explicitly includes sexual abuse, but the guideline definition of “bodily
injury” does not. However, the Commission is fully aware that criminal sexual abuse often is
part of a domestic violence offense under 18 U.S.C. §§ 2261 and 2262 and may be part of a
stalking offense under 18 U.S.C. § 2261A. It is the view of the Commission that the new
guideline provides an adequate mechanism for taking into account the occurrence of criminal
November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment 549
– 509 –
sexual abuse in any of these offenses. This is because the guideline definition of “serious
bodily injury” in §1B1.1 deems serious bodily injury -- a more serious gradient of bodily injury
-- to have occurred if the offense involved conduct constituting criminal sexual abuse under 18
U.S.C. § 2241 or § 2242 or any similar offense under state law. Under the new guideline, any
offense that involved criminal sexual abuse almost certainly will be subject to the cross
reference to another offense guideline and to the rule deeming such conduct to be serious
bodily injury (for purposes of applying a serious bodily injury enhancement in that other
guideline to the offense). Therefore, in all likelihood, the sentence will be enhanced for the
occurrence of criminal sexual abuse because the case will be cross referenced to another
guideline that enhances for serious bodily injury.
Second, the amendment changes the manner in which the offenses of interstate domestic
violence, 18 U.S.C. § 2261, and interstate violation of a protection order, 18 U.S.C. § 2262, are
treated under the guidelines. Instead of being referenced to the guidelines that may cover
underlying conduct, the amendment brings those offenses under the ambit of the new guideline,
§2A6.2. This change recognizes that the aggravating factors accounted for in the new guideline
often are present in these offenses as well.
Third, the amendment adds an enhancement to §2A2.2 (Aggravated Assault), if the offense
involved the violation of a court protection order, to ensure an appropriately severe offense
level for stalking, domestic violence, and other cases that are sentenced under the aggravated
assault guideline and involve this factor.
Fourth, the amendment addresses several new harassing telecommunications offenses,
47 U.S.C. § 223(a)(1)(C)-(E), which were enacted in section 502 of the Telecommunications
Act of 1996, Pub. L. 104–104, 110 Stat. 56. Those offenses make it unlawful to make a
telephone call or utilize a telecommunications device, whether or not conversation or
communication ensues, without disclosing one’s identity and with the intent to annoy, abuse,
threaten, or harass any person at the called number or who receives the communication; make
or cause the telephone of another to repeatedly or continuously ring, with the intent to harass
any person at the called number; or make repeated telephone calls or repeatedly initiate
conversation with a telecommunications device, during which conversation or communication
ensues, solely to harass any person at the called number or who receives the communication.
The amendment incorporates these new offenses into §2A6.1 (Threatening Communications).
Recognizing that these offenses carry only a two-year maximum term of imprisonment, the
amendment provides an alternative offense level of 6 (as compared to 12), if the defendant is
convicted of any of these offenses and there was no threat to injure a person or property. The
amendment also adds enhancements if the offense involved more than two threats or the
violation of a court protection order.
Fifth, this amendment addresses a circuit conflict regarding the enhancement in §2A6.1 that
provides a 6-level increase if the offense involved any conduct evidencing an intent to carry
out a threat. Specifically, the conflict is whether or not conduct which occurred prior to the
making of the threat can evidence an intent to carry out the threat. Compare United States v.
Hornick, 942 F.2d 105 (2d Cir. 1991) (“a person cannot take action that will constitute proof
of his intent to carry out a threat until after the threat has been made”) cert. denied, 502 U.S.
1061 (1992) with United States v. Taylor, 88 F.3d 938 (11th Cir. 1996) (“the essential inquiry
for §2A6.1(b)(1) is whether the facts of the case, taken as a whole, establish a sufficiently direct
Amendment 551 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003
– 510 –
connection between the defendant’s pre-threat conduct and his threat”); United States v.
Sullivan, 75 F.3d 297 (7th Cir. 1996)(same); United States v. Gary, 18 F.3d 1123 (4th Cir.)
(same), cert. denied 513 U.S. 844 (1994); United States v. Hines, 26 F.3d 1469 (9th Cir.
1994)(same).
The amendment essentially adopts the Eleventh Circuit’s view by adding an application note
to both §§2A6.1 and 2A6.2 to provide that conduct which occurred prior to the offense shall
be considered in determining specified enhancements in those guidelines if the prior conduct
is substantially and directly connected to the offense.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1997.
550. Amendment: The Commentary to §2A2.4 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note
1 by inserting the following after "(Aggravated Assault).":
"Conversely, the base offense level does not reflect the possibility that the defendant
may create a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury to another person in the
course of fleeing from a law enforcement official (although an offense under 18 U.S.C.
§ 758 for fleeing or evading a law enforcement checkpoint at high speed will often, but
not always, involve the creation of that risk). If the defendant creates that risk and no
higher guideline adjustment is applicable for the conduct creating the risk, apply §3C1.2
(Reckless Endangerment During Flight).".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment clarifies the interaction of this guideline with the
enhancement under §3C1.2 (Reckless Endangerment During Flight), particularly when the
defendant is convicted under 18 U.S.C. § 758 of fleeing an immigration checkpoint at high
speed.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1997.
551. Amendment: Section 2B1.1(b) is amended by inserting after subdivision (6) the following
additional subdivision:
"(7) If the offense involved misappropriation of a trade secret and the defendant knew
or intended that the offense would benefit any foreign government, foreign
instrumentality, or foreign agent, increase by 2 levels.".
The Commentary to §2B1.1 captioned "Statutory Provisions" is amended by inserting "1831,
1832," before "2113(b)".
The Commentary to §2B1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 1 by inserting
after the first paragraph the following additional paragraphs:
"‘Trade secret’ is defined in 18 U.S.C. § 1839(3).
‘Foreign instrumentality’ and ‘foreign agent’ are defined in 18 U.S.C. § 1839(1) and (2),
respectively.".
November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment 551
– 511 –
The Commentary to §2B1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 2 by inserting
after the fourth paragraph the following additional paragraph:
"In an offense involving unlawfully accessing, or exceeding authorized access to, a
‘protected computer’ as defined in 18 U.S.C. § 1030(e)(2)(A) or (B), ‘loss’ includes the
reasonable cost to the victim of conducting a damage assessment, restoring the system
and data to their condition prior to the offense, and any lost revenue due to interruption
of service.".
The Commentary to §2B1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by inserting after Note
14 the following additional notes:
"15. In cases where the loss determined under subsection (b)(1) does not fully capture
the harmfulness of the conduct, an upward departure may be warranted. For
example, the theft of personal information or writings (e.g., medical records,
educational records, a diary) may involve a substantial invasion of a privacy
interest that would not be addressed by the monetary loss provisions of
subsection (b)(1).
16. In cases involving theft of information from a ‘protected computer’, as defined
in 18 U.S.C. § 1030(e)(2)(A) or (B), an upward departure may be warranted
where the defendant sought the stolen information to further a broader criminal
purpose.".
Section 2B1.3 is amended by inserting after subsection (c) the following additional subsection:
"(d) Special Instruction
(1) If the defendant is convicted under 18 U.S.C. § 1030(a)(5), the minimum
guideline sentence, notwithstanding any other adjustment, shall be six
months’ imprisonment.".
The Commentary to §2B1.3 captioned "Statutory Provisions" is amended by inserting
"1030(a)(5)," before "1361,".
The Commentary to §2B1.3 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 4 by inserting
"or interference with a telecommunications network" after "line"; by inserting ", with attendant
life-threatening delay in the delivery of emergency medical treatment or disruption of other
important governmental or private services" after "hours"; by deleting "instances" and inserting
in lieu thereof "cases"; by deleting "would" and inserting in lieu thereof "may"; and by
inserting at the end the following:
"See §§5K2.2 (Physical Injury), 5K2.7 (Disruption of Governmental Function), and
5K2.14 (Public Welfare).".
The Commentary to §2B1.3 is amended by adding at the end the following:
"Background: Subsection (d) implements the instruction to the Commission in section
Amendment 552 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003
– 512 –
805(c) of Public Law 104-132.".
Section 2B2.3(b) is amended by inserting after subdivision (2) the following additional
subdivision:
"(3) If the offense involved invasion of a protected computer resulting in a loss
exceeding $2000, increase the offense level by the number of levels from the
table in §2F1.1 corresponding to the loss.".
The Commentary to §2B2.3 captioned "Statutory Provision" is amended by deleting
"Provision" and inserting in lieu thereof "Provisions"; and by inserting "18 U.S.C.
§ 1030(a)(3);" before "42 U.S.C.".
The Commentary to §2B2.3 captioned "Application Note" is amended in Note 1 by inserting

the following additional paragraph:
"‘Protected computer’ means a computer described in 18 U.S.C. § 1030(e)(2)(A) or

"2. Valuation of loss is discussed in the Commentary to §2B1.1 (Larceny,
Embezzlement, and Other Forms of Theft).".
The Commentary to §2B3.2 captioned "Statutory Provisions" is amended by inserting
"1030(a)(7)," following "877,".
The Commentary to §2B3.2 captioned "Background" is amended by inserting at the end:
"This guideline also applies to offenses under 18 U.S.C. § 1030(a)(7) involving a threat
to impair the operation of a ‘protected computer.’".
Section 2F1.1 is amended by inserting after subsection (b) the following additional subsection:
"(c) Special Instruction
(1) If the defendant is convicted under 18 U.S.C. § 1030(a)(4), the minimum
guideline sentence, notwithstanding any other adjustment, shall be six
months’ imprisonment.".
The Commentary to §2F1.1 captioned "Statutory Provisions" is amended by inserting
"1030(a)(4)," before "1031,".
The Commentary to §2F1.1 captioned "Background" is amended by inserting at the end the
following additional paragraph:
November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment 552
– 513 –
" Subsection (c) implements the instruction to the Commission in section 805(c)
of Public Law 104-132.".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment makes a number of changes in the theft, property
destruction, trespass, extortion, and fraud guidelines to more effectively punish computer-
related offenses. The amendment also addresses new offenses under 18 U.S.C. § 1030(a)(7),
prohibiting extortion by threats of damage to a non-public government computer or a computer
of a financial institution; 18 U.S.C. § 1831, prohibiting "economic espionage"; and 18 U.S.C.
§ 1832, prohibiting theft of "trade secrets," as broadly defined at 18 U.S.C. § 1839. Offenses
under 18 U.S.C. § 1030(a)(7) are referenced to §2B3.2 (Extortion by Force or Threat of Injury
or Serious Damage); offenses under 18 U.S.C. §§ 1031 and 1832 are referenced to §2B1.1
(Larceny, Embezzlement, and Other Forms of Theft).
Special instructions have been added to §§2B1.3 and 2F1.1 to provide that the minimum
guideline sentence for those convicted under 18 U.S.C. § 1030(a)(4) and (5) is six months’
imprisonment. These provisions implement a directive to the Commission in section 805(c)
of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, Pub. L. 104–132, 110 Stat. 1305.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1997.
552. Amendment: Section 2B3.1(b)(2)(F) is amended by deleting "an express" and inserting in lieu
thereof "a".
The Commentary to §2B3.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 6 by deleting
"An ‘express" and inserting in lieu thereof "‘A"; by inserting after the first sentence the
following additional sentence:
"Accordingly, the defendant does not have to state expressly his intent to kill the victim
in order for the enhancement to apply.";
by deleting "an express" after "constitute" and inserting in lieu thereof "a"; by deleting "the
underlying" and inserting in lieu thereof "this"; and by deleting "significantly greater fear than
that necessary to constitute an element of the offense of robbery" and inserting in lieu thereof
"a fear of death".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment addresses a circuit court conflict regarding the
application of the "express threat of death" enhancement in §2B3.1 (Robbery). The amendment
adopts the majority appellate view which holds that the enhancement applies when the
combination of the defendant’s actions and words would instill in a reasonable person in the
position of the immediate victim (e.g.,a bank teller) a greater amount of fear than necessary to
commit the robbery. See, e.g., United States v. Robinson, 86 F.3d 1197, 1202 (D.C. Cir. 1996)
(enhancement applies if (1) a reasonable person in the position of the immediate victim would
very likely believe the defendant made a threat and the threat was to kill, and (2) the victim
likely thought his life was in peril); United States v. Murray, 65 F.3d 1161, 1167 (4th Cir.
1995) ("any combination of statements, gestures, or actions that would put an ordinary victim
in reasonable fear for his or her life is an express threat of death").
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1997.
Amendment 553 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003
– 514 –
553. Amendment: The Commentary to §2B4.1 captioned "Statutory Provisions" is amended by
deleting "§§ 11907(a), (b)" and inserting in lieu thereof "§ 11902".
The Commentary to §2N3.1 captioned "Statutory Provisions" is amended by deleting
"15 U.S.C. §§ 1983-1988, 1990c" and inserting in lieu thereof "49 U.S.C. §§ 32703-32705,
32709(b).".
The Commentary to §2Q1.2 captioned "Statutory Provisions" is amended by deleting
"§ 1809(b)" and inserting in lieu thereof "§ 60123(d)".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment makes technical corrections to §2B4.1 (Bribery
in Procurement of Bank Loan and Other Commercial Bribery), §2N3.1(Odometer Laws and
Regulations), §2Q1.2 (Mishandling of Hazardous or Toxic Substances or Pesticides;
Recordkeeping, Tampering, and Falsification; Unlawfully Transporting Hazardous Materials
in Commerce), to reflect changes made to statutory references when Congress codified Title
49 (Transportation), United States Code. Pub. L. 103-272, § 1(e), July 5, 1994, 108 Stat. 1356;
Pub. L. 104-88, Title I, § 102(a), December 29, 1995, 109 Stat. 850.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1997.
554. Amendment: Section 2B5.1(b) is amended by inserting after subdivision (3) the following
additional subdivision:
"(4) If any part of the offense was committed outside the United States, increase by
2 levels.".

inserting in lieu thereof "470".
The Commentary to §2B5.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by redesignating Notes
1 through 3 as Notes 2 through 4; and by inserting as the new Note 1:
"1. For purposes of this guideline, ‘United States’ means each of the fifty states, the
District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands,
Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, and American Samoa.".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment addresses section 807(h) of the Antiterrorism and
Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, Pub. L. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1308, which requires the
Commission to amend the sentencing guidelines to provide an appropriate enhancement for a
defendant convicted of an international counterfeiting offense under 18 U.S.C. § 470. The
amendment adds a specific offense characteristic in §2B5.1 (Offenses Involving Counterfeit
Bearer Obligations of the United States) to provide a two-level enhancement if the offense
occurred outside the United States.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1997.
555. Amendment: Section 2D1.1(b) is amended by redesignating subdivision (4) as subdivision
(6) and inserting after subdivision (3) the following additional subdivisions:
November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment 555

(5) If the offense involved (A) an unlawful discharge, emission, or release into the
environment of a hazardous or toxic substance, or (B) the unlawful
transportation, treatment, storage, or disposal of a hazardous waste, increase by
2 levels.".

Section 2D1.1(c) is amended in subdivision (14) by deleting "5 G" before "of
Methamphetamine" and inserting in lieu thereof "2.5 G".
The Commentary to §2D1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 10 in the "Drug
Equivalency Tables" in the subdivision captioned "Cocaine and Other Schedule I and II
Stimulants" in the entry beginning "1 gm of Methamphetamine =" by deleting "1 kg" before
"of marihuana" and inserting in lieu thereof "2 kg".
The Commentary to §2D1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by inserting after Note
18 the following additional notes:
"19. If the offense involved importation of methamphetamine, and an adjustment from
subsection (b)(2) applies, do not apply subsection (b)(4).
20. Under subsection (b)(5), the enhancement applies if the conduct for which the
defendant is accountable under §1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct) involved any
discharge, emission, release, transportation, treatment, storage, or disposal
violation covered by the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, 42 U.S.C.
§ 6928(d), the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, 33 U.S.C. § 1319(c), or the
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act,
42 U.S.C. §§ 5124, 9603(b). In some cases, the enhancement under this
subsection may not adequately account for the seriousness of the environmental
harm or other threat to public health or safety (including the health or safety of
law enforcement and cleanup personnel). In such cases, an upward departure
may be warranted. Additionally, any costs of environmental cleanup and harm
to persons or property should be considered by the court in determining the
amount of restitution under §5E1.1 (Restitution) and in fashioning appropriate
conditions of supervision under §5B1.3 (Conditions of Probation) and §5D1.3
(Conditions of Supervised Release).".
The Commentary to §2D1.1 captioned “Background” is amended in the second paragraph
by inserting as the last sentence “Where necessary, this scheme has been modified in
response to specific congressional directives to the Commission.”.
Reason for Amendment: This multi-part amendment responds to the Comprehensive
Methamphetamine Control Act of 1996, Pub. L. 104-237, 110 Stat. 3099, including the
directives to the Commission in sections 301 and 303 of that Act. First, as directed by section
301 of the Act, the amendment increases penalties for methamphetamine trafficking offenses.
This penalty increase is accomplished by reducing by one-half the quantity of a mixture or
substance containing methamphetamine corresponding to each offense level in the Drug
Quantity Table. This part of the amendment makes no change, however, in the quantities of
methamphetamine (actual) (i.e., "pure" methamphetamine) and "Ice" methamphetamine that
correspond to the various offense levels. The Commission has arrived at these particular
changes after careful analysis of recent sentencing data, including its own intensive study of
methamphetamine offenses, information provided by the Strategic Intelligence Section of the
Drug Enforcement Administration concerning recent methamphetamine trafficking levels,
dosage unit size, price, and drug quantity, and a variety of other information.
November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment 556
– 517 –
Second, in response to the directive in section 303 of the Act, this amendment provides an
enhancement of two levels, with an invited upward departure in more extreme cases, for
environmental violations occurring in association with an illicit manufacturing or other drug
trafficking offense.
Third, in response to evidence of a recent, substantial increase in the importation of
methamphetamine and precursor chemicals used to manufacture methamphetamine, the
amendment provides an enhancement of two levels directed at such activity. An exception to
this enhancement is provided for defendants who have a mitigating role in the offense under
§3B1.2 (Mitigating Role).
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1997.
556. Amendment: Section 2D1.1(d) is amended by deleting "Reference" and inserting in lieu
thereof "References";
and by inserting after subdivision (1) the following additional subdivision:
"(2) If the defendant was convicted under 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(7) (of distributing a
controlled substance with intent to commit a crime of violence), apply §2X1.1
(Attempt, Solicitation, or Conspiracy) in respect to the crime of violence that the
defendant committed, or attempted or intended to commit, if the resulting offense
level is greater than that determined above.".
Section 2D1.1(c)(10) is amended by deleting the period after "Schedule III substances" and
inserting in lieu thereof a semicolon; and by inserting at the end the following additional
subdivision:
"2,500 or more units of Flunitrazepam.".
Section 2D1.1(c)(11) is amended by deleting the period after "Schedule III substances" and
inserting in lieu thereof a semicolon; and by inserting at the end the following additional
subdivision:
"At least 1,250 but less than 2,500 units of Flunitrazepam.".
Section 2D1.1(c)(12) is amended by deleting the period after "Schedule III substances" and
inserting in lieu thereof a semicolon; and by inserting at the end the following additional
subdivision:
"At least 625 but less than 1,250 units of Flunitrazepam.".
Section 2D1.1(c)(13) is amended by deleting the period after "Schedule III substances" and
inserting in lieu thereof a semicolon; and by inserting at the end the following additional
subdivision:
"At least 312 but less than 625 units of Flunitrazepam.".
Amendment 556 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003
– 518 –
Section 2D1.1(c)(14) is amended by inserting after "Schedule III substances;" the following
additional subdivision:
"At least 156 but less than 312 units of Flunitrazepam;";
and by inserting "(except Flunitrazepam)" after "Schedule IV substances".
Section 2D1.1(c)(15) is amended by inserting after "Schedule III substances;" the following
additional subdivision:
"At least 62 but less than 156 units of Flunitrazepam;";
and by inserting "(except Flunitrazepam)" after "Schedule IV substances".
Section 2D1.1(c)(16) is amended by inserting after "Schedule III substances;" the following
additional subdivision:
"Less than 62 units of Flunitrazepam;";
and by inserting "(except Flunitrazepam)" after "Schedule IV substances".
Section 2D1.1(c)(17) is amended by inserting "(except Flunitrazepam)" after "Schedule IV
substances".
The Commentary to §2D1.1 captioned "Statutory Provisions" is amended by inserting "(7),"
after "(3),".
The Commentary to §2D1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 10 in the "Drug
Equivalency Tables" by inserting before the subdivision captioned "Schedule I or II
Depressants**" the following additional subdivision:
"Flunitrazepam **
1 unit of Flunitrazepam = 16 gm of marihuana
** Provided, that the combined equivalent weight of flunitrazepam, all Schedule I or II
depressants, Schedule III substances, Schedule IV substances, and Schedule V
substances shall not exceed 99.99 kilograms of marihuana.
The minimum offense level from the Drug Quantity Table for flunitrazepam individually, or
in combination with any Schedule I or II depressants, Schedule III substances, Schedule IV
substances, and Schedule V substances is level 8.".
The Commentary to §2D1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 10 in the "Drug
Equivalency Tables" in the subdivision captioned "Schedule I or II Depressants" by inserting
an additional asterisk after "**" in both instances; and by inserting "(except flunitrazepam)"
after "Schedule IV substances".
November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment 556
– 519 –
The Commentary to §2D1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 10 in the "Drug
Equivalency Tables" in the subdivision captioned "Schedule III Substances" by inserting an
additional asterisk after "***" in both instances; and by inserting "(except flunitrazepam)" after
"Schedule IV substances".
The Commentary to §2D1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 10 in the "Drug
Equivalency Tables" in the subdivision captioned "Schedule IV Substances" is amended by
inserting "(except Flunitrazepam)" after "Substances"; by inserting an additional asterisk after
"****" in both instances; by inserting "(except flunitrazepam)" after "Substance"; and by
inserting "(except flunitrazepam)" before "and V".
The Commentary to §2D1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 10 in the Drug
Equivalency Tables in the subdivision captioned "Schedule V Substances" by inserting an
additional asterisk after "*****" in both instances.
The Commentary to §2D1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 17 by adding
at the end:
"Similarly, in the case of a controlled substance for which the maximum offense level
is less than level 38 (e.g., the maximum offense level in the Drug Quantity Table for
flunitrazepam is level 20), an upward departure may be warranted if the drug quantity
substantially exceeds the quantity for the highest offense level established for that
particular controlled substance.".
Section 2D2.1(a)(2) is amended by inserting "flunitrazepam," after "cocaine,".
The Commentary to §2D2.1 is amended by inserting before "Background:":
"Application Note:
1. The typical case addressed by this guideline involves possession of a controlled
substance by the defendant for the defendant’s own consumption. Where the
circumstances establish intended consumption by a person other than the
defendant, an upward departure may be warranted.".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment implements the directive to the Commission in the
Drug-Induced Rape Prevention and Punishment Act of 1996, Pub. L. 104-305, 110 Stat. 3807.
Section 2 of the Act directs the Commission to amend the guidelines to reflect the serious
nature of offenses involving flunitrazepam. This amendment reflects the increases in statutory
maximum penalties for offenses involving trafficking and simple possession, respectively, of
flunitrazepam. In addition, the amendment contains a cross reference to cover the new offense
created under this Act involving the distribution of a controlled substance to an individual in
order to commit a crime of violence against that individual.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1997.
557. Amendment: Section 2D1.11(d)(1)-(10), Note "E" (List Chemical Equivalency Table) of
§2D1.11(d), and Note 4(a) of the Commentary to §2D1.11 captioned "Application Notes" are
Amendment 556 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003
– 520 –
repromulgated without change.
Reason for Amendment: Section 302 of the Comprehensive Methamphetamine Control Act
of 1996, Pub. L. 104-237, 110 Stat. 3099, directs the Commission to increase by at least two
levels the offense levels for offenses involving list I chemicals under 21 U.S.C. §§ 841(d)(1)
and (2) and 960(d)(1) and (3). Pursuant to this provision, the Commission promulgated an
emergency amendment to §2D1.11, effective May 1, 1997. Under the terms of the
congressionally-granted authority, the emergency amendment is temporary unless
repromulgated in the next amendment cycle under regularly applicable amendment procedures.
See Pub.L. 100-182, § 21set forth as an editorial note under 28 U.S.C. § 994. This amendment
repromulgates §2D1.11(d)(1)-(10), Note "E" (List Chemical Equivalency Table) of
§2D1.11(d), and Note 4(a) of the Commentary to §2D1.11 captioned "Application Notes", as
set forth in the May 1, 1997 Revised Supplement to the 1995 edition of the Guidelines Manual.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1997.
558. Amendment: Section 2D1.12 is amended by redesignating subsection (b) as subsection (c);
and by inserting the following new subsection (b):
"(b) Specific Offense Characteristic
(1) If the defendant (A) intended to manufacture methamphetamine, or (B)
knew, believed, or had reasonable cause to believe that prohibited
equipment was to be used to manufacture methamphetamine, increase by
2 levels.".
The Commentary to §2D1.12 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 2 by deleting
"(b)(1)" and inserting in lieu thereof "(c)(1)".
Section 2D2.1(a)(3) is amended by inserting "or a list I chemical" after "controlled substance".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment implements the directive to the Commission in
section 203 of the Comprehensive Methamphetamine Control Act of 1996, Pub. L. 104-237,
110 Stat. 3099, to ensure that possession of equipment used to make methamphetamine is
treated as a significant violation. Additionally, the amendment includes list I chemicals under
§2D2.1 (Unlawful Possession; Attempt or Conspiracy), in response to section 201 of the Act,
which amends 21 U.S.C. § 844 to include list I chemicals.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1997.
559. Amendment: Section 2H4.1 is repromulgated without change.
Reason for Amendment: This amendment implements section 218 of the Illegal Immigration
Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, Pub. L. 104-208, 110 Stat. 3009, which
directs the Commission to review the guideline for peonage, involuntary servitude, and slave
trade offenses and amend the guideline pursuant to that review. Pursuant to the emergency
amendment authority of that Act, this amendment previously was promulgated as a temporary
measure effective May 1, 1997.
November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment 561
– 521 –
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1997.
560. Amendment: The Commentary to §2K1.5 captioned "Background" is amended by deleting:
"Except under the circumstances specified in 49 U.S.C. § 46505(c), the offense covered
by this section is a misdemeanor for which the maximum term of imprisonment
authorized by statute is one year.";
by deleting "An" and inserting in lieu thereof "This guideline provides an"; and by deleting "is
provided" immediately after "enhancement".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment strikes background commentary in guideline
§2K1.5 that is no longer correct because of a recent change in statutory penalties. Specifically,
the Antiterrorism Act of 1996 increased the statutory maximum penalty for violations of 49
U.S.C. § 46505(b) from not more than one year to not more than 10 years. This increase
changes the classification of an offense under subsection (b) from a class A misdemeanor to
a class D felony.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1997.
561. Amendment: Section 2L1.1 is repromulgated with the following changes:
Section 2L1.1(b)(1)(A) is amended by deleting "the defendant committed the offense" and
inserting in lieu thereof "the offense was committed".
The Commentary to §2L1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 1 by deleting:
"‘The defendant committed the offense other than for profit’ means that there was no
payment or expectation of payment for the smuggling, transporting, or harboring of any
of the unlawful aliens. The ‘number of unlawful aliens smuggled, transported, or
harbored’ does not include the defendant.",
and inserting in lieu thereof:
"‘The offense was committed other than for profit’ means that there was no payment or
expectation of payment for the smuggling, transporting, or harboring of any of the
unlawful aliens.
‘Number of unlawful aliens smuggled, transported, or harbored’ does not include the
defendant.".
Section 5K2.0 is amended in the third paragraph by deleting "immigration violations" and
inserting in lieu thereof "other guidelines"; and by deleting "for an immigration violation" and
inserting in lieu thereof "under one of these other guidelines".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment implements section 203 of the Illegal Immigration
Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, Pub. L. 104-208, 110 Stat. 3009, which
directs the Commission to amend the guidelines for offenses related to smuggling, transporting,
Amendment 561 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003
– 522 –
or harboring illegal aliens. Pursuant to the emergency amendment authority of that Act, this
amendment previously was promulgated as a temporary measure effective May 1, 1997. This
version of the amendment changes §2L1.1(b)(1)(A)(pertaining to a reduction for non-profit
offenses) to narrow somewhat the class of cases that would qualify for the reduced offense
level under that provision. This amendment also makes a conforming change to §5K2.0.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1997.
562. Amendment: Section 2L1.2 is amended by deleting subsection (b) as follows:
"(b) Specific Offense Characteristics
If more than one applies, use the greater:
(1) If the defendant previously was deported after a conviction for a felony,
other than a felony involving violation of the immigration laws, increase
by 4 levels.
(2) If the defendant previously was deported after a conviction for an
aggravated felony, increase by 16 levels.",
and inserting in lieu thereof:
"(b) Specific Offense Characteristic
(1) If the defendant previously was deported after a criminal conviction, or
if the defendant unlawfully remained in the United States following a
removal order issued after a criminal conviction, increase as follows (if
more than one applies, use the greater):
(A) If the conviction was for an aggravated felony, increase by 16
levels.
(B) If the conviction was for (i) any other felony, or (ii) three or
more misdemeanor crimes of violence or misdemeanor
controlled substance offenses, increase by 4 levels.".
The Commentary to §2L1.2 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by deleting Notes 3 and
4 as follows:
"3. A 4-level increase is provided under subsection (b)(1) in the case of a defendant
who was previously deported after a conviction for a felony, other than a felony
involving a violation of the immigration laws.
4. A 16-level increase is provided under subsection (b)(2) in the case of a defendant
who was previously deported after a conviction for an aggravated felony.";
by redesignating Notes 1 and 2 as Notes 2 and 3, respectively; by deleting in Note 3, as
November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment 562
– 523 –
redesignated, "without criminal conviction" after "deportation"; and by inserting the following
as the new Note 1:
"1. For purposes of this guideline—
‘Deported after a conviction,’ means that the deportation was subsequent to the
conviction, whether or not the deportation was in response to such conviction.
An alien has previously been ‘deported’ if he or she has been removed or has
departed the United States while an order of exclusion, deportation, or removal
was outstanding.
‘Remained in the United States following a removal order issued after a
conviction,’ means that the removal order was subsequent to the conviction,
whether or not the removal order was in response to such conviction.
‘Aggravated felony,’ is defined at 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43) without regard to the
date of conviction of the aggravated felony.
‘Crime of violence’ and ‘controlled substance offense’ are defined in §4B1.2.
For purposes of subsection (b)(1)(B), ‘crime of violence’ includes offenses
punishable by imprisonment for a term of one year or less.
‘Firearms offense’ means any offense covered by Chapter Two, Part K, Subpart
2, or any similar offense under state or local law.
‘Felony offense’ means any federal, state, or local offense punishable by
imprisonment for a term exceeding one year.".
The Commentary to §2L1.2 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by redesignating Note
5 as Note 4; in Note 4, as redesignated, by deleting "(b)(1) or (b)(2)" and inserting in lieu
thereof "(b)"; and by inserting after Note 4, as redesignated, the following new note:
"5. Aggravated felonies that trigger the adjustment from subsection (b)(1)(A) vary
widely. If subsection (b)(1)(A) applies, and (A) the defendant has previously
been convicted of only one felony offense; (B) such offense was not a crime of
violence or firearms offense; and (C) the term of imprisonment imposed for such
offense did not exceed one year, a downward departure may be warranted based
on the seriousness of the aggravated felony.".
The Commentary to §2L1.2 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by deleting Notes 6 and
7 as follows:
"6. ‘Deported after a conviction,’ as used in subsections (b)(1) and (b)(2), means that
the deportation was subsequent to the conviction, whether or not the deportation
was in response to such conviction.
7. ‘Aggravated felony,’ as used in subsection (b)(2), means murder; any illicit
trafficking in any controlled substance (as defined in 21 U.S.C. § 802), including
Amendment 562 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003
– 524 –
any drug trafficking crime as defined in 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(2); any illicit
trafficking in any firearms or destructive devices as defined in 18 U.S.C. § 921;
any offense described in 18 U.S.C. § 1956 (relating to laundering of monetary
instruments); any crime of violence (as defined in 18 U.S.C. § 16, not including
a purely political offense) for which the term of imprisonment imposed
(regardless of any suspension of such imprisonment) is at least five years; or any
attempt or conspiracy to commit any such act. The term ‘aggravated felony’
applies to offenses described in the previous sentence whether in violation of
federal or state law and also applies to offenses described in the previous
sentence in violation of foreign law for which the term of imprisonment was
completed within the previous 15 years. See 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43).".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment implements sections 321 and 334 of the Illegal
Immigration and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, Pub. L. 104-208, 110 Stat. 3009.
Section 321 of the Act adds to the definition of "aggravated felony" crimes of rape and sexual
abuse of a minor, as well as any crime of violence for which the term of imprisonment is at
least one year. This amendment conforms the definition of "aggravated felony" in the
guidelines with the amended definition in the Immigration and Nationality Act.
Section 334 directs the Sentencing Commission to promulgate amendments to the guidelines
for the crimes of unlawfully remaining and illegally entering the United States corresponding
to changes made in statutory penalties for these offenses in the Violent Crime Control and Law
Enforcement Act of 1994, Pub. L. 103-322, 108 Stat. 1796. This amendment enhances
penalties for those who unlawfully enter or remain in the United States following conviction
for an aggravated felony, any other felony, or three misdemeanor crimes of violence or
controlled substance offenses. The amendment also makes clarifying changes to the
commentary.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1997.
563. Amendment: Section 2L2.1 is repromulgated with the following changes:
Section 2L2.1(b) is amended by deleting:
"(1) If the defendant committed the offense other than for profit, or the offense
involved the smuggling, transporting, or harboring only of the defendant’s
spouse or child (or both the defendant’s spouse and child), decrease by 3 levels.",
and inserting in lieu thereof:
"(1) If the offense was committed other than for profit, or the offense involved the
smuggling, transporting, or harboring only of the defendant’s spouse or child (or
both the defendant’s spouse and child), decrease by 3 levels.".
The Commentary to §2L2.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 1 by deleting:
"‘The defendant committed the offense other than for profit’ means that there was no
payment or expectation of payment for the smuggling, transporting, or harboring of any
November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment 564
– 525 –
of the unlawful aliens.",
and inserting in lieu thereof:
"‘The offense was committed other than for profit’ means that there was no payment or
expectation of payment for the smuggling, transporting, or harboring of any of the
unlawful aliens.".
Section 2L2.2 is repromulgated without change.
Reason for Amendment: This amendment implements section 211 of the Illegal Immigration
Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, Pub. L. 104-208, 110 Stat. 3009, which
directs the Commission to amend the guidelines for offenses related to the fraudulent use of
government-issued documents. Pursuant to the emergency amendment authority of that Act,
this amendment previously was promulgated as a temporary measure effective May 1, 1997.
This version of the amendment changes §2L2.1(b)(1)(pertaining to a reduction for non-profit
offenses) to narrow somewhat the class of cases that would qualify for the reduced offense
level under that provision.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1997.
564. Amendment: Section 3A1.1(a) is amended by inserting "of conviction" after "the offense".
The Commentary to §3A1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 2 by inserting
at the beginning the following new paragaph:
"For purposes of subsection (b), ‘victim’ includes any person who is a victim of the
offense of conviction and any conduct for which the defendant is accountable under
§1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct).".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment addresses a circuit court conflict regarding whether
"victim of the offense" in §3A1.1 (Hate Crime Motivation or Vulnerable Victim) refers only
to a victim of the defendant’s offense of conviction or, more broadly, to a victim of any
relevant conduct. The amendment adopts the majority appellate view, which holds that a
sentencing court should consider the defendant’s relevant conduct when determining whether
the vulnerable victim enhancement applies. See, e.g., United States v. Haggard, 41 F.3d 1320,
1326 (9th Cir. 1994) (proper to consider harm caused to victims beyond the defendant’s offense
of conviction); United States v. Yount, 960 F.2d 955 (11th Cir. 1992).
This amendment also clarifies a possible ambiguity regarding the scope of conduct to be
considered when applying the hate crime motivation enhancement in §3A1.1(a). Consistent
with Congress’s intent to punish a defendant whose primary objective in committing the hate
crime was to harm a member of a particular class of individuals, this amendment clarifies that
the enhancement in subsection (a) is limited to victims of the defendant’s offense of conviction.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1997.
565. Amendment: Section 3A1.4 is repromulgated without change.
Amendment 564 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003
– 526 –
Reason for Amendment: Section 730 of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act
of 1996, Pub. L. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1303, requires the Commission to amend the sentencing
guidelines so that the adjustment in §3A1.4 (relating to international terrorism) applies more
broadly to "Federal crimes of terrorism," as defined in 18 U.S.C. § 2332b(g). Pursuant to this
provision, the Commission promulgated §3A1.4 (Terrorism) as an emergency amendment,
effective November 1, 1996. Under the terms of the congressionally granted authority, this
amendment is temporary unless repromulgated in the next amendment cycle under regularly
applicable amendment procedures. See Pub. L. No. 100-182, § 21, set forth as an editorial note
under 28 U.S.C. § 994. This amendment repromulgates §3A1.4, as set forth in the May 1, 1997
Revised Supplement to the 1995 Guidelines Manual.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1997.
566. Amendment: The Commentary to §3C1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note
1 by deleting in the third sentence "such testimony or statements should be evaluated in a light
most favorable to the defendant." and inserting in lieu thereof:
"the court should be cognizant that inaccurate testimony or statements sometimes may
result from confusion, mistake, or faulty memory and, thus, not all inaccurate testimony
or statements necessarily reflect a willful attempt to obstruct justice.".
The Commentary to §3C1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 3(i) by deleting
"conduct prohibited by 18 U.S.C. §§ 1501-1516." and inserting in lieu thereof "other conduct
prohibited by obstruction of justice provisions under Title 18, United States Code (e.g.,
18 U.S.C. §§ 1510, 1511).".
The Commentary to §3C1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 4 by deleting
"The following is a non-exhaustive list of examples of the" and inserting in lieu thereof
"Some"; by deleting "that, absent a separate count of conviction for such conduct," and
inserting in lieu thereof "ordinarily"; by deleting ", but ordinarily can appropriately be
sanctioned by the determination of the particular" and inserting in lieu thereof "but may warrant
a greater"; and by inserting the following after "guideline range":
". However, if the defendant is convicted of a separate count for such conduct, this
enhancement will apply and increase the offense level for the underlying offense (i.e.,
the offense with respect to which the obstructive conduct occurred). See Application
Note 7, below.
The following is a non-exhaustive list of examples of the types of conduct to which this
application note applies".
The Commentary to §3C1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 6 by deleting:
"Where the defendant is convicted both of the obstruction offense and the underlying
offense, the count for the obstruction offense will be grouped with the count for the
underlying offense under subsection (c) of §3D1.2 (Groups of Closely Related Counts).
The offense level for that group of closely related counts will be the offense level for the
underlying offense increased by the 2-level adjustment specified by this section, or the
November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment 567
– 527 –
offense level for the obstruction offense, whichever is greater.".
The Commentary to §3C1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by redesignating Note
7 as Note 8; and by inserting the following as new Note 7:
"7. Where the defendant is convicted both of the obstruction offense and the
underlying offense (the offense with respect to which the obstructive conduct
occurred), the count for the obstruction offense will be grouped with the count
for the underlying offense under subsection (c) of §3D1.2 (Groups of Closely
Related Counts). The offense level for that group of closely related counts will
be the offense level for the underlying offense increased by the 2-level
adjustment specified by this section, or the offense level for the obstruction
offense, whichever is greater.".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment addresses a circuit court conflict regarding the
meaning of the last sentence of Application Note 1 in §3C1.1. The issue is whether that
sentence requires the use of a heightened standard of proof when the court applies an
enhancement for perjury. Compare United States v. Montague, 40 F.3d 1251 (D.C. Cir. 1994)
(applying the clear and convincing standard) with United States v. Zajac, 62 F.3d 145 (6th Cir.)
(applying the preponderance of the evidence standard), cert. denied 116 S. Ct. 681 (1995). The
amendment changes the last sentence of Application Note 1 so that it no longer suggests the
use of a heightened standard of proof. Instead, it clarifies that the court should be mindful that
not all inaccurate testimony or statements reflect a willful attempt to obstruct justice.
The amendment also (A) modifies subdivision (i) of Application Note 3 in §3C1.1 to make the
language more precise; (B) in response to concerns expressed in a Seventh Circuit opinion,
clarifies the meaning of the phrase "absent a separate count of conviction" by adding an
additional sentence at the end of Application Note 4, see United States v. Giacometti, 28 F.3d
698 (7th Cir. 1994); and (C) clarifies that the guidance in the last two sentences of Application
Note 6 applies to a broader set of cases than the cases described in the first two sentences of
Application Note 6.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1997.
567. Amendment: The Commentary to §4B1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note
2 by deleting "not" after "offense," in the first sentence; by deleting "(b)(1)(B), (b)(1)(C), and
(b)(1)(D)" and inserting in lieu thereof "(B), (C), and (D)"; by deleting "where" and inserting
in lieu thereof "in a case in which"; by inserting "for that defendant" after "Maximum’"; by
deleting "twenty years and not thirty years" and inserting in lieu thereof "thirty years and not
twenty years"; by deleting "authorizes" and inserting in lieu thereof "has"; and by deleting
"maximum term of imprisonment" and inserting in lieu thereof "offense statutory maximum".
The Commentary to §4B1.1 captioned "Background" is amended by deleting:
"The legislative history of this provision suggests that the phrase ‘maximum term
authorized’ should be construed as the maximum term authorized by statute. See S. Rep.
No. 225, 98th Cong., 1st Sess. 175 (1983); 128 Cong. Rec. 26,511-12 (1982) (text of
‘Career Criminals’ amendment by Senator Kennedy); id. at 26,515 (brief summary of
Amendment 567 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003
– 528 –
amendment); id. at 26,517-18 (statement of Senator Kennedy).".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment responds to United States v. LaBonte, 520 U.S.
751. In LaBonte, the Supreme Court held that the way in which the Commission defined
"maximum term authorized", for purposes of fulfilling the requirement under 28 U.S.C. §
994(h) to specify sentences for certain categories of career offenders at or near the maximum
term authorized for those offenders, is inconsistent with § 994(h)’s plain and unambiguous
language and is therefore invalid. The Commission defined "maximum term authorized" to
mean the maximum term authorized for the offense of conviction not including any sentencing
enhancement provisions that apply because of the defendant’s prior criminal record. The
Supreme Court held that under § 994’s plain and unambiguous language, "maximum term
authorized" must be read to include all applicable statutory sentencing enhancements. The
proposed amendment makes a straightforward change to the commentary to §4B1.1, the career
offender guideline, to reflect the LaBonte decision. Specifically, the definition of "maximum
term authorized" is proposed to be changed to reflect that the "maximum term authorized"
includes all sentencing enhancements that apply because of the defendant’s prior criminal
record.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1997.
568. Amendment: Section §4B1.2(1) is amended by deleting "(1)" and inserting in lieu thereof
"(a)"; by inserting a comma after "law" and after "one year"; by deleting "(i)" and inserting in
lieu thereof "(1)"; and by deleting "(ii)" and inserting in lieu thereof "(2)".
Section §4B1.2(2) is amended by deleting "(2)" and inserting in lieu thereof "(b)"; by deleting
"a" after "under"; and by deleting "prohibiting" and inserting in lieu thereof ", punishable by
imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, that prohibits".
Section §4B1.2(3) is amended by deleting "(3)" and inserting in lieu thereof "(c)"; by deleting
"(A)" and inserting in lieu thereof "(1)"; and by deleting "(B)" and inserting in lieu thereof
"(2)".
The Commentary to §4B1.2 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 1 by inserting
at the beginning "For purposes of this guideline—"; by deleting "The terms ‘crime" and
inserting in lieu thereof "‘Crime";
and by inserting at the end the following new paragraphs:
"‘Crime of violence’ includes murder, manslaughter, kidnapping, aggravated assault,
forcible sex offenses, robbery, arson, extortion, extortionate extension of credit, and
burglary of a dwelling. Other offenses are included as ‘crimes of violence’ if (A) that
offense has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force
against the person of another, or (B) the conduct set forth (i.e., expressly charged) in the
count of which the defendant was convicted involved use of explosives (including any
explosive material or destructive device) or, by its nature, presented a serious potential
risk of physical injury to another.
‘Crime of violence’ does not include the offense of unlawful possession of a firearm by
November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment 568
– 529 –
a felon. Where the instant offense of conviction is the unlawful possession of a firearm
by a felon, §2K2.1 (Unlawful Receipt, Possession, or Transportation of Firearms or
Ammunition; Prohibited Transactions Involving Firearms or Ammunition) provides an
increase in offense level if the defendant had one or more prior felony convictions for
a crime of violence or controlled substance offense; and, if the defendant is sentenced
under the provisions of 18 U.S.C. § 924(e), §4B1.4 (Armed Career Criminal) will apply.
Unlawfully possessing a listed chemical with intent to manufacture a controlled
substance (21 U.S.C. § 841(d)(1)) is a ‘controlled substance offense.’
Unlawfully possessing a prohibited flask or equipment with intent to manufacture a
controlled substance (21 U.S.C. § 843(a)(6)) is a ‘controlled substance offense.’
Maintaining any place for the purpose of facilitating a drug offense (21 U.S.C. § 856)
is a ‘controlled substance offense’ if the offense of conviction established that the
underlying offense (the offense facilitated) was a ‘controlled substance offense.’
Using a communications facility in committing, causing, or facilitating a drug offense
(21 U.S.C. § 843(b)) is a ‘controlled substance offense’ if the offense of conviction
established that the underlying offense (the offense committed, caused, or facilitated)
was a ‘controlled substance offense.’
Possessing a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence or drug offense
(18 U.S.C. § 924(c)) is a ‘crime of violence’ or ‘controlled substance offense’ if the
offense of conviction established that the underlying offense (the offense during and in
relation to which the firearm was carried or possessed) was a ‘crime of violence’ or
‘controlled substance offense.’ (Note that if the defendant also was convicted of the
underlying offense, the two convictions will be treated as related cases under §4A1.2
(Definitions and Instruction for Computing Criminal History)).
‘Prior felony conviction’ means a prior adult federal or state conviction for an offense
punishable by death or imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, regardless of
whether such offense is specifically designated as a felony and regardless of the actual
sentence imposed. A conviction for an offense committed at age eighteen or older is an
adult conviction. A conviction for an offense committed prior to age eighteen is an adult
conviction if it is classified as an adult conviction under the laws of the jurisdiction in
which the defendant was convicted (e.g., a federal conviction for an offense committed
prior to the defendant’s eighteenth birthday is an adult conviction if the defendant was
expressly proceeded against as an adult).".
The Commentary to §4B1.2 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by deleting Notes 2 and
3 as follows:
"2. ‘Crime of violence’ includes murder, manslaughter, kidnapping, aggravated
assault, forcible sex offenses, robbery, arson, extortion, extortionate extension
of credit, and burglary of a dwelling. Other offenses are included where (A) that
offense has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical
force against the person of another, or (B) the conduct set forth (i.e., expressly
Amendment 568 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003
– 530 –
charged) in the count of which the defendant was convicted involved use of
explosives (including any explosive material or destructive device) or, by its
nature, presented a serious potential risk of physical injury to another. Under this
section, the conduct of which the defendant was convicted is the focus of inquiry.
The term ‘crime of violence’ does not include the offense of unlawful possession
of a firearm by a felon. Where the instant offense of conviction is the unlawful
possession of a firearm by a felon, §2K2.1 (Unlawful Receipt, Possession, or
Transportation of Firearms or Ammunition; Prohibited Transactions Involving
Firearms or Ammunition) provides an increase in offense level if the defendant
has one or more prior felony convictions for a crime of violence or controlled
substance offense; and, if the defendant is sentenced under the provisions of
18 U.S.C. § 924(e), §4B1.4 (Armed Career Criminal) will apply.
3. ‘Prior felony conviction’ means a prior adult federal or state conviction for an
offense punishable by death or imprisonment for a term exceeding one year,
regardless of whether such offense is specifically designated as a felony and
regardless of the actual sentence imposed. A conviction for an offense
committed at age eighteen or older is an adult conviction. A conviction for an
offense committed prior to age eighteen is an adult conviction if it is classified
as an adult conviction under the laws of the jurisdiction in which the defendant
was convicted (e.g., a federal conviction for an offense committed prior to the
defendant’s eighteenth birthday is an adult conviction if the defendant was
expressly proceeded against as an adult).";
and by inserting after Note 1 the following new Note 2:
"2. Section 4B1.1 (Career Offender) expressly provides that the instant and prior
offenses must be crimes of violence or controlled substance offenses of which the
defendant was convicted. Therefore, in determining whether an offense is a
crime of violence or controlled substance for the purposes of §4B1.1 (Career
Offender), the offense of conviction (i.e., the conduct of which the defendant was
convicted) is the focus of inquiry.".
The Commentary to §4B1.2 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by redesignating Note
4 as Note 3.
The Commentary to §2K1.3 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 2 by deleting
"Note 3" and inserting in lieu thereof "Note 1".
The Commentary to §2K2.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 5 by deleting
"Note 3" and inserting in lieu thereof "Note 1".
The Commentary to §7B1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 2 by deleting
"§4B1.2(1)" and inserting in lieu thereof "§4B1.2(a)"; and by deleting "Notes 1 and 2" and
inserting in lieu thereof "Note 1".
The Commentary to §7B1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 3 by deleting
November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment 569
– 531 –
"§4B1.2(2)" and inserting in lieu thereof "§4B1.2(b)".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment addresses a circuit court conflict regarding whether
the offenses of possessing a listed chemical with intent to manufacture a controlled substance
or possessing a prohibited flask or equipment with intent to manufacture a controlled substance
are "controlled substance offenses" under the career offender guideline. Compare United
States v. Calverley, 11 F.3d 505 (5th Cir. 1993) (possession of a listed chemical with intent to
manufacture a controlled substance is a controlled substance offense under §4B1.2) with United
States v. Wagner, 994 F.2d 1467, 1475 (10th Cir. 1993) (possession of a listed chemical with
intent to manufacture a controlled substance is not a controlled substance offense). This
amendment makes each of these offenses a "controlled substance offense" under the career
offender guideline. This decision is based on the Commission’s view that there is such a close
connection between possession of a listed chemical or prohibited flask or equipment with intent
to manufacture a controlled substance and actually manufacturing a controlled substance that
the former offenses are fairly considered as controlled substance trafficking offenses.
The amendment also clarifies that certain other offenses are "crimes of violence" or "controlled
substance offenses" if the offense of conviction established that the underlying offense was a
"crime of violence" or "controlled substance offense." See United States v. Baker, 16 F.3d 854
(8th Cir. 1994); United States v. Vea-Gonzalez, 999 F.2d 1326 (9th Cir. 1993), effectively
overruled on other grounds by Custis v. United States, 114 S.Ct. 1732 (1994). Additionally,
the amendment makes the following nonsubstantive changes to §4B1.2 to improve the internal
consistency of the guidelines: (A) adding the phrase "punishable by a term of imprisonment of
more than one year, that prohibits" in subsection (2) to make it consistent with subsection (1);
and (B) conforming the second paragraph of Application Note 2 of §4B1.2 to the language of
§§2K1.3 and 2K2.1.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1997.
569. Amendment: Chapter Five, Part B, Subpart 1 is amended by deleting §§5B1.3 and 5B1.4 in
their entirety as follows:
"§5B1.3. Conditions of Probation
(a) If a term of probation is imposed, the court shall impose a
condition that the defendant shall not commit another federal,
state, or local crime during the term of probation. 18 U.S.C.
§ 3563(a)(1). The court shall also impose a condition that the
defendant not possess illegal controlled substances. 18 U.S.C.
§ 3563(a)(3).
(b) The court may impose other conditions that (1) are reasonably
related to the nature and circumstances of the offense, the history
and characteristics of the defendant, and the purposes of
sentencing and (2) involve only such deprivations of liberty or
property as are reasonably necessary to effect the purposes of
sentencing. 18 U.S.C. § 3563(b). Recommended conditions are
set forth in §5B1.4.
Amendment 569 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003
– 532 –
(c) If a term of probation is imposed for a felony, the court shall
impose at least one of the following as a condition of probation:
a fine, an order of restitution, or community service, unless the
court finds on the record that extraordinary circumstances exist
that would make such a condition plainly unreasonable, in which
event the court shall impose one or more of the other conditions
set forth under 18 U.S.C. § 3563(b). 18 U.S.C. § 3563(a)(2).
(d) Intermittent confinement (custody for intervals of time) may be
ordered as a condition of probation during the first year of
probation. 18 U.S.C. § 3563(b)(11). Intermittent confinement
shall be credited toward the guideline term of imprisonment at
§5C1.1 as provided in the schedule at §5C1.1(e).
Commentary
A broader form of the condition required under 18 U.S.C. § 3563(a)(3)
(pertaining to possession of controlled substances) is set forth as recommended condition
(7) at §5B1.4 (Recommended Conditions of Probation and Supervised Release).
§5B1.4. Recommended Conditions of Probation and Supervised Release (Policy
Statement)
(a) The following ‘standard’ conditions (1-13) are generally
recommended for both probation and supervised release:
(1) the defendant shall not leave the judicial district or other
specified geographic area without the permission of the
court or probation officer;
(2) the defendant shall report to the probation officer as
directed by the court or probation officer and shall
submit a truthful and complete written report within the
first five days of each month;
(3) the defendant shall answer truthfully all inquiries by the
probation officer and follow the instructions of the

prescribed by a physician;
(8) the defendant shall not frequent places where controlled
substances are illegally sold, used, distributed, or
administered, or other places specified by the court;
(9) the defendant shall not associate with any persons
engaged in criminal activity, and shall not associate with
any person convicted of a felony unless granted
permission to do so by the probation officer;
(10) the defendant shall permit a probation officer to visit him
at any time at home or elsewhere and shall permit
confiscation of any contraband observed in plain view by
the probation officer;
(11) the defendant shall notify the probation officer within
seventy-two hours of being arrested or questioned by a
law enforcement officer;
(12) the defendant shall not enter into any agreement to act as
an informer or a special agent of a law enforcement
agency without the permission of the court;
(13) as directed by the probation officer, the defendant shall
notify third parties of risks that may be occasioned by the
defendant’s criminal record or personal history or
characteristics, and shall permit the probation officer to
make such notifications and to confirm the defendant’s
compliance with such notification requirement.
(b) The following ‘special’ conditions of probation and supervised
release (14-24) are either recommended or required by law under
the circumstances described, or may be appropriate in a
particular case:
(14) Possession of Weapons
If the instant conviction is for a felony, or if the
defendant was previously convicted of a felony or used
a firearm or other dangerous weapon in the course of the
instant offense, it is recommended that the court impose
a condition prohibiting the defendant from possessing a
Amendment 569 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003
– 534 –
firearm or other dangerous weapon.
(15) Restitution
If the court imposes an order of restitution, it is
recommended that the court impose a condition requiring
the defendant to make payment of restitution or adhere to
a court ordered installment schedule for payment of
restitution. See §5E1.1 (Restitution).
(16) Fines
If the court imposes a fine, it is recommended that the
court impose a condition requiring the defendant to pay
the fine or adhere to a court ordered installment schedule
for payment of the fine.
(17) Debt Obligations
If an installment schedule of payment of restitution or
fines is imposed, it is recommended that the court impose
a condition prohibiting the defendant from incurring new
credit charges or opening additional lines of credit
without approval of the probation officer unless the
defendant is in compliance with the payment schedule.
(18) Access to Financial Information
If the court imposes an order of restitution, forfeiture, or
notice to victims, or orders the defendant to pay a fine, it
is recommended that the court impose a condition
requiring the defendant to provide the probation officer
access to any requested financial information.
(19) Community Confinement
Residence in a community treatment center, halfway
house or similar facility may be imposed as a condition
of probation or supervised release. See §5F1.1
(Community Confinement).
(20) Home Detention
Home detention may be imposed as a condition of
probation or supervised release, but only as a substitute
for imprisonment. See §5F1.2 (Home Detention).
(21) Community Service
November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment 569
– 535 –
Community service may be imposed as a condition of
probation or supervised release. See §5F1.3
(Community Service).
(22) Occupational Restrictions
Occupational restrictions may be imposed as a condition
of probation or supervised release. See §5F1.5
(Occupational Restrictions).
(23) Substance Abuse Program Participation
If the court has reason to believe that the defendant is an
abuser of narcotics, other controlled substances or
alcohol, it is recommended that the court impose a
condition requiring the defendant to participate in a
program approved by the United States Probation Office
for substance abuse, which program may include testing
to determine whether the defendant has reverted to the
use of drugs or alcohol.
(24) Mental Health Program Participation
If the court has reason to believe that the defendant is in
need of psychological or psychiatric treatment, it is
recommended that the court impose a condition requiring
that the defendant participate in a mental health program
approved by the United States Probation Office.
(25) Curfew
If the court concludes that restricting the defendant to his
place of residence during evening and nighttime hours is
necessary to provide just punishment for the offense, to
protect the public from crimes that the defendant might
commit during those hours, or to assist in the
rehabilitation of the defendant, a condition of curfew is
recommended. Electronic monitoring may be used as a
means of surveillance to ensure compliance with a
curfew order.
Commentary
Application Note:
1. Home detention, as defined by §5F1.2, may only be used as a substitute for
imprisonment. See §5C1.1 (Imposition of a Term of Imprisonment). Under
home detention, the defendant, with specified exceptions, is restricted to his place
Amendment 569 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003
– 536 –
of residence during all non-working hours. Curfew, which limits the defendant
to his place of residence during evening and nighttime hours, is less restrictive
than home detention and may be imposed as a condition of probation whether or
not imprisonment could have been ordered.".
A replacement guideline with accompanying commentary is inserted as §5B1.3 (Conditions of
Probation).
Chapter Five, Part D, Subpart 1 is amended by deleting §5D1.3 in its entirety as follows:
"§5D1.3. Conditions of Supervised Release
(a) If a term of supervised release is imposed, the court shall impose
a condition that the defendant not commit another federal, state,
or local crime. 18 U.S.C. § 3583(d). The court shall also
impose a condition that the defendant not possess illegal
controlled substances. 18 U.S.C. § 3563(a)(3).
(b) The court may impose other conditions of supervised release, to
the extent that such conditions are reasonably related to (1) the
nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and
characteristics of the defendant, and (2) the need for the sentence
imposed to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct, to
protect the public from further crimes of the defendant, and to
provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational
training, medical care, or other correctional treatment in the most
effective manner. 18 U.S.C. §§ 3553(a)(2) and 3583(d).
(c) Recommended conditions of supervised release are set forth in
§5B1.4.
Commentary
Background: This section applies to conditions of supervised release. The conditions
generally recommended for supervised release are those recommended for probation.
See §5B1.4. A broader form of the condition required under 18 U.S.C. § 3563(a)(3)
(pertaining to possession of controlled substances) is set forth as recommended condition
(7) at §5B1.4 (Recommended Conditions of Probation and Supervised Release).".
A replacement guideline with accompanying commentary is inserted as §5D1.3 (Conditions
of Supervised Release).
The Commentary to §2X5.1 captioned "Application Note" is amended in Note 1 by deleting:
"§5B1.4 (Recommended Conditions of Probation and Supervised Release);".
Section 5H1.3 is amended by deleting "recommended condition (24) at §5B1.4 (Recommended
Conditions of Probation and Supervised Release)" and inserting in lieu thereof "§§5B1.3(d)(5)
and 5D1.3(d)(5)".
November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment 570
– 537 –
Section 5H1.4 is amended in the second paragraph by deleting "recommended condition (23)
at §5B1.4 (Recommended Conditions of Probation and Supervised Release)" and inserting in
lieu thereof "§5D1.3(d)(4)"; and in the third paragraph by deleting "recommended condition
(23) at §5B1.4 (Recommended Conditions of Probation and Supervised Release)" and inserting
in lieu thereof "§5B1.3(d)(4)".
Section 8D1.3(a) is amended by deleting "shall" immediately after "organization".
Section 8D1.3(b) is amended by deleting "a fine, restitution, or community service," and
inserting in lieu thereof "(1) restitution, (2) notice to victims of the offense pursuant to 18
U.S.C. § 3555, or (3) an order requiring the organization to reside, or refrain from residing, in
a specified place or area,";
and by adding at the end:
"Note: Section 3563(a)(2) of Title 18, United States Code, provides that, absent unusual
circumstances, a defendant convicted of a felony shall abide by at least one of the
conditions set forth in 18 U.S.C. § 3563(b)(2), (b)(3), and (b)(13). Before the enactment
of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, those conditions were a
fine ((b)(2)), an order of restitution ((b)(3)), and community service ((b)(13)). Whether
or not the change was intended, the Act deleted the fine condition and renumbered the
restitution and community service conditions in 18 U.S.C. § 3563(b), but failed to make
a corresponding change in the referenced paragraphs under 18 U.S.C. § 3563(a)(2).
Accordingly, the conditions now referenced are restitution ((b)(2)), notice to victims
pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3555 ((b)(3)), and an order that the defendant reside, or refrain
from residing, in a specified place or area ((b)(13)).".
Reason for Amendment: The purposes of this amendment are twofold. First, the amendment
revises the pertinent guidelines to reflect statutorily required conditions of probation and
supervised release added by Section 203 of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act
of 1996, Pub. L. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1227, and other laws. Second, the amendment revises
§§5B1.3 (Conditions of Probation), 5B1.4 (Recommended Conditions of Probation and
Supervised Release), and 5D1.3 (Conditions of Supervised Release) so as to better distinguish
among the statutorily required, standard, and special conditions of probation and supervised
release. Section 5B1.4 has been eliminated. Provisions of §5B1.4 relating to recommended
conditions of probation have been incorporated into §5B1.3, and provisions of §5B1.4 relating

Amendment 570 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003
– 538 –
"Application Notes:
1. A defendant who qualifies under §5C1.2 (Applicability of Statutory Minimum
Sentence in Certain Cases) is not subject to any statutory minimum sentence of
supervised release. See 18 U.S.C. § 3553(f). In such a case, the term of
supervised release shall be determined under subsection (a).
2. Upon motion of the Government, a defendant who has provided substantial
assistance in the investigation or prosecution of another person who has
committed an offense may be sentenced to a term of supervised release that is
less than any minimum required by statute or the guidelines. See 18 U.S.C. §
3553(e), §5K1.1 (Substantial Assistance to Authorities).".
The Commentary to §5C1.2 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by inserting after Note
8 the following additional note:
"9. A defendant who meets the criteria under this section is exempt from any
otherwise applicable statutory minimum sentence of imprisonment and statutory
minimum term of supervised release.".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment amends §5D1.2 (Term of Supervised Release) to
make clear that a defendant who qualifies under the "safety valve" (§5C1.2, 18 U.S.C.
§ 3553(f)), or who is the beneficiary of a Government substantial assistance motion under 18
U.S.C. § 3553(e), is not subject to any statutory minimum term of supervised release. This
issue has arisen in a number of hotline calls. This amendment also clarifies that the
requirement in subsection (a), with respect to the length of a term of supervised release, is
subject to the requirement in subsection (b) that the term be not less than any statutorily
required term of supervised release.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1997.
571. Amendment: Chapter Five, Part E, Subpart 1 is amended by deleting §5E1.1 in its entirety
as follows:
"§5E1.1. Restitution
(a) The court shall --
(1) enter a restitution order if such order is authorized under
18 U.S.C. §§ 3663-3664; or
(2) if a restitution order would be authorized under
18 U.S.C. §§ 3663-3664, except for the fact that the
offense of conviction is not an offense set forth in Title
18, United States Code, or 49 U.S.C. § 46312, § 46502,

(b) Provided, that the provisions of subsection (a) do not apply
when full restitution has been made, or to the extent the court
determines that the complication and prolongation of the
sentencing process resulting from the fashioning of a restitution
requirement outweighs the need to provide restitution to any
victims through the criminal process.
(c) If a defendant is ordered to make restitution and to pay a fine,
the court shall order that any money paid by the defendant shall
first be applied to satisfy the order of restitution.
(d) With the consent of the victim of the offense, the court may
order a defendant to perform services for the benefit of the
victim in lieu of monetary restitution or in conjunction therewith.
18 U.S.C. § 3663(b)(4).
Commentary
Application Note:
1. In the case of a conviction under certain statutes, additional requirements
regarding restitution apply. See 18 U.S.C. §§ 2248 and 2259 (applying
to convictions under 18 U.S.C. §§ 2241-2258 for sexual-abuse offenses
and sexual exploitation of minors); 18 U.S.C. § 2327 (applying to
convictions under 18 U.S.C. §§ 1028-1029, 1341-1344 for telemarketing-
fraud offenses); 18 U.S.C. § 2264 (applying to convictions under
18 U.S.C. §§ 2261-2262 for domestic-violence offenses). To the extent
that any of the above-noted statutory provisions conflict with the
provisions of this guideline, the applicable statutory provision shall
control.
Background: Section 3553(a)(7) of Title 18 requires the court, ‘in determining
the particular sentence to be imposed,’ to consider ‘the need to provide restitution
to any victims of the offense.’ Section 3556 of Title 18 authorizes the court to
impose restitution in accordance with 18 U.S.C. §§ 3663 and 3664, which
authorize restitution for violations of Title 18 or 49 U.S.C. § 46312, § 46502, or
§ 46504. For other offenses, restitution may be imposed as a condition of
probation or supervised release. See 18 U.S.C. § 3563(b)(3) as amended by
Section 7110 of Pub. L. No. 100-690 (1988).
A court’s authority to decline to order restitution is limited. Subsection
(a)(1) of this guideline requires the court to order restitution for offenses under
Title 18, United States Code, or 49 U.S.C. § 46312, § 46502, or § 46504, unless
full restitution has already been made or ‘the court determines that the
complication and prolongation of the sentencing process resulting from the
fashioning of an order of restitution . . . outweighs the need to provide restitution
to any victims.’ 18 U.S.C. § 3663(d). The legislative history of 18 U.S.C. §
3579, the precursor of 18 U.S.C. § 3663, states that even ‘[i]n those unusual
Amendment 571 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003
– 540 –
cases where the precise amount owed is difficult to determine, the section
authorizes the court to reach an expeditious, reasonable determination of
appropriate restitution by resolving uncertainties with a view toward achieving
fairness to the victim.’ S. Rep. No. 532, 97th Cong., 2d Sess. 31, reprinted in
1982 U.S. Code Cong. & Ad. News 2515, 2537. If the court does not order
restitution, or orders only partial restitution, it must state its reasons for doing so.
18 U.S.C. § 3553(c). Subsection (a)(2) provides for restitution as a condition of
probation or supervised release for offenses not set forth in Title 18, United
States Code, or 49 U.S.C. § 46312, § 46502, or § 46504.
In determining whether to impose an order of restitution, and the amount
of restitution, the court shall consider the amount of loss the victim suffered as
a result of the offense, the financial resources of the defendant, the financial
needs of the defendant and his dependents, and other factors the court deems
appropriate. 18 U.S.C. § 3664(a).
Pursuant to Rule 32(b)(4)(D), Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the
probation officer’s presentence investigation report must contain a victim impact
statement. That report must contain information about the financial impact on
the victim and the defendant’s financial condition. The sentencing judge may
base findings on the presentence report or other testimony or evidence supported
by a preponderance of the evidence. 18 U.S.C. § 3664(d).
Unless the court orders otherwise, restitution must be made immediately.
18 U.S.C. § 3663(f)(3). The court may permit the defendant to make restitution
within a specified period or in specified installments, provided that the last
installment is paid not later than the expiration of probation, five years after the
end of the defendant’s term of imprisonment, or in any other case five years after
the date of sentencing. 18 U.S.C. § 3663(f)(1) and (2). The restitution order
should specify the manner in which, and the persons to whom, payment is to be
made.".
A replacement guideline with accompanying commentary is inserted as §5E1.1 (Restitution).
Chapter Eight, Part B, Subpart 1 is amended by deleting §8B1.1 in its entirety as follows:
"§8B1.1. Restitution - Organizations
(a) The court shall --
(1) enter a restitution order if such order is authorized under
18 U.S.C. §§ 3663-3664; or
(2) if a restitution order would be authorized under
18 U.S.C. §§ 3663-3664, except for the fact that the
offense of conviction is not an offense set forth in Title
18, United States Code, or 49 U.S.C. § 1472(h), (i), (j),
or (n), sentence the organization to probation with a
November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I Amendment 572
– 541 –
condition requiring restitution.
(b) Provided, that the provisions of subsection (a) do not
apply when the organization has made full restitution, or
to the extent the court determines that the complication
and prolongation of the sentencing process resulting
from the fashioning of a restitution requirement
outweighs the need to provide restitution to any victims
through the criminal process.
Commentary
Background: This guideline provides for restitution either as a sentence under
18 U.S.C. §§ 3663-3664 or as a condition of probation.".
A replacement guideline with accompanying commentary is inserted as §8B1.1 (Restitution -
Organizations).
Reason for Amendment: This amendment conforms the provisions of §§5E1.1 and 8B1.1 to
section 204 of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, Pub. L. 104-132, 110
Stat. 1227, which includes procedures for payment of full restitution to a victim of the offense.
The amendment also implements the directive to the Commission in section 205 of the Act to
issue guidelines to assist courts in determining an appropriate amount of "community
restitution" when the defendant is convicted of certain drug offenses and there is no identifiable
victim of the offense. As a starting point, the Commission has elected to issue a guideline that
permits broad court discretion to determine an amount of community restitution not exceeding
the fine imposed. Over time, the Commission intends to evaluate and refine this guideline in
light of sentencing experience.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1997.
572. Amendment: Section §5E1.2(b) is amended by deleting "Except as provided in subsections
(f) and (i) below, or otherwise required by statute, the fine imposed shall be within the range"
and inserting in lieu thereof "The applicable fine guideline range is that".
Section 5E1.2(c)(1) is amended by inserting "guideline" after "fine".
Section 5E1.2(c)(2) is amended by inserting "guideline" after "fine".
Section 5E1.2(d) is amended in subdivision (6) by deleting "and"; by redesignating subdivision
(7) as subdivision (8); and by inserting after subdivision (6) the following new subdivision (7):
"(7) the expected costs to the government of any term of probation, or term of
imprisonment and term of supervised release imposed; and".
Section 5E1.2 is amended by deleting "(e)"; by redesignating subsections (f), (g), and (h) as
subsections (e), (f), and (g) respectively; and by deleting:
Amendment 572 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003
– 542 –
"(i) Notwithstanding of the provisions of subsection (c) of this section, but subject
to the provisions of subsection (f) herein, the court shall impose an additional
fine amount that is at least sufficient to pay the costs to the government of any
imprisonment, probation, or supervised release ordered.".
The Commentary to §5E1.2 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 6 by deleting
"§5E1.2" and inserting in lieu thereof "this section".
The Commentary to §5E1.2 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 7 by deleting:
"Subsection (i) provides for an additional fine sufficient to pay the costs of any imprisonment,
probation, or supervised release ordered, subject to the defendant’s ability to pay as prescribed
in subsection (f). In making a determination as to the amount of any fine to be imposed under
this provision,"
and inserting in lieu thereof "In considering subsection (d)(7),".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment indirectly addresses a circuit court conflict
regarding whether a court may impose a fine for costs of imprisonment and/or supervision
when it has not imposed any punitive fine. Compare, United States v. Labat, 915 F.2d 603
(10th Cir. 1990)(requiring imposition of punitive fine before costs of imprisonment fine can
be imposed) with United States v. Sellers, 42 F.3d 116 (2d Cir. 1994)(not requiring imposition
of punitive fine before ordering costs of imprisonment fine), cert. denied, 116 S.Ct. 93 (1995).
Recognizing that a fine for costs of imprisonment and/or supervision is not statutorily required
and rarely is imposed, the Commission has elected to dispense with the requirement that courts
determine a separate, additional fine for such costs. Instead, the amendment provides that the
court shall take such costs into consideration in determining the appropriate amount of a
punitive fine.
Because, under the amended procedure, it no longer will be necessary to determine a separate
fine increment for costs associated with implementing the sentence, the issue on which the
circuit courts have differed should not arise. This procedure also should substantially simplify
fine calculations, thereby allowing court and probation officer resources to be used more
efficiently and productively.
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1997.
573. Amendment: The Commentary to §5E1.3 captioned "Background" is amended by deleting
the entire text as follows:
"Background: The Victims of Crime Act of 1984, Pub. L. No. 98-473, Title II, Chap.
XIV, requires the courts to impose special assessments on convicted defendants for the
purpose of funding the Crime Victims Fund established by the same legislation. Monies
deposited in the fund are awarded to the states by the Attorney General for victim
assistance and compensation programs. Under the Victims of Crime Act, as amended
by Section 7085 of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988, the court is required to impose
assessments in the following amounts with respect to offenses committed on or after

Amendment 575 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003
– 550 –
The Commentary to §2G2.2 captioned "Statutory Provisions" is amended by deleting
"2258(a), (b)" and inserting in lieu thereof "2260".
Section 2K2.1(a)(3) is amended by inserting "felony" before "prior".
Reason for Amendment: This amendment makes Appendix A (Statutory Index) more
comprehensive. This amendment adds references for additional offenses, including
offenses created by recently enacted legislation. In addition, this amendment revises
Appendix A to conform to the revision of existing statutes and to reflect the codification
of Title 49, United States Code. This amendment also corrects clerical errors in §§2G2.1
and 2G2.2.
Finally, this amendment corrects a clerical error in §2K2.1(a)(3), as amended by
amendment 522, effective November 1, 1995. During the execution of that amendment,
which equalized offense levels for semiautomatic assault weapon possession with
machinegun possession, the word "felony" was inadvertently omitted from the phrase
"prior conviction" in subsection (a)(3).
Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1997.
