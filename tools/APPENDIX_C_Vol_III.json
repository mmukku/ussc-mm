[{"Id":663,"Title":"Amendment 663","Text":"The Commentary to §2A1.1 captioned \"Application Notes\" is amended by\r\nstriking Notes 1 and 2 as follows:\r\n\"1. The Commission has concluded that in the absence of capital punishment\r\nlife imprisonment is the appropriate punishment for premeditated killing.\r\nHowever, this guideline also applies when death results from the\r\ncommission of certain felonies. Life imprisonment is not necessarily\r\nappropriate in all such situations. For example, if in robbing a bank, the\r\ndefendant merely passed a note to the teller, as a result of which she had a\r\nheart attack and died, a sentence of life imprisonment clearly would not be\r\nappropriate.\r\nIf the defendant did not cause the death intentionally or knowingly, a\r\ndownward departure may be warranted. The extent of the departure should\r\nbe based upon the defendant’s state of mind (e.g., recklessness or\r\nnegligence), the degree of risk inherent in the conduct, and the nature of the\r\nunderlying offense conduct. However, the Commission does not envision\r\nthat departure below that specified in §2A1.2 (Second Degree Murder) is\r\nlikely to be appropriate. Also, because death obviously is an aggravating\r\nfactor, it necessarily would be inappropriate to impose a sentence at a level\r\nbelow that which the guideline for the underlying offense requires in the\r\nabsence of death.\r\n\r\n2. If the defendant is convicted under 21 U.S.C. § 848(e), a sentence of death\r\nmay be imposed under the specific provisions contained in that statute.\r\nThis guideline applies when a sentence of death is not imposed.\",\r\nand inserting the following:\r\n\"1. Applicability of Guideline.—This guideline applies in cases of\r\npremeditated killing. This guideline also applies when death results from\r\nthe commission of certain felonies. For example, this guideline may be\r\napplied as a result of a cross reference (e.g., a kidnapping in which death\r\noccurs), or in cases in which the offense level of a guideline is calculated\r\nusing the underlying crime (e.g., murder in aid of racketeering).\r\n2. Imposition of Life Sentence.—\r\n(A) Offenses Involving Premeditated Killing.—In the case of\r\npremeditated killing, life imprisonment is the appropriate sentence\r\nif a sentence of death is not imposed. A downward departure\r\nwould not be appropriate in such a case. A downward departure\r\nfrom a mandatory statutory term of life imprisonment is\r\npermissible only in cases in which the government files a motion\r\nfor a downward departure for the defendant’s substantial\r\nassistance, as provided in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(e).\r\n(B) Felony Murder.—If the defendant did not cause the death\r\nintentionally or knowingly, a downward departure may be\r\nwarranted. For example, a downward departure may be warranted\r\nif in robbing a bank, the defendant merely passed a note to the\r\nteller, as a result of which the teller had a heart attack and died.\r\nThe extent of the departure should be based upon the defendant’s\r\nstate of mind (e.g., recklessness or negligence), the degree of risk\r\ninherent in the conduct, and the nature of the underlying offense\r\nconduct. However, departure below the minimum guideline\r\nsentence provided for second degree murder in §2A1.2 (Second\r\nDegree Murder) is not likely to be appropriate. Also, because\r\ndeath obviously is an aggravating factor, it necessarily would be\r\ninappropriate to impose a sentence at a level below that which the\r\nguideline for the underlying offense requires in the absence of\r\ndeath.\r\n3. Applicability of Guideline When Death Sentence Not Imposed.—If the\r\ndefendant is sentenced pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3591 et seq. or 21 U.S.C.\r\n§ 848(e), a sentence of death may be imposed under the specific provisions\r\ncontained in that statute. This guideline applies when a sentence of death\r\nis not imposed under those specific provisions.\".\r\nSection 2A1.2(a) is amended by striking \"33\" and inserting \"38\".\r\nSection 2A1.2 is amended by striking the commentary captioned \"Background\" as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Background: The maximum term of imprisonment authorized by statute for\r\nsecond degree murder is life.\",\r\nand inserting the following:\r\n\"Application Note:\r\n1.

The term thus\r\n\r\nincludes all, or nearly all, convictions for involuntary manslaughter under\r\n18 U.S.C. § 1112. A homicide resulting from driving, or similarly\r\ndangerous actions, while under the influence of alcohol or drugs ordinarily\r\nshould be treated as reckless.\r\n2. ‘Criminally negligent’ refers to conduct that involves a gross deviation\r\nfrom the standard of care that a reasonable person would exercise under the\r\ncircumstances, but which is not reckless.

Definitions.—For purposes of this guideline:\r\n‘Criminally negligent’ means conduct that involves a gross deviation from\r\nthe standard of care that a reasonable person would exercise under the\r\ncircumstances, but which is not reckless. Offenses with this characteristic\r\nusually will be encountered as assimilative crimes.\r\n‘Means of transportation’ includes a motor vehicle (including an\r\nautomobile or a boat) and a mass transportation vehicle. ‘Mass\r\ntransportation’ has the meaning given that term in 18 U.S.C. § 1993(c)(5).\r\n‘Reckless’ means a situation in which the defendant was aware of the risk\r\ncreated by his conduct and the risk was of such a nature and degree that to\r\ndisregard that risk constituted a gross deviation from the standard of care\r\nthat a reasonable person would exercise in such a situation. ‘Reckless’\r\nincludes all, or nearly all, convictions for involuntary manslaughter under\r\n18 U.S.C. § 1112. A homicide resulting from driving a means of\r\ntransportation, or similarly dangerous actions, while under the influence of\r\nalcohol or drugs ordinarily should be treated as reckless.\".\r\nSection 2A1.5(a) is amended by striking \"28\" and inserting \"33\".\r\nSection 2A2.1(a) is amended in subdivision (1) by striking \"28\" and inserting \"33\"; and in\r\nsubdivision (2) by striking \"22\" and inserting \"27\".\r\nSection 2A2.1(b)(1) is amended by striking \"(A) If\" and inserting \"If (A)\"; and by striking\r\n\"if\" each place it appears.\r\nThe Commentary to §2A2.1 captioned \"Application Notes\" is amended by striking Notes\r\n1 through 3 as follows:\r\n\"1.

If the offense created a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury to\r\nmore than one person, an upward departure may be warranted.\",\r\nand inserting the following:\r\n\"1. Definitions.—For purposes of this guideline:\r\n‘First degree murder’ means conduct that, if committed within the special\r\nmaritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States, would constitute\r\nfirst degree murder under 18 U.S.C. § 1111.\r\n‘Permanent or life-threatening bodily injury’ and ‘serious bodily injury’\r\nhave the meaning given those terms in Application Note 1 of the\r\nCommentary to §1B1.1 (Application Instructions).\r\n2.

Conversely, the base offense level\r\ndoes not reflect the possibility that the defendant may create a substantial\r\nrisk of death or serious bodily injury to another person in the course of\r\n\r\nfleeing from a law enforcement official (although an offense under 18\r\nU.S.C. § 758 for fleeing or evading a law enforcement checkpoint at high\r\nspeed will often, but not always, involve the creation of that risk). If the\r\ndefendant creates that risk and no higher guideline adjustment is applicable\r\nfor the conduct creating the risk, apply §3C1.2 (Reckless Endangerment\r\nDuring Flight).\r\n2.

Application of Certain Chapter Three Adjustments.—The base offense\r\nlevel incorporates the fact that the victim was a governmental officer\r\nperforming official duties. Therefore, do not apply §3A1.2 (Official\r\nVictim) unless, pursuant to subsection (c), the offense level is determined\r\nunder §2A2.2 (Aggravated Assault). Conversely, the base offense level\r\ndoes not incorporate the possibility that the defendant may create a\r\nsubstantial risk of death or serious bodily injury to another person in the\r\ncourse of fleeing from a law enforcement official (although an offense\r\nunder 18 U.S.C. § 758 for fleeing or evading a law enforcement checkpoint\r\nat high speed will often, but not always, involve the creation of that risk).\r\nIf the defendant creates that risk and no higher guideline adjustment is\r\napplicable for the conduct creating the risk, apply §3C1.2 (Reckless\r\nEndangerment During Flight).\".\r\nThe Commentary to §2A2.4 captioned \"Application Notes\" is amended in Note 3 by\r\ninserting \"Upward Departure Provision.—\" before \"The base\".\r\nThe Commentary to §2A2.4 captioned \"Background\" is amended by striking the last\r\nsentence as follows:\r\n\"The guideline has been drafted to provide offense levels that are identical to those\r\notherwise provided for assaults involving an official victim; when no assault is\r\ninvolved, the offense level is 6.\".\r\nSection 3A1.2 is amended by striking:\r\n\"§3A1.2.

Upward Departure Provision.—If the official victim is an exceptionally\r\nhigh-level official, such as the President or the Vice President of the United\r\nStates, an upward departure may be warranted due to the potential\r\ndisruption of the governmental function.\".","Reason":"Reason for Amendment: This amendment increases the base offense levels for the\r\nhomicide and manslaughter guidelines to address longstanding proportionality concerns and\r\nnew proportionality issues prompted by changes to other Chapter Two guidelines pursuant\r\nto the Prosecutorial Remedies and Other Tools to end the Exploitation of Children Today\r\nAct of 2003, Pub. L. 108–21 (the \"PROTECT Act\"). It also amends the assault guidelines\r\nand the adjustment at §3A1.2 (Official Victim) to implement the directive in section\r\n11008(e) of the 21st Century Department of Justice Appropriations Authorization Act, Pub.\r\nL. 107–273 (the \"Act\").\r\nFirst, this amendment makes a number of changes to the homicide guidelines. The\r\namendment revises the commentary in guideline §2A1.1 (First Degree Murder) and deletes\r\noutdated language. One effect of this revision is to clarify that a downward departure from\r\na mandatory statutory sentence of life imprisonment is permissible only in cases in which\r\n\r\nthe government files a motion for a downward departure for the defendant’s substantial\r\nassistance, as provided in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(e).\r\nIn addition, the Commission received public comment that the guideline penalties for all\r\nhomicides, other than for first degree murder, were inadequate and in need of review. An\r\nexamination of the homicide and manslaughter guidelines also was prompted by section 104\r\nof the PROTECT Act, which directed the Commission to increase the base offense level for\r\n§2A4.1 (Kidnapping, Abduction, Unlawful Restraint). The Commission increased the base\r\noffense level for kidnapping by eight levels, from base offense level 24 to base offense level\r\n32, effective May 30, 2003. This increase brought kidnapping without injury to within one\r\nlevel of the base offense of level 33 for second degree murder. The Commission examined\r\ndata on second degree murder offenses and found that in 2002, courts departed upward from\r\nthe guideline range in 34.3% of the cases. The Commission also received public comment\r\nexpressing concern that an individual convicted of second degree murder who accepted\r\nresponsibility might serve as little as eight years’ imprisonment. By increasing the base\r\noffense level in §2A1.2 (Second Degree Murder) to level 38, the Commission has\r\nestablished an approximate 20-year sentence of imprisonment for second degree murder.\r\nData also showed a high level of upward departure sentences for some other homicide\r\noffenses, such as voluntary manslaughter, which had a 28.6% upward departure rate in 2002.\r\nBased upon such indications that the sentences may be inadequate for these offenses, the\r\nCommission increased the base offense levels of many of the homicide guidelines to punish\r\nthem more appropriately and with an eye toward restoring the proportionality found in the\r\noriginal guidelines. For example, the original base offense level of 28 for attempted first\r\ndegree murder, §2A2.1 (Assault with Intent to Commit Murder; Attempted Murder) is five\r\nlevels lower than the original base offense level of level 33 for second degree murder. In\r\nthis amendment, the five-level increase from a base offense level of level 28 to level 33 for\r\nattempted first degree murder mirrors the five-level increase for second degree murder from\r\noffense level of level 33 to level 38 and maintains the five-level difference that exists\r\nbetween the two. The amendment increases the base offense levels in the guidelines for\r\n§§2A1.2, 2A1.3 (Voluntary Manslaughter), 2A1.5 (Conspiracy or Solicitation to Commit\r\nMurder), and 2A2.1.\r\nAdditionally, the amendment adds a third alternative base offense level in §2A1.4\r\n(Involuntary Manslaughter) of level 22 for reckless involuntary manslaughter offenses that\r\ninvolved the reckless operation of a means of transportation. This new offense level\r\ncompletes work undertaken in the previous amendment cycle to address disparities between\r\nfederal and state sentences for vehicular manslaughter and to account for the 1994 increase\r\nin the statutory maximum term of imprisonment from three to six years. The new alternative\r\noffense level focusing on the reckless operation of a means of transportation addresses\r\nconcerns raised by some members of Congress and comports with a recommendation from\r\nthe Commission’s Native American Advisory Group that vehicular manslaughter involving\r\nalcohol or drugs should be sentenced at offense level 22. The amendment also adds a\r\nspecial instruction to apply §3D1.2 (Groups of Closely Related Counts) as if there had been\r\na separate count of conviction for each victim in cases in which more than one victim died.\r\nThe purpose of the instruction is to ensure an incremental increase in punishment for single\r\ncount offenses involving multiple victims.\r\nSecond, this amendment makes a number of changes to the assault guidelines and the\r\n\r\nAmendment 664 APPENDIX C - VOLUME III November 1, 2011\r\nChapter Three adjustment relating to official victims, to implement the congressional\r\ndirective and the changes in statutory maximum terms of imprisonment in the 21st Century\r\nDepartment of Justice Appropriations Authorization Act. The Act increased the statutory\r\nmaximum term of imprisonment for a number of offenses against current or former officers\r\nor employees of the United States, including Federal judges and magistrate judges, their\r\nfamilies, or persons assisting in the performance of those official duties, or offenses\r\ncommitted on account of those duties. In response to the directive, the Commission added\r\na new specific offense characteristic in §2A2.2 (Aggravated Assault) to provide a two-level\r\nincrease if the defendant was convicted under 18 U.S.C. § 111(b) or § 115. The\r\nCommission also amended the guideline to decrease the base offense level from level 15 to\r\nlevel 14, based upon information received from the Native American Advisory Group and\r\nstudies indicating that federal aggravated assault sentences generally are more severe than\r\nmany state aggravated assault sentences. To ensure that individuals who cause bodily injury\r\nto victims do not benefit from this decrease in the base offense level, the specific offense\r\ncharacteristics addressing degrees of bodily injury each were increased by one level. To\r\nmaintain proportionality, reflect increased statutory penalties, and comply with the directive,\r\nthe two non-aggravated assault guidelines also were amended. For §2A2.3 (Minor Assault),\r\nthe alternative base offense levels each were increased by one level, a specific offense\r\ncharacteristic was added to provide a two-level enhancement if the victim sustained bodily\r\ninjury, and a cross-reference to §2A2.2 was added. Similarly, §2A2.4 (Obstructing or\r\nImpeding Officers) was amended by increasing the base offense level to level 10, and by\r\nadding a specific offense characteristic providing a two-level increase if the victim sustained\r\nbodily injury.\r\nThe amendment restructures §3A1.2 (Official Victim) and provides a two-tiered adjustment.\r\nThe amendment maintains the three-level adjustment for offenses motivated by the status\r\nof the official victim, but increases the adjustment to six levels if that defendant’s offense\r\nguideline was from Chapter Two, Part A (Offenses Against the Person). For example, a\r\nthreat against a federal judge sentenced pursuant to §2A6.1 (Threatening or Harassing\r\nCommunications) that is calculated at base offense level 12 could have received, before this\r\namendment, a three-level enhancement under §3A1.2, which would have resulted in an\r\nadjusted offense level of level 15 and a guideline range of 18 to 24 months. Under this\r\namendment, the defendant could receive a six-level adjustment, resulting in an enhanced\r\noffense level of level 18 and a guideline range of 27 to 33 months. The six level\r\nenhancement also applies to assaultive conduct against law enforcement officers or prison\r\nofficials if the defendant committed the assault in a manner creating a substantial risk of\r\nserious bodily injury. This increase comports with the directive in the Act to \"ensure\r\npunishment at or near the maximum penalty for the most egregious conduct covered by the\r\noffense\" for offenses against federal officers, officials and employees.","EffectiveDate":"Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2004."},{"Id":664,"Title":"Amendment 664","Text":"Section 2A3.1(a) is amended by striking \"27\" and inserting \"30\".\r\nSection 2A3.1(b)(1) is amended by striking \"was committed by the means set forth\" and\r\ninserting \"involved conduct described\".\r\nSection 2A3.1(b)(6) is amended by striking \"Internet-access device\" and inserting\r\n\"interactive computer service\".\r\n\r\nSection 2A3.1(c) is amended in the heading by striking \"Cross Reference\" and inserting\r\n\"Cross References\".\r\nSection 2A3.1(c)(1) is amended by inserting \", if the resulting offense level is greater than\r\nthat determined above\" after \"Murder)\".\r\nSection 2A3.1(c) is amended by adding at the end the following:\r\n\"(2) If the offense involved causing, transporting, permitting, or offering or\r\nseeking by notice or advertisement, a minor to engage in sexually explicit\r\nconduct for the purpose of producing a visual depiction of such conduct,\r\napply §2G2.1 (Sexually Exploiting a Minor by Production of Sexually\r\nExplicit Visual or Printed Material; Custodian Permitting Minor to Engage\r\nin Sexually Explicit Conduct; Advertisement for Minors to Engage in\r\nProduction), if the resulting offense level is greater than that determined\r\nabove.\".\r\nSection 2A3.1(d)(1) is amended by striking \"a correctional facility and the victim was a\r\ncorrections employee\" and inserting \"the custody or control of a prison or other correctional\r\nfacility and the victim was a prison official\"; and by striking \"(a)\" and inserting \"(c)(2)\".\r\nThe Commentary to §2A3.1 captioned \"Application Notes\" is amended by striking Notes\r\n1 through 3 as follows:\r\n\"1.

For such cases, the Commission recommends a downward\r\ndeparture to the equivalent of an offense level of level 6.\".\r\nChapter Two, Part G, Subpart 1 is amended by striking §2G1.1 and its accompanying\r\ncommentary as follows:\r\n\"§2G1.1. Promoting A Commercial Sex Act or Prohibited Sexual Conduct\r\n\r\n(a) Base Offense Level:\r\n(1) 19, if the offense involved a minor; or\r\n(2) 14, otherwise.\r\n(b) Specific Offense Characteristics\r\n(1) If the offense involved (A) a commercial sex act;\r\nand (B) the use of physical force, fraud, or\r\ncoercion, increase by 4 levels.\r\n(2) If the offense involved a victim who had (A) not\r\nattained the age of 12 years, increase by 4 levels;\r\nor (B) attained the age of 12 years but not attained\r\nthe age of 16 years, increase by 2 levels.\r\n(3) If subsection (b)(2) applies; and—\r\n(A) the defendant was a parent, relative, or\r\nlegal guardian of the victim; or\r\n(B) the victim was otherwise in the custody,\r\ncare, or supervisory control of the\r\ndefendant,\r\nincrease by 2 levels.\r\n(4) If subsection (b)(3) does not apply; and—\r\n(A) the offense involved the knowing\r\nmisrepresentation of a participant’s\r\nidentity to persuade, induce, entice,\r\ncoerce, or facilitate the travel of, a minor\r\nto engage in a commercial sex act; or\r\n(B) a participant otherwise unduly influenced\r\na minor to engage in a commercial sex\r\nact,\r\nincrease by 2 levels.\r\n(5) If a computer or an Internet-access device was\r\nused to (A) persuade, induce, entice, coerce, or\r\nfacilitate the travel of, a minor to engage in a\r\ncommercial sex act; or (B) entice, encourage,\r\noffer, or solicit a person to engage in prohibited\r\nsexual conduct with a minor, increase by 2 levels.\r\n\r\n(c) Cross References\r\n(1) If the offense involved causing, transporting,\r\npermitting, or offering or seeking by notice or\r\nadvertisement, a person less than 18 years of age\r\nto engage in sexually explicit conduct for the\r\npurpose of producing a visual depiction of such\r\nconduct, apply §2G2.1 (Sexually Exploiting a\r\nMinor by Production of Sexually Explicit Visual\r\nor Printed Material; Custodian Permitting Minor\r\nto Engage in Sexually Explicit Conduct;\r\nAdvertisement for Minors to Engage in\r\nProduction).\r\n(2) If the offense involved criminal sexual abuse,\r\nattempted criminal sexual abuse, or assault with\r\nintent to commit criminal sexual abuse, apply\r\n§2A3.1 (Criminal Sexual Abuse; Attempt to\r\nCommit Criminal Sexual Abuse). If the offense\r\ninvolved criminal sexual abuse of a minor who\r\nhad not attained the age of 12 years, §2A3.1 shall\r\napply, regardless of the ‘consent’ of the victim.\r\n(3) If the offense did not involve promoting a\r\ncommercial sex act, and neither subsection (c)(1)\r\nnor (c)(2) is applicable, apply §2A3.2 (Criminal\r\nSexual Abuse of a Minor Under the Age of\r\nSixteen Years (Statutory Rape) or Attempt to\r\nCommit Such Acts) or §2A3.4 (Abusive Sexual\r\nContact or Attempt to Commit Abusive Sexual\r\nContact), as appropriate.\r\n(d) Special Instruction\r\n(1) If the offense involved more than one victim,\r\nChapter Three, Part D (Multiple Counts) shall be\r\napplied as if the promoting of a commercial sex\r\nact or prohibited sexual conduct in respect to each\r\nvictim had been contained in a separate count of\r\nconviction.\r\nCommentary\r\nStatutory Provisions: 8 U.S.C. § 1328; 18 U.S.C. §§ 1591, 2421, 2422, 2423(a),\r\n2425.\r\nApplication Notes:\r\n\r\n1. For purposes of this guideline—\r\n‘Commercial sex act’ has the meaning given that term in 18 U.S.C.\r\n§ 1591(c)(1).\r\n‘Minor’ means an individual who had not attained the age of 18 years.\r\n‘Participant’ has the meaning given that term in Application Note 1 of\r\n§3B1.1 (Aggravating Role).\r\n‘Prohibited sexual conduct’ has the meaning given that term in Application\r\nNote 1 of §2A3.1 (Criminal Sexual Abuse; Attempt to Commit Criminal\r\nSexual Abuse).\r\n‘Promoting a commercial sex act’ means persuading, inducing, enticing, or\r\ncoercing a person to engage in a commercial sex act, or to travel to engage\r\nin, a commercial sex act.\r\n‘Victim’ means a person transported, persuaded, induced, enticed, or\r\ncoerced to engage in, or travel for the purpose of engaging in, a commercial\r\nsex act or prohibited sexual conduct, whether or not the person consented\r\nto the commercial sex act or prohibited sexual conduct. Accordingly,\r\n‘victim’ may include an undercover law enforcement officer.\r\n2. Subsection (b)(1) provides an enhancement for physical force, fraud, or\r\ncoercion, that occurs as part of a commercial sex act offense and anticipates\r\nno bodily injury. If bodily injury results, an upward departure may be\r\nwarranted. See Chapter Five, Part K (Departures). For purposes of\r\nsubsection (b)(1)(B), ‘coercion’ includes any form of conduct that negates\r\nthe voluntariness of the behavior of the victim. This enhancement would\r\napply, for example, in a case in which the ability of the victim to appraise\r\nor control conduct was substantially impaired by drugs or alcohol. In the\r\ncase of an adult victim, rather than a victim less than 18 years of age, this\r\ncharacteristic generally will not apply if the drug or alcohol was voluntarily\r\ntaken.\r\n3. For the purposes of §3B1.1 (Aggravating Role), a victim, as defined in this\r\nguideline, is considered a participant only if that victim assisted in the\r\npromoting of a commercial sex act or prohibited sexual conduct in respect\r\nto another victim.\r\n4. For the purposes of Chapter Three, Part D (Multiple Counts), each person\r\ntransported, persuaded, induced, enticed, or coerced to engage in, or travel\r\nto engage in, a commercial sex act or prohibited sexual conduct is to be\r\ntreated as a separate victim. Consequently, multiple counts involving more\r\nthan one victim are not to be grouped together under §3D1.2 (Groups of\r\nClosely-Related Counts). In addition, subsection (d)(1) directs that if the\r\nrelevant conduct of an offense of conviction includes the promoting of a\r\ncommercial sex act or prohibited sexual conduct in respect to more than\r\n\r\none victim, whether specifically cited in the count of conviction, each such\r\nvictim shall be treated as if contained in a separate count of conviction.\r\n5. Subsection (b)(3) is intended to have broad application and includes\r\noffenses involving a victim less than 18 years of age entrusted to the\r\ndefendant, whether temporarily or permanently. For example, teachers, day\r\ncare providers, baby-sitters, or other temporary caretakers are among those\r\nwho would be subject to this enhancement. In determining whether to\r\napply this enhancement, the court should look to the actual relationship that\r\nexisted between the defendant and the victim and not simply to the legal\r\nstatus of the defendant-victim relationship.\r\n6. If the enhancement in subsection (b)(3) applies, do not apply subsection\r\n(b)(4) or §3B1.3 (Abuse of Position of Trust or Use of Special Skill).\r\n7. The enhancement in subsection (b)(4)(A) applies in cases involving the\r\nmisrepresentation of a participant’s identity to persuade, induce, entice,\r\ncoerce, or facilitate the travel of, a minor to engage in a commercial sex act.\r\nSubsection (b)(4)(A) is intended to apply only to misrepresentations made\r\ndirectly to a minor or to a person who exercises custody, care, or\r\nsupervisory control of the minor. Accordingly, the enhancement in\r\nsubsection (b)(4)(A) would not apply to a misrepresentation made by a\r\nparticipant to an airline representative in the course of making travel\r\narrangements for the minor.\r\nThe misrepresentation to which the enhancement in subsection (b)(4)(A)\r\nmay apply includes misrepresentation of a participant’s name, age,\r\noccupation, gender, or status, as long as the misrepresentation was made\r\nwith the intent to persuade, induce, entice, coerce, or facilitate the travel of,\r\na minor to engage in a commercial sex act. Accordingly, use of a computer\r\nscreen name, without such intent, would not be a sufficient basis for\r\napplication of the enhancement.\r\nIn determining whether subsection (b)(4)(B) applies, the court should\r\nclosely consider the facts of the case to determine whether a participant’s\r\ninfluence over the minor compromised the voluntariness of the minor’s\r\nbehavior.\r\nIn a case in which a participant is at least 10 years older than the minor,\r\nthere shall be a rebuttable presumption, for purposes of subsection\r\n(b)(4)(B), that such participant unduly influenced the minor to engage in a\r\ncommercial sex act. In such a case, some degree of undue influence can be\r\npresumed because of the substantial difference in age between the\r\nparticipant and the minor.\r\n8. Subsection (b)(5) provides an enhancement if a computer or an Internet-\r\naccess device was used to (A) persuade, induce, entice, coerce, or facilitate\r\nthe travel of, a minor to engage in a commercial sex act; or (B) entice,\r\nencourage, offer, or solicit a person to engage in prohibited sexual conduct\r\n\r\nwith a minor. Subsection (b)(5)(A) is intended to apply only to the use of\r\na computer or an Internet-access device to communicate directly with a\r\nminor or with a person who exercises custody, care, or supervisory control\r\nof the minor. Accordingly, the enhancement in subsection (b)(5)(A) would\r\nnot apply to the use of a computer or an Internet-access device to obtain\r\nairline tickets for the minor from an airline’s Internet site.\r\n9. The cross reference in subsection (c)(1) is to be construed broadly to\r\ninclude all instances in which the offense involved employing, using,\r\npersuading, inducing, enticing, coercing, transporting, permitting, or\r\noffering or seeking by notice or advertisement, a person less than 18 years\r\nof age to engage in sexually explicit conduct for the purpose of producing\r\nany visual depiction of such conduct. For purposes of subsection (c)(1),\r\n‘sexually explicit conduct’ has the meaning given that term in 18 U.S.C.\r\n§ 2256.\r\n10. Subsection (c)(2) provides a cross reference to §2A3.1 (Criminal Sexual\r\nAbuse; Attempt to Commit Criminal Sexual Abuse) if the offense involved\r\ncriminal sexual abuse or attempt to commit criminal sexual abuse, as\r\ndefined in 18 U.S.C. § 2241 or § 2242. For example, the cross reference\r\nto §2A3.1 shall apply if the offense involved criminal sexual abuse; and (A)\r\nthe victim had not attained the age of 12 years (see 18 U.S.C. § 2241(c));\r\n(B) the victim had attained the age of 12 years but had not attained the age\r\nof 16 years, and was placed in fear of death, serious bodily injury, or\r\nkidnapping (see 18 U.S.C. § 2241(a),(c)); or (C) the victim was threatened\r\nor placed in fear other than fear of death, serious bodily injury, or\r\nkidnapping (see 18 U.S.C. § 2242(1)).\r\n11. The cross reference in subsection (c)(3) addresses the case in which the\r\noffense did not involve promoting a commercial sex act, neither subsection\r\n(c)(1) nor (c)(2) is applicable, and the offense involved prohibited sexual\r\nconduct other than the conduct covered by subsection (c)(1) or (c)(2). In\r\nsuch case, the guideline for the underlying prohibited sexual conduct is to\r\nbe used; i.e., §2A3.2 (Criminal Sexual Abuse of a Minor Under the Age of\r\nSixteen Years (Statutory Rape) or Attempt to Commit Such Acts) or\r\n§2A3.4 (Abusive Sexual Contact or Attempt to Commit Abusive Sexual\r\nContact).\r\n12. Upward Departure Provision.—An upward departure may be warranted if\r\nthe offense involved more than 10 victims.\r\nBackground: This guideline covers offenses under chapter 117 of title 18, United\r\nStates Code. Those offenses involve promoting prostitution or prohibited sexual\r\nconduct through a variety of means. Offenses that involve promoting prostitution\r\nunder chapter 117 of such title are sentenced under this guideline, unless other\r\nprohibited sexual conduct occurs as part of the prostitution offense, in which case\r\none of the cross references would apply. Offenses under chapter 117 of such title\r\nthat do not involve promoting prostitution are to be sentenced under §2G2.1\r\n(Sexually Exploiting a Minor by Production of Sexually Explicit Visual or Printed\r\n\r\nMaterial; Custodian Permitting Minor to Engage in Sexually Explicit Conduct;\r\nAdvertisement for Minors to Engage in Production), §2A3.1 (Criminal Sexual\r\nAbuse; Attempt to Commit Criminal Sexual Abuse), §2A3.2 (Criminal Sexual\r\nAbuse of a Minor Under the Age of Sixteen Years (Statutory Rape) or Attempt to\r\nCommit Such Acts) or §2A3.4 (Abusive Sexual Contact or Attempt to Commit\r\nAbusive Sexual Contact), as appropriate, pursuant to the cross references provided\r\nin subsection (c).\r\nThis guideline also covers offenses under section 1591 of title 18, United\r\nStates Code. These offenses involve recruiting or transporting a person in interstate\r\ncommerce knowing either that (1) force, fraud, or coercion will be used to cause the\r\nperson to engage in a commercial sex act; or (2) the person (A) had not attained the\r\nage of 18 years; and (B) will be caused to engage in a commercial sex act.\",\r\nand inserting the following:\r\n\"§2G1.1. Promoting a Commercial Sex Act or Prohibited Sexual Conduct\r\nwith an Individual Other than a Minor\r\n(a) Base Offense Level: 14\r\n(b) Specific Offense Characteristic\r\n(1) If the offense involved fraud or coercion, increase\r\nby 4 levels.\r\n(c) Cross Reference\r\n(1) If the offense involved conduct described in 18\r\nU.S.C. § 2241(a) or (b) or 18 U.S.C. § 2242, apply\r\n§2A3.1 (Criminal Sexual Abuse; Attempt to\r\nCommit Criminal Sexual Abuse).\r\n(d) Special Instruction\r\n(1) If the offense involved more than one victim,\r\nChapter Three, Part D (Multiple Counts) shall be\r\napplied as if the promoting of a commercial sex\r\nact or prohibited sexual conduct in respect to each\r\nvictim had been contained in a separate count of\r\nconviction.\r\nCommentary\r\nStatutory Provisions: 8 U.S.C. § 1328 (only if the offense involved a victim other\r\nthan a minor); 18 U.S.C. §§ 1591 (only if the offense involved a victim other than\r\na minor), 2421 (only if the offense involved a victim other than a minor), 2422(a)\r\n(only if the offense involved a victim other than a minor).\r\n\r\nApplication Notes:\r\n1. Definitions.—For purposes of this guideline:\r\n‘Commercial sex act’ has the meaning given that term in 18 U.S.C.\r\n§ 1591(c)(1).\r\n‘Prohibited sexual conduct’ has the meaning given that term in Application\r\nNote 1 of §2A3.1 (Criminal Sexual Abuse; Attempt to Commit Criminal\r\nSexual Abuse).\r\n‘Promoting a commercial sex act’ means persuading, inducing, enticing, or\r\ncoercing a person to engage in a commercial sex act, or to travel to engage\r\nin, a commercial sex act.\r\n‘Victim’ means a person transported, persuaded, induced, enticed, or\r\ncoerced to engage in, or travel for the purpose of engaging in, a commercial\r\nsex act or prohibited sexual conduct, whether or not the person consented\r\nto the commercial sex act or prohibited sexual conduct. Accordingly,\r\n‘victim’ may include an undercover law enforcement officer.\r\n2. Application of Subsection (b)(1).—Subsection (b)(1) provides an\r\nenhancement for fraud or coercion that occurs as part of the offense and\r\nanticipates no bodily injury. If bodily injury results, an upward departure\r\nmay be warranted. See Chapter Five, Part K (Departures). For purposes\r\nof subsection (b)(1), ‘coercion’ includes any form of conduct that negates\r\nthe voluntariness of the victim. This enhancement would apply, for\r\nexample, in a case in which the ability of the victim to appraise or control\r\nconduct was substantially impaired by drugs or alcohol. This characteristic\r\ngenerally will not apply if the drug or alcohol was voluntarily taken.\r\n3. Application of Chapter Three Adjustment.—For the purposes of §3B1.1\r\n(Aggravating Role), a victim, as defined in this guideline, is considered a\r\nparticipant only if that victim assisted in the promoting of a commercial sex\r\nact or prohibited sexual conduct in respect to another victim.\r\n4. Application of Subsection (c)(1).—\r\n(A) Conduct Described in 18 U.S.C. § 2241(a) or (b).—For purposes\r\nof subsection (c)(1), conduct described in 18 U.S.C. § 2241(a) or\r\n(b) is engaging in, or causing another person to engage in, a sexual\r\nact with another person by: (i) using force against the victim; (ii)\r\nthreatening or placing the victim in fear that any person will be\r\nsubject to death, serious bodily injury, or kidnapping; (iii)\r\nrendering the victim unconscious; or (iv) administering by force or\r\nthreat of force, or without the knowledge or permission of the\r\nvictim, a drug, intoxicant, or other similar substance and thereby\r\nsubstantially impairing the ability of the victim to appraise or\r\ncontrol conduct. This provision would apply, for example, if any\r\n\r\ndangerous weapon was used or brandished, or in a case in which\r\nthe ability of the victim to appraise or control conduct was\r\nsubstantially impaired by drugs or alcohol.\r\n(B) Conduct Described in 18 U.S.C. § 2242.—For purposes of\r\nsubsection (c)(1), conduct described in 18 U.S.C. § 2242 is: (i)\r\nengaging in, or causing another person to engage in, a sexual act\r\nwith another person by threatening or placing the victim in fear\r\n(other than by threatening or placing the victim in fear that any\r\nperson will be subject to death, serious bodily injury, or\r\nkidnapping); or (ii) engaging in, or causing another person to\r\nengage in, a sexual act with a victim who is incapable of appraising\r\nthe nature of the conduct or who is physically incapable of\r\ndeclining participation in, or communicating unwillingness to\r\nengage in, the sexual act.\r\n5. Special Instruction at Subsection (d)(1).—For the purposes of Chapter\r\nThree, Part D (Multiple Counts), each person transported, persuaded,\r\ninduced, enticed, or coerced to engage in, or travel to engage in, a\r\ncommercial sex act or prohibited sexual conduct is to be treated as a\r\nseparate victim. Consequently, multiple counts involving more than one\r\nvictim are not to be grouped together under §3D1.2 (Groups of Closely\r\nRelated Counts). In addition, subsection (d)(1) directs that if the relevant\r\nconduct of an offense of conviction includes the promoting of a commercial\r\nsex act or prohibited sexual conduct in respect to more than one victim,\r\nwhether specifically cited in the count of conviction, each such victim shall\r\nbe treated as if contained in a separate count of conviction.\r\n6. Upward Departure Provision.—If the offense involved more than ten\r\nvictims, an upward departure may be warranted.\r\nBackground: This guideline covers offenses that involve promoting prostitution or\r\nprohibited sexual conduct with an adult through a variety of means. Offenses that\r\ninvolve promoting prostitution or prohibited sexual conduct with an adult are\r\nsentenced under this guideline, unless criminal sexual abuse occurs as part of the\r\noffense, in which case the cross reference would apply.\r\nThis guideline also covers offenses under section 1591 of title 18, United\r\nStates Code, that involve recruiting or transporting a person, other than a minor, in\r\ninterstate commerce knowing that force, fraud, or coercion will be used to cause the\r\nperson to engage in a commercial sex act.\r\nOffenses of promoting prostitution or prohibited sexual conduct in which\r\na minor victim is involved are to be sentenced under §2G1.3 (Promoting a\r\nCommercial Sex Act or Prohibited Sexual Conduct with a Minor; Transportation\r\nof Minors to Engage in a Commercial Sex Act or Prohibited Sexual Conduct;\r\nTravel to Engage in Commercial Sex Act or Prohibited Sexual Conduct with a\r\nMinor; Sex Trafficking of Children; Use of Interstate Facilities to Transport\r\nInformation about a Minor).\".\r\n\r\nChapter Two, Part G, Subpart 1, is amended by adding at the end the following new\r\nguideline and accompanying commentary:\r\n\"§2G1.3. Promoting a Commercial Sex Act or Prohibited Sexual Conduct\r\nwith a Minor; Transportation of Minors to Engage in a Commercial\r\nSex Act or Prohibited Sexual Conduct; Travel to Engage in\r\nCommercial Sex Act or Prohibited Sexual Conduct with a Minor;\r\nSex Trafficking of Children; Use of Interstate Facilities to\r\nTransport Information about a Minor\r\n(a) Base Offense Level: 24\r\n(b) Specific Offense Characteristics\r\n(1) If (A) the defendant was a parent, relative, or legal\r\nguardian of the minor; or (B) the minor was\r\notherwise in the custody, care, or supervisory\r\ncontrol of the defendant, increase by 2 levels.\r\n(2) If (A) the offense involved the knowing\r\nmisrepresentation of a participant’s identity to\r\npersuade, induce, entice, coerce, or facilitate the\r\ntravel of, a minor to engage in prohibited sexual\r\nconduct; or (B) a participant otherwise unduly\r\ninfluenced a minor to engage in prohibited sexual\r\nconduct, increase by 2 levels.\r\n(3) If the offense involved the use of a computer or an\r\ninteractive computer service to (A) persuade,\r\ninduce, entice, coerce, or facilitate the travel of,\r\nthe minor to engage in prohibited sexual conduct;\r\nor (B) entice, encourage, offer, or solicit a person\r\nto engage in prohibited sexual conduct with the\r\nminor, increase by 2 levels.\r\n(4) If the offense involved (A) the commission of a\r\nsex act or sexual contact; or (B) a commercial sex\r\nact, increase by 2 levels.\r\n(5) If the offense involved a minor who had not\r\nattained the age of 12 years, increase by 8 levels.\r\n(c) Cross References\r\n(1) If the offense involved causing, transporting,\r\npermitting, or offering or seeking by notice or\r\nadvertisement, a minor to engage in sexually\r\nexplicit conduct for the purpose of producing a\r\nvisual depiction of such conduct, apply §2G2.1\r\n\r\n(Sexually Exploiting a Minor by Production of\r\nSexually Explicit Visual or Printed Material;\r\nCustodian Permitting Minor to Engage in\r\nSexually Explicit Conduct; Advertisement for\r\nMinors to Engage in Production), if the resulting\r\noffense level is greater than that determined\r\nabove.\r\n(2) If a minor was killed under circumstances that\r\nwould constitute murder under 18 U.S.C. § 1111\r\nhad such killing taken place within the territorial\r\nor maritime jurisdiction of the United States,\r\napply §2A1.1 (First Degree Murder), if the\r\nresulting offense level is greater than that\r\ndetermined above.\r\n(3) If the offense involved conduct described in 18\r\nU.S.C. § 2241 or § 2242, apply §2A3.1 (Criminal\r\nSexual Abuse; Attempt to Commit Criminal\r\nSexual Abuse), if the resulting offense level is\r\ngreater than that determined above. If the offense\r\ninvolved interstate travel with intent to engage in\r\na sexual act with a minor who had not attained the\r\nage of 12 years, or knowingly engaging in a\r\nsexual act with a minor who had not attained the\r\nage of 12 years, §2A3.1 shall apply, regardless of\r\nthe ‘consent’ of the minor.\r\n(d) Special Instruction\r\n(1) If the offense involved more than one minor,\r\nChapter Three, Part D (Multiple Counts) shall be\r\napplied as if the persuasion, enticement, coercion,\r\ntravel, or transportation to engage in a commercial\r\nsex act or prohibited sexual conduct of each\r\nvictim had been contained in a separate count of\r\nconviction.\r\nCommentary\r\nStatutory Provisions: 8 U.S.C. § 1328 (only if the offense involved a minor); 18\r\nU.S.C. §§ 1591 (only if the offense involved a minor), 2421 (only if the offense\r\ninvolved a minor), 2422 (only if the offense involved a minor), 2422(b), 2423, 2425.\r\nApplication Notes:\r\n1. Definitions.—For purposes of this guideline:\r\n\r\n‘Commercial sex act’ has the meaning given that term in 18 U.S.C.\r\n§ 1591(c)(1).\r\n‘Computer’ has the meaning given that term in 18 U.S.C. § 1030(e)(1).\r\n‘Illicit sexual conduct’ has the meaning given that term in 18 U.S.C.\r\n§ 2423(f).\r\n‘Interactive computer service’ has the meaning given that term in section\r\n230(e)(2) of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. § 230(f)(2)).\r\n‘Minor’ means (A) an individual who had not attained the age of 18 years;\r\n(B) an individual, whether fictitious or not, who a law enforcement officer\r\nrepresented to a participant (i) had not attained the age of 18 years, and (ii)\r\ncould be provided for the purposes of engaging in sexually explicit\r\nconduct; or (C) an undercover law enforcement officer who represented to\r\na participant that the officer had not attained the age of 18 years.\r\n‘Participant’ has the meaning given that term in Application Note 1 of the\r\nCommentary to §3B1.1 (Aggravating Role).\r\n‘Prohibited sexual conduct’ has the meaning given that term in Application\r\nNote 1 of the Commentary to §2A3.1 (Criminal Sexual Abuse; Attempt to\r\nCommit Criminal Sexual Abuse).\r\n‘Sexual act’ has the meaning given that term in 18 U.S.C. § 2246(2).\r\n‘Sexual contact’ has the meaning given that term in 18 U.S.C. § 2246(3).\r\n2. Application of Subsection (b)(1).—\r\n(A) Custody, Care, or Supervisory Control.—Subsection (b)(1) is\r\nintended to have broad application and includes offenses involving\r\na victim less than 18 years of age entrusted to the defendant,\r\nwhether temporarily or permanently. For example, teachers, day\r\ncare providers, baby-sitters, or other temporary caretakers are\r\namong those who would be subject to this enhancement. In\r\ndetermining whether to apply this enhancement, the court should\r\nlook to the actual relationship that existed between the defendant\r\nand the minor and not simply to the legal status of the defendant-\r\nminor relationship.\r\n(B) Inapplicability of Chapter Three Adjustment.—If the enhancement\r\nunder subsection (b)(1) applies, do not apply §3B1.3 (Abuse of\r\nPosition of Trust or Use of Special Skill).\r\n3. Application of Subsection (b)(2).—\r\n(A) Misrepresentation of Participant’s Identity.—The enhancement in\r\n\r\nsubsection (b)(2)(A) applies in cases involving the\r\nmisrepresentation of a participant’s identity to persuade, induce,\r\nentice, coerce, or facilitate the travel of, a minor to engage in\r\nprohibited sexual conduct. Subsection (b)(2)(A) is intended to\r\napply only to misrepresentations made directly to a minor or to a\r\nperson who exercises custody, care, or supervisory control of the\r\nminor. Accordingly, the enhancement in subsection (b)(2)(A)\r\nwould not apply to a misrepresentation made by a participant to an\r\nairline representative in the course of making travel arrangements\r\nfor the minor.\r\nThe misrepresentation to which the enhancement in subsection\r\n(b)(2)(A) may apply includes misrepresentation of a participant’s\r\nname, age, occupation, gender, or status, as long as the\r\nmisrepresentation was made with the intent to persuade, induce,\r\nentice, coerce, or facilitate the travel of, a minor to engage in\r\nprohibited sexual conduct. Accordingly, use of a computer screen\r\nname, without such intent, would not be a sufficient basis for\r\napplication of the enhancement.\r\n(B) Undue Influence.—In determining whether subsection (b)(2)(B)\r\napplies, the court should closely consider the facts of the case to\r\ndetermine whether a participant’s influence over the minor\r\ncompromised the voluntariness of the minor’s behavior.\r\nIn a case in which a participant is at least 10 years older than the\r\nminor, there shall be a rebuttable presumption, for purposes of\r\nsubsection (b)(2)(B), that such participant unduly influenced the\r\nminor to engage in prohibited sexual conduct. In such a case, some\r\ndegree of undue influence can be presumed because of the\r\nsubstantial difference in age between the participant and the minor.\r\n4. Application of Subsection (b)(3).—Subsection (b)(3) is intended to apply\r\nonly to the use of a computer or an interactive computer service to\r\ncommunicate directly with a minor or with a person who exercises custody,\r\ncare, or supervisory control of the minor. Accordingly, the enhancement\r\nin subsection (b)(3) would not apply to the use of a computer or an\r\ninteractive computer service to obtain airline tickets for the minor from an\r\nairline’s Internet site.\r\n5. Application of Subsection (c).—\r\n(A) Application of Subsection (c)(1).—The cross reference in\r\nsubsection (c)(1) is to be construed broadly and includes all\r\ninstances in which the offense involved employing, using,\r\npersuading, inducing, enticing, coercing, transporting, permitting,\r\nor offering or seeking by notice, advertisement or other method, a\r\nminor to engage in sexually explicit conduct for the purpose of\r\nproducing any visual depiction of such conduct. For purposes of\r\n\r\nsubsection (c)(1), ‘sexually explicit conduct’ has the meaning\r\ngiven that term in 18 U.S.C. § 2256(2).\r\n(B) Application of Subsection (c)(3).—For purposes of subsection\r\n(c)(3), conduct described in 18 U.S.C. § 2241 means conduct\r\ndescribed in 18 U.S.C. § 2241(a), (b), or (c). Accordingly, for\r\npurposes of subsection (c)(3):\r\n(i) Conduct described in 18 U.S.C. § 2241(a) or (b) is\r\nengaging in, or causing another person to engage in, a\r\nsexual act with another person: (I) using force against the\r\nminor; (II) threatening or placing the minor in fear that any\r\nperson will be subject to death, serious bodily injury, or\r\nkidnapping; (III) rendering the minor unconscious; or (IV)\r\nadministering by force or threat of force, or without the\r\nknowledge or permission of the minor, a drug, intoxicant,\r\nor other similar substance and thereby substantially\r\nimpairing the ability of the minor to appraise or control\r\nconduct. This provision would apply, for example, if any\r\ndangerous weapon was used or brandished, or in a case in\r\nwhich the ability of the minor to appraise or control\r\nconduct was substantially impaired by drugs or alcohol.\r\n(ii) Conduct described in 18 U.S.C. § 2241(c) is: (I) interstate\r\ntravel with intent to engage in a sexual act with a minor\r\nwho has not attained the age of 12 years; (II) knowingly\r\nengaging in a sexual act with a minor who has not attained\r\nthe age of 12 years; or (III) knowingly engaging in a\r\nsexual act under the circumstances described in 18 U.S.C.\r\n§ 2241(a) and (b) with a minor who has attained the age of\r\n12 years but has not attained the age of 16 years (and is at\r\nleast 4 years younger than the person so engaging).\r\n(iii) Conduct described in 18 U.S.C. § 2242 is: (I) engaging in,\r\nor causing another person to engage in, a sexual act with\r\nanother person by threatening or placing the minor in fear\r\n(other than by threatening or placing the minor in fear that\r\nany person will be subject to death, serious bodily injury,\r\nor kidnapping); or (II) engaging in, or causing another\r\nperson to engage in, a sexual act with a minor who is\r\nincapable of appraising the nature of the conduct or who\r\nis physically incapable of declining participation in, or\r\ncommunicating unwillingness to engage in, the sexual act.\r\n6. Application of Subsection (d)(1).—For the purposes of Chapter Three, Part\r\nD (Multiple Counts), each minor transported, persuaded, induced, enticed,\r\nor coerced to engage in, or travel to engage in, a commercial sex act or\r\nprohibited sexual conduct is to be treated as a separate minor.\r\nConsequently, multiple counts involving more than one minor are not to be\r\n\r\ngrouped together under §3D1.2 (Groups of Closely Related Counts). In\r\naddition, subsection (d)(1) directs that if the relevant conduct of an offense\r\nof conviction includes travel or transportation to engage in a commercial\r\nsex act or prohibited sexual conduct in respect to more than one minor,\r\nwhether specifically cited in the count of conviction, each such minor shall\r\nbe treated as if contained in a separate count of conviction.\r\n7. Upward Departure Provision.—If the offense involved more than ten\r\nminors, an upward departure may be warranted.\r\nBackground: This guideline covers offenses under chapter 117 of title 18, United\r\nStates Code, involving transportation of a minor for illegal sexual activity through\r\na variety of means. This guideline also covers offenses involving a minor under\r\nsection 1591 of title 18, United States Code. Offenses involving an individual who\r\nhad attained the age of 18 years are covered under §2G1.1 (Promoting A\r\nCommercial Sex Act or Prohibited Sexual Conduct with an Individual Other than\r\na Minor).\".\r\nSection 2G2.1(a) is amended by striking \"27\" and inserting \"32\".\r\nSection 2G2.1(b) is amended in subdivision (1) by striking \"victim\" and inserting \"minor\";\r\nby redesignating subdivisions (2) and (3) as subdivisions (5) and (6), respectively; and by\r\ninserting after subdivision (1) the following:\r\n\"(2) (Apply the greater) If the offense involved—\r\n(A) the commission of a sexual act or sexual contact, increase by 2\r\nlevels; or\r\n(B) (i) the commission of a sexual act; and (ii) conduct described in 18\r\nU.S.C. § 2241(a) or (b), increase by 4 levels.\r\n(3) If the offense involved distribution, increase by 2 levels.\r\n(4) If the offense involved material that portrays sadistic or masochistic\r\nconduct or other depictions of violence, increase by 4 levels.\".\r\nSection 2G2.1(b)(6), as redesignated by this amendment, is amended by striking \"Internet-\r\naccess device\" and inserting \"interactive computer service\".\r\nSection 2G2.1 is amended by redesignating subsection (c) as subsection (d); and by inserting\r\nafter subsection (b) the following:\r\n\"(c) Cross Reference\r\n(1) If the victim was killed in circumstances that would constitute\r\nmurder under 18 U.S.C. § 1111 had such killing taken place within\r\nthe territorial or maritime jurisdiction of the United States, apply\r\n§2A1.1 (First Degree Murder), if the resulting offense level is\r\n\r\ngreater than that determined above.\".\r\nThe Commentary to §2G2.1 captioned \"Statutory Provisions\" is amended by striking \"(a),\r\n(b), (c)(1)(B), 2260\" and inserting \", 2260(b)\".\r\nThe Commentary to §2G2.1 captioned \"Application Notes\" is amended by striking Notes\r\n1 through 5 as follows:\r\n\"1. For purposes of this guideline, ‘minor’ means an individual who had not\r\nattained the age of 18 years.\r\n2. For the purposes of Chapter Three, Part D (Multiple Counts), each minor\r\nexploited is to be treated as a separate victim. Consequently, multiple\r\ncounts involving the exploitation of different minors are not to be grouped\r\ntogether under §3D1.2 (Groups of Closely Related Counts). Special\r\ninstruction (c)(1) directs that if the relevant conduct of an offense of\r\nconviction includes more than one minor being exploited, whether\r\nspecifically cited in the count of conviction or not, each such minor shall\r\nbe treated as if contained in a separate count of conviction.\r\n3. Subsection (b)(2) is intended to have broad application and includes\r\noffenses involving a minor entrusted to the defendant, whether temporarily\r\nor permanently. For example, teachers, day care providers, baby-sitters, or\r\nother temporary caretakers are among those who would be subject to this\r\nenhancement. In determining whether to apply this adjustment, the court\r\nshould look to the actual relationship that existed between the defendant\r\nand the child and not simply to the legal status of the defendant-child\r\nrelationship.\r\n4. If the adjustment in subsection (b)(2) applies, do not apply §3B1.3 (Abuse\r\nof Position of Trust or Use of Special Skill).\r\n5. The enhancement in subsection (b)(3)(A) applies in cases involving the\r\nmisrepresentation of a participant’s identity to persuade, induce, entice,\r\ncoerce, or facilitate the travel of, a minor to engage in sexually explicit\r\nconduct for the purpose of producing sexually explicit material. Subsection\r\n(b)(3)(A) is intended to apply only to misrepresentations made directly to\r\na minor or to a person who exercises custody, care, or supervisory control\r\nof the minor. Accordingly, the enhancement in subsection (b)(3)(A) would\r\nnot apply to a misrepresentation made by a participant to an airline\r\nrepresentative in the course of making travel arrangements for the minor.\r\nThe misrepresentation to which the enhancement in subsection (b)(3)(A)\r\nmay apply includes misrepresentation of a participant’s name, age,\r\noccupation, gender, or status, as long as the misrepresentation was made\r\nwith the intent to persuade, induce, entice, coerce, or facilitate the travel of,\r\na minor to engage in sexually explicit conduct for the purpose of producing\r\nsexually explicit material. Accordingly, use of a computer screen name,\r\nwithout such intent, would not be a sufficient basis for application of the\r\n\r\nenhancement.\r\nSubsection (b)(3)(B)(i) provides an enhancement if a computer or an\r\nInternet-access device was used to persuade, induce, entice, coerce, or\r\nfacilitate the travel of, a minor to engage in sexually explicit conduct for\r\nthe purpose of producing sexually explicit material or otherwise to solicit\r\nparticipation by a minor in such conduct for such purpose. Subsection\r\n(b)(3)(B)(i) is intended to apply only to the use of a computer or an\r\nInternet-access device to communicate directly with a minor or with a\r\nperson who exercises custody, care, or supervisory control of the minor.\r\nAccordingly, the enhancement would not apply to the use of a computer or\r\nan Internet-access device to obtain airline tickets for the minor from an\r\nairline’s Internet site.\",\r\nand inserting the following:\r\n\"1. Definitions.—For purposes of this guideline:\r\n‘Computer’ has the meaning given that term in 18 U.S.C. § 1030(e)(1).\r\n‘Distribution’ means any act, including possession with intent to distribute,\r\nproduction, advertisement, and transportation, related to the transfer of\r\nmaterial involving the sexual exploitation of a minor. Accordingly,\r\ndistribution includes posting material involving the sexual exploitation of\r\na minor on a website for public viewing but does not include the mere\r\nsolicitation of such material by a defendant.\r\n‘Interactive computer service’ has the meaning given that term in section\r\n230(e)(2) of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. § 230(f)(2)).\r\n‘Minor’ means (A) an individual who had not attained the age of 18 years;\r\n(B) an individual, whether fictitious or not, who a law enforcement officer\r\nrepresented to a participant (i) had not attained the age of 18 years, and (ii)\r\ncould be provided for the purposes of engaging in sexually explicit\r\nconduct; or (C) an undercover law enforcement officer who represented to\r\na participant that the officer had not attained the age of 18 years.\r\n‘Sexually explicit conduct’ has the meaning given that term in 18 U.S.C.\r\n§ 2256(2).\r\n2. Application of Subsection (b)(2).—For purposes of subsection (b)(2):\r\n‘Conduct described in 18 U.S.C. § 2241(a) or (b)’ is: (i) using force against\r\nthe minor; (ii) threatening or placing the minor in fear that any person will\r\nbe subject to death, serious bodily injury, or kidnapping; (iii) rendering the\r\nminor unconscious; or (iv) administering by force or threat of force, or\r\nwithout the knowledge or permission of the minor, a drug, intoxicant, or\r\nother similar substance and thereby substantially impairing the ability of\r\nthe minor to appraise or control conduct. This provision would apply, for\r\n\r\nexample, if any dangerous weapon was used or brandished, or in a case in\r\nwhich the ability of the minor to appraise or control conduct was\r\nsubstantially impaired by drugs or alcohol.\r\n‘Sexual act’ has the meaning given that term in 18 U.S.C. § 2246(2).\r\n‘Sexual contact’ has the meaning given that term in 18 U.S.C. § 2246(3).\r\n3. Application of Subsection (b)(5).—\r\n(A) In General.—Subsection (b)(5) is intended to have broad\r\napplication and includes offenses involving a minor entrusted to\r\nthe defendant, whether temporarily or permanently. For example,\r\nteachers, day care providers, baby-sitters, or other temporary\r\ncaretakers are among those who would be subject to this\r\nenhancement. In determining whether to apply this adjustment, the\r\ncourt should look to the actual relationship that existed between the\r\ndefendant and the minor and not simply to the legal status of the\r\ndefendant-minor relationship.\r\n(B) Inapplicability of Chapter Three Adjustment.—If the enhancement\r\nin subsection (b)(5) applies, do not apply §3B1.3 (Abuse of\r\nPosition of Trust or Use of Special Skill).\r\n4. Application of Subsection (b)(6).—\r\n(A) Misrepresentation of Participant’s Identity.—The enhancement in\r\nsubsection (b)(6)(A) applies in cases involving the\r\nmisrepresentation of a participant’s identity to persuade, induce,\r\nentice, coerce, or facilitate the travel of, a minor to engage in\r\nsexually explicit conduct for the purpose of producing sexually\r\nexplicit material. Subsection (b)(6)(A) is intended to apply only\r\nto misrepresentations made directly to a minor or to a person who\r\nexercises custody, care, or supervisory control of the minor.\r\nAccordingly, the enhancement in subsection (b)(6)(A) would not\r\napply to a misrepresentation made by a participant to an airline\r\nrepresentative in the course of making travel arrangements for the\r\nminor.\r\nThe misrepresentation to which the enhancement in subsection\r\n(b)(6)(A) may apply includes misrepresentation of a participant’s\r\nname, age, occupation, gender, or status, as long as the\r\nmisrepresentation was made with the intent to persuade, induce,\r\nentice, coerce, or facilitate the travel of, a minor to engage in\r\nsexually explicit conduct for the purpose of producing sexually\r\nexplicit material. Accordingly, use of a computer screen name,\r\nwithout such intent, would not be a sufficient basis for application\r\nof the enhancement.\r\n\r\n(B) Use of a Computer or an Interactive Computer\r\nService.—Subsection (b)(6)(B) provides an enhancement if the\r\noffense involved the use of a computer or an interactive computer\r\nservice to persuade, induce, entice, coerce, or facilitate the travel\r\nof, a minor to engage in sexually explicit conduct for the purpose\r\nof producing sexually explicit material or otherwise to solicit\r\nparticipation by a minor in such conduct for such purpose.\r\nSubsection (b)(6)(B) is intended to apply only to the use of a\r\ncomputer or an interactive computer service to communicate\r\ndirectly with a minor or with a person who exercises custody, care,\r\nor supervisory control of the minor. Accordingly, the enhancement\r\nwould not apply to the use of a computer or an interactive\r\ncomputer service to obtain airline tickets for the minor from an\r\nairline’s Internet site.\r\n5. Application of Subsection (d)(1).—For the purposes of Chapter Three, Part\r\nD (Multiple Counts), each minor exploited is to be treated as a separate\r\nminor. Consequently, multiple counts involving the exploitation of\r\ndifferent minors are not to be grouped together under §3D1.2 (Groups of\r\nClosely Related Counts).

L. 108–21. This amendment makes changes to Chapter Two, Part A (Criminal Sexual\r\nAbuse), Chapter Two, Part G (Offenses Involving Commercial Sex Acts, Sexual\r\nExploitation of Minors, and Obscenity), §§3D1.2 (Groups of Closely Related Counts),\r\n5B1.3 (Conditions of Probation), 5D1.2 (Term of Supervised Release), and 5D1.3\r\n(Conditions of Supervised Release), and Appendix A (Statutory Index).\r\nFirst, the amendment consolidates §§2G2.2 (Trafficking in Material Involving the Sexual\r\nExploitation of a Minor; Receiving, Transporting, Shipping, or Advertising Material\r\nInvolving the Sexual Exploitation of a Minor; Possessing Material Involving the Sexual\r\nExploitation of a Minor with Intent to Traffic), and 2G2.4 (Possession of Materials\r\nDepicting a Minor Engaged in Sexually Explicit Conduct), into one guideline, §2G2.2\r\n(Trafficking in Material Involving the Sexual Exploitation of a Minor; Receiving,\r\nTransporting, Shipping, or Advertising Material Involving the Sexual Exploitation of a\r\nMinor; Possessing Material Involving the Sexual Exploitation of a Minor with Intent to\r\nTraffic; Possession of Materials Depicting a Minor Engaged in Sexually Explicit Conduct).\r\nConsolidation addresses concerns raised by judges, probation officers, prosecutors, and\r\ndefense attorneys regarding difficulties in determining the appropriate guideline (§2G2.2\r\nor §2G2.4) for cases involving convictions of 18 U.S.C. § 2252 or § 2252A. Furthermore,\r\nas a result of amendments directed by the PROTECT Act, these guidelines have a number\r\nof similar specific offense characteristics.\r\nSection 103 of the PROTECT Act established five-year mandatory minimum terms of\r\nimprisonment for offenses related to trafficking and receipt of child pornography under 18\r\nU.S.C. §§ 2252(a)(1)-(3) and 2252A(a)(1), (2), (3), (4) and (6). This section also increased\r\nthe statutory maximum terms of imprisonment for these offenses from 15 years to 20 years.\r\nFurthermore, the PROTECT Act increased the statutory maximum penalty for possession\r\noffenses from five to ten years. As a result of these new mandatory minimum penalties and\r\nthe increases in the statutory maxima for these offenses, the Commission increased the base\r\noffense level for these offenses.\r\nThe amendment provides two alternative base offense levels depending upon the statute of\r\nconviction. The base offense level is set at level 18 for a defendant convicted of the\r\npossession of child pornography under 18 U.S.C. § 2252(a)(4), 18 U.S.C. § 2252A(a)(5),\r\nor 18 U.S.C. § 1466A(b), and at level 22 for a defendant convicted of any other offense\r\nreferenced to this guideline, primarily trafficking and receipt of child pornography. The\r\nCommission determined that a base offense level of level 22 is appropriate for trafficking\r\noffenses because, when combined with several specific offense characteristics which are\r\nexpected to apply in almost every case (e.g., use of a computer, material involving children\r\nunder 12 years of age, number of images), the mandatory minimum of 60 months’\r\n\r\nimprisonment will be reached or exceeded in almost every case by the Chapter Two\r\ncalculations. The Commission increased the base offense level for possession offenses from\r\nlevel 15 to level 18 because of the increase in the statutory maximum term of imprisonment\r\nfrom 5 to 10 years, and to maintain proportionality with receipt and trafficking offenses.\r\nThe amendment also provides a two-level decrease at §2G2.2(b)(1) for a defendant whose\r\nbase offense level is level 22, whose conduct was limited to the receipt or solicitation of\r\nmaterial involving the sexual exploitation of a minor, and whose conduct did not involve an\r\nintent to traffic in or distribute the material. Thus, individuals convicted of receipt of child\r\npornography with no intent to traffic or distribute the material essentially will have an\r\nadjusted offense level of level 20, as opposed to an offense level of level 22, for receipt with\r\nintent to traffic, prior to application of any other specific offense characteristics. The\r\nCommission’s review of these cases indicated the conduct involved in such \"simple receipt\"\r\ncases in most instances was indistinguishable from \"simple possession\" cases. The statutory\r\npenalties for \"simple receipt\" cases, however, are the same as the statutory penalties for\r\ntrafficking cases. Reconciling these competing concerns, the Commission determined that\r\na two-level reduction from the base offense level of level 22 is warranted, if the defendant\r\nestablishes that there was no intent to distribute the material.\r\nThe amendment also provides a new, six-level enhancement at §2G2.2(b)(3)(D) for offenses\r\nthat involve distribution to a minor with intent to persuade, induce, entice, or coerce the\r\nminor to engage in any illegal activity, other than sexual activity.\r\nThe amendment also makes a number of changes to the commentary at §2G2.2, as follows.\r\nThe amendment adds several definitions, including definitions of \"computer,\" \"image,\" and\r\n\"interactive computer service,\" to provide greater guidance for these terms and uniformity\r\nin application of the guideline. The amendment also broadens the \"use of a computer\"\r\nenhancement at §2G2.2(b)(5) in two ways. First, the amendment expands the enhancement\r\nto include an \"interactive computer service\" (e.g., Internet access devices), as defined in 47\r\nU.S.C. § 230(f)(2). The Commission concluded that the term \"computer\" did not capture\r\nall types of Internet devices. Thus, the amendment expands the definition of \"computer\" to\r\ninclude other devices that involve interactive computer services (e.g., Web-Tv). In addition,\r\nthe amendment broadens the enhancement by explicitly providing that the enhancement\r\napplies to offenses in which the computer or interactive computer service was used to obtain\r\npossession of child pornographic material. Prior to this amendment, the enhancement only\r\napplied if the computer was used for the transmission, receipt or distribution of the material.\r\nThe PROTECT Act directly amended §§2G2.2 and 2G2.4 to create a specific offense\r\ncharacteristic related to the number of child pornography images. That specific offense\r\ncharacteristic provides a graduated enhancement of two to five levels, depending on the\r\nnumber of images. However, the congressional amendment did not provide a definition of\r\n\"image,\" which raised questions regarding how to apply the specific offense characteristic.\r\nThis amendment defines the term \"image\" and provides an instruction regarding how to\r\napply the specific offense characteristic to videotapes. Application Note 4 states that an\r\n\"image\" means any visual depiction described in 18 U.S.C. § 2256(5) and (8) and instructs\r\nthat each photograph, picture, computer or computer-generated image, or any similar visual\r\ndepiction shall be considered one image. Furthermore, the application note provides that\r\neach video, video-clip, movie, or similar recording shall be considered to have 75 images\r\nfor purposes of the specific offense characteristic. Application Note 4 also provides two\r\npossible grounds for an upward departure (if the number of images substantially under-\r\n\r\nrepresents the number of minors or if the length of the videotape or recording is\r\nsubstantially more than five minutes). Because the image specific offense characteristic\r\ncreated directly by Congress in the PROTECT Act essentially supercedes an earlier directive\r\nregarding a specific offense characteristic relating to the number of items (see Pub. L.\r\n102–141 and Amendment 436), the Commission deleted the specific offense characteristic\r\nfor possessing ten or more child pornographic items (formerly §2G2.4(b)(3)). This deletion\r\navoids potential litigation regarding issues of \"double counting\" if both specific offense\r\ncharacteristics were retained in the guideline.\r\nIn response to the increase in the use of undercover officers in child pornography\r\ninvestigations, the amendment expands the definition of \"minor.\" \"Minor\" is defined as (1)\r\nan individual who had not attained the age of 18 years; (2) an individual, whether fictitious\r\nor not, who a law enforcement officer represented to a participant (A) had not attained the\r\nage of 18 years, and (B) could be provided to a participant for the purposes of engaging in\r\nsexually explicit conduct; or (3) an undercover law enforcement officer who represented to\r\na participant that the officer had not attained the age of 18 years.\r\nThe amendment also makes clear that distribution includes advertising and posting material\r\ninvolving the sexual exploitation of a minor on a website for public viewing but does not\r\ninclude soliciting such material. In response to a circuit conflict, the amendment adds an\r\napplication note to make clear that the specific offense characteristic for material portraying\r\nsadistic or masochistic conduct applies regardless of whether the defendant specifically\r\nintended to possess, receive, or distribute such material. The circuit courts have disagreed\r\nregarding whether a defendant must have specifically intended to receive the sadistic or\r\nmasochistic images. Some circuit courts have required that the defendant must have\r\nintended to receive these images. See United States v. Kimbrough, 69 F.3d 723 (5th Cir.\r\n1995); United States v. Tucker, 136 F.3d 763 (11th Cir. 1998). The Seventh Circuit has held\r\nthat this specific offense characteristic is applied based on a strict liability standard, and that\r\nno proof of intent is necessary. See United States v. Richardson, 238 F.3d 837 (7th Cir.\r\n2001). The Commission followed the Seventh Circuit’s holding that the enhancement\r\napplies regardless of whether the defendant specifically intended to possess, receive, or\r\ndistribute such material.\r\nSecond, section 103 of the PROTECT Act increased the mandatory minimum term of\r\nimprisonment from 10 to 15 years for offenses related to the production of child\r\npornography under 18 U.S.C. § 2251. In response, the amendment increases the base\r\noffense level at §2G2.1 (Sexually Exploiting a Minor by Production of Sexually Explicit\r\nVisual or Printed Material; Custodian Permitting Minor to Engage in Sexually Explicit\r\nConduct; Advertisement for Minors to Engage in Production) from level 27 to level 32. A\r\nbase offense level of level 32 is appropriate for production offenses because, combined with\r\nthe application of several specific offense characteristics that are expected to apply in almost\r\nall production cases (e.g., age of the victim), this base offense level will ensure that the 15\r\nyear mandatory minimum (180 months) will be met in by the Chapter Two calculations\r\nalmost every case.\r\nThe amendment adds three new specific offense characteristics that are associated with the\r\nproduction of child pornography. The amendment provides, at §2G2.1(b)(2), a two-level\r\nincrease if the offense involved the commission of a sex act or sexual contact, or a four-level\r\nincrease if the offense involved a sex act and conduct described in 18 U.S.C. § 2241(a) or\r\n\r\n(b) (i.e., the use of force was involved). The Commission concluded that this type of\r\nconduct is more serious than the production of a picture without a sex act or the use of force,\r\nand therefore, a two- or four-level increase is appropriate. The amendment also adds a two-\r\nlevel increase if the production offense also involved distribution. The Commission\r\nconcluded that because traffickers sentenced at §2G2.2 receive an increase for distributing\r\nimages of child pornography, an individual who produces and distributes the image(s) also\r\nshould be punished for distributing the item. Lastly, the amendment adds a new, four-level\r\nincrease if the offense involved material portraying sadistic or masochistic conduct. Similar\r\nto the distribution specific offense characteristic, the Commission concluded that, because\r\n§2G2.2 contains a four-level increase for possessing, receiving or trafficking these images,\r\nthe producers of such images also should receive comparable additional punishment.\r\nThird, this amendment creates a new guideline, §2G1.3 (Promoting a Commercial Sex Act\r\nor Prohibited Sexual Conduct with a Minor; Transportation of Minors to Engage in a\r\nCommercial Sex Act or Prohibited Sexual Conduct; Travel to Engage in Commercial Sex\r\nAct or Prohibited Sexual Conduct with a Minor; Sex Trafficking of Children; Use of\r\nInterstate Facilities to Transport Information about a Minor), to specifically address offenses\r\nunder chapter 117 of title 18, United States Code (Transportation for Illegal Sexual Activity\r\nand Related Crimes). Prior to the amendment, chapter 117 offenses, primarily 18 U.S.C.\r\n§§ 2422 (Coercion and Enticement) and 2423 (Transportation of Minors), were referenced\r\nby Appendix A (Statutory Index) to either §2G1.1 or §2A3.2. Offenses under 18 U.S.C.\r\n§§ 2422 and 2423(a) (Transportation with Intent to Engage in Criminal Sexual Activity) are\r\nreferenced to §2G1.1 (Promoting A Commercial Sex Act or Prohibited Sexual Conduct), but\r\nare then cross referenced from §2G1.1 to §2A3.2 (Criminal Sexual Abuse of a Minor Under\r\nthe Age of Sixteen Years (Statutory Rape) or Attempt to Commit Such Acts) in order to\r\naccount for certain underlying behavior. Application of this cross reference has led to\r\nconfusion among courts and practitioners. Offenses under 18 U.S.C. § 2423(b) (Travel with\r\nIntent to Engage in Sexual Act with a Juvenile) are referenced to §2A3.1, §2A3.2, or\r\n§2A3.3, but most are sentenced at §2A3.2. Until recently, the majority of cases sentenced\r\nunder §2A3.2 were statutory rape cases that occurred on federal property (e.g., military\r\nbases) or Native American lands. In fiscal years 2001 and 2002, the majority of cases\r\nsentenced under the statutory rape guideline were coercion, travel, and transportation\r\noffenses. The creation of a new guideline for these cases is intended to address more\r\nappropriately the issues specific to these offenses. In addition, the removal of these cases\r\nfrom §2A3.2 will permit the Commission to more appropriately tailor that guideline to\r\nactual statutory rape cases. Furthermore, travel and transportation cases have a different\r\nstatutory penalty structure than § 2243(a) statutory rape cases.\r\nPrior to the amendment, §2A3.2 provided alternative base offense levels of (1) level 24 for\r\na chapter 117 violation with a sexual act; (2) level 21 for a chapter 117 violation with no\r\nsexual act (e.g., a sting case); or (3) level 18 for statutory rape with no travel. The\r\nPROTECT Act created a five year mandatory minimum term of imprisonment for 18 U.S.C.\r\n§§ 2422(a) and 2423(a) and increased the statutory maximum term of imprisonment for these\r\noffenses from 15 to 30 years. The PROTECT Act, however, did not increase the statutory\r\nmaximum penalty, nor did the Act add a mandatory minimum, for 18 U.S.C.\r\n§ 2243(a) offenses.\r\nThis new guideline has a base offense level of level 24 to account for the new mandatory\r\nminimum terms of imprisonment established by the PROTECT Act. The new guideline\r\n\r\nprovides six specific offense characteristics to provide proportionate enhancements for\r\naggravating conduct that may occur in connection with these cases. The guideline contains\r\nenhancements for commission of a sex act or commercial sex act, use of a computer,\r\nmisrepresentations of identity, undue influence, custody issues, and involvement of a minor\r\nunder the age of 12 years. The amendment also provides three cross references to account\r\nfor certain more serious sexual abuse conduct, including a cross reference if the offense\r\ninvolved conduct described in 18 U.S.C. § 2241 or § 2242. Furthermore, the amendment\r\nmakes conforming changes to §2G1.1 (Promoting a Commercial Sex Act or Prohibited\r\nSexual Conduct) as a result of the creation of the new travel guideline. Section 2G1.1 is\r\nexpected to apply primarily to adult prostitution cases because of the creation of §2G1.3.\r\nFourth, section 521 of the PROTECT Act created a new offense at 18 U.S.C. § 2252B\r\n(Misleading Domain Names on the Internet). Section 2252B(a) prohibits the knowing use\r\nof a misleading domain name on the Internet with the intent to deceive a person into viewing\r\nmaterial constituting obscenity. Offenses under this subsection are punishable by a\r\nmaximum term of imprisonment of two years. Section 2252B(b) prohibits the knowing use\r\nof a misleading domain name with the intent to deceive a minor into viewing material that\r\nis harmful to minors, with a maximum term of imprisonment of four years. The amendment\r\nrefers the new offense to §2G3.1 (Importing, Mailing, or Transporting Obscene Matter;\r\nTransferring Obscene Matter to a Minor), modifies the title of the guideline to include\r\n\"Misleading Domain Names\", and provides a two-level enhancement at §2G3.1(b)(2), if \"the\r\noffense involved the use of a misleading domain name on the Internet with the intent to\r\ndeceive a minor into viewing material on the Internet that is harmful to minors.\" In addition,\r\nthe amendment also provides enhancements for the following conduct: (1) distribution to a\r\nminor that was intended to persuade, induce, entice, or coerce a minor to engage in any\r\nillegal activity; and (2) use of a computer or interactive computer service. Finally, the\r\namendment adds §2G3.1 to the list of guidelines at subsection (d) of §3D1.2 (Groups of\r\nClosely Related Counts). Grouping multiple counts of these offenses pursuant to §3D1.2(d)\r\nis appropriate because typically these offenses, as well as other pornography distribution\r\noffenses, are ongoing or continuous in nature. The amendment makes other minor technical\r\nchanges to the commentary to make this guideline consistent with other Chapter Two, Part\r\nG guidelines.\r\nFifth, in response to a circuit conflict, this amendment adds a condition to §§5B1.3\r\n(Conditions of Probation) and 5D1.3 (Conditions of Supervised Release) permitting the court\r\nto limit the use of a computer or an interactive computer service for sex offenses in which\r\nthe defendant used such items. The circuit courts have disagreed over imposition of\r\nrestrictive computer use and Internet-access conditions. Some circuit courts have refused\r\nto allow complete prohibitions on computer use and Internet access (see United States v.\r\nSofsky, 287 F.3d 122 (2nd Cir. 2002) (invalidating restrictions on computer use and Internet\r\nuse); United States v. Freeman, 316 F.3d 386 (3d Cir. 2003) (same)), but other circuit courts\r\nhave upheld restrictions on computer use and Internet access with probation officer\r\npermission (see United States v. Fields, 324 F.3d 1025 (8th Cir. 2003) (upholding condition\r\nprohibiting defendant from having Internet service in his home and allowing possessing of\r\na computer only if granted permission by his probation officer); United States v. Walser, 275\r\nF.3d 981 (10th Cir. 2001) (prohibiting Internet use but allowing Internet use with probation\r\nofficer's permission); United States v. Zinn, 321 F.3d 1084 (11th Cir. 2003) (same)). Other\r\ncourts have permitted a complete ban on a convicted sex offender's Internet use while on\r\nsupervised release. See United States v. Paul, 274 F.3d 155 (5th Cir. 2001)\r\n\r\nNovember 1, 2011 APPENDIX C - VOLUME III Amendment 666\r\n(upholding complete ban on Internet use).\r\nIn addition, this amendment makes §5D1.2 (Term of Supervised Release) consistent with\r\nchanges made by the PROTECT Act regarding the applicable terms of supervised release\r\nunder 18 U.S.C. § 3583 for sex offenders.\r\nSixth, section 401(i)(2) of the PROTECT Act directs the Commission to \"amend the\r\nSentencing Guidelines to ensure that the Guidelines adequately reflect the seriousness of the\r\noffenses\" under sections 2243(b) (Sexual Abuse of a Ward), 2244(a)(4) (Abusive Sexual\r\nContact), and 2244(b) (Sexual Contact with a Person without that Person’s Permission) of\r\ntitle 18, United States Code. This amendment makes several amendments to the guidelines\r\nin Chapter Two, Part A (Criminal Sexual Abuse) to address this directive and to account for\r\nproportionality issues created by the increases in the Chapter Two, Part G guidelines. In\r\naddition, the amendment makes changes to the commentary to make the definitions in these\r\nguidelines consistent with definitions in the pornography guidelines.\r\nSeventh, the amendment increases the base offense level at §2A3.1 (Criminal Sexual Abuse;\r\nAttempt to Commit Criminal Sexual Abuse) from level 27 to level 30 to maintain\r\nproportionality between this guideline and §2G2.1, the production of child pornography\r\nguideline, the base offense level of which was raised to level 32 by this amendment.\r\nFurthermore, the amendment adds the term \"interactive computer service\" to the computer\r\nenhancement in §2A3.1.\r\nEighth, the amendment increases the offense levels for two specific offense characteristics\r\nat §2A3.2. The amendment increases the custody, care, or supervisory control enhancement\r\nfrom two to four levels at §2A3.2(b)(1), and changes §2A3.2(b)(3), which involves the\r\nmisrepresentation or undue influence by the defendant, from a two- to a four-level increase.\r\nThe Commission concluded that an increase in the magnitude of these enhancements is\r\nappropriate because of the seriousness of such conduct. The amendment also deletes the\r\nalternative base offense level of level 21 or level 24 because these cases will be referenced\r\nto the new travel guideline at §2G1.3.\r\nNinth, in response to section 401 of the PROTECT Act, the amendment increases the base\r\noffense level at §2A3.3 (Criminal Sexual Abuse of a Ward) from level 9 to a level 12.\r\nAlthough 18 U.S.C. § 2243(b) offenses have only a one-year statutory maximum term of\r\nimprisonment, the Commission determined that these offenses were serious in nature and\r\ndeserved punishment near that statutory maximum.\r\nFinally, the amendment increases the alternative base offense levels in §2A3.4 (Abusive\r\nSexual Contact or Attempt to Commit Abusive Sexual Contact) to level 20, 16, or 12,\r\ndepending on the conduct involved in the offense. Prior to the amendment, these base\r\noffenses levels were level 16, 12, or 10. Base offense level 20 applies if the offense involved\r\nconduct described in 18 U.S.C. § 2241(a) or (b). Base offense level 16 applies if the offense\r\ninvolved conduct described in 18 U.S.C. § 2242, and base offense level 12 applies for all\r\nother cases sentenced at this guideline. The Commission concluded that these increases were\r\nappropriate to account for the serious conduct committed by the defendant and to maintain\r\nproportionality with other Chapter Two, Part A guidelines.","EffectiveDate":"Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2004."},{"Id":665,"Title":"Amendment 665","Text":"Section 2B1.1(b) is amended by redesignating subdivisions (7) through (14)\r\nas subdivisions (8) through (15), respectively; and by inserting after subdivision (6) the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\"(7) If (A) the defendant was convicted of an offense under 18 U.S.C. § 1037;\r\nand (B) the offense involved obtaining electronic mail addresses through\r\nimproper means, increase by 2 levels.\".\r\nThe Commentary to §2B1.1 captioned \"Statutory Provisions\" is amended by inserting\r\n\"1037,\" after \"1031,\".\r\nThe Commentary to §2B1.1 captioned \"Application Notes\" is amended in Note 4 by\r\nredesignating subdivisions (B) and (C) as subdivisions (C) and (D), respectively; and by\r\ninserting after subdivision (A) the following:\r\n\"(B) Applicability to Transmission of Multiple Commercial Electronic Mail\r\nMessages.—For purposes of subsection (b)(2), an offense under 18 U.S.C.\r\n§ 1037, or any other offense involving conduct described in 18 U.S.C.\r\n§ 1037, shall be considered to have been committed through mass-\r\nmarketing.

The Act also requires that the Commission consider providing\r\nsentencing enhancements for several factors, including defendants convicted under 18 U.S.C.\r\n§ 1037 who obtained electronic mail addresses through improper means.\r\n\r\nNovember 1, 2011 APPENDIX C - VOLUME III Amendment 666\r\nThe amendment refers violations of subsections of 18 U.S.C. § 1037 to §2B1.1 (Larceny,\r\nEmbezzlement, and Other Forms of Theft; Offenses Involving Stolen Property; Property\r\nDamage or Destruction; Fraud and Deceit; Forgery; Offenses involving Altered or\r\nCounterfeit Instruments Other than Counterfeit Bearer Obligations of the United States).\r\nThe Commission determined that reference to §2B1.1 is appropriate because subsection 18\r\nU.S.C. § 1037(a)(1) involves misappropriation of another’s computer, and 18 U.S.C.\r\n§ 1037(a)(2) through (a)(5) involve deceit. Because each offense under 18 U.S.C. § 1037\r\ncontains as an element the transmission of multiple commercial electronic messages (where\r\n\"multiple\" is defined in the statute as \"more than 100 electronic mail messages during a\r\n24-hour period, more than 1,000 electronic mail messages during a 30-day period, or more\r\nthan 10,000 electronic mail messages during a 1-year period\"), the amendment provides in\r\nApplication Note 4 that the mass-marketing enhancement in §2B1.1(b)(2)(A)(ii) shall apply\r\nautomatically to any defendant who is convicted of 18 U.S.C. § 1037, or who committed an\r\noffense involving conduct described in 18 U.S.C. § 1037.

For example, an amendment to the obscenity guideline, §2G3.1 (Importing,\r\nMailing, or Transporting Obscene Matter; Transferring Obscene Matter to a Minor), added\r\na two-level enhancement if the offense involved the use of a computer or interactive\r\ncomputer service.","EffectiveDate":"Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2004."},{"Id":666,"Title":"Amendment 666","Text":"The Commentary to §1B1.5 captioned \"Application Notes\" is amended in\r\nNote 2 by striking \"(Offering, Giving, Soliciting, or Receiving a Bribe); 2C1.7 (Fraud\r\nInvolving Deprivation of the Intangible Right to the Honest Services of Public Officials)\"\r\nand inserting \"(Offering, Giving, Soliciting, or Receiving a Bribe; Extortion Under Color of\r\nOfficial Right; Fraud Involving the Deprivation of the Intangible Right to Honest Services\r\nof Public Officials; Conspiracy to Defraud by Interference with Governmental Functions)\".\r\nThe Commentary to §2B1.1 captioned \"Application Notes\" is amended in Note 15, as\r\nredesignated by Amendment 665, by adding at the end the following:\r\n\"For example, a state employee who improperly influenced the award of a contract\r\nand used the mails to commit the offense may be prosecuted under 18 U.S.C. § 1341\r\nfor fraud involving the deprivation of the intangible right of honest services.

For additional statutory provision(s), see Appendix A (Statutory\r\nIndex).\r\nApplication Notes:\r\n1. ‘Official holding a high-level decision-making or sensitive position’\r\nincludes, for example, prosecuting attorneys, judges, agency administrators,\r\nsupervisory law enforcement officers, and other governmental officials with\r\nsimilar levels of responsibility.\r\n2. ‘Loss’, for purposes of subsection (b)(2)(A), shall be determined in\r\naccordance with Application Note 3 of the Commentary to §2B1.1 (Theft,\r\nProperty Destruction, and Fraud). The value of ‘the benefit received or to\r\nbe received’ means the net value of such benefit. Examples: (1) A\r\ngovernment employee, in return for a $500 bribe, reduces the price of a\r\npiece of surplus property offered for sale by the government from $10,000\r\nto $2,000; the value of the benefit received is $8,000. (2) A $150,000\r\ncontract on which $20,000 profit was made was awarded in return for a\r\nbribe; the value of the benefit received is $20,000. Do not deduct the value\r\nof the bribe itself in computing the value of the benefit received or to be\r\nreceived. In the above examples, therefore, the value of the benefit received\r\nwould be the same regardless of the value of the bribe.\r\n3. Do not apply §3B1.3 (Abuse of Position of Trust or Use of Special Skill)\r\nexcept where the offense level is determined under §2C1.1(c)(1), (2), or\r\n\r\n(3). In such cases, an adjustment from §3B1.3 (Abuse of Position of Trust\r\nor Use of Special Skill) may apply.\r\n4. In some cases the monetary value of the unlawful payment may not be\r\nknown or may not adequately reflect the seriousness of the offense. For\r\nexample, a small payment may be made in exchange for the falsification of\r\ninspection records for a shipment of defective parachutes or the destruction\r\nof evidence in a major narcotics case. In part, this issue is addressed by the\r\nadjustments in §2C1.1(b)(2), and §2C1.1(c)(1), (2), and (3). However, in\r\ncases in which the seriousness of the offense is still not adequately\r\nreflected, an upward departure is warranted. See Chapter Five, Part K\r\n(Departures).\r\n5. Where the court finds that the defendant’s conduct was part of a systematic\r\nor pervasive corruption of a governmental function, process, or office that\r\nmay cause loss of public confidence in government, an upward departure\r\nmay be warranted. See Chapter Five, Part K (Departures).\r\n6. Subsection (b)(1) provides an adjustment for offenses involving more than\r\none incident of either bribery or extortion. Related payments that, in\r\nessence, constitute a single incident of bribery or extortion (e.g., a number\r\nof installment payments for a single action) are to be treated as a single\r\nbribe or extortion, even if charged in separate counts.\r\n7. For the purposes of determining whether to apply the cross references in\r\nthis section, the ‘resulting offense level’ means the greater final offense\r\nlevel (i.e., the offense level determined by taking into account both the\r\nChapter Two offense level and any applicable adjustments from Chapter\r\nThree, Parts A-D).\r\nBackground: This section applies to a person who offers or gives a bribe for a\r\ncorrupt purpose, such as inducing a public official to participate in a fraud or to\r\ninfluence his official actions, or to a public official who solicits or accepts such a\r\nbribe. The maximum term of imprisonment authorized by statute for these offenses\r\nis fifteen years under 18 U.S.C. § 201(b) and (c), twenty years under 18 U.S.C.\r\n§ 1951, and three years under 18 U.S.C. § 872.\r\nThe object and nature of a bribe may vary widely from case to case. In\r\nsome cases, the object may be commercial advantage (e.g., preferential treatment in\r\nthe award of a government contract). In others, the object may be issuance of a\r\nlicense to which the recipient is not entitled. In still others, the object may be the\r\nobstruction of justice. Consequently, a guideline for the offense must be designed\r\nto cover diverse situations.\r\nIn determining the net value of the benefit received or to be received, the\r\nvalue of the bribe is not deducted from the gross value of such benefit; the harm is\r\nthe same regardless of value of the bribe paid to receive the benefit. Where the\r\nvalue of the bribe exceeds the value of the benefit or the value of the benefit cannot\r\nbe determined, the value of the bribe is used because it is likely that the payer of\r\n\r\nsuch a bribe expected something in return that would be worth more than the value\r\nof the bribe. Moreover, for deterrence purposes, the punishment should be\r\ncommensurate with the gain to the payer or the recipient of the bribe, whichever is\r\nhigher.\r\nUnder §2C1.1(b)(2)(B), if the payment was for the purpose of influencing\r\nan official act by certain officials, the offense level is increased by 8 levels if this\r\nincrease is greater than that provided under §2C1.1(b)(2)(A).\r\nUnder §2C1.1(c)(1), if the payment was to facilitate the commission of\r\nanother criminal offense, the guideline applicable to a conspiracy to commit that\r\nother offense will apply if the result is greater than that determined above. For\r\nexample, if a bribe was given to a law enforcement officer to allow the smuggling\r\nof a quantity of cocaine, the guideline for conspiracy to import cocaine would be\r\napplied if it resulted in a greater offense level.\r\nUnder §2C1.1(c)(2), if the payment was to conceal another criminal offense\r\nor obstruct justice in respect to another criminal offense, the guideline from §2X3.1\r\n(Accessory After the Fact) or §2J1.2 (Obstruction of Justice), as appropriate, will\r\napply if the result is greater than that determined above. For example, if a bribe was\r\ngiven for the purpose of concealing the offense of espionage, the guideline for\r\naccessory after the fact to espionage would be applied.\r\nUnder §2C1.1(c)(3), if the offense involved forcible extortion, the guideline\r\nfrom §2B3.2 (Extortion by Force or Threat of Injury or Serious Damage) will apply\r\nif the result is greater than that determined above.\r\nWhen the offense level is determined under §2C1.1(c)(1), (2), or (3), an\r\nadjustment from §3B1.3 (Abuse of Position of Trust or Use of Special Skill) may\r\napply.\r\nSection 2C1.1 also applies to extortion by officers or employees of the\r\nUnited States in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 872, and Hobbs Act extortion, or attempted\r\nextortion, under color of official right in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1951. The Hobbs\r\nAct, 18 U.S.C. § 1951(b)(2), applies in part to any person who acts ‘under color of\r\nofficial right.’ This statute applies to extortionate conduct by, among others,\r\nofficials and employees of state and local governments. The panoply of conduct that\r\nmay be prosecuted under the Hobbs Act varies from a city building inspector who\r\ndemands a small amount of money from the owner of an apartment building to\r\nignore code violations to a state court judge who extracts substantial interest-free\r\nloans from attorneys who have cases pending in his court.\r\nSection 2C1.1 also applies to offenses under 15 U.S.C. §§ 78dd-1, 78dd-\r\n2, and 78dd-3. Such offenses generally involve a payment to a foreign public\r\nofficial, candidate for public office, or agent or intermediary, with the intent to\r\ninfluence an official act or decision of a foreign government or political party.\r\nTypically, a case prosecuted under these provisions will involve an intent to\r\ninfluence governmental action.\r\n\r\nOffenses involving attempted bribery are frequently not completed because\r\nthe victim reports the offense to authorities or is acting in an undercover capacity.\r\nFailure to complete the offense does not lessen the defendant’s culpability in\r\nattempting to use public position for personal gain. Therefore, solicitations and\r\nattempts are treated as equivalent to the underlying offense.\r\n§2C1.2. Offering, Giving, Soliciting, or Receiving a Gratuity\r\n(a) Base Offense Level: 7\r\n(b) Specific Offense Characteristics\r\n(1) If the offense involved more than one gratuity,\r\nincrease by 2 levels.\r\n(2) (If more than one applies, use the greater):\r\n(A) If the value of the gratuity (i) exceeded\r\n$2,000 but did not exceed $5,000,\r\nincrease by 1 level; or (ii) exceeded\r\n$5,000, increase by the number of levels\r\nfrom the table in §2B1.1 (Theft, Property\r\nDestruction, and Fraud) corresponding to\r\nthat amount.\r\n(B) If the gratuity was given, or to be given,\r\nto an elected official or any official\r\nholding a high-level decision-making or\r\nsensitive position, increase by 8 levels.\r\n(c) Special Instruction for Fines - Organizations\r\n(1) In lieu of the pecuniary loss under subsection\r\n(a)(3) of §8C2.4 (Base Fine), use the value of the\r\nunlawful payment.\r\nCommentary\r\nStatutory Provision: 18 U.S.C. § 201(c)(1). For additional statutory provision(s),\r\nsee Appendix A (Statutory Index).\r\nApplication Notes:\r\n1. ‘Official holding a high-level decision-making or sensitive position’\r\nincludes, for example, prosecuting attorneys, judges, agency administrators,\r\nsupervisory law enforcement officers, and other governmental officials with\r\nsimilar levels of responsibility.\r\n2. Do not apply the adjustment in §3B1.3 (Abuse of Position or Trust or Use\r\n\r\nof Special Skill).\r\n3. In some cases, the public official is the instigator of the offense. In others,\r\na private citizen who is attempting to ingratiate himself or his business with\r\nthe public official may be the initiator. This factor may appropriately be\r\nconsidered in determining the placement of the sentence within the\r\napplicable guideline range.\r\n4. Related payments that, in essence, constitute a single gratuity (e.g., separate\r\npayments for airfare and hotel for a single vacation trip) are to be treated as\r\na single gratuity, even if charged in separate counts.\r\nBackground: This section applies to the offering, giving, soliciting, or receiving of\r\na gratuity to a public official in respect to an official act. A corrupt purpose is not\r\nan element of this offense. An adjustment is provided where the value of the\r\ngratuity exceeded $2,000, or where the public official was an elected official or held\r\na high-level decision-making or sensitive position.\",\r\nand inserting the following:\r\n\"§2C1.1.

Related payments that, in essence, constitute a single incident\r\n\r\nof bribery or extortion (e.g., a number of installment payments for a single\r\naction) are to be treated as a single bribe or extortion, even if charged in\r\nseparate counts.\r\nIn a case involving more than one incident of bribery or extortion, the\r\napplicable amounts under subsection (b)(2) (i.e., the greatest of the value of\r\nthe payment, the benefit received or to be received, the value of anything\r\nobtained or to be obtained by a public official or others acting with a public\r\nofficial, or the loss to the government) are determined separately for each\r\nincident and then added together.\r\n3. Application of Subsection (b)(2).—‘Loss’, for purposes of subsection\r\n(b)(2)(A), shall be determined in accordance with Application Note 3 of the\r\nCommentary to §2B1.1 (Theft, Property Destruction, and Fraud). The\r\nvalue of ‘the benefit received or to be received’ means the net value of such\r\nbenefit. Examples: (A) A government employee, in return for a $500\r\nbribe, reduces the price of a piece of surplus property offered for sale by the\r\ngovernment from $10,000 to $2,000; the value of the benefit received is\r\n$8,000. (B) A $150,000 contract on which $20,000 profit was made was\r\nawarded in return for a bribe; the value of the benefit received is $20,000.\r\nDo not deduct the value of the bribe itself in computing the value of the\r\nbenefit received or to be received. In the preceding examples, therefore, the\r\nvalue of the benefit received would be the same regardless of the value of\r\nthe bribe.\r\n4. Application of Subsection (b)(3).—\r\n(A) Definition.—‘High-level decision-making or sensitive position’\r\nmeans a position characterized by a direct authority to make\r\ndecisions for, or on behalf of, a government department, agency, or\r\nother government entity, or by a substantial influence over the\r\ndecision-making process.\r\n(B) Examples.—Examples of a public official in a high-level decision-\r\nmaking position include a prosecuting attorney, a judge, an agency\r\nadministrator, and any other public official with a similar level of\r\nauthority. Examples of a public official who holds a sensitive\r\nposition include a juror, a law enforcement officer, an election\r\nofficial, and any other similarly situated individual.\r\n5. Application of Subsection (c).—For the purposes of determining whether\r\nto apply the cross references in this section, the ‘resulting offense level’\r\nmeans the final offense level (i.e., the offense level determined by taking\r\ninto account both the Chapter Two offense level and any applicable\r\nadjustments from Chapter Three, Parts A-D). See §1B1.5(d); Application\r\nNote 2 of the Commentary to §1B1.5 (Interpretation of References to Other\r\nOffense Guidelines).\r\n6. Inapplicability of §3B1.3.—Do not apply §3B1.3 (Abuse of Position of\r\n\r\nTrust or Use of Special Skill).\r\n7. Upward Departure Provisions.—In some cases the monetary value of the\r\nunlawful payment may not be known or may not adequately reflect the\r\nseriousness of the offense. For example, a small payment may be made in\r\nexchange for the falsification of inspection records for a shipment of\r\ndefective parachutes or the destruction of evidence in a major narcotics\r\ncase. In part, this issue is addressed by the enhancements in §2C1.1(b)(2)\r\nand (c)(1), (2), and (3). However, in cases in which the seriousness of the\r\noffense is still not adequately reflected, an upward departure is warranted.\r\nSee Chapter Five, Part K (Departures).\r\nIn a case in which the court finds that the defendant’s conduct was part of\r\na systematic or pervasive corruption of a governmental function, process,\r\nor office that may cause loss of public confidence in government, an\r\nupward departure may be warranted. See §5K2.7 (Disruption of\r\nGovernmental Function).\r\nBackground: This section applies to a person who offers or gives a bribe for a\r\ncorrupt purpose, such as inducing a public official to participate in a fraud or to\r\ninfluence such individual’s official actions, or to a public official who solicits or\r\naccepts such a bribe.\r\nThe object and nature of a bribe may vary widely from case to case. In\r\nsome cases, the object may be commercial advantage (e.g., preferential treatment in\r\nthe award of a government contract). In others, the object may be issuance of a\r\nlicense to which the recipient is not entitled. In still others, the object may be the\r\nobstruction of justice. Consequently, a guideline for the offense must be designed\r\nto cover diverse situations.\r\nIn determining the net value of the benefit received or to be received, the\r\nvalue of the bribe is not deducted from the gross value of such benefit; the harm is\r\nthe same regardless of value of the bribe paid to receive the benefit. In a case in\r\nwhich the value of the bribe exceeds the value of the benefit, or in which the value\r\nof the benefit cannot be determined, the value of the bribe is used because it is likely\r\nthat the payer of such a bribe expected something in return that would be worth\r\nmore than the value of the bribe. Moreover, for deterrence purposes, the punishment\r\nshould be commensurate with the gain to the payer or the recipient of the bribe,\r\nwhichever is greater.\r\nUnder §2C1.1(b)(3), if the payment was for the purpose of influencing an\r\nofficial act by certain officials, the offense level is increased by 4 levels.\r\nUnder §2C1.1(c)(1), if the payment was to facilitate the commission of\r\nanother criminal offense, the guideline applicable to a conspiracy to commit that\r\nother offense will apply if the result is greater than that determined above. For\r\nexample, if a bribe was given to a law enforcement officer to allow the smuggling\r\nof a quantity of cocaine, the guideline for conspiracy to import cocaine would be\r\napplied if it resulted in a greater offense level.\r\n\r\nUnder §2C1.1(c)(2), if the payment was to conceal another criminal offense\r\nor obstruct justice in respect to another criminal offense, the guideline from §2X3.1\r\n(Accessory After the Fact) or §2J1.2 (Obstruction of Justice), as appropriate, will\r\napply if the result is greater than that determined above. For example, if a bribe was\r\ngiven for the purpose of concealing the offense of espionage, the guideline for\r\naccessory after the fact to espionage would be applied.\r\nUnder §2C1.1(c)(3), if the offense involved forcible extortion, the guideline\r\nfrom §2B3.2 (Extortion by Force or Threat of Injury or Serious Damage) will apply\r\nif the result is greater than that determined above.\r\nSection 2C1.1 also applies to offenses under 15 U.S.C. §§ 78dd-1, 78dd-\r\n2, and 78dd-3. Such offenses generally involve a payment to a foreign public\r\nofficial, candidate for public office, or agent or intermediary, with the intent to\r\ninfluence an official act or decision of a foreign government or political party.\r\nTypically, a case prosecuted under these provisions will involve an intent to\r\ninfluence governmental action.\r\nSection 2C1.1 also applies to fraud involving the deprivation of the\r\nintangible right to honest services of government officials under 18 U.S.C. §§ 1341-\r\n1343 and conspiracy to defraud by interference with governmental functions under\r\n18 U.S.C. § 371. Such fraud offenses typically involve an improper use of\r\ngovernment influence that harms the operation of government in a manner similar\r\nto bribery offenses.\r\nOffenses involving attempted bribery are frequently not completed because\r\nthe offense is reported to authorities or an individual involved in the offense is\r\nacting in an undercover capacity. Failure to complete the offense does not lessen\r\nthe defendant’s culpability in attempting to use public position for personal gain.\r\nTherefore, solicitations and attempts are treated as equivalent to the underlying\r\noffense.\r\n§2C1.2. Offering, Giving, Soliciting, or Receiving a Gratuity\r\n(a) Base Offense Level:\r\n(1) 11, if the defendant was a public official; or\r\n(2) 9, otherwise.\r\n(b) Specific Offense Characteristics\r\n(1) If the offense involved more than one gratuity,\r\nincrease by 2 levels.\r\n(2) If the value of the gratuity exceeded $5,000,\r\nincrease by the number of levels from the table in\r\n§2B1.1 (Theft, Property Destruction, and Fraud)\r\n\r\ncorresponding to that amount.\r\n(3) If the offense involved an elected public official or\r\nany public official in a high-level decision-making\r\nor sensitive position, increase by 4 levels. If the\r\nresulting offense level is less than level 15,\r\nincrease to level 15.\r\n(4) If the defendant was a public official who\r\nfacilitated (A) entry into the United States for a\r\nperson, a vehicle, or cargo; (B) the obtaining of a\r\npassport or a document relating to naturalization,\r\ncitizenship, legal entry, or legal resident status; or\r\n(C) the obtaining of a government identification\r\ndocument, increase by 2 levels.\r\n(c) Special Instruction for Fines - Organizations\r\n(1) In lieu of the pecuniary loss under subsection\r\n(a)(3) of §8C2.4 (Base Fine), use the value of the\r\nunlawful payment.\r\nCommentary\r\nStatutory Provisions: 18 U.S.C. §§ 201(c)(1), 212-214, 217. For additional\r\nstatutory provision(s), see Appendix A (Statutory Index).\r\nApplication Notes:\r\n1. Definitions.—For purposes of this guideline:\r\n‘Government identification document’ means a document made or issued\r\nby or under the authority of the United States Government, a State, or a\r\npolitical subdivision of a State, which, when completed with information\r\nconcerning a particular individual, is of a type intended or commonly\r\naccepted for the purpose of identification of individuals.\r\n‘Public official’ shall be construed broadly and includes the following:\r\n(A) ‘Public official’ as defined in 18 U.S.C. § 201(a)(1).\r\n(B) A member of a state or local legislature. ‘State’ means a\r\nState of the United States, and any commonwealth,\r\nterritory, or possession of the United States.\r\n(C) An officer or employee or person acting for or on behalf of\r\na state or local government, or any department, agency, or\r\nbranch of government thereof, in any official function,\r\nunder or by authority of such department, agency, or\r\n\r\nbranch of government, or a juror.\r\n(D) Any person who has been selected to be a person described\r\nin subdivisions (A), (B), or (C), either before or after such\r\nperson has qualified.\r\n(E) An individual who, although not otherwise covered by\r\nsubdivisions (A) through (D): (i) is in a position of public\r\ntrust with official responsibility for carrying out a\r\ngovernment program or policy; (ii) acts under color of law\r\nor official right; or (iii) participates so substantially in\r\ngovernment operations as to possess de facto authority to\r\nmake governmental decisions (e.g., which may include a\r\nleader of a state or local political party who acts in the\r\nmanner described in this subdivision).\r\n2. Application of Subsection (b)(1).—Related payments that, in essence,\r\nconstitute a single gratuity (e.g., separate payments for airfare and hotel for\r\na single vacation trip) are to be treated as a single gratuity, even if charged\r\nin separate counts.\r\n3. Application of Subsection (b)(3).—\r\n(A) Definition.—‘High-level decision-making or sensitive position’\r\nmeans a position characterized by a direct authority to make\r\ndecisions for, or on behalf of, a government department, agency, or\r\nother government entity, or by a substantial influence over the\r\ndecision-making process.\r\n(B) Examples.—Examples of a public official in a high-level decision-\r\nmaking position include a prosecuting attorney, a judge, an agency\r\nadministrator, a law enforcement officer, and any other public\r\nofficial with a similar level of authority. Examples of a public\r\nofficial who holds a sensitive position include a juror, a law\r\nenforcement officer, an election official, and any other similarly\r\nsituated individual.\r\n4. Inapplicability of §3B1.3.—Do not apply the adjustment in §3B1.3 (Abuse\r\nof Position or Trust or Use of Special Skill).\r\nBackground: This section applies to the offering, giving, soliciting, or receiving of\r\na gratuity to a public official in respect to an official act. It also applies in cases\r\ninvolving (1) the offer to, or acceptance by, a bank examiner of a loan or gratuity;\r\n(2) the offer or receipt of anything of value for procuring a loan or discount of\r\ncommercial bank paper from a Federal Reserve Bank; and (3) the acceptance of a\r\nfee or other consideration by a federal employee for adjusting or cancelling a farm\r\ndebt.\".\r\n\r\nChapter Two, Part C, Subpart 1, is amended by striking §§2C1.6 and 2C1.7 and their\r\naccompanying commentary as follows:\r\n\"§2C1.6. Loan or Gratuity to Bank Examiner, or Gratuity for Adjustment of\r\nFarm Indebtedness, or Procuring Bank Loan, or Discount of\r\nCommercial Paper\r\n(a) Base Offense Level: 7\r\n(b) Specific Offense Characteristic\r\n(1) If the value of the gratuity (i) exceeded $2,000 but\r\ndid not exceed $5,000, increase by 1 level; or (ii)\r\nexceeded $5,000, increase by the number of levels\r\nfrom the table in §2B1.1 (Theft, Property\r\nDestruction, and Fraud) corresponding to that\r\namount.\r\nCommentary\r\nStatutory Provisions: 18 U.S.C. §§ 212-214, 217.\r\nApplication Note:\r\n1. Do not apply the adjustment in §3B1.3 (Abuse of Position of Trust or Use\r\nof Special Skill).\r\nBackground: Violations of 18 U.S.C. §§ 212 and 213 involve the offer to, or\r\nacceptance by, a bank examiner of a loan or gratuity. Violations of 18 U.S.C. § 214\r\ninvolve the offer or receipt of anything of value for procuring a loan or discount of\r\ncommercial paper from a Federal Reserve bank. Violations of 18 U.S.C. § 217\r\ninvolve the acceptance of a fee or other consideration by a federal employee for\r\nadjusting or cancelling a farm debt. These offenses are misdemeanors for which the\r\nmaximum term of imprisonment authorized by statute is one year.\r\n§2C1.7. Fraud Involving Deprivation of the Intangible Right to the Honest\r\nServices of Public Officials; Conspiracy to Defraud by Interference\r\nwith Governmental Functions\r\n(a) Base Offense Level: 10\r\n(b) Specific Offense Characteristic\r\n(1) (If more than one applies, use the greater):\r\n(A) If the loss to the government, or the value\r\nof anything obtained or to be obtained by\r\na public official or others acting with a\r\npublic official, whichever is greater (i)\r\n\r\nexceeded $2,000 but did not exceed\r\n$5,000, increase by 1 level; or (ii)\r\nexceeded $5,000, increase by the number\r\nof levels from the table in §2B1.1 (Theft,\r\nProperty Destruction, and Fraud)\r\ncorresponding to that amount.\r\n(B) If the offense involved an elected official\r\nor any official holding a high-level\r\ndecision-making or sensitive position,\r\nincrease by 8 levels.\r\n(c) Cross References\r\n(1) If the offense was committed for the purpose of\r\nfacilitating the commission of another criminal\r\noffense, apply the offense guideline applicable to\r\na conspiracy to commit that other offense if the\r\nresulting offense level is greater than that\r\ndetermined above.\r\n(2) If the offense was committed for the purpose of\r\nconcealing, or obstructing justice in respect to,\r\nanother criminal offense, apply §2X3.1\r\n(Accessory After the Fact) or §2J1.2 (Obstruction\r\nof Justice), as appropriate, in respect to that other\r\noffense if the resulting offense level is greater than\r\nthat determined above.\r\n(3) If the offense involved a threat of physical injury\r\nor property destruction, apply §2B3.2 (Extortion\r\nby Force or Threat of Injury or Serious Damage)\r\nif the resulting offense level is greater than that\r\ndetermined above.\r\n(4) If the offense is covered more specifically under\r\n§2C1.1 (Offering, Giving, Soliciting, or Receiving\r\na Bribe; Extortion Under Color of Official Right),\r\n§2C1.2 (Offering, Giving, Soliciting, or Receiving\r\na Gratuity), or §2C1.3 (Conflict of Interest), apply\r\nthe offense guideline that most specifically covers\r\nthe offense.\r\nCommentary\r\nStatutory Provisions: 18 U.S.C. §§ 371, 1341-1343.\r\nApplication Notes:\r\n\r\n1. This guideline applies only to offenses committed by public officials or\r\nothers acting with them that involve (A) depriving others of the intangible\r\nright to honest services (such offenses may be prosecuted under 18 U.S.C.\r\n§§ 1341-1343), or (B) conspiracy to defraud the United States by interfering\r\nwith governmental functions (such offenses may be prosecuted under 18\r\nU.S.C. § 371). ‘Public official,’ as used in this guideline, includes officers\r\nand employees of federal, state, or local government.\r\n2. ‘Official holding a high-level decision-making or sensitive position’\r\nincludes, for example, prosecuting attorneys, judges, agency administrators,\r\nsupervisory law enforcement officers, and other governmental officials with\r\nsimilar levels of responsibility.\r\n3. ‘Loss’, for purposes of subsection (b)(1)(A), shall be determined in\r\naccordance with Application Note 3 of the Commentary to §2B1.1 (Theft,\r\nProperty Destruction, and Fraud).\r\n4. Do not apply §3B1.3 (Abuse of Position of Trust or Use of Special Skill)\r\nexcept where the offense level is determined under §2C1.7(c)(1), (2), or (3).\r\nIn such cases, an adjustment from §3B1.3 (Abuse of Position of Trust or\r\nUse of Special Skill) may apply.\r\n5. Where the court finds that the defendant’s conduct was part of a systematic\r\nor pervasive corruption of a governmental function, process, or office that\r\nmay cause loss of public confidence in government, an upward departure\r\nmay be warranted. See Chapter Five, Part K (Departures).\r\n6. For the purposes of determining whether to apply the cross references in\r\nthis section, the ‘resulting offense level’ means the greater final offense\r\nlevel (i.e., the offense level determined by taking into account both the\r\nChapter Two offense level and any applicable adjustments from Chapter\r\nThree, Parts A-D).\r\nBackground: The maximum term of imprisonment authorized by statute under 18\r\nU.S.C. §§ 371 and 1341-1343 is five years.\".\r\nThe Commentary to §2E5.1 captioned \"Application Notes\" is amended in Note 4 by\r\ninserting \"; Fraud Involving the Deprivation of the Intangible Right to Honest Services of\r\nPublic Officials; Conspiracy to Defraud by Interference with Governmental Functions\" after\r\n\"Official Right\".\r\nThe Commentary to §8C2.4 captioned \"Application Notes\" is amended in Note 5 by\r\ninserting \"; Fraud Involving the Deprivation of the Intangible Right to Honest Services of\r\nPublic Officials; Conspiracy to Defraud by Interference with Governmental Functions\" after\r\n\"Official Right\".\r\nAppendix A (Statutory Index) is amended in the line referenced to 18 U.S.C. § 209 by\r\nstriking \"2C1.4\" and inserting \"2C1.3\";\r\n\r\nAmendment 667 APPENDIX C - VOLUME III November 1, 2011\r\nin the line referenced to 18 U.S.C. § 212 by striking \"2C1.6\" and inserting \"2C1.2\";\r\nin the line referenced to 18 U.S.C. § 213 by striking \"2C1.6\" and inserting \"2C1.2\";\r\nin the line referenced to 18 U.S.C. § 214 by striking \"2C1.6\" and inserting \"2C1.2\";\r\nin the line referenced to 18 U.S.C. § 217 by striking \"2C1.6\" and inserting \"2C1.2\";\r\nin the line referenced to 18 U.S.C. § 371 by striking \"2C1.7\" and inserting \"2C1.1 (if\r\nconspiracy to defraud by interference with governmental functions)\"; and by striking\r\n\"924(c)\" and inserting \"924(c))\";\r\nin the line referenced to 18 U.S.C. § 1341 by striking \"2C1.7\" and inserting \"2C1.1\";\r\nin the line referenced to 18 U.S.C. § 1342 by striking \"2C1.7\" and inserting \"2C1.1\";\r\nin the line referenced to 18 U.S.C. § 1343 by striking \"2C1.7\" and inserting \"2C1.1\";\r\nin the line referenced to 18 U.S.C. § 1909 by striking \", 2C1.4\"; and\r\nin the line referenced to 41 U.S.C. § 423(e) by striking \", 2C1.7\".","Reason":"Reason for Amendment: This amendment increases punishment for bribery, gratuity, and\r\n\"honest services\" cases while providing additional enhancements to address previously\r\nunrecognized aggravating factors inherent in some of these offenses. This amendment\r\nreflects the Commission’s conclusion that, in general, public corruption offenses previously\r\ndid not receive punishment commensurate with the gravity of such offenses. The\r\namendment also ensures that punishment levels for public corruption offenses remain\r\nproportionate to those for closely analogous offenses sentenced under §2B1.1 (Larceny,\r\nEmbezzlement, and Other Forms of Theft; Offenses Involving Stolen Property; Property\r\nDamage or Destruction; Fraud and Deceit; Forgery; Offenses Involving Altered or\r\nCounterfeit Instruments Other than Counterfeit Bearer Obligations of the United States) and\r\n§2J1.2 (Obstruction of Justice). To simplify guideline application, this amendment also\r\nconsolidates §2C1.1 (Offering, Giving, Soliciting, or Receiving a Bribe; Extortion Under\r\nColor of Official Right) with §2C1.7 (Fraud Involving Deprivation of the Intangible Right\r\nto the Honest Services of Public Officials; Conspiracy to Defraud by Interference with\r\nGovernmental Functions) and consolidates §2C1.2 (Offering, Giving, Soliciting, or\r\nReceiving a Gratuity) with §2C1.6 (Loan or Gratuity to Bank Examiner, or Gratuity for\r\nAdjustment of Farm Indebtedness, or Procuring Bank Loan, or Discount of Commercial\r\nPaper).\r\nSections 2C1.1 and 2C1.2 each are amended to include alternative base offense levels, with\r\nan increase of two levels for public official defendants who violate their offices or\r\nresponsibilities by accepting bribes, gratuities, or anything else of value. The higher\r\nalternative base offense levels for public officials reflect the Commission’s view that\r\noffenders who abuse their positions of public trust are inherently more culpable than those\r\nwho seek to corrupt them, and their offenses present a somewhat greater threat to the\r\nintegrity of governmental processes.\r\n\r\nNovember 1, 2011 APPENDIX C - VOLUME III Amendment 667\r\nA specific offense characteristic in the former §§2C1.1, 2C1.2, and 2C1.7 that raised offense\r\nlevels incrementally with the financial magnitude of the offense or, if greater, by eight levels\r\nfor the defendant’s status as a \"high-level decision-maker\" is replaced by two separate\r\nspecific offense characteristics in the amended guidelines. These new specific offense\r\ncharacteristics for \"loss\" and \"status\" are to be applied cumulatively when they both co-exist\r\nin the case. Their operation in tandem ensures that the offense level will always rise\r\ncommensurate with the financial magnitude of the offense, and that all offenses involving\r\n\"an elected public official or any public official in a high-level decision-making or sensitive\r\nposition\" will receive four additional offense levels and, when applicable, a minimum\r\noffense level of level 18 (in §2C1.1) or level 15 (in §2C1.2).

First, this amendment implements\r\nsection 608 of the Prosecutorial Remedies and Other Tools to end the Exploitation of\r\nChildren Today Act of 2003, (the \"PROTECT Act\"), Pub. L. 108–21, which directs the\r\nCommission to review and consider amending the guidelines with respect to gamma-\r\nhydroxybutyric acid (GHB) to provide increased penalties that reflect the seriousness of\r\noffenses involving GHB and the need to deter them. The Commission identified several\r\nharms associated with GHB offenses and separately increased penalties for Internet\r\ntrafficking and drug facilitated sexual assault, two harms associated with trafficking and use\r\nof this and other controlled substances. Specifically, the amendment modifies §2D1.1\r\n(Unlawful Manufacturing, Importing, Exporting, or Trafficking (Including Possession with\r\nIntent to Commit These Offenses); Attempt or Conspiracy) to provide an approximate five-\r\nyear term of imprisonment (equivalent to base offense level 26, Criminal History Category\r\nI) for distribution of three gallons of GHB. The Commission determined, based on\r\ninformation provided by the Drug Enforcement Administration, that this quantity typically\r\nreflects a mid-level distributor. The trigger for the ten-year penalty (base offense level 32)\r\nis set at 30 gallons, reflecting quantities associated with a high-level distributor. This\r\namendment also increases the penalties under §2D1.11 (Unlawfully Distributing, Importing,\r\nExporting or Possessing a Listed Chemical; Attempt or Conspiracy) for offenses involving\r\ngamma-butyrolactone (GBL), a precursor for GHB. The quantities in §2D1.11 track the\r\nquantities used in §2D1.1.\r\nSecond, this amendment adds a two-level enhancement in §§2D1.1, 2D1.11, and 2D1.12\r\n(Unlawful Possession, Manufacture, Distribution, Transportation, Exportation, or\r\nImportation of Prohibited Flask, Equipment, Chemical, Product, or Material; Attempt or\r\nConspiracy) for mass marketing of a controlled substance, listed chemical, or prohibited\r\nequipment, respectively, through the use of an interactive computer service. The\r\nCommission identified use of an interactive computer service as a tool providing easier\r\naccess to illegal products. Use of an interactive computer service enables drug traffickers\r\nto market their illegal products more efficiently and anonymously to a wider audience than\r\nthrough traditional drug trafficking means, while making it more difficult for law\r\nenforcement authorities to discover the offense and apprehend the offenders.\r\nThird, this amendment provides a special instruction in §2D1.1(e) that requires application\r\nof the vulnerable victim adjustment in §3A1.1(b)(1) (Hate Crime Motivation or Vulnerable\r\nVictim) if the defendant commits a sexual offense by distributing a controlled substance to\r\nanother individual, with or without that individual’s knowledge. The amendment addresses\r\ncases in which the cross reference in §2D1.1(d)(2) does not apply. The cross reference in\r\n§2D1.1(d)(2) is limited to cases involving a conviction under 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(7), which\r\nprescribes a 20-year statutory maximum penalty for the distribution of a controlled\r\n\r\nsubstance to another individual, without that individual’s knowledge, with the intent to\r\ncommit a crime of violence (including rape). Because the statute requires that the\r\ndistribution occur without knowledge, the cross reference does not apply to drug facilitated\r\nsexual assaults when the victim of the sexual assault knowingly ingests the controlled\r\nsubstance. This amendment reflects the Commission’s view that a defendant who commits\r\na drug-facilitated sexual assault should receive increased punishment whether or not the\r\nvictim knowingly ingested the controlled substance distributed by the defendant.\r\nFourth, this amendment modifies the existing rule at Application Note 5 of §2D1.1 to\r\nprovide a uniform mechanism for determining sentences in cases involving analogues of\r\ncontrolled substances or controlled substances not specifically referenced in this guideline.\r\nThe genesis of this amendment was the Commission’s investigation of GHB, during which\r\nthe Commission learned that analogues of GHB, specifically GBL and 1,4 Butanediol (BD),\r\namong others, often are used in its stead and cause the same effects as GHB. The\r\nCommission was concerned that analogues of other drugs might be similarly used.\r\nAdditionally, the Commission became aware that courts employ a variety of means to\r\ndetermine the applicable guideline range for defendants charged with offenses involving\r\ncontrolled substances not specifically referenced in §2D1.1, resulting in disparate sentences.\r\nThe purpose of the amendment is to provide a more uniform mechanism for determining\r\nsentences in cases involving analogues or controlled substances not specifically referenced\r\nin this guideline.\r\nFifth, this amendment corrects a technical error in the Drug Quantity Table at §2D1.1(c) with\r\nrespect to Schedule III substances. Specifically, the maximum base offense level for\r\nSchedule III substances is level 20, but prior to the amendment there was no corresponding\r\nlanguage in the Drug Quantity Table to so indicate.\r\nSixth, this amendment addresses a circuit conflict regarding the interpretation of the last\r\nsentence in Application Note 12 of §2D1.1. See United States v. Smack, 347 F.3d 533 (3rd\r\nCir. 2003) (criticizing language of note); compare United States v. Gomez, 103 F.3d 249,\r\n252-53 (2d Cir. 1997) (holding that the last sentence of the note is intended to apply only to\r\nsellers); United States v. Perez de Dios, 237 F.3d 1192 (10th Cir. 2001) (same); United\r\nStates v. Brassard, 212 F.3d 54, 58 (1st Cir. 2000) (same), with United States v. Minore, 40\r\nFed. Appx. 536, 537 (9th Cir. 2002) (mem.op.) (applying the final sentence of the new Note\r\n12 to a buyer in reverse sting operation); United States v. Estrada, 256 F.3d 466, 476 (7th\r\nCir. 2001) (same). Application Note 12 covers offenses involving an agreement to sell a\r\nspecific quantity of a controlled substance. This amendment makes clear that the court shall\r\nexclude from the offense level determination the amount of the controlled substance, if any,\r\nthat the defendant establishes that he or she did not intend to provide or purchase, or was not\r\nreasonably capable of providing or purchasing, regardless of whether the defendant agreed\r\nto be the seller or the buyer of the controlled substance.\r\nSeventh, this amendment updates the statutory references in §2D1.11(b)(2) and\r\naccompanying commentary to conform to statutory redesignations of certain offenses, and\r\nalso expands application of §2D1.11(b)(2) to include 21 U.S.C. § 960(d)(3) and (d)(4)\r\namong the statutes of conviction for which the three-level reduction at subsection (b)(2) is\r\navailable. The reduction formerly applied in cases in which the defendant, convicted under\r\n21 U.S.C. § 841(c)(2), (f)(1), or § 960(d)(2), as properly redesignated, did not have\r\nknowledge or actual belief that the listed chemical would be used to manufacture a\r\n\r\ncontrolled substance. Section 841(c)(2) of title 21, United States Code, requires a finding\r\nof either knowledge or a reasonable cause to believe that the listed chemical would be used\r\nto manufacture a controlled substance. Sections 960(d)(3) and (d)(4) of title 21, United\r\nStates Code, similarly require a finding that a person who imports, exports, or serves as a\r\nbroker for, a listed chemical knows or has a reasonable cause to believe, that the listed\r\nchemical will be used to manufacture a controlled substance. Given that the reduction\r\napplies in 21 U.S.C. § 841(c)(2) cases in which the defendant had a reasonable cause to\r\nbelieve, but not knowledge or actual belief, that the listed chemical would be used to\r\nmanufacture a controlled substance, and the mens rea in 21 U.S.C. § 841(c)(2) is the same\r\nas in 21 U.S.C. § 960(d)(3) and (d)(4), the amendment adds 21 U.S.C. § 960(d)(3) and (d)(4)\r\nto §2D1.11(b)(2).\r\nEighth, this amendment adds white phosphorus and hypophosphorous acid to the Chemical\r\nQuantity Table in §2D1.11(e). Both substances are List I chemicals that can be substituted\r\nfor red phosphorus in the manufacture of methamphetamine. Red phosphorus was added to\r\nthe Chemical Quantity Table effective November 1, 2003 (see Amendment 661), but notice\r\nand comment requirements prevented white phosphorus and hypophosphorous acid from\r\nbeing added contemporaneously.\r\nNinth, this amendment provides an enhancement of six levels at §2D1.12 if the offense\r\ninvolved stealing anhydrous ammonia or transporting stolen anhydrous ammonia. A widely\r\nused source of nitrogen fertilizer for crops, anhydrous ammonia also is used in the\r\nmanufacture of methamphetamine. Anhydrous ammonia must be stored and handled under\r\nhigh pressure, which requires specially designed and well-maintained equipment. The\r\nimproper handling and storage of anhydrous ammonia can result in permanent injury (such\r\nas cell destruction and severe chemical burns) and explosions. Methamphetamine\r\nmanufacturers often obtain anhydrous ammonia by siphoning large-volume tanks at fertilizer\r\nplants and farms, and rarely have the knowledge or equipment required to properly handle\r\nit. This enhancement accounts for the inherent dangers created by such conduct, as well as\r\nthe likely intended unlawful use.\r\nFinally, this amendment modifies Appendix A (Statutory Index) by deleting the reference\r\nto 21 U.S.C. § 957, which is not a substantive criminal offense, but rather a registration\r\nprovision for which violations are prosecuted under 21 U.S.C. § 960(a) or (b) (for controlled\r\nsubstances) or § 960(d)(6) (for listed chemicals).","EffectiveDate":"Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2004."},{"Id":668,"Title":"Amendment 668","Text":"Section 2D1.1(a) is amended by striking subdivision (3) as follows:\r\n\"(3) the offense level specified in the Drug Quantity Table set forth in\r\nsubsection (c), except that if the defendant receives an adjustment under\r\n§3B1.2 (Mitigating Role), the base offense level under this subsection shall\r\nbe not more than level 30.\",\r\nand inserting the following:\r\n\"(3) the offense level specified in the Drug Quantity Table set forth in\r\nsubsection (c), except that if (A) the defendant receives an adjustment\r\n\r\nunder §3B1.2 (Mitigating Role); and (B) the base offense level under\r\nsubsection (c) is (i) level 32, decrease by 2 levels; (ii) level 34 or level 36,\r\ndecrease by 3 levels; or (iii) level 38, decrease by 4 levels.\".\r\nSection 2D1.11 is amended by striking subsection (a) as follows:\r\n\"(a) Base Offense Level: The offense level from the Chemical Quantity Table\r\nset forth in subsection (d) or (e), as appropriate.\",\r\nand inserting the following:\r\n\"(a) Base Offense Level: The offense level from the Chemical Quantity Table\r\nset forth in subsection (d) or (e), as appropriate, except that if (A) the\r\ndefendant receives an adjustment under §3B1.2 (Mitigating Role); and (B)\r\nthe base offense level under subsection (e) is (i) level 32, decrease by 2\r\nlevels; (ii) level 34 or level 36, decrease by 3 levels; or (iii) level 38,\r\ndecrease by 4 levels.\".","Reason":"Reason for Amendment: The amendment modifies the maximum base offense level for\r\ncertain offenders provided at §2D1.1(a)(3) (Unlawful Manufacturing, Importing, Exporting,\r\nor Trafficking (Including Possession with Intent to Commit These Offenses); Attempt or\r\nConspiracy). Prior to the amendment, subsection (a)(3) limited the maximum base offense\r\nlevel to level 30 for all offenders sentenced under §2D1.1 who also received an adjustment\r\nunder §3B1.2 (Mitigating Role).

This amendment increases that enhancement to 15 levels if the\r\ndestructive device was a man-portable air defense system (MANPADS), portable rocket,\r\nmissile, or device used for launching a portable rocket or missile. It maintains the two-level\r\nenhancement for all other destructive devices. MANPADS and similar weapons are highly\r\nregulated under chapter 53 of title 26, United States Code, and chapter 44 of title 18, United\r\nStates Code, and are classified as \"destructive devices\" under 26 U.S.C. § 5845(f).\r\nThis amendment responds to concerns that these types of weapons, which have been used\r\noverseas, have the ability to inflict death or injury on large numbers of persons if fired at an\r\naircraft, train, building, or similar target. Because of the inherent risks of such weapons and\r\nthe fact that there is no legitimate reason to possess them, the Commission determined that\r\nthe statutory maximum penalty for possession of such devices should apply in all such\r\noffenses, even after possible application of acceptance of responsibility. The amendment\r\nalso re-designates Application Note 11 as Application Note 8, and adds an invited upward\r\ndeparture for non-MANPADS destructive devices in a case in which the two-level\r\nenhancement for such devices does not adequately capture the seriousness of the offense\r\nbecause of the type of destructive device involved, the risk to public welfare, and the risk of\r\ndeath or serious bodily injury that the destructive device created. Furthermore, in response\r\nto concerns that it is unclear whether certain types of firearms qualify as \"destructive\r\ndevices\" using the guideline definition of \"destructive device,\" the amendment adopts the\r\nstatutory definition provided in 26 U.S.C. § 5845(f). For consistency, similar statutory\r\ndefinitions are substituted for the definitions of \"ammunition\" and \"firearm.\"\r\nThe amendment also increases guideline penalties for attempts and conspiracies to commit\r\ncertain offenses if those offenses involved the use of a MANPADS or similar destructive\r\ndevice.

Organizations can act only through agents\r\nand, under federal criminal law, generally are vicariously liable for offenses\r\ncommitted by their agents. At the same time, individual agents are responsible for\r\ntheir own criminal conduct. Federal prosecutions of organizations therefore\r\nfrequently involve individual and organizational co-defendants. Convicted\r\nindividual agents of organizations are sentenced in accordance with the guidelines\r\nand policy statements in the preceding chapters. This chapter is designed so that the\r\nsanctions imposed upon organizations and their agents, taken together, will provide\r\njust punishment, adequate deterrence, and incentives for organizations to maintain\r\ninternal mechanisms for preventing, detecting, and reporting criminal conduct.\r\nThis chapter reflects the following general principles: First, the court must,\r\nwhenever practicable, order the organization to remedy any harm caused by the\r\noffense. The resources expended to remedy the harm should not be viewed as\r\npunishment, but rather as a means of making victims whole for the harm caused.\r\nSecond, if the organization operated primarily for a criminal purpose or primarily\r\nby criminal means, the fine should be set sufficiently high to divest the organization\r\nof all its assets. Third, the fine range for any other organization should be based on\r\nthe seriousness of the offense and the culpability of the organization. The\r\nseriousness of the offense generally will be reflected by the highest of the pecuniary\r\ngain, the pecuniary loss, or the amount in a guideline offense level fine table.\r\nCulpability generally will be determined by the steps taken by the organization prior\r\nto the offense to prevent and detect criminal conduct, the level and extent of\r\ninvolvement in or tolerance of the offense by certain personnel, and the\r\norganization’s actions after an offense has been committed.

Federal prosecutions of organizations therefore\r\nfrequently involve individual and organizational co-defendants. Convicted\r\nindividual agents of organizations are sentenced in accordance with the guidelines\r\nand policy statements in the preceding chapters. This chapter is designed so that the\r\nsanctions imposed upon organizations and their agents, taken together, will provide\r\njust punishment, adequate deterrence, and incentives for organizations to maintain\r\n\r\ninternal mechanisms for preventing, detecting, and reporting criminal conduct.\r\nThis chapter reflects the following general principles:\r\nFirst, the court must, whenever practicable, order the organization to\r\nremedy any harm caused by the offense. The resources expended to remedy the\r\nharm should not be viewed as punishment, but rather as a means of making victims\r\nwhole for the harm caused.\r\nSecond, if the organization operated primarily for a criminal purpose or\r\nprimarily by criminal means, the fine should be set sufficiently high to divest the\r\norganization of all its assets.\r\nThird, the fine range for any other organization should be based on the\r\nseriousness of the offense and the culpability of the organization. The seriousness\r\nof the offense generally will be reflected by the greatest of the pecuniary gain, the\r\npecuniary loss, or the amount in a guideline offense level fine table. Culpability\r\ngenerally will be determined by six factors that the sentencing court must consider.\r\nThe four factors that increase the ultimate punishment of an organization are: (i) the\r\ninvolvement in or tolerance of criminal activity; (ii) the prior history of the\r\norganization; (iii) the violation of an order; and (iv) the obstruction of justice. The\r\ntwo factors that mitigate the ultimate punishment of an organization are: (i) the\r\nexistence of an effective compliance and ethics program; and (ii) self-reporting,\r\ncooperation, or acceptance of responsibility.\r\nFourth, probation is an appropriate sentence for an organizational defendant\r\nwhen needed to ensure that another sanction will be fully implemented, or to ensure\r\nthat steps will be taken within the organization to reduce the likelihood of future\r\ncriminal conduct.\r\nThese guidelines offer incentives to organizations to reduce and ultimately\r\neliminate criminal conduct by providing a structural foundation from which an\r\norganization may self-police its own conduct through an effective compliance and\r\nethics program. The prevention and detection of criminal conduct, as facilitated by\r\nan effective compliance and ethics program, will assist an organization in\r\nencouraging ethical conduct and in complying fully with all applicable laws.\".\r\nSection 8A1.2(a) is amended by inserting \", Subpart 1\" after \"Part B\".\r\nSection 8A1.2(b)(2)(D) is amended by adding at the end the following:\r\n\"To determine whether the organization had an effective compliance and ethics\r\nprogram for purposes of §8C2.5(f), apply §8B2.1 (Effective Compliance and Ethics\r\nProgram).\".\r\nThe Commentary to §8A1.2 captioned \"Application Notes\" is amended in Note 3(c) in the\r\nsecond sentence by inserting \"of the organization\" after \"high-level personnel\".\r\nThe Commentary to §8A1.2 captioned \"Application Notes\" is amended by striking Note 3(k)\r\n\r\nas follows:\r\n\"(k) An ‘effective program to prevent and detect violations of law’ means a\r\nprogram that has been reasonably designed, implemented, and enforced so\r\nthat it generally will be effective in preventing and detecting criminal\r\nconduct. Failure to prevent or detect the instant offense, by itself, does not\r\nmean that the program was not effective. The hallmark of an effective\r\nprogram to prevent and detect violations of law is that the organization\r\nexercised due diligence in seeking to prevent and detect criminal conduct\r\nby its employees and other agents. Due diligence requires at a minimum\r\nthat the organization must have taken the following types of steps:\r\n(1) The organization must have established compliance standards and\r\nprocedures to be followed by its employees and other agents that\r\nare reasonably capable of reducing the prospect of criminal\r\nconduct.\r\n(2) Specific individual(s) within high-level personnel of the\r\norganization must have been assigned overall responsibility to\r\noversee compliance with such standards and procedures.\r\n(3) The organization must have used due care not to delegate\r\nsubstantial discretionary authority to individuals whom the\r\norganization knew, or should have known through the exercise of\r\ndue diligence, had a propensity to engage in illegal activities.\r\n(4) The organization must have taken steps to communicate effectively\r\nits standards and procedures to all employees and other agents, e.g.,\r\nby requiring participation in training programs or by disseminating\r\npublications that explain in a practical manner what is required.\r\n(5) The organization must have taken reasonable steps to achieve\r\ncompliance with its standards, e.g., by utilizing monitoring and\r\nauditing systems reasonably designed to detect criminal conduct by\r\nits employees and other agents and by having in place and\r\npublicizing a reporting system whereby employees and other agents\r\ncould report criminal conduct by others within the organization\r\nwithout fear of retribution.\r\n(6) The standards must have been consistently enforced through\r\nappropriate disciplinary mechanisms, including, as appropriate,\r\ndiscipline of individuals responsible for the failure to detect an\r\noffense. Adequate discipline of individuals responsible for an\r\noffense is a necessary component of enforcement; however, the\r\nform of discipline that will be appropriate will be case specific.\r\n(7) After an offense has been detected, the organization must have\r\ntaken all reasonable steps to respond appropriately to the offense\r\n\r\nand to prevent further similar offenses -- including any necessary\r\nmodifications to its program to prevent and detect violations of law.\r\nThe precise actions necessary for an effective program to prevent and detect\r\nviolations of law will depend upon a number of factors. Among the\r\nrelevant factors are:\r\n(i) Size of the organization -- The requisite degree of formality of a\r\nprogram to prevent and detect violations of law will vary with the\r\nsize of the organization: the larger the organization, the more\r\nformal the program typically should be. A larger organization\r\ngenerally should have established written policies defining the\r\nstandards and procedures to be followed by its employees and other\r\nagents.\r\n(ii) Likelihood that certain offenses may occur because of the nature of\r\nits business-- If because of the nature of an organization’s business\r\nthere is a substantial risk that certain types of offenses may occur,\r\nmanagement must have taken steps to prevent and detect those\r\ntypes of offenses. For example, if an organization handles toxic\r\nsubstances, it must have established standards and procedures\r\ndesigned to ensure that those substances are properly handled at all\r\ntimes. If an organization employs sales personnel who have\r\nflexibility in setting prices, it must have established standards and\r\nprocedures designed to prevent and detect price-fixing. If an\r\norganization employs sales personnel who have flexibility to\r\nrepresent the material characteristics of a product, it must have\r\nestablished standards and procedures designed to prevent fraud.\r\n(iii) Prior history of the organization -- An organization’s prior history\r\nmay indicate types of offenses that it should have taken actions to\r\nprevent. Recurrence of misconduct similar to that which an\r\norganization has previously committed casts doubt on whether it\r\ntook all reasonable steps to prevent such misconduct. An\r\norganization’s failure to incorporate and follow applicable industry\r\npractice or the standards called for by any applicable governmental\r\nregulation weighs against a finding of an effective program to\r\nprevent and detect violations of law.\".\r\nChapter Eight, Part B is amended by striking the heading as follows:\r\n\"PART B - REMEDYING HARM FROM CRIMINAL CONDUCT\",\r\nand inserting the following:\r\n\"PART B - REMEDYING HARM FROM CRIMINAL CONDUCT,\r\nAND EFFECTIVE COMPLIANCE AND ETHICS PROGRAM\r\n\r\n1. REMEDYING HARM FROM CRIMINAL CONDUCT\";\r\nand by adding at the end the following new subpart:\r\n\"2. EFFECTIVE COMPLIANCE AND ETHICS PROGRAM\r\n§8B2.1. Effective Compliance and Ethics Program\r\n(a) To have an effective compliance and ethics program, for\r\npurposes of subsection (f) of §8C2.5 (Culpability Score)\r\nand subsection (c)(1) of §8D1.4 (Recommended\r\nConditions of Probation - Organizations), an organization\r\nshall—\r\n(1) exercise due diligence to prevent and detect\r\ncriminal conduct; and\r\n(2) otherwise promote an organizational culture that\r\nencourages ethical conduct and a commitment to\r\ncompliance with the law.\r\nSuch compliance and ethics program shall be reasonably\r\ndesigned, implemented, and enforced so that the program\r\nis generally effective in preventing and detecting criminal\r\nconduct. The failure to prevent or detect the instant\r\noffense does not necessarily mean that the program is not\r\ngenerally effective in preventing and detecting criminal\r\nconduct.\r\n(b) Due diligence and the promotion of an organizational\r\nculture that encourages ethical conduct and a commitment\r\nto compliance with the law within the meaning of\r\nsubsection (a) minimally require the following:\r\n(1) The organization shall establish standards and\r\nprocedures to prevent and detect criminal conduct.\r\n(2) (A) The organization’s governing authority\r\nshall be knowledgeable about the content\r\nand operation of the compliance and\r\nethics program and shall exercise\r\nreasonable oversight with respect to the\r\nimplementation and effectiveness of the\r\ncompliance and ethics program.\r\n(B) High-level personnel of the organization\r\nshall ensure that the organization has an\r\neffective compliance and ethics program,\r\nas described in this guideline. Specific\r\n\r\nindividual(s) within high-level personnel\r\nshall be assigned overall responsibility for\r\nthe compliance and ethics program.\r\n(C) Specific individual(s) within the\r\norganization shall be delegated day-to-\r\nday operational responsibility for the\r\ncompliance and ethics program.\r\nIndividual(s) wi th operat ional\r\nresponsibility shall report periodically to\r\nhigh-level personnel and, as appropriate,\r\nto the governing authority, or an\r\nappropriate subgroup of the governing\r\nauthority, on the effectiveness of the\r\ncompliance and ethics program. To carry\r\nout such operational responsibility, such\r\nindividual(s) shall be given adequate\r\nresources, appropriate authority, and\r\ndirect access to the governing authority or\r\nan appropriate subgroup of the governing\r\nauthority.\r\n(3) The organization shall use reasonable efforts not\r\nto include within the substantial authority\r\npersonnel of the organization any individual\r\nwhom the organization knew, or should have\r\nknown through the exercise of due diligence, has\r\nengaged in illegal activities or other conduct\r\ninconsistent with an effective compliance and\r\nethics program.\r\n(4) (A) The organization shall take reasonable\r\nsteps to communicate periodically and in\r\na practical manner its standards and\r\nprocedures, and other aspects of the\r\ncompliance and ethics program, to the\r\nindividuals referred to in subdivision (B)\r\nby conducting effective training programs\r\nand otherwise disseminating information\r\nappropriate to such individuals’\r\nrespective roles and responsibilities.\r\n(B) The individuals referred to in subdivision\r\n(A) are the members of the governing\r\nauthority, high-level personnel,\r\nsubstantial authority personnel, the\r\norganization’s employees, and, as\r\nappropriate, the organization’s agents.\r\n\r\n(5) The organization shall take reasonable steps—\r\n(A) to ensure that the organization’s\r\ncompliance and ethics program is\r\nfollowed, including monitoring and\r\nauditing to detect criminal conduct;\r\n(B) to evaluate periodically the effectiveness\r\nof the organization’s compliance and\r\nethics program; and\r\n(C) to have and publicize a system, which\r\nmay include mechanisms that allow for\r\nanonymity or confidentiality, whereby the\r\norganization’s employees and agents may\r\nreport or seek guidance regarding\r\npotential or actual criminal conduct\r\nwithout fear of retaliation.\r\n(6) The organization’s compliance and ethics program\r\nshall be promoted and enforced consistently\r\nthroughout the organization through (A)\r\nappropriate incentives to perform in accordance\r\nwith the compliance and ethics program; and (B)\r\nappropriate disciplinary measures for engaging in\r\ncriminal conduct and for failing to take reasonable\r\nsteps to prevent or detect criminal conduct.\r\n(7) After criminal conduct has been detected, the\r\norganization shall take reasonable steps to respond\r\nappropriately to the criminal conduct and to\r\nprevent further similar criminal conduct, including\r\nmaking any necessary modifications to the\r\norganization’s compliance and ethics program.\r\n(c) In implementing subsection (b), the organization shall\r\nperiodically assess the risk of criminal conduct and shall\r\ntake appropriate steps to design, implement, or modify\r\neach requirement set forth in subsection (b) to reduce the\r\nrisk of criminal conduct identified through this process.\r\nCommentary\r\nApplication Notes:\r\n1. Definitions.—For purposes of this guideline:\r\n\r\n‘Compliance and ethics program’ means a program designed to prevent and\r\ndetect criminal conduct.\r\n‘Governing authority’ means the (A) the Board of Directors; or (B) if the\r\norganization does not have a Board of Directors, the highest-level\r\ngoverning body of the organization.\r\n‘High-level personnel of the organization’ and ‘substantial authority\r\npersonnel’ have the meaning given those terms in the Commentary to\r\n§8A1.2 (Application Instructions - Organizations).\r\n‘Standards and procedures’ means standards of conduct and internal\r\ncontrols that are reasonably capable of reducing the likelihood of criminal\r\nconduct.\r\n2. Factors to Consider in Meeting Requirements of this Guideline.—\r\n(A) In General.—Each of the requirements set forth in this guideline\r\nshall be met by an organization; however, in determining what\r\nspecific actions are necessary to meet those requirements, factors\r\nthat shall be considered include: (i) applicable industry practice or\r\nthe standards called for by any applicable governmental regulation;\r\n(ii) the size of the organization; and (iii) similar misconduct.\r\n(B) Applicable Governmental Regulation and Industry Practice.—An\r\norganization’s failure to incorporate and follow applicable industry\r\npractice or the standards called for by any applicable governmental\r\nregulation weighs against a finding of an effective compliance and\r\nethics program.\r\n(C) The Size of the Organization.—\r\n(i) In General.—The formality and scope of actions that an\r\norganization shall take to meet the requirements of this\r\nguideline, including the necessary features of the\r\norganization’s standards and procedures, depend on the\r\nsize of the organization.\r\n(ii) Large Organizations.—A large organization generally shall\r\ndevote more formal operations and greater resources in\r\nmeeting the requirements of this guideline than shall a\r\nsmall organization. As appropriate, a large organization\r\nshould encourage small organizations (especially those that\r\nhave, or seek to have, a business relationship with the\r\nlarge organization) to implement effective compliance and\r\nethics programs.\r\n(iii) Small Organizations.—In meeting the requirements of this\r\nguideline, small organizations shall demonstrate the same\r\n\r\ndegree of commitment to ethical conduct and compliance\r\nwith the law as large organizations. However, a small\r\norganization may meet the requirements of this guideline\r\nwith less formality and fewer resources than would be\r\nexpected of large organizations. In appropriate\r\ncircumstances, reliance on existing resources and simple\r\nsystems can demonstrate a degree of commitment that, for\r\na large organization, would only be demonstrated through\r\nmore formally planned and implemented systems.\r\nExamples of the informality and use of fewer resources\r\nwith which a small organization may meet the\r\nrequirements of this guideline include the following: (I)\r\nthe governing authority’s discharge of its responsibility for\r\noversight of the compliance and ethics program by directly\r\nmanaging the organization’s compliance and ethics efforts;\r\n(II) training employees through informal staff meetings,\r\nand monitoring through regular ‘walk-arounds’ or\r\ncontinuous observation while managing the organization;\r\n(III) using available personnel, rather than employing\r\nseparate staff, to carry out the compliance and ethics\r\nprogram; and (IV) modeling its own compliance and ethics\r\nprogram on existing, well-regarded compliance and ethics\r\nprograms and best practices of other similar organizations.\r\n(D) Recurrence of Similar Misconduct.—Recurrence of similar\r\nmisconduct creates doubt regarding whether the organization took\r\nreasonable steps to meet the requirements of this guideline. For\r\npurposes of this subdivision, ‘similar misconduct’ has the meaning\r\ngiven that term in the Commentary to §8A1.2 (Application\r\nInstructions - Organizations).\r\n3. Application of Subsection (b)(2).—High-level personnel and substantial\r\nauthority personnel of the organization shall be knowledgeable about the\r\ncontent and operation of the compliance and ethics program, shall perform\r\ntheir assigned duties consistent with the exercise of due diligence, and shall\r\npromote an organizational culture that encourages ethical conduct and a\r\ncommitment to compliance with the law.\r\nIf the specific individual(s) assigned overall responsibility for the\r\ncompliance and ethics program does not have day-to-day operational\r\nresponsibility for the program, then the individual(s) with day-to-day\r\noperational responsibility for the program typically should, no less than\r\nannually, give the governing authority or an appropriate subgroup thereof\r\ninformation on the implementation and effectiveness of the compliance and\r\nethics program.\r\n4. Application of Subsection (b)(3).—\r\n\r\n(A) Consistency with Other Law.—Nothing in subsection (b)(3) is\r\nintended to require conduct inconsistent with any Federal, State, or\r\nlocal law, including any law governing employment or hiring\r\npractices.\r\n(B) Implementation.—In implementing subsection (b)(3), the\r\norganization shall hire and promote individuals so as to ensure that\r\nall individuals within the high-level personnel and substantial\r\nauthority personnel of the organization will perform their assigned\r\nduties in a manner consistent with the exercise of due diligence and\r\nthe promotion of an organizational culture that encourages ethical\r\nconduct and a commitment to compliance with the law under\r\nsubsection (a). With respect to the hiring or promotion of such\r\nindividuals, an organization shall consider the relatedness of the\r\nindividual’s illegal activities and other misconduct (i.e., other\r\nconduct inconsistent with an effective compliance and ethics\r\nprogram) to the specific responsibilities the individual is\r\nanticipated to be assigned and other factors such as: (i) the recency\r\nof the individual’s illegal activities and other misconduct; and (ii)\r\nwhether the individual has engaged in other such illegal activities\r\nand other such misconduct.\r\n5. Application of Subsection (b)(6).—Adequate discipline of individuals\r\nresponsible for an offense is a necessary component of enforcement;\r\nhowever, the form of discipline that will be appropriate will be case\r\nspecific.\r\n6. Application of Subsection (c).—To meet the requirements of subsection (c),\r\nan organization shall:\r\n(A) Assess periodically the risk that criminal conduct will occur,\r\nincluding assessing the following:\r\n(i) The nature and seriousness of such criminal conduct.\r\n(ii) The likelihood that certain criminal conduct may occur\r\nbecause of the nature of the organization’s business. If,\r\nbecause of the nature of an organization’s business, there\r\nis a substantial risk that certain types of criminal conduct\r\nmay occur, the organization shall take reasonable steps to\r\nprevent and detect that type of criminal conduct. For\r\nexample, an organization that, due to the nature of its\r\nbusiness, employs sales personnel who have flexibility to\r\nset prices shall establish standards and procedures\r\ndesigned to prevent and detect price-fixing. An\r\norganization that, due to the nature of its business,\r\nemploys sales personnel who have flexibility to represent\r\nthe material characteristics of a product shall establish\r\nstandards and procedures designed to prevent and detect\r\n\r\nfraud.\r\n(iii) The prior history of the organization. The prior history of\r\nan organization may indicate types of criminal conduct that\r\nit shall take actions to prevent and detect.\r\n(B) Prioritize periodically, as appropriate, the actions taken pursuant to\r\nany requirement set forth in subsection (b), in order to focus on\r\npreventing and detecting the criminal conduct identified under\r\nsubdivision (A) of this note as most serious, and most likely, to\r\noccur.\r\n(C) Modify, as appropriate, the actions taken pursuant to any\r\nrequirement set forth in subsection (b) to reduce the risk of criminal\r\nconduct identified under subdivision (A) of this note as most\r\nserious, and most likely, to occur.\r\nBackground: This section sets forth the requirements for an effective compliance\r\nand ethics program. This section responds to section 805(a)(2)(5) of the Sarbanes-\r\nOxley Act of 2002, Public Law 107–204, which directed the Commission to review\r\nand amend, as appropriate, the guidelines and related policy statements to ensure\r\nthat the guidelines that apply to organizations in this chapter ‘are sufficient to deter\r\nand punish organizational criminal misconduct.’\r\nThe requirements set forth in this guideline are intended to achieve\r\nreasonable prevention and detection of criminal conduct for which the organization\r\nwould be vicariously liable. The prior diligence of an organization in seeking to\r\nprevent and detect criminal conduct has a direct bearing on the appropriate penalties\r\nand probation terms for the organization if it is convicted and sentenced for a\r\ncriminal offense.\".\r\nThe Commentary to §8C2.4 captioned \"Application Notes\" is amended in Note 2 by striking\r\n\"(Larceny, Embezzlement, and Other Forms of Theft)\" and inserting \"(Theft, Property\r\nDestruction, and Fraud)\".\r\nSection 8C2.5 is amended by striking subsection (f) as follows:\r\n\"(f) Effective Program to Prevent and Detect Violations of Law\r\nIf the offense occurred despite an effective program to prevent and detect\r\nviolations of law, subtract 3 points.\r\nProvided, that this subsection does not apply if an individual within high-\r\nlevel personnel of the organization, a person within high-level personnel of\r\nthe unit of the organization within which the offense was committed where\r\nthe unit had 200 or more employees, or an individual responsible for the\r\nadministration or enforcement of a program to prevent and detect violations\r\nof law participated in, condoned, or was willfully ignorant of the offense.\r\nParticipation of an individual within substantial authority personnel in an\r\n\r\noffense results in a rebuttable presumption that the organization did not\r\nhave an effective program to prevent and detect violations of law.\r\nProvided, further, that this subsection does not apply if, after becoming\r\naware of an offense, the organization unreasonably delayed reporting the\r\noffense to appropriate governmental authorities.\",\r\nand inserting the following:\r\n\"(f) Effective Compliance and Ethics Program\r\n(1) If the offense occurred even though the organization had in place\r\nat the time of the offense an effective compliance and ethics\r\nprogram, as provided in §8B2.1 (Effective Compliance and Ethics\r\nProgram), subtract 3 points.\r\n(2) Subsection (f)(1) shall not apply if, after becoming aware of an\r\noffense, the organization unreasonably delayed reporting the\r\noffense to appropriate governmental authorities.\r\n(3) (A) Except as provided in subdivision (B), subsection (f)(1)\r\nshall not apply if an individual within high-level personnel\r\nof the organization, a person within high-level personnel\r\nof the unit of the organization within which the offense\r\nwas committed where the unit had 200 or more employees,\r\nor an individual described in §8B2.1(b)(2)(B) or (C),\r\nparticipated in, condoned, or was willfully ignorant of the\r\noffense.\r\n(B) There is a rebuttable presumption, for purposes of\r\nsubsection (f)(1), that the organization did not have an\r\neffective compliance and ethics program if an individual—\r\n(i) within high-level personnel of a small\r\norganization; or\r\n(ii) within substantial authority personnel, but not\r\nwithin high-level personnel, of any organization,\r\nparticipated in, condoned, or was willfully ignorant of, the\r\noffense.\".\r\nThe Commentary to §8C2.5 captioned \"Application Notes\" is amended by striking Note 1\r\nas follows:\r\n\"1. ‘Substantial authority personnel,’ ‘condoned,’ ‘willfully ignorant of the\r\noffense,’ ‘similar misconduct,’ ‘prior criminal adjudication,’ and ‘effective\r\nprogram to prevent and detect violations of law,’ are defined in the\r\nCommentary to §8A1.2 (Application Instructions - Organizations).\",\r\n\r\nand inserting the following:\r\n\"1.

Most\r\nnotably, §8B2.1 strengthens the existing criteria an organization must follow in order to\r\nestablish and maintain an effective program to prevent and detect criminal conduct for\r\npurposes of mitigating its sentencing culpability for an offense. This amendment is the\r\n\r\nculmination of a multi-year review of the organizational guidelines, implements several\r\nrecommendations issued on October 7, 2003, by the Commission’s Ad Hoc Advisory Group\r\non the Organizational Sentencing Guidelines (Advisory Group), and responds to the\r\nSarbanes-Oxley Act (\"the Act\"), Pub. L. 107–204, which in section 805 directed the\r\nCommission to review and amend the organizational guidelines and related policy statements\r\nto ensure that they are sufficient to deter and punish organizational misconduct.\r\nConsistent with the Act’s focus on deterring criminal misconduct, this amendment revises\r\nthe introductory commentary to Chapter Eight to highlight the importance of structural\r\nsafeguards designed to prevent and detect criminal conduct. First and foremost among these\r\nsafeguards is a regime of internal crime prevention and self-policing (\"an effective\r\ncompliance and ethics program\"). While Chapter Eight derives its authority and content\r\nfrom the federal criminal law, an effective compliance and ethics program not only will\r\nprevent and detect criminal conduct, but also should facilitate compliance with all applicable\r\nlaws.\r\nUnder §8C2.5(g) (Culpability Score), an effective compliance and ethics program is one of\r\nthe mitigating factors that can reduce an organization’s fine punishment under Chapter Eight.\r\nThe absence of an effective program may be a reason for the court to place an organization\r\non probation, and the implementation of an effective program may be a condition of\r\nprobation for organizations under §8D1.4(c) (Recommended Conditions of\r\nProbation-Organizations).\r\nIn order to emphasize the importance of compliance and ethics programs and to provide\r\nmore prominent guidance on the requirements for an effective program, the amendment\r\nelevates the criteria for an effective compliance program previously set forth in the\r\nCommentary to §8A1.2 (Application Instructions - Organizations) into a separate guideline.\r\nFurthermore, the amendment elaborates upon these criteria, introducing additional rigor\r\ngenerally and imposing significantly greater responsibilities on the organization’s governing\r\nauthority and executive leadership.\r\nSection 8B2.1(a)(1) sets forth the existing requirement that an organization exercise due\r\ndiligence to prevent and detect criminal conduct, but adds the requirement that an\r\norganization \"otherwise promote an organizational culture that encourages ethical conduct\r\nand a commitment to compliance with the law.\" This addition is intended to reflect the\r\nemphasis on ethical conduct and values incorporated into recent legislative and regulatory\r\nreforms, such as those provided by the Act.\r\nSection 8B2.1(b) provides that due diligence and the promotion of desired organizational\r\nculture are indicated by the fulfilment of seven minimum requirements, which are the\r\nhallmarks of an effective program that encourages compliance with the law and ethical\r\nconduct. While the framework of requirements is derived from the existing criteria for an\r\neffective compliance program at Application Note 3(k) to §8A1.2, significant additional\r\nguidance is provided.\r\nFirst, §8B2.1(b)(1) provides that organizations must establish \"standards and procedures to\r\nprevent and detect criminal conduct.\" Application Note 1 establishes that \"standards and\r\nprocedures\" encompass \"standards of conduct and internal controls that are reasonably\r\ncapable of reducing the likelihood of criminal conduct.\"\r\n\r\nSecond, the new guideline replaces the requirement in Application Note 3(k)(2) to §8A1.2\r\nthat \"specific individual(s) within high-level personnel of the organization must have been\r\nassigned overall responsibility to oversee compliance\" with more specific and exacting\r\nrequirements. Section 8B2.1(b)(2) defines the specific roles and reporting relationships of\r\nparticular categories of personnel with respect to compliance and ethics program\r\nresponsibilities. Specifically, the Commission has determined that the organization’s\r\ngoverning authority must \"be knowledgeable about the content and operation of the\r\ncompliance and ethics program and shall exercise reasonable oversight with respect to the\r\nimplementation and effectiveness of the compliance and ethics program.\" Application Note\r\n1 defines \"governing authority\" as the \"(A) Board of Directors, or (B) if the organization\r\ndoes not have a Board of Directors, the highest-level governing body of the organization.\"\r\nSection 8B2.1(b)(2) provides that it is the organizational leadership, defined in the guidelines\r\nas \"high-level personnel,\" who must ensure that the organization’s program is effective. The\r\naccompanying commentary at Application Note 1 retains existing definitions for the terms\r\n\"high-level personnel\" and \"substantial authority personnel\" of the organization. Section\r\n8B2.1(b)(2)(B) provides that the organization must assign someone in high-level personnel\r\n\"overall responsibility\" for the program. This prescription makes explicit that, while another\r\nindividual or individuals may be assigned operational responsibility for the program,\r\nsomeone within high-level personnel must be assigned the ultimate responsibility for the\r\nprogram’s effectiveness.\r\nSection 8B2.1(b)(2)(C) requires that certain individual(s) have day-to-day responsibility for\r\nthe compliance and ethics program and adequate resources to carry out the associated tasks.\r\nSpecifically, §8B2.1 requires that the individual assigned day-to-day operational\r\nresponsibility for the program, whether it be a high-level person or an employee to whom\r\nthis task is assigned, report to organizational leadership and the governing authority on the\r\nprogram. If authority is delegated, the governing authority must receive reports from such\r\nindividuals at least annually, according to the commentary in Application Note 3. In order\r\nto carry out such responsibility, the new guideline mandates that such individual or\r\nindividuals, no matter the level, must \"be given adequate resources, appropriate authority,\r\nand direct access to the governing authority or an appropriate subgroup of the governing\r\nauthority.\"\r\nThird, §8B2.1(b)(3) replaces the previous requirement that substantial authority personnel\r\nbe screened for their \"propensity to engage in violations of law\" with the requirement that\r\nthe organization \"use reasonable efforts not to include within the substantial authority\r\npersonnel of the organization any individual whom the organization knew, or should have\r\nknown through the exercise of due diligence, has engaged in illegal activities or other\r\nconduct inconsistent with an effective compliance and ethics program.\" Application Note\r\n4(A) makes explicit that this provision does not require any \"conduct inconsistent with any\r\nFederal, State, or local law, including any law governing employment or hiring practices.\"\r\nApplication Note 4(B) provides that the organization shall hire and promote individuals so\r\nas to ensure that all individuals within the organizational leadership will perform their\r\nassigned duties in a manner consistent with the exercise of due diligence and the promotion\r\nof an organizational culture that encourages a commitment to compliance with ethics and the\r\nlaw. If an individual has engaged in illegal activities, the organization has an obligation to\r\nconsider the relatedness of the individual’s illegal activities and other misconduct to the\r\nspecific responsibilities such individual is expected to be assigned. The recency of the\r\n\r\nindividual’s illegal activities and other misconduct also should be considered.\r\nFourth, §8B2.1(b)(4) makes compliance and ethics training a requirement, and specifically\r\nextends the training requirement to the upper levels of an organization, including the\r\ngoverning authority and high-level personnel, in addition to all of the organization’s\r\nemployees and agents, as appropriate. Furthermore, subsection (b)(4) establishes that this\r\ncommunication and training obligation is ongoing, requiring \"periodic\" updates.\r\nFifth, §8B2.1(b)(5) expands the existing requirement regarding reasonable steps to achieve\r\ncompliance. Specifically, the amendment mandates that organizations use auditing and\r\nmonitoring systems designed to detect criminal conduct. It also adds the specific\r\nrequirement that the organization periodically evaluate the effectiveness of its compliance\r\nand ethics program. Significantly, the new guideline expands the focus of internal reporting\r\nfrom simply reporting \"the criminal conduct . . . of others\" to using internal systems to either\r\n\"report or seek guidance regarding potential or actual criminal conduct.\" The addition of\r\n\"seeking guidance\" is consistent with the increased focus of this guideline on the prevention\r\nand deterrence of wrongdoing within organizations. This section also replaces the existing\r\nreference to \"reporting systems without fear of retribution\" with the more specific\r\nrequirement that the organization must have \"a system, which may include mechanisms that\r\nallow for anonymity or confidentiality, whereby the organization’s employees and agents\r\nmay report or seek guidance regarding potential or actual criminal conduct without fear of\r\nretaliation.\"\r\nThe Commission is aware that both anonymous and confidential mechanisms have inherent\r\nvalue and limitations. For example, anonymous mechanisms may hinder an organization\r\nfrom engaging in an effective dialogue with the potential whistleblower to discover\r\nadditional information that might lead to a more efficient detection of the wrongdoing.\r\nConfidential mechanisms may permit the dialogue and development of maximum\r\ninformation, but the ability of organizations to ensure total confidentiality may be limited\r\nby legal obligations relating to self-disclosure, law enforcement subpoenas, and civil\r\ndiscovery requests. The Commission intends for an organization to have maximum\r\nflexibility in implementing a system that is best suited to its culture and conforms to\r\napplicable law. A responsible organization is expected, as appropriate, to communicate to\r\nits employees any applicable limitations of its internal reporting mechanisms.\r\nSixth, §8B2.1(b)(6) broadens the existing criterion that the compliance standards be enforced\r\nthrough disciplinary measures by adding that such standards also be encouraged through\r\n\"appropriate incentives to perform in accordance with the compliance and ethics program.\"\r\nThis addition articulates both a duty to promote proper conduct in whatever manner an\r\norganization deems appropriate, as well as a duty to sanction improper conduct.\r\nFinally, §8B2.1(b)(7) retains the requirement that an organization take reasonable steps to\r\nrespond to and prevent further similar criminal conduct. This dual duty underscores the\r\norganization’s obligation to address both specific instances of misconduct and systemic\r\nshortcomings that compromise the deterrent effect of its compliance and ethics program.\r\nIn addition to the seven requirements for a compliance and ethics program, §8B2.1(c)\r\nexpressly provides, as an essential component of the design, implementation, and\r\nmodification of an effective program, that an organization must periodically assess the risk\r\n\r\nAmendment 674 APPENDIX C - VOLUME III November 1, 2011\r\nof the occurrence of criminal conduct. The new guideline includes at Application Note 6\r\nvarious factors that should be addressed when assessing relevant risks. Specifically,\r\norganizations should evaluate the nature and seriousness of potential criminal conduct, the\r\nlikelihood that certain criminal conduct may occur because of the nature of the\r\norganization’s business, and the prior history of the organization. To be effective, this\r\nprocess must be ongoing. Organizations must periodically prioritize their compliance and\r\nethics resources to target those potential criminal activities that pose the greatest threat in\r\nlight of the risks identified.\r\nThe amendment also provides additional guidance with respect to the implementation of\r\ncompliance and ethics programs by small organizations by including frequent references to\r\nsmall organizations throughout the commentary of §8B2.1 and providing illustrations (see\r\ne.g., Application Note 2(C)(ii)). It also encourages larger organizations to promote the\r\nadoption of compliance and ethics programs by smaller organizations, including those with\r\nwhich they conduct or seek to conduct business.\r\nThis amendment also changes the automatic preclusion for compliance program credit\r\nprovided in §8C2.5(f) (Culpability Score) for \"small organizations.\" A \"small organization\"\r\nis defined, for this subsection only, as an organization having fewer than 200 employees.\r\nThis modification is intended to assist smaller organizations that previously may have been\r\nautomatically precluded, because of their size, from arguing for a culpability score reduction\r\nbased upon an effective compliance and ethics program that fulfills all of the guideline\r\nrequirements. Rather than precluding absolutely these small organizations from obtaining\r\nthe reduction if certain categories of high-level personnel are involved in the offense of\r\nconviction, §8C2.5(f)(3) establishes that an offense by an individual within high-level\r\npersonnel of the organization results in a rebuttable presumption for a small organization that\r\nit did not have an effective program. The small organization, however, can rebut that\r\npresumption by demonstrating that it had an effective program, despite the involvement in\r\nthe offense of a person high in the organization’s structure.\r\nThis amendment also addresses concerns about the relationship between obtaining credit\r\nunder §8C2.5(g) and waiver of the attorney-client privilege and the work product protection\r\ndoctrine. Pursuant to §8C2.5(g)(1) and (2), an organization’s culpability score will be\r\nreduced if it \"fully cooperated in the investigation\" of its wrongdoing, among other factors.\r\nThe Commission’s Ad Hoc Advisory Group on the Organizational Sentencing Guidelines\r\nstudied the relationship between waivers and §8C2.5(g) by obtaining testimony and\r\nconducting its own research, including a survey of United States Attorneys’ Offices (all of\r\nwhich are described at Part V of the Advisory Group Report of October 7, 2003). The\r\nCommission addresses some of these concerns by providing at Application Note 12 that\r\nwaiver of the attorney-client privilege and of work product protections \"is not a prerequisite\r\nto a reduction in culpability score under subdivisions (1) and (2) of subsection (g) unless\r\nsuch waiver is necessary in order to provide timely and thorough disclosure of all pertinent\r\ninformation known to the organization.\" The Commission expects that such waivers will be\r\nrequired on a limited basis.

A sentence under 18 U.S.C. § 844(h), § 924(c), or § 929(a) accounts\r\nfor the conduct covered by subsections (b)(3)(A) and (c)(2) because of the\r\nrelatedness of the conduct covered by these subsections to the conduct that\r\nforms the basis for the conviction under 18 U.S.C. § 844(h), § 924(c), or\r\n§ 929(a).\r\nIn a few cases, the rule provided in the preceding paragraph may result in\r\na guideline range that, when combined with the mandatory consecutive\r\nsentence under 18 U.S.C. § 844(h), § 924(c), or § 929(a), produces a total\r\nmaximum penalty that is less than the maximum of the guideline range that\r\nwould have resulted had there not been a count of conviction under 18\r\nU.S.C. § 844(h), § 924(c), or § 929(a) (i.e., the guideline range that would\r\nhave resulted if subsections (b)(3)(A) and (c)(2) had been applied).

Family Ties and Responsibilities (Policy Statement)\r\nIn sentencing a defendant convicted of an offense other than an\r\noffense described in the following paragraph, family ties and\r\nresponsibilities are not ordinarily relevant in determining whether\r\na departure may be warranted.\r\nIn sentencing a defendant convicted of an offense involving a\r\nminor victim under section 1201, an offense under section 1591, or\r\nan offense under chapter 71, 109A, 110, or 117, of title 18, United\r\n\r\nStates Code, family ties and responsibilities and community ties are\r\nnot relevant in determining whether a sentence should be below the\r\napplicable guideline range.\r\nFamily responsibilities that are complied with may be relevant to\r\nthe determination of the amount of restitution or fine.\".\r\nThe Commentary to §5H1.6 is amended by adding at the end the following:\r\n\"Background: Section 401(b)(4) of Public Law 108–21 directly amended this policy\r\nstatement to add the second paragraph, effective April 30, 2003.\".\r\nSection 5H1.11 is amended by striking \"sentence should be outside the applicable guideline\r\nrange\" and inserting \"departure is warranted\".\r\nSection 5H1.12 is amended by striking \"grounds for imposing a sentence outside the\r\napplicable guideline range\" and inserting \"in determining whether a departure is warranted\".\r\nSection 5K2.12 is amended by striking \"decrease the sentence below the applicable guideline\r\nrange\" and inserting \"depart downward\".\r\nSection 5K2.13 is amended by striking \"sentence below the applicable guideline range\" and\r\ninserting \"downward departure\".\r\nSection 5K2.14 is amended by striking \"increase the sentence above the guideline range\" and\r\ninserting \"depart upward\".\r\nSection 5K2.16 is amended by striking \"departure below the applicable guideline range for\r\nthat offense\" and inserting \"downward departure\".\r\nSection 5K2.21 is amended by striking \"increase the sentence above the guideline range\" and\r\ninserting \"depart upward\".\r\nSection 5K2.22 is amended by striking \"impose a sentence below the applicable guideline\r\nrange\" each place it appears and inserting \"depart downward\"; and by striking \"for imposing\r\na sentence below the guidelines\" and inserting \"to depart downward\".\r\nSection 5K2.23 is amended by striking \"sentence below the applicable guideline range\" and\r\ninserting \"downward departure\".\r\nSection 6A1.1 is amended by striking the following:\r\n\"A probation officer shall conduct a presentence investigation and report to the court\r\nbefore the imposition of sentence unless the court finds that there is information in\r\nthe record sufficient to enable the meaningful exercise of sentencing authority\r\npursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3553, and the court explains this finding on the record.\r\nRule 32(b)(1), Fed.

R. Crim. P.\r\n(b) The defendant may not waive preparation of the presentence report.\".\r\nThe Commentary to §6A1.1 is amended by striking:\r\n\" A thorough presentence investigation is essential in determining the facts\r\nrelevant to sentencing. In order to ensure that the sentencing judge will have\r\ninformation sufficient to determine the appropriate sentence, Congress deleted\r\nprovisions of Rule 32(c), Fed. R. Crim. P., which previously permitted the defendant\r\nto waive the presentence report. Rule 32(b)(1) permits the judge to dispense with\r\na presentence report, but only after explaining, on the record, why sufficient\r\ninformation is already available.\",\r\nand inserting the following:\r\n\" A thorough presentence investigation ordinarily is essential in determining\r\nthe facts relevant to sentencing. Rule 32(c)(1)(A) permits the judge to dispense with\r\na presentence report in certain limited circumstances, as when a specific statute\r\nrequires or when the court finds sufficient information in the record to enable it to\r\nexercise its statutory sentencing authority meaningfully and explains its finding on\r\nthe record.\".\r\nChapter Six, Part A is amended by striking §6A1.2 and its accompanying commentary as\r\nfollows:\r\n\"§6A1.2. Disclosure of Presentence Report; Issues in Dispute (Policy\r\nStatement)\r\nCourts should adopt procedures to provide for the timely disclosure\r\nof the presentence report; the narrowing and resolution, where\r\nfeasible, of issues in dispute in advance of the sentencing hearing;\r\nand the identification for the court of issues remaining in dispute.\r\nRule 32(b)(6), Fed.

An objecting party must provide a copy of its\r\nobjections to the opposing party and to the probation\r\nofficer. After receiving objections, the probation officer\r\nmay meet with the parties to discuss the objections. The\r\nprobation officer may then investigate further and revise\r\nthe presentence report accordingly. Rule 32(f), Fed. R.\r\nCrim.

R. Crim. P.\".\r\nSection 6A1.3(b) is amended by striking \"Rule 32(c)(1)\" and inserting \"Rule 32(i)\".\r\nThe Commentary to §6A1.3 is amended by striking the first paragraph as follows:\r\n\r\n\" In pre-guidelines practice, factors relevant to sentencing were often\r\ndetermined in an informal fashion. The informality was to some extent explained\r\nby the fact that particular offense and offender characteristics rarely had a highly\r\nspecific or required sentencing consequence. This situation no longer exists under\r\nsentencing guidelines. The court’s resolution of disputed sentencing factors usually\r\nhas a measurable effect on the applicable punishment. More formality is therefore\r\nunavoidable if the sentencing process is to be accurate and fair.\";\r\nby striking \"117 S. Ct. 633, 635\" and inserting \"519 U.S. 148, 154\"; and by striking \"117 S.\r\nCt. at 637\" and inserting \"519 U.S. at 157\".\r\nChapter Six, Part A is amended by adding at the end the following:\r\n\"§6A1.4. Notice of Possible Departure (Policy Statement)\r\nBefore the court may depart from the applicable sentencing\r\nguideline range on a ground not identified for departure either in\r\nthe presentence report or in a party’s prehearing submission, the\r\ncourt must give the parties reasonable notice that it is\r\ncontemplating such a departure. The notice must specify any\r\nground on which the court is contemplating a departure. Rule\r\n32(h), Fed. R. Crim. P.\r\nCommentary\r\nBackground: The Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure were amended, effective\r\nDecember 1, 2002, to incorporate into Rule 32(h) the holding in Burns v. United\r\nStates, 501 U.S. 129, 138-39 (1991). This policy statement parallels Rule 32(h),\r\nFed. R. Crim. P.\".\r\nChapter Six, Part B is amended by striking the Introductory Commentary as follows:\r\n\" Introductory Commentary\r\nPolicy statements governing the acceptance of plea agreements under\r\nRule 11(e)(1), Fed. R. Crim. P., are intended to ensure that plea negotiation\r\npractices:\r\n(1) promote the statutory purposes of sentencing prescribed in\r\n18 U.S.C. § 3553(a); and\r\n(2) do not perpetuate unwarranted sentencing disparity.\r\nThese policy statements are a first step toward implementing 28 U.S.C.\r\n§ 994(a)(2)(E). Congress indicated that it expects judges ‘to examine plea\r\nagreements to make certain that prosecutors have not used plea bargaining to\r\nundermine the sentencing guidelines.’ S. Rep. 98-225, 98th Cong., 1st Sess. 63, 167\r\n(1983). In pursuit of this goal, the Commission shall study plea agreement practice\r\nunder the guidelines and ultimately develop standards for judges to use in\r\n\r\ndetermining whether to accept plea agreements. Because of the difficulty in\r\nanticipating problems in this area, and because the sentencing guidelines are\r\nthemselves to some degree experimental, substantive restrictions on judicial\r\ndiscretion would be premature at this stage of the Commission’s work.\r\nThe present policy statements move in the desired direction in two ways.\r\nFirst, the policy statements make clear that sentencing is a judicial function and that\r\nthe appropriate sentence in a guilty plea case is to be determined by the judge. This\r\nis a reaffirmation of pre-guidelines practice. Second, the policy statements ensure\r\nthat the basis for any judicial decision to depart from the guidelines will be\r\nexplained on the record. Explanations will be carefully analyzed by the\r\nCommission and will pave the way for more detailed policy statements presenting\r\nsubstantive criteria to achieve consistency in this aspect of the sentencing process.\",\r\nand inserting the following:\r\n\" Introductory Commentary\r\nPolicy statements governing the acceptance of plea agreements under\r\nRule 11(c), Fed. R. Crim. P., are intended to ensure that plea negotiation practices:\r\n(1) promote the statutory purposes of sentencing prescribed in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a);\r\nand (2) do not perpetuate unwarranted sentencing disparity.\r\nThese policy statements make clear that sentencing is a judicial function\r\nand that the appropriate sentence in a guilty plea case is to be determined by the\r\njudge. The policy statements also ensure that the basis for any judicial decision to\r\ndepart from the guidelines will be explained on the record.\".\r\nSection 6B1.1 is amended by striking subsections (a), (b), and (c) as follows:\r\n\"(a) If the parties have reached a plea agreement, the court shall, on the record,\r\nrequire disclosure of the agreement in open court or, on a showing of good\r\ncause, in camera. Rule 11(e)(2), Fed. R. Crim. P.\r\n(b) If the plea agreement includes a nonbinding recommendation pursuant to\r\nRule 11(e)(1)(B), the court shall advise the defendant that the court is not\r\nbound by the sentencing recommendation, and that the defendant has no\r\nright to withdraw the defendant’s guilty plea if the court decides not to\r\naccept the sentencing recommendation set forth in the plea agreement.\r\n(c) The court shall defer its decision to accept or reject any nonbinding\r\nrecommendation pursuant to Rule 11(e)(1)(B), and the court’s decision to\r\naccept or reject any plea agreement pursuant to Rules 11(e)(1)(A) and\r\n11(e)(1)(C) until there has been an opportunity to consider the presentence\r\nreport, unless a report is not required under §6A1.1.\",\r\nand inserting the following:\r\n\"(a) The parties must disclose the plea agreement in open court when the plea\r\n\r\nis offered, unless the court for good cause allows the parties to disclose the\r\nplea agreement in camera.

Rule 11(e)(2) gives the court discretion to accept the\r\nplea agreement immediately or defer acceptance pending consideration of the\r\npresentence report. Prior to the guidelines, an immediate decision was permissible\r\nbecause, under Rule 32(c), Fed. R. Crim. P., the defendant could waive preparation\r\nof the presentence report. Section 6B1.1(c) reflects the changes in practice required\r\nby §6A1.1 (Presentence Report) and amended Rule 32(c)(1). Since a presentence\r\nreport normally will be prepared, the court must defer acceptance of the plea\r\nagreement until the court has had an opportunity to consider the presentence\r\nreport.\",\r\nand inserting the following:\r\n\" Section 6B1.1(c) deals with the timing of the court’s decision regarding\r\nwhether to accept or reject the plea agreement. Rule 11(c)(3)(A) gives the court\r\ndiscretion to accept or reject the plea agreement immediately or defer a decision\r\npending consideration of the presentence report. Given that a presentence report\r\nnormally will be prepared, the Commission recommends that the court defer\r\nacceptance of the plea agreement until the court has reviewed the presentence\r\nreport.\".\r\nSection 6B1.3 is amended by striking:\r\n\"If a plea agreement pursuant to Rule 11(e)(1)(A) or Rule 11(e)(1)(C) is rejected,\r\nthe court shall afford the defendant an opportunity to withdraw the defendant’s\r\nguilty plea.

L. 108–21 (the \"PROTECT Act\").\r\nThird, this amendment corrects an error in an example provided in Application Note 3(B)(iii)\r\nof §5G1.2 (Sentencing on Multiple Counts of Conviction).\r\nFourth, this amendment generally updates Chapter Six (Sentencing Procedures and Plea\r\nAgreements) in response to a number of amendments that were made to the Federal Rules\r\nof Criminal Procedure effective December 1, 2002. While some of these changes to the\r\nRules were substantive, the bulk of the changes to Rules 11 and 32 of the Federal Rules of\r\nCriminal Procedure were organizational and stylistic. These guideline amendments conform\r\nto those changes made to the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure with respect to such issues\r\nas deadlines for disputed issues and requirements for disclosure of presentence reports, as\r\nwell as procedures the court must follow in rejecting certain plea agreements. Certain\r\noutdated commentary also has been deleted.\r\n\r\nFifth, this amendment broadens the special multiple victim rule in Application Note 4(C)(ii)\r\nof §2B1.1 (Larceny, Embezzlement, and Other Forms of Theft; Offenses Involving Stolen\r\nProperty; Property Damage or Destruction; Fraud and Deceit; Forgery; Offenses Involving\r\nAltered or Counterfeit Instruments Other than Counterfeit Bearer Obligations of the United\r\nStates), as redesignated by Amendment 3 of this document, for offenses involving stolen\r\nUnited States mail. The rule is expanded to include theft of mail from housing unit cluster\r\nboxes, whether owned by the United States Postal Service or otherwise. The amendment\r\nprovides a presumption that a theft from such a cluster box involves the number of victims\r\ncorresponding to the number of mailboxes contained in the cluster box. The same rationale\r\nfor the original special rule applies to this expansion: (i) unique proof problems in that once\r\nentry is gained to such a cluster box and mail is removed, it is difficult to determine the\r\nnumber of persons from whom mail was stolen; (ii) the frequently significant, but difficult\r\nto quantify, non-monetary losses; and (iii) the importance of maintaining the integrity of the\r\nUnited States mail service. See USSG App. C (Vol. II) (Amendment 617). These reasons\r\nare equally valid whether the mail receptacle is owned by the United States Postal Service\r\nor is privately owned.\r\nSixth, this amendment modifies §2B1.1(b)(10), as redesignated by Amendment 3 of this\r\ndocument, which provides a two-level enhancement and a minimum offense level of 12, in\r\nresponse to the Secure Authentication Feature and Enhanced Identification Defense Act of\r\n2003 (the \"SAFE ID Act\") (section 607 of the PROTECT Act, Pub. L. 108–21). That Act\r\ncreated a new offense at 18 U.S.C. § 1028(a)(8), prohibiting the trafficking of authentication\r\nfeatures (e.g., a hologram or symbol used by a government agency to determine whether a\r\ndocument is counterfeit, altered, or otherwise falsified), and amended 18 U.S.C. § 1028 to\r\nprohibit the transfer or possession of authentication features. This amendment makes\r\n§2B1.1(b)(10) applicable to offenses involving authentication features.\r\nSeventh, this amendment creates a new guideline at §2X6.1 (Use of a Minor to Commit a\r\nCrime of Violence). This new guideline is in response to a new offense provided at\r\n18 U.S.C. § 25 (Use of Minors in Crimes of Violence), which was created by section 601 of\r\nthe PROTECT Act. The new offense prohibits any person 18 years of age or older from\r\nintentionally using a minor to commit a crime of violence or to assist in avoiding detection\r\nor apprehension for such offense. For a first conviction, the penalty is twice the maximum\r\nterm of imprisonment that would otherwise be authorized for the offense, and for each\r\nsubsequent conviction, three times the maximum term of imprisonment that would otherwise\r\nbe authorized for the offense.\r\nWhile consideration was given to expanding the existing two-level adjustment at §3B1.4\r\n(Using a Minor to Commit a Crime), the Commission determined it was more appropriate\r\nand consistent with guideline construction to create a new guideline for the new substantive\r\noffense created by Congress in the PROTECT Act. This new guideline at §2X6.1 directs the\r\ncourt to increase by 4 levels the offense level from the guideline applicable to the underlying\r\ncrime of violence. Application notes are included to provide that the adjustment under\r\n§3B1.4 is inapplicable if §2X6.1 is used and to provide rules for the grouping of multiple\r\ncounts.\r\nEighth, this amendment expands the definition of \"crime of violence\" in Application Note\r\n1 to §4B1.2 (Definitions of Terms Used in Section 4B1.1) to include unlawful possession\r\nof any firearm described in 26 U.S.C. § 5845(a). The amendment also excepts possession\r\n\r\nAmendment 675 APPENDIX C - VOLUME III November 1, 2011\r\nof those firearms described in 26 U.S.C. § 5845(a) from the rule that excludes felon in\r\npossession offenses from the definition of \"crime of violence.\" Congress has determined that\r\nthose firearms described in 26 U.S.C. § 5845(a) are inherently dangerous and when\r\npossessed unlawfully, serve only violent purposes. In the National Firearms Act, Pub. L.\r\n90–618, Congress required that these firearms be registered with the National Firearms\r\nRegistration and Transfer Record. A number of courts have held that possession of certain\r\nof these firearms, such as a sawed-off shotgun, is a \"crime of violence\" due to the serious\r\npotential risk of physical injury to another person. The amendment’s categorical rule\r\nincorporating 26 U.S.C. § 5845(a) firearms includes short-barreled rifles and shotguns,\r\nmachine guns, silencers, and destructive devices. It will affect determinations both of career\r\noffender status under Chapter Four, Part B and also of appropriate base offense levels in\r\n§2K2.1 (Unlawful Receipt, Possession, or Transportation of Firearms or Ammunition;\r\nProhibited Transactions Involving Firearms or Ammunition).\r\nNinth, this amendment provides an application note in §4B1.4 (Armed Career Criminal) to\r\naddress an apparent \"double counting\" issue that appears to be present when a defendant is\r\nconvicted both of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g) (Felon in Possession) and also of an offense such as\r\n18 U.S.C. § 924(c) (Use of a Firearm in Relation to Any Crime of Violence or Drug\r\nTrafficking Crime) or a similar offense carrying a mandatory minimum consecutive penalty,\r\nsuch as 18 U.S.C. § 844(h) relating to use of explosives, or 18 U.S.C. § 929(a) relating to\r\nuse of restricted ammunition.\r\nThe basis for the mandatory minimum, consecutive penalties in these offenses is the same\r\nas the basis for the enhanced guideline offense level 34 at §4B1.4(b)(3)(A) and the enhanced\r\nCriminal History Category VI at §4B1.4(c)(2); i.e., the use or possession of the firearm in\r\nconnection with a crime of violence or controlled substance offense. The Commission\r\ndetermined that the mandatory minimum, consecutive sentences in these statutes are\r\nsufficient to take into account the aggravated conduct referenced in §4B1.4.\r\nAn upward departure is provided for those cases that result in a total maximum penalty that\r\nis less than the maximum of the guideline range that would have resulted if the enhanced\r\noffense level under §4B1.4(b)(3)(A) and the criminal history enhancement under\r\n§4B1.4(c)(2) had been applied. However, the extent of the upward departure shall not\r\nexceed the maximum of the guideline range that would have resulted had there not been a\r\nconviction under 18 U.S.C. § 924(c), § 844(h), or § 929(a).","EffectiveDate":"Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2004."},{"Id":675,"Title":"Amendment 675","Text":"Section 2B5.3(b) is amended by redesignating subsections (b)(2) through\r\n(b)(4) as subsections (b)(3) through (b)(5), respectively; and by inserting after subsection\r\n(b)(1) the following:\r\n\"(2) If the offense involved the display, performance, publication, reproduction,\r\nor distribution of a work being prepared for commercial distribution,\r\nincrease by 2 levels.\".\r\nThe Commentary to §2B5.3 captioned \"Application Notes\" is amended in Note 1 by striking\r\nthe last paragraph as follows:\r\n\r\n\"‘Uploading’ means making an infringing item available on the Internet or a similar\r\nelectronic bulletin board with the intent to enable other persons to download or\r\notherwise copy, or have access to, the infringing item.\",\r\nand inserting the following:\r\n\"‘Uploading’ means making an infringing item available on the Internet or a similar\r\nelectronic bulletin board with the intent to enable other persons to (A) download or\r\notherwise copy the infringing item; or (B) have access to the infringing item,\r\nincluding by storing the infringing item in an openly shared file. ‘Uploading’ does\r\nnot include merely downloading or installing an infringing item on a hard drive on\r\na defendant’s personal computer unless the infringing item is placed in an openly\r\nshared file.\r\n‘Work being prepared for commercial distribution’ has the meaning given that term\r\nin 17 U.S.C. § 506(a)(3).\".\r\nThe Commentary to §2B5.3 captioned \"Application Notes\" is amended in Note 2 in\r\nsubdivision (A) by inserting after subdivision (v) the following:\r\n\"(vi) The offense involves the display, performance, publication, reproduction,\r\nor distribution of a work being prepared for commercial distribution.

The directive, which\r\nrequires the Commission to promulgate an amendment under emergency amendment\r\nauthority by October 24, 2005, instructs the Commission to \"review and, if appropriate,\r\namend the Federal sentencing guidelines and policy statements applicable to persons\r\nconvicted of intellectual property rights crimes...\"\r\n\"In carrying out [the directive], the Commission shall—\r\n(1) take all appropriate measures to ensure that the Federal sentencing\r\nguidelines and policy statements...are sufficiently stringent to deter, and adequately reflect\r\nthe nature of, intellectual property rights crimes;\r\n(2) determine whether to provide a sentencing enhancement for those\r\nconvicted of the offenses [involving intellectual property rights], if the conduct\r\ninvolves the display, performance, publication, reproduction, or distribution of a\r\ncopyrighted work before it has been authorized by the copyright owner, whether in\r\nthe media format used by the infringing party or in any other media format;\r\n(3) determine whether the scope of ‘uploading’ set forth in application note\r\n3 of section 2B5.3 of the Federal sentencing guidelines is adequate to address the\r\nloss attributable to people who, without authorization, broadly distribute\r\ncopyrighted works over the Internet; and\r\n(4) determine whether the sentencing guideline and policy statements\r\napplicable to the offenses [involving intellectual property rights] adequately reflect\r\nany harm to victims from copyright infringement if law enforcement authorities\r\ncannot determine how many times copyrighted material has been reproduced or\r\ndistributed.\"\r\nPre-Release Works\r\nThe amendment provides a separate two-level enhancement if the offense involved a pre-\r\nrelease work. The enhancement and the corresponding definition use language directly from\r\n17 U.S.C. § 506(a) (criminal infringement). The amendment adds language to Application\r\nNote 2 that explains that in cases involving pre-release works, the infringement amount\r\nshould be determined by using the retail value of the infringed item, rather than any premium\r\nprice attributed to the infringing item because of its pre-release status. The amendment\r\naddresses concerns that distribution of an item before it is legally available to the consumer\r\nis more serious conduct than distribution of other infringing items and involves a harm not\r\naddressed by the current guideline.\r\nUploading\r\nThe concern underlying the uploading directive pertains to offenses in which the copyrighted\r\nwork is transferred through file sharing. The amendment builds on the current definition of\r\n\"uploading\" to include making an infringing item available on the Internet by storing an\r\ninfringing item in an openly shared file. The amendment also clarifies that uploading does\r\nnot include merely downloading or installing infringing items on a hard drive of the\r\ndefendant’s computer unless the infringing item is in an openly shared file. By clarifying\r\nthe definition of uploading in this manner, Application Note 3, which is a restatement of the\r\nuploading definition, is no longer necessary and the amendment deletes the application note\r\nfrom the guideline.\r\n\r\nNovember 1, 2011 APPENDIX C - VOLUME III Amendment 676\r\nIndeterminate Number\r\nThe amendment addresses the final directive by amending Application Note 2, which sets\r\nforth the rules for determining the infringement amount. The note provides that the court\r\nmay make a reasonable estimate of the infringement amount using any relevant information\r\nincluding financial records in cases in which the court cannot determine the number of\r\ninfringing items.\r\nNew Offense\r\nFinally, the amendment provides a reference in Appendix A (Statutory Index) for the new\r\noffense at 18 U.S.C. § 2319B.

Imposition of Sentence.—\r\n(A) In General.—Section 1028A of title 18, United State Code,\r\nprovides a mandatory term of imprisonment. Accordingly, the\r\nguideline sentence for a defendant convicted under 18 U.S.C. §\r\n1028A is the term required by that statute. Except as provided in\r\nsubdivision (B), 18 U.S.C. § 1028A also requires a term of\r\nimprisonment imposed under this section to run consecutively to\r\nany other term of imprisonment.\r\n(B) Multiple Convictions Under Section 1028A.—Section 1028A(b)(4)\r\nof title 18, United State Code, provides that in the case of multiple\r\nconvictions under 18 U.S.C. § 1028A, the terms of imprisonment\r\nimposed on such counts may, in the discretion of the court, run\r\nconcurrently, in whole or in part, with each other.

However, 18 U.S.C. § 1028A(b)(4)\r\npermits the court, in its discretion, to impose the mandatory term of\r\nimprisonment on a defendant for a violation of such section ‘concurrently,\r\nin whole or in part, only with another term of imprisonment that is imposed\r\nby the court at the same time on that person for an additional violation of\r\nthis section, provided that such discretion shall be exercised in accordance\r\nwith any applicable guidelines and policy statements issued by the\r\nSentencing Commission. . .’.\r\nIn determining whether multiple counts of 18 U.S.C. § 1028A should run\r\nconcurrently with, or consecutively to, each other, the court should consider\r\nthe following non-exhaustive list of factors:\r\n(i) The nature and seriousness of the underlying offenses. For\r\n\r\nexample, the court should consider the appropriateness of imposing\r\nconsecutive, or partially consecutive, terms of imprisonment for\r\nmultiple counts of 18 U.S.C. § 1028A in a case in which an\r\nunderlying offense for one of the 18 U.S.C. § 1028A offenses is a\r\ncrime of violence or an offense enumerated in 18 U.S.C. §\r\n2332b(g)(5)(B).\r\n(ii) Whether the underlying offenses are groupable under §3D1.2\r\n(Multiple Counts). Generally, multiple counts of 18 U.S.C. §\r\n1028A should run concurrently with one another in cases in which\r\nthe underlying offenses are groupable under §3D1.2.\r\n(iii) Whether the purposes of sentencing set forth in 18 U.S.C. §\r\n3553(a)(2) are better achieved by imposing a concurrent or a\r\nconsecutive sentence for multiple counts of 18 U.S.C. § 1028A.\r\n(C) Imposition of Supervised Release.—In the case of a consecutive term of\r\nimprisonment imposed under subsection (a), any term of supervised release\r\nimposed is to run concurrently with any other term of supervised release\r\nimposed.

L. 108–275, 118 Stat. 831 (\"the Act\"), which create\r\ntwo new criminal offenses at 18 U.S.C. § 1028A and direct the Sentencing Commission to\r\nexpand the upward adjustment at §3B1.3 (Abuse of Position of Trust or Use of Special\r\nSkill). This amendment also provides guidance to the courts on imposing sentences for\r\nmultiple violations of section 1028A.\r\nThe Act creates a new offense at 18 U.S.C. § 1028A(a)(1) that prohibits the unauthorized\r\ntransfer, use, or possession of a means of identification of another person during, or in\r\nrelation to, specific enumerated felonies. These felonies consist of various types of fraud,\r\nincluding mail and wire fraud in connection with passports, visas and other immigration,\r\nnationality, and citizenship laws, programs under the Social Security Act, and the acquisition\r\nof firearms. A conviction under section 1028A(a)(1) carries a two-year mandatory term of\r\nimprisonment that must run consecutively to any other term of imprisonment, including the\r\nsentence for the underlying felony conviction. The Act also creates a new offense at 18\r\nU.S.C. § 1028A(b)(1) that prohibits the unauthorized transfer, use, or possession of a means\r\nof identification of another person during, or in relation to, specific felonies enumerated in\r\n18 U.S.C. § 2332b(g)(5)(B) (\"federal crimes of terrorism\"). Section 1028A(b)(1) provides\r\na five-year mandatory term of imprisonment that must run consecutively to any other term\r\nof imprisonment, including the sentence for the underlying felony conviction. As described\r\nbelow, section 1028A(b)(4) creates an exception to the requirement for consecutive terms\r\nof imprisonment in cases involving multiple violations of the statute sentenced at the same\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nNovember 1, 2011 APPENDIX C - VOLUME III Amendment 678\r\nFirst, in response to the creation of these new criminal offenses, the amendment creates a\r\nnew guideline at §2B1.6 (Aggravated Identity Theft). This guideline is patterned after\r\n§2K2.4 (Use of Firearm, Armor-Piercing Ammunition, or Explosive During or in Relation\r\nto Certain Crimes). Because the new offenses carry a fixed, mandatory consecutive term\r\nof imprisonment, the new guideline, as does §2K2.4, provides that the guideline sentence is\r\nthe term of imprisonment required by statute. To avoid unwarranted double-counting, the\r\namendment contains an application note that prohibits the application of any specific offense\r\ncharacteristic for the transfer, possession, or use of a means of identification when\r\ndetermining the sentence for the underlying offense in cases in which a sentence under\r\n§2B1.6 is imposed in conjunction with a sentence for an underlying offense. Also,\r\nconsistent with §2K2.4, the new guideline at §2B1.6 contains an application note that\r\nprovides that adjustments under Chapters Three and Four are inapplicable to sentences under\r\nthis guideline.\r\nSecond, in response to the directive in section 5 to amend §3B1.3 (Abuse of Position of\r\nTrust or Use of Special Skill) to include a \"defendant [who] exceeds or abuses the authority\r\nof his or her position in order to obtain unlawfully or use without authority any means of\r\nidentification,\" the Commission created Application Note 2 to §3B1.3 to include such\r\ndefendants within the scope of the guideline. The application note contains several examples\r\nto illustrate the types of conduct intended to be within the scope of the new provision.\r\nThird, the amendment adds a number of provisions at appropriate guidelines in order to\r\nprovide guidance to courts in accordance with section 2 of the Act (18 U.S.C. §\r\n1028A(b)(4)). That section states that \"a term of imprisonment imposed on a person for\r\nviolation of this section may, in the discretion of the court, run concurrently, in whole or in\r\npart, only with another term of imprisonment that is imposed by the court at the same time\r\non that person for an additional violation of this section, provided that such discretion shall\r\nbe exercised in accordance with any applicable guidelines and policy statements issued by\r\nthe Sentencing Commission . . . .\" The amendment states a general rule, at §5G1.2\r\n(Sentencing on Multiple Counts of Conviction), Application Note 2(B), providing that the\r\ncourt has discretion to impose concurrent or consecutive, or partially concurrent and partially\r\nconsecutive, terms of imprisonment for multiple violations of 18 U.S.C. § 1028A. A\r\nnon-exhaustive list of factors for courts to consider in making this determination is provided,\r\nincluding the nature and seriousness of the underlying offenses and whether the offenses\r\nwould be groupable under §3D1.2 (Group of Closely Related Counts).\r\nFinally, the amendment modifies §3D1.1 (Procedure for Determining Offense Level on\r\nMultiple Counts) to make clear that section 1028A offenses are excluded from the general\r\ngrouping rules in §§3D1.2 - 3D1.5 and makes conforming additions and changes to the new\r\nguideline at §2B1.6 (Aggravated Identity Theft) in Application Note 1 and §3D1.1(b)(1) and\r\n(2).","EffectiveDate":"Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2005."},{"Id":678,"Title":"Amendment 678","Text":"Section 2R1.1(a) is amended by striking \"10\" and inserting \"12\".\r\nSection 2R1.1(b) is amended by striking subdivision (2) as follows:\r\n\r\n\"(2) If the volume of commerce attributable to the defendant was more than\r\n$400,000, adjust the offense level as follows:\r\nVolume of Adjustment to\r\nCommerce (Apply the Greatest) Offense Level\r\n(A) More than $400,000 add 1\r\n(B) More than $1,000,000 add 2\r\n(C) More than $2,500,000 add 3\r\n(D) More than $6,250,000 add 4\r\n(E) More than $15,000,000 add 5\r\n(F) More than $37,500,000 add 6\r\n(G) More than $100,000,000 add 7.\r\nFor purposes of this guideline, the volume of commerce attributable to an\r\nindividual participant in a conspiracy is the volume of commerce done by\r\nhim or his principal in goods or services that were affected by the violation.\r\nWhen multiple counts or conspiracies are involved, the volume of\r\ncommerce should be treated cumulatively to determine a single, combined\r\noffense level.\",\r\nand inserting the following:\r\n\"(2) If the volume of commerce attributable to the defendant was more than\r\n$1,000,000, adjust the offense level as follows:\r\nVolume of Adjustment to\r\nCommerce (Apply the Greatest) Offense Level\r\n(A) More than $1,000,000 add 2\r\n(B) More than $10,000,000 add 4\r\n(C) More than $40,000,000 add 6\r\n(D) More than $100,000,000 add 8\r\n(E) More than $250,000,000 add 10\r\n(F) More than $500,000,000 add 12\r\n(G) More than $1,000,000,000 add 14\r\n(H) More than $1,500,000,000 add 16.\r\nFor purposes of this guideline, the volume of commerce attributable to an\r\nindividual participant in a conspiracy is the volume of commerce done by\r\nhim or his principal in goods or services that were affected by the violation.\r\nWhen multiple counts or conspiracies are involved, the volume of\r\ncommerce should be treated cumulatively to determine a single, combined\r\noffense level.\".\r\nThe Commentary to §2R1.1 captioned \"Application Notes\" is amended by striking Note 1\r\nas follows:\r\n\"1. The provisions of §3B1.1 (Aggravating Role) and §3B1.2 (Mitigating Role)\r\nshould be applied to an individual defendant as appropriate to reflect the\r\n\r\nindividual’s role in committing the offense. For example, if a sales manager\r\norganizes or leads the price-fixing activity of five or more participants, a 4-\r\nlevel increase is called for under §3B1.1.

For example, if a sales manager organizes or\r\nleads the price-fixing activity of five or more participants, the 4-level\r\nincrease at §3B1.1(a) should be applied to reflect the defendant’s\r\naggravated role in the offense.

L. 108–237 (the \"Act\"). The Act increased the\r\nstatutory maximum term of imprisonment for antitrust offenses under 15 U.S.C. §§ 1 and\r\n3(b) from three to ten years. The amendment responds to congressional concern about the\r\nseriousness of antitrust offenses and provides for antitrust penalties that are more\r\nproportionate to those for sophisticated frauds sentenced under §2B1.1 (Larceny,\r\nEmbezzlement, and Other Forms of Theft; Offenses Involving Stolen Property; Property\r\nDamage or Destruction; Fraud and Deceit; Forgery; Offenses Involving Altered or\r\nCounterfeit Instruments Other than Counterfeit Bearer Obligations of the United States).\r\nThe Commission has long recognized the similarity of antitrust offenses to sophisticated\r\nfrauds.\r\nThe amendment increases the base offense level for antitrust offenses in §2R1.1 (Bid-\r\nRigging, Price-Fixing or Market-Allocation Agreements Among Competitors ) to level 12.\r\nThe higher base offense level ensures that penalties for antitrust offenses will be coextensive\r\nwith those for sophisticated frauds sentenced under §2B1.1 and recognizes congressional\r\nconcern about the inherent seriousness of antitrust offenses. The penalties for sophisticated\r\nfraud have been increased incrementally due to a series of amendments to §2B1.1, while no\r\ncommensurate increases for antitrust offenses had occurred. Raising the base offense level\r\nof §2R1.1 helps restore the historic proportionality in the treatment of antitrust offenses and\r\nsophisticated frauds.\r\nThe \"volume of commerce\" table at §2R1.1(b)(2) is amended to provide up to 16 additional\r\noffense levels for the defendant whose offense involves more than $1,500,000,000, while\r\nthe new table’s first threshold is raised from $400,000 to $1,000,000. The new volume of\r\ncommerce table: (1) recognizes the depreciation in the value of the dollar since the table was\r\nlast revised in 1991; (2) responds to data indicating that the financial magnitude of antitrust\r\noffenses has increased significantly; and (3) provides greater deterrence of large scale price-\r\nfixing crimes.\r\nApplication Note 1 to §2R1.1 is amended to emphasize the potential relevance of such\r\nChapter Three enhancements as §3B1.1 (Aggravating Role), §3B1.3 (Abuse of Position of\r\nTrust or Use of Special Skill), and §3C1.1 (Obstructing or Impeding the Administration of\r\nJustice) in determining the appropriate sentence for an antitrust offender.

In the case of a defendant subject to a sentence enhancement under 18\r\n\r\nU.S.C. § 3147 (Penalty for an Offense Committed While on Release), see\r\n§2J1.7 (Commission of Offense While on Release).\";\r\nand by redesignating Note 7 as Note 6.\r\nSection 2D1.1(c) is amended by striking \"(or the equivalent amount of other Schedule I or\r\nII Opiates)\" each place it appears; by striking \"(or the equivalent amount of other Schedule\r\nI or II Stimulants)\" each place it appears; and by striking \"(or the equivalent amount of other\r\nSchedule I or II Hallucinogens)\" each place it appears.\r\nSection 2D1.1(d)(1) is amended by inserting \"or §2A1.2 (Second Degree Murder), as\r\nappropriate, if the resulting offense level is greater than that determined under this guideline\"\r\nafter \"Murder)\".\r\nThe Commentary to §2D1.1 captioned \"Application Notes\" is amended in Note 10 in the first\r\nparagraph by striking the third and fourth sentences as follows:\r\n\"The Drug Equivalency Tables set forth below provide conversion factors for other\r\nsubstances, which the Drug Quantity Table refers to as ‘equivalents’ of these drugs.\r\nFor example, one gram of a substance containing oxymorphone, a Schedule I opiate,\r\nis to be treated as the equivalent of five kilograms of marihuana in applying the\r\nDrug Quantity Table.\",\r\nand inserting the following:\r\n\"In the case of a controlled substance that is not specifically referenced in the Drug\r\nQuantity Table, determine the base offense level as follows:\r\n(A) Use the Drug Equivalency Tables to convert the quantity of the\r\ncontrolled substance involved in the offense to its equivalent\r\nquantity of marihuana.\r\n(B) Find the equivalent quantity of marihuana in the Drug Quantity\r\nTable.\r\n(C) Use the offense level that corresponds to the equivalent quantity of\r\nmarihuana as the base offense level for the controlled substance\r\ninvolved in the offense.\r\n(See also Application Note 5.)

In a case involving 100 gm\r\nof oxymorphone, the equivalent quantity of marihuana would be 500 kg, which\r\ncorresponds to a base offense level of 28 in the Drug Quantity Table.\".\r\nChapter Two, Part J is amended by striking §2J1.7 and its accompanying commentary as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n\"§2J1.7. Commission of Offense While on Release\r\nIf an enhancement under 18 U.S.C. § 3147 applies, add 3 levels to\r\nthe offense level for the offense committed while on release as if\r\nthis section were a specific offense characteristic contained in the\r\noffense guideline for the offense committed while on release.\r\nCommentary\r\nStatutory Provision: 18 U.S.C. § 3147.\r\nApplication Notes:\r\n1. Because 18 U.S.C. § 3147 is an enhancement provision, rather than an\r\noffense, this section provides a specific offense characteristic to increase the\r\noffense level for the offense committed while on release.\r\n2. Under 18 U.S.C. § 3147, a sentence of imprisonment must be imposed in\r\naddition to the sentence for the underlying offense, and the sentence of\r\nimprisonment imposed under 18 U.S.C. § 3147 must run consecutively to\r\nany other sentence of imprisonment. Therefore, the court, in order to\r\ncomply with the statute, should divide the sentence on the judgment form\r\nbetween the sentence attributable to the underlying offense and the sentence\r\nattributable to the enhancement. The court will have to ensure that the\r\n‘total punishment’ (i.e., the sentence for the offense committed while on\r\nrelease plus the sentence enhancement under 18 U.S.C. § 3147) is in accord\r\nwith the guideline range for the offense committed while on release, as\r\nadjusted by the enhancement in this section. For example, if the applicable\r\nadjusted guideline range is 30-37 months and the court determines ‘total\r\npunishment’ of 36 months is appropriate, a sentence of 30 months for the\r\nunderlying offense plus 6 months under 18 U.S.C. § 3147 would satisfy this\r\nrequirement.\r\nBackground: An enhancement under 18 U.S.C. § 3147 may be imposed only after\r\nsufficient notice to the defendant by the government or the court, and applies only\r\nin the case of a conviction for a federal offense that is committed while on release\r\non another federal charge.\r\nLegislative history indicates that the mandatory nature of the penalties\r\nrequired by 18 U.S.C. § 3147 was to be eliminated upon the implementation of the\r\nsentencing guidelines. ‘Section 213(h) [renumbered as §200(g) in the Crime\r\nControl Act of 1984] amends the new provision in title I of this Act relating to\r\nconsecutive enhanced penalties for committing an offense on release (new 18 U.S.C.\r\n§ 3147) by eliminating the mandatory nature of the penalties in favor of utilizing\r\nsentencing guidelines.’ (Senate Report 98-225 at 186). Not all of the phraseology\r\nrelating to the requirement of a mandatory sentence, however, was actually deleted\r\nfrom the statute. Consequently, it appears that the court is required to impose a\r\nconsecutive sentence of imprisonment under this provision, but there is no\r\nrequirement as to any minimum term. This guideline is drafted to enable the\r\n\r\ncourt to determine and implement a combined ‘total punishment’ consistent with the\r\noverall structure of the guidelines, while at the same time complying with the\r\nstatutory requirement. Guideline provisions that prohibit the grouping of counts of\r\nconviction requiring consecutive sentences (e.g., the introductory paragraph of\r\n§3D1.2; §5G1.2(a)) do not apply to this section because 18 U.S.C. § 3147 is an\r\nenhancement, not a count of conviction.\".\r\nChapter 3, Part C is amended in the heading by adding at the end \"AND RELATED\r\nADJUSTMENTS\".\r\nChapter Three, Part C is amended by adding at the end the following:\r\n\"§3C1.3. Commission of Offense While on Release\r\nIf a statutory sentencing enhancement under 18 U.S.C. § 3147\r\napplies, increase the offense level by 3 levels.\r\nCommentary\r\nApplication Note:\r\n1. Under 18 U.S.C. § 3147, a sentence of imprisonment must be imposed in\r\naddition to the sentence for the underlying offense, and the sentence of\r\nimprisonment imposed under 18 U.S.C. § 3147 must run consecutively to\r\nany other sentence of imprisonment. Therefore, the court, in order to\r\ncomply with the statute, should divide the sentence on the judgment form\r\nbetween the sentence attributable to the underlying offense and the sentence\r\nattributable to the enhancement. The court will have to ensure that the\r\n‘total punishment’ (i.e., the sentence for the offense committed while on\r\nrelease plus the statutory sentencing enhancement under 18 U.S.C. § 3147)\r\nis in accord with the guideline range for the offense committed while on\r\nrelease, as adjusted by the enhancement in this section. For example, if the\r\napplicable adjusted guideline range is 30-37 months and the court\r\ndetermines a ‘total punishment’ of 36 months is appropriate, a sentence of\r\n30 months for the underlying offense plus 6 months under 18 U.S.C. § 3147\r\nwould satisfy this requirement.\r\nBackground: An enhancement under 18 U.S.C. § 3147 applies, after appropriate\r\nsentencing notice, when a defendant is sentenced for an offense committed while\r\nreleased in connection with another federal offense.\r\nThis guideline enables the court to determine and implement a combined\r\n‘total punishment’ consistent with the overall structure of the guidelines, while at\r\nthe same time complying with the statutory requirement.\".","Reason":"Reason for Amendment: This amendment addresses several problematic areas of guideline\r\napplication. First, the amendment adds language to the cross reference at subsection (d) of\r\n§2D1.1 (Unlawful Manufacturing, Importing, Exporting, or Trafficking (Including\r\nPossession with Intent to Commit These Offenses); Attempt or Conspiracy) to allow the\r\napplication of §2A1.2 (Second Degree Murder) in cases in which the conduct\r\n\r\ninvolved is second degree murder, if the resulting offense level is greater than the offense\r\nlevel determined under §2D1.1.\r\nSecond, the amendment creates a new guideline at §3C1.3 (Commission of Offense While\r\non Release), which provides a three-level adjustment in cases in which the statutory\r\nsentencing enhancement at 18 U.S.C. § 3147 (Penalty for an offense committed while on\r\nrelease) applies. The amendment also deletes §2J1.7 (Commission of Offense While on\r\nRelease), the Chapter Two guideline to which the statutory enhancement at 18 U.S.C. § 3147\r\nhad been referenced prior to the amendment. Despite its reference in Appendix A (Statutory\r\nIndex), 18 U.S.C. § 3147 is not an offense of conviction and thus does not require reference\r\nin Appendix A. Creating a Chapter Three adjustment for 18 U.S.C. § 3147 cases ensures the\r\nenhancement is not overlooked and is consistent with other adjustments in Chapter Three,\r\nall of which apply to a broad range of offenses.\r\nThird, the amendment deletes from the Drug Quantity Table in §2D1.1(c) language that\r\nindicates the court should apply \"the equivalent amount of other Schedule I or II Opiates\"\r\n(in the line referenced to Heroin), \"the equivalent amount of other Schedule I or II\r\nStimulants\" (in the line referenced to Cocaine), and \"the equivalent amount of other\r\nSchedule I or II Hallucinogens\" (in the line referenced to LSD). This language caused some\r\nguideline users to erroneously calculate the base offense level without converting the\r\ncontrolled substance to its marihuana equivalency, even though Application Note 10 of\r\n§2D1.1 sets forth the marihuana equivalencies for substances not specifically referenced in\r\nthe Drug Quantity Table. For example, instead of converting 10 KG of morphine (an opiate)\r\nto 5000 KG of marihuana and determining the base offense level on that marihuana\r\nequivalency (resulting in a base offense level of 34), some guideline users determined the\r\nbase offense level on the 10 KG of morphine by using the equivalent amount of heroin\r\n(resulting in a base offense level of 36). This amendment deletes the problematic language\r\nand also clarifies in Application Note 10 that, for cases involving a substance not specifically\r\nreferenced in the Drug Quantity Table, the court is to determine the base offense level using\r\nthe marihuana equivalency for that controlled substance.","EffectiveDate":"Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2006."},{"Id":685,"Title":"Amendment 685","Text":"The Commentary to §2A1.1 captioned \"Statutory Provisions\" is amended by\r\ninserting \"1841(a)(2)(C),\" after \"1111,\".\r\nThe Commentary to §2A1.2 captioned \"Statutory Provisions\" is amended by inserting\r\n\"1841(a)(2)(C),\" after \"1111,\".\r\nThe Commentary to §2A1.3 captioned \"Statutory Provisions\" is amended by inserting\r\n\"1841(a)(2)(C),\" after \"1112,\".\r\nThe Commentary to §2A1.4 captioned \"Statutory Provisions\" is amended by inserting\r\n\"1841(a)(2)(C),\" after \"1112,\".\r\nThe Commentary to §2A2.1 captioned \"Statutory Provisions\" is amended by inserting\r\n\"1841(a)(2)(C),\" after \"1751(c),\".\r\nThe Commentary to §2A2.2 captioned \"Statutory Provisions\" is amended by inserting\r\n\r\n\"1841(a)(2)(C),\" after \"1751(e),\".\r\nSection 2B1.1(b)(6) is amended by inserting \"or veterans’ memorial\" after \"national\r\ncemetery\".\r\nThe Commentary to §2B1.1 captioned \"Statutory Provisions\" is amended by inserting\r\n\"1369,\" after \"1363,\".\r\nThe Commentary to §2B1.1 captioned \"Application Notes\" is amended in Note 1 by\r\ninserting after the paragraph that begins \"‘Trade secret’\" the following paragraph:\r\n\"‘Veterans’ memorial’ means any structure, plaque, statue, or other monument described in\r\n18 U.S.C. § 1369(a).\".\r\nSection 2B1.5(b)(2)(E) is amended by inserting \"or veterans’ memorial\" after \"cemetery\".\r\nThe Commentary to §2B1.5 captioned \"Statutory Provisions\" is amended by inserting\r\n\"1369,\" after \"1361,\".\r\nThe Commentary to §2B1.5 captioned \"Application Notes\" is amended in Note 3 in\r\nsubdivision (B) by striking \"has the meaning given that term\" and inserting \"and ‘veterans’\r\nmemorial’ have the meaning given those terms\".\r\nThe Commentary to §2N2.1 captioned \"Application Notes\" is amended by striking Note 3\r\nas follows:\r\n\"3.

L. 108–29. This Act created a new offense at 18 U.S.C.\r\n§ 1369 that prohibits the destruction of veterans’ memorials and imposes a ten-year statutory\r\nmaximum term of imprisonment. This amendment refers this new offense to both §§2B1.1\r\n(Theft, Property Destruction, and Fraud) and 2B1.5 (Theft of, Damage to, or Destruction of,\r\nCultural Heritage Resources), and broadens the application of the two-level enhancement\r\nunder both §§2B1.1(b)(6) and 2B1.5(b)(2) to include veterans’ memorials. The two-level\r\nenhancement at §2B1.1(b)(6), combined with the cross reference at §2B1.1(c)(4), ensures\r\nthat the penalty for the destruction of veterans’ memorials will reflect the status of a\r\nveterans’ memorial as a specially protected cultural heritage resource.\r\nSecond, this amendment addresses the Plant Protection Act of 2002, Pub. L. 107–171, which\r\ncreated a new offense under 7 U.S.C. § 7734 for knowingly importing or exporting plants,\r\nplant products, biological control organisms, and like products for distribution or sale. The\r\nstatutory maximum term of imprisonment for the first offense is five years, and for\r\nsubsequent offenses the statutory maximum term of imprisonment is ten years. This\r\namendment modifies Application Note 3 of §2N2.1 (Violations of Statutes and Regulations\r\nDealing with Any Food, Drug, Biological Product, Device, Cosmetic, or Agricultural\r\nProduct) to provide that an upward departure may be warranted if a defendant is convicted\r\n\r\nunder 7 U.S.C. § 7734.\r\nThird, this amendment addresses the Clean Diamond Trade Act of 2003, Pub. L. 108–19,\r\nand accompanying Executive Order 13312, which prohibits (1) \"the importation into, or\r\nexportation from, the United States . . . of any rough diamond, from whatever source, unless\r\nthe rough diamond has been controlled through the [Kimberley Process Certification\r\nScheme]; and (2) any transaction by a United States person anywhere, or any transaction that\r\noccurs in whole or in part within the United States, that evades or avoids, or has the purpose\r\nof evading or avoiding, or attempts to violate, any of the prohibitions set forth in this\r\nsection,\" and conspiracies to commit such acts. This amendment references the new offense\r\nat 19 U.S.C. § 3907 to §2T3.1 (Evading Import Duties or Restrictions (Smuggling);\r\nReceiving or Trafficking in Smuggled Property) because the offense involves importing into\r\nthe United States \"conflict\" diamonds (so-called because the profits from their sale are\r\nfrequently used to fund rebel and military activities) without proper certification or payment\r\nof duty fees according to the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme, a process that\r\nlegitimizes the quality and original source of the diamond. Because the essence of this new\r\nstatutory offense is to avoid proper certification and evade duty fees, penalties for its\r\nviolation are appropriately covered by §2T3.1. This amendment also adds language\r\nreferencing \"contraband diamonds\" to the introductory commentary of Chapter Two, Part\r\nT, Subpart Three to indicate that uncertified diamonds are contraband covered by §2T3.1\r\neven if other types of contraband are covered by other, more specific guidelines.\r\nFourth, this amendment implements the Unborn Victims of Violence Act of 2004, Pub. L.\r\n108–212, which created a new offense at 18 U.S.C. § 1841 for causing death or serious\r\nbodily injury to a child in utero while engaging in conduct violative of any of over 60\r\noffenses enumerated at 18 U.S.C. § 1841(b). Under 18 U.S.C. § 1841(a)(1) and (a)(2)(A),\r\nthe statutory maximum term of imprisonment for the conduct that “caused the death of, or\r\nbodily injury to a child in utero shall be the penalty provided under Federal law for that\r\nconduct had that injury or death occurred to the unborn child’s mother.” Otherwise, under\r\n18 U.S.C. § 1841(a)(2)(C), if the person “engaging in the conduct . . . intentionally kills or\r\nattempts to kill the unborn child, that person shall be punished . . . under sections 1111,\r\n1112, and 1113 for intentionally killing or attempting to kill a human being.” The\r\namendment references 18 U.S.C. § 1841(a)(2)(C) to the guidelines designated in Appendix\r\nA for 18 U.S.C. §§ 1111, 1112, and 1113, which are §§2A1.1 (First Degree Murder), 2A1.2\r\n(Second Degree Murder), 2A1.3 (Voluntary Manslaughter), and 2A1.4 (Involuntary\r\nManslaughter). This amendment also refers the provisions under 18 U.S.C. § 1841(a)(1) and\r\n(a)(2)(A) to 2X5.1 (Other Offenses) and adds a special instruction that the most analogous\r\nguideline for these offenses is the guideline that covers the underlying offenses.\r\nFifth, this amendment creates a new guideline at §2X5.2 (Class A Misdemeanors) that covers\r\nall Class A misdemeanors not otherwise referenced to a more specific Chapter Two\r\nguideline.

In response to the new offense,\r\nthe amendment adds a two-level specific offense characteristic at §2L1.1(b)(7) applicable\r\nto offenses of conviction under 8 U.S.C. § 1324(a)(4), to account for the increased statutory\r\nmaximum penalty for such offenses.\r\nSection 6702 of the Act creates a new offense at 18 U.S.C. § 1038 (False Information and\r\nHoaxes). The amendment references the new offense to §2A6.1 (Threatening or Harassing\r\nCommunications) and adds a cross reference to §2M6.1 (Unlawful Production,\r\nDevelopment, Acquisition, Stockpiling, Alteration, Use, Transfer, or Possession of Nuclear\r\nMaterial, Weapons, or Facilities, Biological Agents, Toxins, or Delivery Systems, Chemical\r\nWeapons, or Other Weapons of Mass Destruction; Attempt or Conspiracy) if the conduct\r\nsupports a threat to use a weapon of mass destruction. The Commission referenced the new\r\noffense to these guidelines because the conduct criminalized by the new statute is analogous\r\nto conduct already covered by other statutes referenced to these two guidelines.\r\nSection 6803 of the Act creates a new offense at 18 U.S.C. § 832 (Participation in Nuclear\r\nand Weapons of Mass Destruction Threats in the United States), relating to participation in\r\nnuclear, and weapons of mass destruction, threats to the United States. Section 6803 also\r\nadds this new offense to the list of predicate offenses at 18 U.S.C. § 2332b(g)(5)(B)(i) and\r\namends sections 57(b) and 92 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (42 U.S.C. § 2077(b)) to\r\ncover the participation of an individual in the development of special nuclear material. The\r\namendment references 18 U.S.C. § 832 to §2M6.1 because this offense is similar to other\r\noffenses referenced to this guideline.\r\nSection 6903 of the Act creates a new offense at 18 U.S.C. § 2332g (Missile Systems\r\nDesigned to Destroy Aircraft) prohibiting the production or transfer of missile systems\r\ndesigned to destroy aircraft. The amendment references 18 U.S.C. § 2332g to §2K2.1\r\n(Unlawful Receipt, Possession, or Transportation of Firearms or Ammunition; Prohibited\r\nTransactions Involving Firearms or Ammunition) because the types of weapons described\r\nin the offense would be covered as destructive devices under 26 U.S.C. § 5845(a).\r\nSection 6905 of the Act creates a new offense at 18 U.S.C. § 2332h (Radiological Dispersal\r\nDevices) prohibiting the production, transfer, receipt, possession, or threat to use, any\r\nradiological dispersal device. The amendment references 18 U.S.C. § 2332h to §2M6.1\r\nbecause of the nature of the offense. Section 2M6.1 covers conduct dealing with the\r\nproduction of certain types of nuclear, biological, or chemical weapons or other weapons of\r\nmass destruction, including weapons of mass destruction that, as defined in 18 U.S.C. §\r\n2332a, are designed to release radiation or radioactivity at levels dangerous to human life.\r\nSection 6906 of the Act creates a new offense at 18 U.S.C. § 175c (Variola Virus) that\r\n\r\nprohibits the production, acquisition, transfer, or possession of, or the threat to use, the\r\nvariola virus. The amendment references the new offense to §2M6.1 because the variola\r\nvirus may be used as a biological agent or toxin and, therefore, it is appropriate to reference\r\nthis new offense to this guideline.","EffectiveDate":"Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2006."},{"Id":687,"Title":"Amendment 687","Text":"Section 2B5.3 and Appendix A (Statutory Index), effective October 24, 2005\r\n(see USSC Guidelines Manual, Supplement to Appendix C, Amendment 675), are\r\nrepromulgated with the following changes:\r\nThe Commentary to §2B5.3 captioned \"Application Notes\" is amended in Note 1, in the\r\nparagraph that begins ‘Uploading’ by striking \"item in an openly shared file\" and inserting\r\n\"item as an openly shared file\"; and by striking \"placed in\".","Reason":"Reason for Amendment: This amendment re-promulgates as a permanent amendment the\r\ntemporary, emergency amendment to §2B5.3 (Criminal Infringement of Copyright or\r\nTrademark), and Appendix A (Statutory Index), which became effective on October 24,\r\n2005.

The enhancement and the corresponding definition use language directly from\r\n17 U.S.C. § 506(a) (criminal infringement). The amendment adds language to Application\r\n\r\nNovember 1, 2011 APPENDIX C - VOLUME III Amendment 688\r\nNote 2 that explains that in cases involving pre-release works, the infringement amount\r\nshould be determined by using the retail value of the infringed item, rather than any premium\r\nprice attributed to the infringing item because of its pre-release status. The amendment\r\naddresses concerns that distribution of an item before it is legally available to the consumer\r\nis more serious conduct than distribution of other infringing items and involves a harm not\r\naddressed by the current guideline.\r\nUploading\r\nThe concern underlying the uploading directive pertains to offenses in which the copyrighted\r\nwork is transferred through file sharing. The amendment builds on the current definition of\r\n\"uploading\" to include making an infringing item available on the Internet by storing an\r\ninfringing item as an openly shared file. The amendment also clarifies that uploading does\r\nnot include merely downloading or installing infringing items on a hard drive of the\r\ndefendant’s computer unless the infringing item is in an openly shared file. By clarifying\r\nthe definition of uploading in this manner, Application Note 3, which is a restatement of the\r\nuploading definition, is no longer necessary and the amendment deletes the application note\r\nfrom the guideline.\r\nIndeterminate Number\r\nThe amendment addresses the final directive by amending Application Note 2, which sets\r\nforth the rules for determining the infringement amount. The note provides that the court\r\nmay make a reasonable estimate of the infringement amount using any relevant information\r\nincluding financial records in cases in which the court cannot determine the number of\r\ninfringing items.\r\nNew Offense\r\nFinally, the amendment provides a reference in Appendix A (Statutory Index) for the new\r\noffense at 18 U.S.C. § 2319B.

L. 108–358 (the \"ASC Act\"),\r\nwhich directs the Commission to \"review the Federal sentencing guidelines with respect to\r\noffenses involving anabolic steroids\" and \"consider amending the. . . guidelines to provide\r\nfor increased penalties with respect to offenses involving anabolic steroids in a manner that\r\nreflects the seriousness of such offenses and the need to deter anabolic steroid trafficking and\r\nuse . . ..\" The emergency amendment became effective on March 27, 2006 (See Supplement\r\nto Appendix C, Amendment 681).\r\n\r\nThe amendment implements the directives by increasing the penalties for offenses involving\r\nanabolic steroids. It does so by changing the manner in which anabolic steroids are treated\r\nunder §2D1.1 (Unlawful Manufacturing, Importing, Exporting, or Trafficking (Including\r\nPossession with Intent to Commit These Offenses); Attempt or Conspiracy). The\r\namendment eliminates the sentencing distinction between anabolic steroids and other\r\nSchedule III substances when the steroid is in a pill, capsule, tablet, or liquid form. For\r\nanabolic steroids in other forms (e.g., patch, topical cream, aerosol), the amendment instructs\r\nthe court that it shall make a reasonable estimate of the quantity of anabolic steroid involved\r\nin the offense, and in making such estimate, the court shall consider that each 25 mg of\r\nanabolic steroid is one \"unit\".\r\nIn addition, the amendment addresses two harms often associated with anabolic steroid\r\noffenses by providing new enhancements in §2D1.1(b)(6) and (b)(7). Subsection (b)(6)\r\nprovides a two-level enhancement if the offense involved the distribution of an anabolic\r\nsteroid and a masking agent. Subsection (b)(7) provides a two-level enhancement if the\r\ndefendant distributed an anabolic steroid to an athlete. Both enhancements address\r\ncongressional concern with distribution of anabolic steroids to athletes, particularly the\r\nimpact that steroids distribution and steroids use has on the integrity of sport, either because\r\nof the unfair advantage gained by the use of steroids or because of the concealment of such\r\nuse.\r\nThe amendment also amends Application Note 8 of §2D1.1 to provide that an adjustment\r\nunder §3B1.3 (Abuse of Position of Trust or Use of Special Skill) ordinarily would apply\r\nin the case of a defendant who used his or her position as a coach to influence an athlete to\r\nuse an anabolic steroid.","EffectiveDate":"Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2006."},{"Id":689,"Title":"Amendment 689","Text":"Section 2G2.5 is amended in the heading by adding at the end \"; Failure to\r\nProvide Required Marks in Commercial Electronic Email\".\r\nThe Commentary to §2G2.5 captioned \"Statutory Provision\" is amended by striking\r\n\"Provision:\" and inserting \"Provisions: 15 U.S.C. § 7704(d);\".\r\nChapter Three, Part C, as amended by Amendment 684 of this document, is further amended\r\nby adding at the end the following:\r\n\"§3C1.4.

The amendment implements this directive by creating a\r\nnew guideline, at §3C1.4 (False Registration of Domain Names), which provides a two-level\r\nadjustment for cases in which a statutory enhancement under 18 U.S.C. § 3559(f)(1) applies.\r\nSection 3559(f)(1), created by section 204(a) of the Intellectual Property Protection and\r\nCourts Administration Act of 2004, doubles the statutory maximum term of imprisonment,\r\nor increases the maximum sentence by seven years, whichever is less, if a defendant who is\r\nconvicted of a felony offense knowingly falsely registered a domain name and used that\r\ndomain name in the course of the offense. Basing the adjustment in the new guideline on\r\napplication of the statutory enhancement in 18 U.S.C. § 3559(f)(1) satisfies the directive in\r\na straightforward and uncomplicated manner.\r\nSection 5(d)(1) of the CAN-SPAM Act prohibits the transmission of commercial electronic\r\nmessages that contain \"sexually oriented material\" unless such messages include certain\r\nmarks, notices, and information. The amendment references the new offense, found at 15\r\nU.S.C. § 7704(d), to §2G2.5 (Recordkeeping Offenses Involving the Production of Sexually\r\nExplicit Materials). Prior to this amendment, §2G2.5 applied to violations of 18 U.S.C. §\r\n2257, which requires producers of sexually explicit materials to maintain detailed records\r\nregarding their production activities and to make such records available for inspection by the\r\nAttorney General in accordance with applicable regulations. Although offenses under 15\r\nU.S.C. § 7704(d) do not involve the same recording and reporting functions, section 7704(d)\r\noffenses essentially are regulatory in nature and in this manner are similar to other offenses\r\nsentenced under §2G2.5.

However, if the offense\r\ninvolved a firearm with an altered or obliterated serial number,\r\napply subsection (b)(4)(B).\r\nSimilarly, if the offense to which §2K2.1 applies is 18 U.S.C. §\r\n922(k) or 26 U.S.C. § 5861(g) or (h) (offenses involving an altered\r\nor obliterated serial number) and the base offense level is\r\ndetermined under subsection (a)(7), do not apply the enhancement\r\nin subsection (b)(4)(B). This is because the base offense level\r\ntakes into account that the firearm had an altered or obliterated\r\nserial number. However, it the offense involved a stolen firearm or\r\nstolen ammunition, apply subsection (b)(4)(A).\r\n(B) Knowledge or Reason to Believe.—Subsection (b)(4) applies\r\nregardless of whether the defendant knew or had reason to believe\r\nthat the firearm was stolen or had an altered or obliterated serial\r\nnumber.\".\r\nThe Commentary to §2K2.1 captioned \"Application Notes\" is amended in Note 4, as\r\nredesignated by this amendment, by inserting \"Application of Subsection (a)(7).—\" before\r\n\"Subsection (a)(7)\"; in Note 5, as redesignated by this amendment, by inserting \"Application\r\nof Subsection (b)(1).—\" before \"For purposes of calculating\"; in Note 6, as redesignated by\r\nthis amendment, by inserting \"Application of Subsection (b)(2).—\" before \"Under subsection\r\n(b)(2)\"; in Note 7, as redesignated by this amendment, by inserting \"Destructive Devices.—\"\r\nbefore \"A defendant\"; in Note 9, as redesignated by this amendment, by inserting\r\n\"Application of Subsection (b)(7).—\" before \"Under\"; and by striking \"(b)(6), if\" and\r\ninserting \"(b)(7), if\"; in Note 10, as redesignated by this amendment, by inserting \"Prior\r\nFelony Convictions.—\" before \"For purposes of\"; in Note 11, as redesignated by this\r\namendment, by inserting \"Upward Departure Provisions.—\" before \"An upward departure\";\r\nin Note 12, as redesignated by this amendment, by inserting \"Armed Career Criminal.—\"\r\nbefore \"A defendant who\"; and by inserting at the end the following:\r\n\"13. Application of Subsection (b)(5).—\r\n(A) In General.—Subsection (b)(5) applies, regardless of whether\r\nanything of value was exchanged, if the defendant—\r\n(i) transported, transferred, or otherwise disposed of two or\r\nmore firearms to another individual, or received two or\r\n\r\nmore firearms with the intent to transport, transfer, or\r\notherwise dispose of firearms to another individual; and\r\n(ii) knew or had reason to believe that such conduct would\r\nresult in the transport, transfer, or disposal of a firearm to\r\nan individual—\r\n(I) whose possession or receipt of the firearm would\r\nbe unlawful; or\r\n(II) who intended to use or dispose of the firearm\r\nunlawfully.\r\n(B) Definitions.—For purposes of this subsection:\r\n‘Individual whose possession or receipt of the firearm would be\r\nunlawful’ means an individual who (i) has a prior conviction for a\r\ncrime of violence, a controlled substance offense, or a\r\nmisdemeanor crime of domestic violence; or (ii) at the time of the\r\noffense was under a criminal justice sentence, including probation,\r\nparole, supervised release, imprisonment, work release, or escape\r\nstatus. ‘Crime of violence’ and ‘controlled substance offense’ have\r\nthe meaning given those terms in §4B1.2 (Definitions of Terms\r\nUsed in Section 4B1.1). ‘Misdemeanor crime of domestic\r\nviolence’ has the meaning given that term in 18 U.S.C.\r\n§ 921(a)(33)(A).\r\nThe term ‘defendant’, consistent with §1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct),\r\nlimits the accountability of the defendant to the defendant’s own\r\nconduct and conduct that the defendant aided or abetted, counseled,\r\ncommanded, induced, procured, or willfully caused.\r\n(C) Upward Departure Provision.—If the defendant trafficked\r\nsubstantially more than 25 firearms, an upward departure may be\r\nwarranted.\r\n(D) Interaction with Other Subsections.—In a case in which three or\r\nmore firearms were both possessed and trafficked, apply both\r\nsubsections (b)(1) and (b)(5). If the defendant used or transferred\r\none of such firearms in connection with another felony offense (i.e.,\r\nan offense other than a firearms possession or trafficking offense)\r\nan enhancement under subsection (b)(6) also would apply.\r\n14. ‘In Connection With’.—\r\n(A) In General.—Subsections (b)(6) and (c)(1) apply if the firearm or\r\nammunition facilitated, or had the potential of facilitating, another\r\nfelony offense or another offense, respectively.\r\n(B) Application When Other Offense is Burglary or Drug\r\n\r\nOffense.—Subsections (b)(6) and (c)(1) apply (i) in a case in which\r\na defendant who, during the course of a burglary, finds and takes\r\na firearm, even if the defendant did not engage in any other conduct\r\nwith that firearm during the course of the burglary; and (ii) in the\r\ncase of a drug trafficking offense in which a firearm is found in\r\nclose proximity to drugs, drug-manufacturing materials, or drug\r\nparaphernalia. In these cases, application of subsections (b)(1) and\r\n(c)(1) is warranted because the presence of the firearm has the\r\npotential of facilitating another felony offense or another offense,\r\nrespectively.\r\n(C) Definitions.—\r\n‘Another felony offense’, for purposes of subsection (b)(6), means\r\nany federal, state, or local offense, other than the explosive or\r\nfirearms possession or trafficking offense, punishable by\r\nimprisonment for a term exceeding one year, regardless of whether\r\na criminal charge was brought, or a conviction obtained.\r\n‘Another offense’, for purposes of subsection (c)(1), means any\r\nfederal, state, or local offense, other than the explosive or firearms\r\npossession or trafficking offense, regardless of whether a criminal\r\ncharge was brought, or a conviction obtained.\r\n(D) Upward Departure Provision.—In a case in which the defendant\r\nused or possessed a firearm or explosive to facilitate another\r\nfirearms or explosives offense (e.g., the defendant used or\r\npossessed a firearm to protect the delivery of an unlawful shipment\r\nof explosives), an upward departure under §5K2.6 (Weapons and\r\nDangerous Instrumentalities) may be warranted.\".\r\nChapter Five, Part K is amended by striking §5K2.17 as follows:\r\n\"§5K2.17. High-Capacity, Semiautomatic Firearms (Policy Statement)\r\nIf the defendant possessed a high-capacity, semiautomatic firearm\r\nin connection with a crime of violence or controlled substance\r\noffense, an upward departure may be warranted. A ‘high-capacity,\r\nsemiautomatic firearm’ means a semiautomatic firearm that has a\r\nmagazine capacity of more than ten cartridges. The extent of any\r\nincrease should depend upon the degree to which the nature of the\r\nweapon increased the likelihood of death or injury in the\r\ncircumstances of the particular case.\",\r\nand inserting:\r\n\"§5K2.17. Semiautomatic Firearms Capable of Accepting Large Capacity\r\nMagazine (Policy Statement)\r\n\r\nIf the defendant possessed a semiautomatic firearm capable of\r\naccepting a large capacity magazine in connection with a crime of\r\nviolence or controlled substance offense, an upward departure may\r\nbe warranted. A ‘semiautomatic firearm capable of accepting a\r\nlarge capacity magazine’ means a semiautomatic firearm that has\r\nthe ability to fire many rounds without reloading because at the\r\ntime of the offense (A) the firearm had attached to it a magazine or\r\nsimilar device that could accept more than 15 rounds of\r\nammunition; or (B) a magazine or similar device that could accept\r\nmore than 15 rounds of ammunition was in close proximity to the\r\nfirearm. The extent of any increase should depend upon the degree\r\nto which the nature of the weapon increased the likelihood of death\r\nor injury in the circumstances of the particular case.\".","Reason":"Reason for Amendment: This four part amendment addresses various issues pertaining to\r\nthe primary firearms guideline, §2K2.1 (Unlawful Receipt, Possession, or Transportation of\r\nFirearms or Ammunition; Prohibited Transactions Involving Firearms or Ammunition).\r\nFirst, the amendment modifies four base offense levels that provide enhanced penalties for\r\noffenses involving a firearm described in 18 U.S.C. § 921(a)(30), the semiautomatic assault\r\nweapon ban that expired on September 13, 2004. The Commission received information\r\nregarding inconsistent application as to whether the enhanced base offense levels apply to\r\nthese types of firearms in light of the ban’s expiration. The amendment deletes the reference\r\nto 18 U.S.C. § 921(a)(30) at §2K2.1(a)(1), (a)(3), and (a)(4) and replaces the reference with\r\nthe term, \"a semiautomatic firearm capable of accepting a large capacity magazine,\" which\r\nis defined in Application Note 2.\r\nWhile the amendment deletes the reference to 18 U.S.C. § 921(a)(30) at §2K2.1(a)(5), it does\r\nnot include the phrase \"a semiautomatic firearm that is capable of accepting a large capacity\r\nmagazine\" in this subsection because a defendant sentenced under subsection (a)(5) does not\r\nhave the same \"prohibited person\" status as a defendant sentenced under subsections (a)(1),\r\n(a)(3), or (a)(4).\r\nThe amendment also amends §5K2.17 (High-Capacity, Semiautomatic Firearms) in a manner\r\nconsistent with §2K2.1, as amended, except that it excludes the language pertaining to .22\r\ncaliber rim fire ammunition in order to remain in conformity with a prior congressional\r\ndirective. As amended, §5K2.17 (Semiautomatic Firearms Capable of Accepting Large\r\nCapacity Magazine) provides that an upward departure may be warranted if a defendant\r\npossesses a semiautomatic firearm capable of accepting a large capacity magazine in\r\nconnection with a crime of violence or controlled substance offense.\r\nSecond, the amendment provides a 4-level enhancement at §2K2.1(b)(5) if the defendant\r\nengaged in the trafficking of firearms. The definition of trafficking encompasses\r\ntransporting, transferring, or otherwise disposing of two or more firearms, or receipt of two\r\nor more firearms with the intent to transport, transfer, or otherwise dispose of firearms to\r\nanother individual. The definition also requires that the defendant know or have reason to\r\nbelieve that such conduct would result in the transport, transfer, or disposal of a firearm to\r\nan individual whose possession or receipt would be unlawful or who intended to use or\r\ndispose of the firearm unlawfully. With respect to an individual whose possession would\r\nbe unlawful, the amendment includes individuals who previously have been convicted of a\r\n\r\nNovember 1, 2011 APPENDIX C - VOLUME III Amendment 692\r\ncrime of violence, a controlled substance offense, or a misdemeanor crime of domestic\r\nviolence, or who at the time of the offense were under a criminal justice sentence, including\r\nprobation, parole, supervised release, imprisonment, work release, or escape status.\r\nAdditionally, the definition provides that the enhancement applies regardless of whether\r\nanything of value was exchanged.\r\nThird, the amendment modifies §2K2.1(b)(4) to increase penalties for offenses involving\r\naltered or obliterated serial numbers. Prior to this amendment, §2K2.1(b)(4) provided a 2-\r\nlevel enhancement if the offense involved either a stolen firearm or a firearm with an altered\r\nor obliterated serial number. The amendment provides a 4-level enhancement for offenses\r\ninvolving altered or obliterated serial numbers. This increase reflects both the difficulty in\r\ntracing firearms with altered or obliterated serial numbers, and the increased market for these\r\ntypes of weapons.\r\nFourth, the amendment addresses a circuit conflict pertaining to the application of current\r\n§2K2.1(b)(5) (re-designated by this amendment as §2K2.1(b)(6)) and (c)(1)), specifically\r\nwith respect to the use of a firearm \"in connection with\" burglary and drug offenses. The\r\namendment, adopting the language from Smith v. United States, 508 U.S. 223 (1993),\r\nprovides at Application Note 14 that the provisions apply if the firearm facilitated, or had\r\nthe potential of facilitating, another felony offense or another offense, respectively.\r\nFurthermore, the amendment provides that in burglary offenses, these provisions apply to\r\na defendant who takes a firearm during the course of the burglary, even if the defendant did\r\nnot engage in any other conduct with that firearm during the course of the burglary. In\r\naddition, the provisions apply in the case of a drug trafficking offense in which a firearm is\r\nfound in close proximity to drugs, drug manufacturing materials, or drug paraphernalia. The\r\nCommission determined that application of these provisions is warranted in these cases\r\nbecause of the potential that the presence of the firearm has for facilitating another felony\r\noffense or another offense.","EffectiveDate":"Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2006."},{"Id":692,"Title":"Amendment 692","Text":"Section 2L1.1 is amended by redesignating subsections (a)(1) and (a)(2) as\r\nsubsections (a)(2) and (a)(3), respectively; and by inserting after \"Base Offense Level:\" the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\"(1) 25, if the defendant was convicted under 8 U.S.C. § 1327 of a violation\r\ninvolving an alien who was inadmissible under 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(3);\".\r\nSection 2L1.1 is amended by redesignating subsections (b)(4) through (b)(6) as subsections\r\n(b)(5) through (b)(7), respectively; and by inserting after subsection (b)(3) the following:\r\n\"(4) If the defendant smuggled, transported, or harbored a minor who was\r\nunaccompanied by the minor’s parent or grandparent, increase by 2 levels.\".\r\nSubsection (b)(7), as redesignated by this amendment, is amended by striking \"8 levels\" and\r\ninserting \"10 levels\"; and by redesignating subdivisions (1) through (4) as subdivisions (A)\r\nthrough (D), respectively.\r\n\r\nSection 2L1.1(b) is amended by adding at the end the following:\r\n\"(8) If an alien was involuntarily detained through coercion or threat, or in\r\nconnection with a demand for payment, (A) after the alien was smuggled\r\ninto the United States; or (B) while the alien was transported or harbored in\r\nthe United States, increase by 2 levels.

First, this amendment addresses national\r\nsecurity concerns pertaining to the smuggling of illegal aliens. Specifically, a new base\r\noffense level of 25 at §2L1.1(a)(1) provides increased punishment for defendants convicted\r\nof 8 U.S.C. § 1327 involving an alien who is inadmissable because of \"security or related\r\ngrounds,\" as defined in 8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(3). To further address concerns related to national\r\n\r\nsecurity, an application note provides that an upward departure may be warranted if the\r\ndefendant had specific knowledge that the alien the defendant smuggled, transported, or\r\nharbored was inadmissible for reasons of security and related grounds, as set forth in 8\r\nU.S.C. § 1182(a)(3). This upward departure note applies regardless of whether the defendant\r\nis convicted of 8 U.S.C. § 1327.\r\nSecond, the amendment provides a two-level enhancement for a case in which the defendant\r\nsmuggled, transported, or harbored a minor unaccompanied by the minor’s parent or\r\ngrandparent. This enhancement addresses concerns regarding the increased risk involved\r\nwhen unaccompanied minors are smuggled into, or harbored or transported within, the\r\nUnited States. Application Note 1 defines \"minor\" as \"an individual who had not attained\r\nthe age of 16 years\" and defines \"parent\" as \"(A) a natural mother or father; (B) a\r\nstepmother or stepfather; or (C) an adoptive mother or father.\"\r\nThird, the amendment makes two changes with respect to offenses involving death. First,\r\nthe amendment increases the enhancement from 8 levels to 10 levels if any person died as\r\na result of the offense. Additionally, the cross reference at §2L1.1(c)(1) is expanded to cover\r\nhomicides other than murder. This amendment ensures that any offense involving the death\r\nof an alien will be sentenced under the guideline appropriate for the particular type of\r\nhomicide involved if the resulting offense level is greater than the offense level determined\r\nunder §2L1.1.\r\nFourth, the amendment adds a two-level enhancement and a minimum offense level of 18\r\nin a case in which an alien was involuntarily detained through coercion or threat, or in\r\nconnection with a demand for payment, after the alien was smuggled into the United States,\r\nor while the alien was transported or harbored in the United States. This conduct may not\r\nbe covered by §3A1.3 (Restraint of Victim) because an illegal alien, as a participant in the\r\noffense, may not be considered a \"victim\" for purposes of that adjustment. Additionally,\r\napplication of §3A1.3 requires \"physical restraint,\" as that term is defined in §1B1.1, and the\r\ninvoluntary detainment involved in offenses sentenced under §2L1.1 may not involve\r\nphysical restraint. Finally, the amendment provides an application note, as a corollary to\r\nApplication Note 2 in §3A1.3, that instructs the court not to apply §3A1.3 if the involuntary\r\ndetainment enhancement applies\r\nThe second part of the amendment modifies §§2L2.1 and 2L2.2. First, this part of the\r\namendment adds a new specific offense characteristic at §2L2.1(b)(5)(A) that provides a\r\nfour-level enhancement in a case in which the defendant fraudulently used or obtained a\r\nUnited States passport. The same specific offense characteristic was added to §2L2.2,\r\neffective November 1, 2004 (see USSC Guidelines Manual Supplement to Appendix C,\r\nAmendment 671). The addition of this specific offense characteristic to §2L2.1 promotes\r\nproportionality between the document fraud guidelines, §§2L2.1 and 2L2.2.\r\nSecond, the amendment provides, at §2L2.1(b)(5)(B) and §2L2.2(b)(3)(B), a two-level\r\nenhancement if the defendant fraudulently obtained or used a foreign passport. This\r\nmodification addresses concern regarding the threat to the security of the United States in\r\ndocument fraud offenses involving foreign passports.","EffectiveDate":"Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2006."},{"Id":693,"Title":"Amendment 693","Text":"Section 3C1.1 is amended by striking \"during the course of\" and inserting\r\n\"with respect to\".\r\nThe Commentary to §3C1.1 captioned \"Application Notes\" is amended in Note 1 by\r\ninserting \"In General.—\" before \"This adjustment\"; by striking \"during the course of\" and\r\ninserting \"with respect to\"; and by inserting at the end the following:\r\n\"Obstructive conduct that occurred prior to the start of the investigation of the\r\ninstant offense of conviction may be covered by this guideline if the conduct was\r\npurposefully calculated, and likely, to thwart the investigation or prosecution of the\r\noffense of conviction.\".\r\nThe Commentary to §3C1.1 captioned \"Application Notes\" is amended in Note 2 by\r\ninserting \"Limitations on Applicability of Adjustment.—\" before \"This provision\"; in Note\r\n3 by inserting \"Covered Conduct Generally.—\" before \"Obstructive\"; in Note 5 by inserting\r\n\"Examples of Conduct Ordinarily Not Covered.—\" before \"Some types\"; in Note 6 by\r\ninserting \"‘Material’ Evidence Defined.—\" before \"‘Material’ evidence\"; in Note 7 by\r\ninserting \"Inapplicability of Adjustment in Certain Circumstances.—\" before \"If the\r\ndefendant\"; in Note 8 by inserting \"Grouping Under §3D1.2(c).—\" before \"If the defendant\";\r\nand in Note 9 by inserting \"Accountability for §1B1.3(a)(1)(A) Conduct.—\" before \"Under\r\nthis section\".\r\nThe Commentary to §3C1.1 captioned \"Application Notes\" is amended in Note 4 by\r\ninserting \"Examples of Covered Conduct.—\" before \"The following\"; in subdivision (b) by\r\ninserting \", including during the course of a civil proceeding if such perjury pertains to\r\nconduct that forms the basis of the offense of conviction\" after \"suborn perjury\"; by striking\r\nthe period at the end of subdivision (j) and inserting a semi-colon; and by adding at the end\r\nthe following subdivision:\r\n\"(k) threatening the victim of the offense in an attempt to prevent the victim\r\nfrom reporting the conduct constituting the offense of conviction.\".","Reason":"Reason for Amendment: This amendment addresses a circuit conflict regarding the issue\r\nof whether pre-investigative conduct can form the basis of an adjustment under §3C1.1\r\n(Obstructing or Impeding the Administration of Justice).

For example, if the\r\napplicable adjusted guideline range is 15-21 months and the court\r\ndetermines a ‘total punishment’ of 21 months is appropriate, a sentence of\r\n9 months for conduct under 18 U.S.C. § 1039(a) plus 12 months for 18\r\nU.S.C. § 1039(d) conduct would achieve the ‘total punishment’ in a manner\r\nthat satisfies the statutory requirement.\r\n3. Upward Departure.—There may be cases in which the offense level\r\ndetermined under this guideline substantially understates the seriousness\r\n\r\nof the offense. In such a case, an upward departure may be warranted. The\r\nfollowing are examples of cases in which an upward departure may be\r\nwarranted:\r\n(i) The offense involved confidential phone records information of a\r\nsubstantial number of individuals.\r\n(ii) The offense caused or risked substantial non-monetary harm (e.g.\r\nphysical harm, psychological harm, or severe emotional trauma, or\r\nresulted in a substantial invasion of privacy interest) to individuals\r\nwhose private or protected information was obtained.\".\r\nSection 2H3.1 is amended by striking the Commentary captioned \"Background\" as follows:\r\n\"Background: This section refers to conduct proscribed by 47 U.S.C. § 605 and the\r\nElectronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986, which amends 18 U.S.C. § 2511\r\nand other sections of Title 18 dealing with unlawful interception and disclosure of\r\ncommunications.

The penalties for violating the statute include fines and imprisonment for a term\r\nnot to exceed 10 years. The statute also includes enhanced penalties for certain forms of\r\naggravated conduct, providing for up to a five year term of imprisonment, in addition to the\r\npenalties for a violation of section 1039(a), (b), or (c).

The Commission\r\nconcluded that disclosure of telephone records is similar to the types of privacy offenses\r\nreferenced to this guideline. In addition, this guideline includes a cross reference,\r\n\r\ninstructing that if the purpose of the offense was to facilitate another offense, that the\r\nguideline applicable to an attempt to commit the other offenses should be applied, if the\r\nresulting offense level is higher. The Commission concluded that operation of the cross\r\nreference would capture the harms associated with the aggravated forms of this offense\r\nreferenced at 18 U.S.C. § 1039(d) or (e). Finally, the amendment expands the scope of the\r\nexisting three-level enhancement in the guideline to include cases in which the defendant is\r\nconvicted under 18 U.S.C. § 1039(d) or (e).

The amendment also provides a corresponding amendment\r\nto Appendix A (Statutory Index).

This amendment responds to the\r\ndirective by revising the enhancement at subsection (b)(11) of §2B1.1 (Larceny,\r\nEmbezzlement, and Other Forms of Theft; Offenses Involving Stolen Property; Property\r\nDamage or Destruction; Fraud and Deceit; Forgery; Offenses Involving Altered or\r\nCounterfeit Instruments Other than Counterfeit Bearer Obligations of the United States).\r\nThe amendment expands the scope of this enhancement to cover cargo theft and adds a\r\nreference to the receipt of stolen vehicles or goods to ensure application of the enhancement\r\nis consistent with the scope of 18 U.S.C. §§ 659 and 2313.

App. § 1701 2M5.1, 2M5.2\".","Reason":"Reason for Amendment: This amendment implements the USA PATRIOT Improvement\r\nand Reauthorization Act of 2005 (the \"PATRIOT Reauthorization Act\"), Pub. L. 109–177,\r\nand the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2007 (the \"Homeland\r\nSecurity Act\"), Pub. L. 109–295.\r\nFirst, the amendment addresses section 122 of the PATRIOT Reauthorization Act, which\r\ncreated a new offense at 21 U.S.C. § 960a covering narco-terrorism. This new offense\r\nprohibits engaging in conduct that would be covered under 21 U.S.C. § 841(a) if committed\r\nunder the jurisdiction of the United States, knowing or intending to provide, directly or\r\nindirectly, anything of pecuniary value to any person or organization that has engaged or\r\nengages in terrorist activity (as defined in section 212(a)(3)(B) of the Immigration and\r\nNationality Act) or terrorism (as defined in section 140(d)(2) of the Foreign Relations\r\nAuthorization Act, Fiscal Years 1988 and 1989 (This act is made up of separate parts divided\r\nby fiscal year)). The penalty is not less than twice the statutory minimum punishment under\r\n21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1) and not more than life. Section 960a also provides a mandatory term\r\nof supervised release of at least five years.\r\n\r\nThe amendment creates a new guideline at §2D1.14 (Narco-Terrorism) because an offense\r\nunder 21 U.S.C. § 960a differs from basic drug offenses because it involves trafficking that\r\nbenefits terrorist activity. The guideline also provides that the base offense level is the\r\noffense level determined under §2D1.1 (Unlawful Manufacturing, Importing, Exporting, or\r\nTrafficking (Including Possession with Intent to Commit These Offenses); Attempt or\r\nConspiracy) for the underlying offense, except that the \"mitigating role cap\" in\r\n§2D1.1(a)(3)(A) and (B) and the two-level reduction for meeting the criteria set forth in\r\nsubdivisions (1)-(5) of subsection (a) of §5C1.2 (Limitation on Applicability of Statutory\r\nMinimum Sentences in Certain Cases) shall not apply. The Commission determined that\r\nthese exclusions are appropriate to reflect that this is not a typical drug offense, in that an\r\nindividual convicted under this provision must have had knowledge that the person or\r\norganization receiving the funds or support generated by the drug trafficking \"has engaged\r\nor engages in terrorist activity . . . or terrorism . . . .\" The guideline also contains a specific\r\noffense characteristic that provides a six-level increase if the adjustment in §3A1.4\r\n(Terrorism) does not apply. This six-level increase fully effectuates the statute’s doubling\r\nof the minimum punishment for the underlying drug offense, while avoiding potential double\r\ncounting with the 12-level adjustment at §3A1.4. The amendment also provides a\r\ncorresponding reference for the new offense to §2D1.14 in Appendix A (Statutory Index).\r\nSecond, the amendment responds to the directive in section 551 of the Homeland Security\r\nAct, which created a new offense in 18 U.S.C. § 554 regarding the construction of border\r\ntunnels and subterranean passages that cross the international boundary between the United\r\nStates and another country. Section 551(c) of the Homeland Security Act directed the\r\nCommission to promulgate or amend the guidelines to provide for increased penalties for\r\npersons convicted of offenses under 18 U.S.C. § 554 and required the Commission to\r\nconsider a number of factors. Section 554(a) prohibits the construction or financing of such\r\ntunnels and passages and provides a statutory maximum term of imprisonment of 20 years.\r\nSection 554(b) prohibits the knowing or reckless disregard of the construction on land the\r\nperson owns or controls and provides a statutory maximum term of imprisonment of 10\r\nyears. Section 554(c) prohibits the use of the tunnels to smuggle an alien, goods (in\r\nviolation of 18 U.S.C. § 545), controlled substances, weapons of mass destruction (including\r\nbiological weapons), or a member of a terrorist organization (defined in 18 U.S.C. §\r\n2339B(g)(6)) and provides a penalty of twice the maximum term of imprisonment that\r\notherwise would have been applicable had the unlawful activity not made use of the tunnel\r\nor passage.\r\nThe amendment creates a new guideline at §2X7.1 (Border Tunnels and Subterranean\r\nPassages) for convictions under 18 U.S.C. § 554. The new guideline provides that a\r\nconviction under 18 U.S.C. § 554(a) receives a base offense level 16, which is commensurate\r\nwith certain other offenses with statutory maximum terms of imprisonment of 20 years and\r\nensures a sentence of imprisonment. A conviction under 18 U.S.C. § 554(c) will receive a\r\nfour-level increase over the offense level applicable to the underlying smuggling offense,\r\nwhich ensures that the seriousness of the underlying offense is the primary measure of\r\noffense severity. The four-level increase also satisfies the directive’s instruction to account\r\nfor the aggravating nature of the use of a tunnel or subterranean passage to breach the border\r\nto accomplish the smuggling offense and effectuates the statute’s doubling of the statutory\r\nmaximum penalty. A conviction under 18 U.S.C. § 554(b) receives a base offense level of\r\n8, which reflects the less aggravated nature of this offense.\r\n\r\nThird, the amendment addresses other new offenses created by the PATRIOT\r\nReauthorization Act. Based on an assessment of similar offenses already covered by the\r\nrelevant guidelines, the amendment provides as follows:\r\n(A) The new offense in 18 U.S.C. § 554, pertaining to smuggling of goods from the\r\nUnited States, is referenced to §§2B1.5 (Theft of, Damage to, or Destruction of,\r\nCultural Heritage Resources; Unlawful Sale, Purchase, Exchange, Transportation,\r\nor Receipt of Cultural Heritage Resources), 2M5.2 (Exportation of Arms, Munitions,\r\nor Military Equipment or Services Without Required Validated Export License), and\r\n2Q2.1 (Offenses Involving Fish, Wildlife, and Plants).\r\n(B) The new offense in 18 U.S.C. § 2282A, pertaining to mining of United States\r\nnavigable waters, is referenced to §§2A1.1 (First Degree Murder), 2A1.2 (Second\r\nDegree Murder), 2B1.1 (Larceny, Embezzlement, and Other Forms of Theft;\r\nOffenses Involving Stolen Property; Property Damage or Destruction; Fraud and\r\nDeceit; Forgery; Offenses Involving Altered or Counterfeit Instruments Other than\r\nCounterfeit Bearer Obligations of the United States), 2K1.4 (Arson; Property\r\nDamage by Use of Explosives), and 2X1.1 (Attempt, Solicitation, or Conspiracy\r\n(Not Covered by a Specific Offense Guideline)). The amendment also adds vessel,\r\nmaritime facility, and a vessel’s cargo to §2K1.4(a)(1) and (a)(2) to cover conduct\r\ndescribed in 18 U.S.C. § 2282A. The definitions provided for \"vessel,\" \"maritime\r\nfacility,\" and \"aids to maritime navigation\" come from title 33 of the Code of\r\nFederal Regulations pertaining to the United States Coast Guard, specifically\r\nNavigation and Navigable Waters.\r\nSection 2282B, pertaining to violence against maritime navigational aids, is\r\nreferenced to §§2B1.1, 2K1.4, and 2X1.1. Section 2K1.4(a) is amended to provide\r\na new base offense level of 16 if the offense involved the destruction of or\r\ntampering with aids to maritime navigation.\r\n(C) The new offense in 18 U.S.C. § 2283 pertaining to transporting biological and\r\nchemical weapons is referenced to §§2K1.3 (Unlawful Receipt, Possession, or\r\nTransportation of Explosive Materials; Prohibited Transactions Involving Explosive\r\nMaterials), 2M5.3 (Providing Material Support or Resources to Designated Foreign\r\nTerrorism Organizations or For a Terrorist Purpose), and 2M6.1 (Unlawful\r\nProduction, Development, Acquisition, Stockpiling, Alteration, Use, Transfer, or\r\nPossession of Nuclear Material, Weapons, or Facilities, Biological Agents, Toxins,\r\nor Delivery Systems, Chemical Weapons, or Other Weapons of Mass Destruction;\r\nAttempt or Conspiracy).

L. 109–248, which contained a\r\ndirective to the Commission, created new sexual offenses, and enhanced penalties for\r\nexisting sexual offenses. The amendment implements the directive by creating two new\r\nguidelines, §§2A3.5 (Failure to Register as a Sex Offender) and 2A3.6 (Aggravated Offenses\r\nRelating to Registration as a Sex Offender). It further addresses relevant provisions in the\r\nAdam Walsh Act by making changes to Chapter Two, Part A, Subpart 3 (Criminal Sexual\r\nAbuse) and Part G (Offenses Involving Commercial Sex Acts, Sexual Exploitation of\r\nMinors, and Obscenity), §2J1.2 (Obstruction of Justice), §3D1.2 (Groups of Closely Related\r\nCounts), §4B1.5 (Repeat and Dangerous Sex Offender Against Minors), §5B1.3 (Conditions\r\nof Probation), §5D1.2 (Term of Supervised Release), §5D1.3 (Conditions of Supervised\r\nRelease) and Appendix A (Statutory Index).\r\nFirst, section 206 of the Adam Walsh Act amended 18 U.S.C. § 2241(c) to add a new\r\nmandatory minimum term of imprisonment of 30 years for offenses related to the aggravated\r\nsexual abuse of a child under 12 years old, or of a child between 12 and 16 years old if force,\r\nthreat, or other means was used. In response to the new mandatory minimum for these\r\noffenses, the amendment increases the base offense level at §2A3.1 (Criminal Sexual Abuse;\r\nAttempt to Commit Criminal Sexual Abuse) from level 30 to level 38. The base offense\r\nlevel of 30 has been retained for all other offenses. At least one specific offense\r\ncharacteristic applied to every conviction under 18 U.S.C. § 2241(c) sentenced under\r\n\r\n§2A3.1 in fiscal year 2006. Accordingly, the mandatory minimum 360 months’\r\nimprisonment is expected to be reached or exceeded in every case with a base offense level\r\nof 38.\r\nThe amendment provides a new application note that precludes application of the specific\r\noffense characteristic at §2A3.1(b)(1) regarding conduct described in 18 U.S.C. § 2241(a)\r\nor (b) if the conduct that forms the basis for a conviction under 18 U.S.C. § 2241(c) is that\r\nthe defendant engaged in conduct described in 18 U.S.C. § 2241(a) or (b) (force, threat, or\r\nother means). The amendment also precludes application of the specific offense\r\ncharacteristic for the age of a victim at §2A3.1(b)(2) if the defendant was convicted under\r\nsection 2241(c). The heightened base offense level of 38 takes into account the age of the\r\nvictim. These instructions, therefore, avoid unwarranted double counting.\r\nSecond, section 207 of the Adam Walsh Act increased the statutory maximum term of\r\nimprisonment under 18 U.S.C. § 2243(b) from 5 years to 15 years for the sexual abuse of a\r\nperson in official detention or under custodial authority. In response to increased penalty,\r\nthe amendment increases the base offense level from 12 to 14 in §2A3.3 (Criminal Sexual\r\nAbuse of a Ward or Attempt to Commit Such Acts). The amendment also adds a new\r\ndefinition of \"minor\" consistent with how this term is defined elsewhere in the guidelines\r\nmanual. In addition, the amendment includes an application note precluding application of\r\n§3B1.3 (Abuse of Position of Trust or Use of Special Skill) for these offenses because an\r\nabuse of position of trust is assumed in all such cases and, therefore, is built into the base\r\noffense level.\r\nThird, section 206 of the Adam Walsh Act created a new subsection at 18 U.S.C. § 2244.\r\nSection 2244(a)(5) provides a penalty of any term of years if the sexual conduct would have\r\nviolated 18 U.S.C. § 2241(c) had the contact been a sexual act. Section 2241(c) conduct\r\ninvolves the aggravated sexual abuse of a child under 12 years old or of a child between 12\r\nand 16 years old if force, threat, or other means was used, as defined in 18 U.S.C. § 2241(a)\r\nand (b). Prior to the Adam Walsh Act, the penalty for offenses involving children under 12\r\nyears old was \"twice that otherwise provided,\" and the penalty for sexual contact involving\r\nbehavior described in 18 U.S.C. § 2241 was a statutory maximum term of imprisonment of\r\n10 years.\r\nThe amendment addresses this new offense by increasing the minimum offense level in the\r\nage enhancement in subsection (b)(1) of §2A3.4 (Abusive Sexual Contact or Attempt to\r\nCommit Abusive Sexual Contact) from level 20 to level 22.\r\nFourth, section 141 of the Adam Walsh Act created a new offense under 18 U.S.C. § 2250(a)\r\nfor the failure to register as a sex offender. The basic offense carries a statutory maximum\r\nterm of imprisonment of 10 years. Section 141 also included a directive to the Commission\r\nthat when promulgating guidelines for the offense, to consider, among other factors, the\r\nseriousness of the sex offender’s conviction that gave rise to the requirement to register;\r\nrelevant further offense conduct during the period for which the defendant failed to register;\r\nand the offender’s criminal history.\r\nThe amendment creates a new guideline, §2A3.5 (Failure to Register as a Sex Offender), to\r\naddress the directive. The new guideline provides three alternative base offense levels based\r\non the tiered category of the sex offender: level 16 if the defendant was required to register\r\n\r\nas a Tier III offender; level 14 if the defendant was required to register as a Tier II offender;\r\nand level 12 if the defendant was required to register as a Tier I offender.\r\nThe amendment also provides two specific offense characteristics. First, subsection (b)(1)\r\nprovides a tiered enhancement to address criminal conduct committed while the defendant\r\nis in a failure to register status. Specifically, §2A3.5(b)(1) provides a six-level increase if,\r\nwhile in a failure to register status, the defendant committed a sex offense against an adult,\r\na six-level increase if the defendant committed a felony offense against a minor, and an\r\neight-level increase if the defendant committed a sex offense against a minor. Second,\r\n§2A3.5(b)(2) provides a three-level decrease if the defendant voluntarily corrected the failure\r\nto register or voluntarily attempted to register but was prevented from registering by\r\nuncontrollable circumstances, and the defendant did not contribute to the creation of those\r\ncircumstances. The reduction covers cases in which (1) the defendant either does not attempt\r\nto register until after the relevant registration period has expired but subsequently\r\nsuccessfully registers, thereby correcting the failure to register status, or (2) the defendant,\r\neither before or after the registration period has expired, attempted to register but\r\ncircumstances beyond the defendant’s control prevented the defendant from successfully\r\nregistering. An application note specifies that the voluntary attempt to register or to correct\r\nthe failure to register must have occurred prior to the time the defendant knew or reasonably\r\nshould have known a jurisdiction had detected the failure to register. The application note\r\nalso provides that the reduction does not apply if the enhancement for committing one of the\r\nenumerated offenses in §2A3.5(b)(1) applies.\r\nAdditionally, the amendment adds §2A3.5 to the list of offenses that are considered\r\ngroupable under §3D1.2(d) because the failure to register offense is an ongoing and\r\ncontinuous offense.\r\nFifth, section 141 of the Adam Walsh Act created two new aggravated offenses relating to\r\nthe registration as a sex offender. Section 141 of the Act created 18 U.S.C. § 2250(c), which\r\ncarries a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment of 5 years and a statutory maximum\r\nterm of imprisonment of 30 years if a defendant commits a crime of violence while in a\r\nfailure to register status, with the sentence to be consecutive to the punishment provided for\r\nthe failure to register. Section 702 of the Adam Walsh Act created a new offense at 18\r\nU.S.C. § 2260A that prohibits the commission of various enumerated offenses while in a\r\nfailure to register status. The penalty for this offense is a mandatory term of imprisonment\r\nof 10 years to be imposed consecutively to the underlying offense.\r\nThe amendment creates a new guideline at §2A3.6 (Aggravated Offenses Relating to\r\nRegistration as a Sex Offender) to address these new offenses. The new guideline provides\r\nthat for offenses under section 2250(c), the guideline sentence is the minimum term of\r\nimprisonment required by statute, and for offenses under section 2260A, the guideline\r\nsentence is the term of imprisonment required by statute. Chapters Three and Four are not\r\nto apply. This is consistent with how the guidelines treat other offenses that carry both a\r\nspecified term of imprisonment and a requirement that such term be imposed consecutively.\r\nSee §§3D1.1 (Procedure for Determining Offense Level on Multiple Counts) and 5G1.2\r\n(Sentencing on Multiple Counts of Conviction).\r\nThe guideline includes an application note that provides an upward departure stating that\r\na sentence above the minimum term required by section 2250(c) is an upward departure\r\n\r\nfrom the guideline sentence. An upward departure may be warranted, for example, in a case\r\ninvolving a sex offense committed against a minor or if the offense resulted in serious bodily\r\ninjury to a minor.\r\nSixth, section 208 of the Adam Walsh Act added a new mandatory minimum term of\r\nimprisonment of 15 years under 18 U.S.C. § 1591(b)(1) for sex trafficking of an adult by\r\nforce, fraud, or coercion. In response, the amendment provides a new base offense level of\r\n34 in §2G1.1 (Promoting a Commercial Sex Act or Prohibited Sexual Conduct with an\r\nIndividual Other than a Minor) if the offense of conviction is 18 U.S.C. § 1591(b)(1), but\r\nretains a base offense level of 14 for all other offenses. In addition, the amendment limits\r\napplication of the specific offense characteristic at §2G1.1(b)(1) that applies if the offense\r\ninvolved fraud or coercion only to those offenses receiving a base offense level of 14.\r\nOffenses under 18 U.S.C. § 1591(b)(1) necessarily involve fraud and coercion and, therefore,\r\nsuch conduct is built into the heightened base offense level of 34. This limitation thus avoids\r\nunwarranted double counting.\r\nSeventh, section 208 of the Adam Walsh Act added a new mandatory minimum term of\r\nimprisonment of 15 years under 18 U.S.C. § 1591(b)(1) for sex trafficking of children under\r\n14 years of age and added a new mandatory minimum term of imprisonment of 10 years and\r\nincreased the statutory maximum term of imprisonment from 40 years to life under 18 U.S.C.\r\n§ 1591(b)(2) for sex trafficking of children who had attained the age of 14 years but had not\r\nattained the age of 18 years. Further, the Adam Walsh Act increased the mandatory\r\nminimum term of imprisonment from 5 years to 10 years and increased the statutory\r\nmaximum term of imprisonment from 30 years to life under both 18 U.S.C. § 2422(b), for\r\npersuading or enticing any person who has not attained the age of 18 years to engage in\r\nprostitution or any sexual activity for which any person can be charged with a criminal\r\noffense, and 18 U.S.C. § 2423(a), for transporting a person who has not attained the age of\r\n18 years in interstate or foreign commerce, with the intent that the person engage in\r\nprostitution, or in any sexual activity for which any person can be charged with a criminal\r\noffense.\r\nIn response, the amendment provides alternative base offense levels in §2G1.3 (Promoting\r\na Commercial Sex Act or Prohibited Sexual Conduct with a Minor; Transportation of Minors\r\nto Engage in a Commercial Sex Act or Prohibited Sexual Conduct; Travel to Engage in\r\nCommercial Sex Act or Prohibited Sexual Conduct with a Minor; Sex Trafficking of\r\nChildren; Use of Interstate Facilities to Transport Information about a Minor) based on the\r\nstatute of conviction and the conduct described in that conviction. For convictions under 18\r\nU.S.C. § 1591(b)(1), the base offense level is 34. For convictions under 18 U.S.C. §\r\n1591(b)(2), the base offense level is 30.\r\nThe amendment further provides a base offense level of 28 for convictions under 18 U.S.C.\r\n§§ 2422(b) and 2423(a). The two-level enhancement for the use of a computer at\r\n§2G1.3(b)(3) applied to 95 percent of offenders convicted under 18 U.S.C. § 2422(b) and\r\nsentenced under §2G1.3 in fiscal year 2006. In addition, the two-level enhancement for the\r\noffense involving a sexual act or sexual contact at §2G1.3(b)(4) applied to 95 percent of\r\noffenders convicted under 18 U.S.C. § 2423(a) and sentenced under this guideline in fiscal\r\nyear 2006 . With application of either enhancement, the mandatory minimum term of\r\nimprisonment of 120 months will be reached in the majority of convictions under 18 U.S.C.\r\n§§ 2422(b) and 2423(a), before application of other guidelines adjustments.\r\n\r\nFurther, the amendment addresses the interaction of two specific offense characteristics with\r\nthe alternative base offense levels. First, every conviction under 18 U.S.C. § 1591\r\nnecessarily involves a commercial sex act. With the base offense levels being determined\r\nbased on the statute of conviction, the amendment clarifies that §2G1.3(b)(4)(B), which\r\nprovides a two-level enhancement if the offense involved a commercial sex act, does not\r\napply if the defendant is convicted under 18 U.S.C. § 1591. Second, the amendment\r\nprecludes application of the age enhancement in §2G1.3(b)(5) if the base offense level is\r\ndetermined under subsection (a)(1) of §2G1.3 for a conviction under 18 U.S.C. § 1591(b)(1).\r\nThe base offense level provided by subsection (a)(1) of §2G1.3 takes into account the age\r\nof the victim and, therefore, limitations on application of subsections (b)(4)(B) and (b)(5)\r\nof §2G1.3 avoid unwarranted double counting.\r\nEighth, section 503 of the Adam Walsh Act created a new section, 18 U.S.C. § 2257A,\r\nadopting new recordkeeping obligations for the production of any book, magazine,\r\nperiodical, film, videotape, or digital image that contains a visual depiction of simulated\r\nsexually explicit conduct. Section 2257A has a statutory maximum of one year\r\nimprisonment for the failure to comply with the recordkeeping requirements and a statutory\r\nmaximum term of imprisonment of five years if the violation was to conceal a substantive\r\noffense that involves either causing a minor to engage in sexually explicit conduct for the\r\npurpose of producing a visual depiction or trafficking in material involving the sexual\r\nexploitation of a minor. The new offense is similar to 18 U.S.C. § 2257, which is referenced\r\nto §2G2.5 (Recordkeeping Offenses Involving the Production of Sexually Explicit Materials;\r\nFailure to Provide Required Marks in Commercial Electronic Mail). Accordingly, the\r\namendment refers the new offense to §2G2.5.\r\nNinth, section 701 of the Adam Walsh Act created a new offense in 18 U.S.C. § 2252A(g)\r\nthat prohibits engaging in child exploitation enterprises, defined as violating 18 U.S.C. §§\r\n1591, 1201 (if the victim is a minor), chapter 109A (involving a minor victim), chapter 110\r\n(except for 18 U.S.C. §§ 2257 and 2257A), or chapter 117 (involving a minor victim), as part\r\nof a series of felony violations constituting three or more separate incidents and involving\r\nmore than one victim, and committing those offenses in concert with three or more other\r\npeople. The statute provides a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment of 20 years.\r\nThe amendment creates a new guideline at §2G2.6 (Child Exploitation Enterprises) to cover\r\nthis new offense. The guideline provides a base offense level of 35 and four specific offense\r\ncharacteristics. The Commission anticipates these offenses typically will involve conduct\r\nencompassing at least one of the specific offense characteristics, resulting in an offense level\r\nof at least level 37. Thus, the mandatory minimum term of imprisonment of 240 months\r\ntypically is expected to be reached or exceeded, before application of other guideline\r\nadjustments.\r\nTenth, section 206 of the Adam Walsh Act increased the statutory maximum term of\r\nimprisonment from 4 years to 10 years under 18 U.S.C. § 2252B(b) for knowingly using a\r\nmisleading domain name with the intent to deceive a minor into viewing material harmful\r\nto minors on the Internet. In addition, section 703 of the Act created a new section, 18\r\nU.S.C. § 2252C, that carries a statutory maximum term of imprisonment of 10 years for\r\nknowingly embedding words or digital images into the source code of a website with the\r\nintent to deceive a person into viewing material constituting obscenity. Section 2252C(b)\r\ncarries a statutory maximum term of imprisonment of 20 years for knowingly embedding\r\n\r\nwords or digital images into the source code of a website with the intent to deceive a minor\r\ninto viewing material harmful to minors on the Internet.\r\nIn response to the new offense, the amendment expands the scope of subsection (b)(2) of\r\n§2G3.1 (Importing, Mailing, or Transporting Obscene Matter; Transferring Obscene Matter\r\nto a Minor; Misleading Domain Names) by adding to this enhancement \"embedded words\r\nor digital images into the source code on a website.\"\r\nEleventh, section 141 of the Adam Walsh Act added a new provision in 18 U.S.C. § 1001\r\nthat carries a statutory maximum term of imprisonment of 8 years for falsifying or covering\r\nup by any scheme or making materially false or fraudulent statements or making or using\r\nany false writings or documents that relate to offenses under chapters 109A, 109B, 110, and\r\n117, and under section 1591 of chapter 77. The amendment adds a new specific offense\r\ncharacteristic at subsection (b)(1)(A) of §2J1.2 (Obstruction of Justice) enhancing the\r\noffense level by four levels if the defendant was convicted under 18 U.S.C. § 1001 and the\r\nstatutory maximum term of 8 years’ imprisonment applies because the matter relates to sex\r\noffenses. The amendment also added language to Application Note 4 stating an upward\r\ndeparture may be warranted under the guideline in a case involving a particularly serious sex\r\noffense.\r\nTwelfth, section 206 of the Adam Walsh Act added 18 U.S.C. § 1591 to the list of offenses\r\nfor which a defendant is to be sentenced to life under 18 U.S.C. § 3559(e)(2)(A). The\r\namendment adds 18 U.S.C. § 1591 to the list of instant offenses of convictions that are\r\ncovered sex crimes under §4B1.5.\r\nThirteenth, section 141 of the Adam Walsh Act amended 18 U.S.C. §§ 3563 and 3583. The\r\namendment adds a new subdivision to (a)(9) of §5B1.3 and to (d)(7) of §5D1.3 to require\r\na defendant to comply with the new registration requirements provided by the Adam Walsh\r\nAct. The amendment also modifies the language in §§5B1.3(a)(9) and 5D1.3(d)(7) relating\r\nto defendants convicted of a sexual offense described in 18 U.S.C. § 4042(c)(4). Not all\r\nstates have implemented the new requirements, continuing to register sex offenders pursuant\r\nto the sex offender registry in place prior to July 27, 2006, the date of enactment of the Adam\r\nWalsh Act. Thus, it is necessary to maintain the language in the guidelines providing for\r\nconditions of probation and supervised release for those offenders.\r\nFourteenth, section 141 of the Act amended 18 U.S.C. § 3583(k), which provides that the\r\nauthorized term of supervised release for any offense under enumerated sex offenses is any\r\nterm of years or life. In response, the amendment adds offenses under chapter 109B and\r\nsections 1201 and 1591 of title 18 United States Code or 18 U.S.C. §§ 1201 and 1591 to the\r\ndefinition of sex offense under §5D1.2(b)(2) for which the length of the term of supervised\r\nrelease shall be not less than the minimum term of years specified for the offense and may\r\nbe up to life.\r\nFinally, the amendment provides a definition of \"minor\" in relevant guidelines that is\r\nconsistent with how this term is defined elsewhere in the guidelines. Outdated background\r\ncommentary also is deleted by this amendment.","EffectiveDate":"Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2007."},{"Id":702,"Title":"Amendment 702","Text":"Section 2B1.1(b)(13)(C) is amended by striking \"(b)(12)(B)\" and inserting\r\n\"(b)(13)(B)\".\r\nSection 2L1.1(b)(1) is amended by striking \"(a)(2)\" and inserting \"(a)(3)\".","Reason":"Reason for Amendment: This amendment corrects typographical errors in subsection\r\n(b)(13)(C) of §2B1.1 (Larceny, Embezzlement, and Other Forms of Theft; Offenses\r\nInvolving Stolen Property; Property Damage or Destruction; Fraud and Deceit; Forgery;\r\nOffenses Involving Altered or Counterfeit Instruments Other than Counterfeit Bearer\r\nObligations of the United States) and subsection (b)(1) of §2L1.1 (Smuggling, Transporting,\r\nor Harboring an Unlawful Alien).\r\nThe typographical error to §2B1.1(b)(13)(C) stems from redesignations made to §2B1.1 in\r\n2004 when the Commission added a new subsection (b)(7) in response to the Controlling the\r\nAssault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act of 2003 (\"CAN-SPAM Act\"),\r\nPub.

L. 109–181\r\n(2006). The directive, which required the Commission to promulgate an amendment under\r\nemergency amendment authority by September 12, 2006, instructs the Commission to\r\n\"review, and if appropriate, amend the Federal sentencing guidelines and policy statements\r\napplicable to persons convicted of any offense under section 2318 or 2320 of title 18, United\r\nStates Code.\"\r\nIn carrying out [the directive], the United States Sentencing Commission shall\r\ndetermine whether the definition of \"infringement amount\" set forth in application\r\nnote 2 of section 2B5.3 of the Federal sentencing guidelines is adequate to address\r\nsituations in which the defendant has been convicted of one of the offenses [under\r\nsection 2318 or 2320 of title 18, United States Code,] and the item in which the\r\ndefendant trafficked was not an infringing item but rather was intended to facilitate\r\ninfringement, such as an anti-circumvention device, or the item in which the\r\ndefendant trafficked was infringing and also was intended to facilitate infringement\r\nin another good or service, such as a counterfeit label, documentation, or packaging,\r\ntaking into account cases such as U.S. v. Sung, 87 F.3d 194 (7th Cir. 1996).\r\nThe amendment adds subdivision (vii) to Application Note 2(A) of §2B5.3 (Criminal\r\n\r\nInfringement of Copyright or Trademark) to provide that the infringement amount is based\r\non the retail value of the infringed item in a case under 18 U.S.C. § 2318 or § 2320 that\r\ninvolves a counterfeit label, patch, sticker, wrapper, badge, emblem, medallion, charm, box,\r\ncontainer, can, case, hangtag, documentation, or packaging of any type or nature (i) that has\r\nnot been affixed to, or does not enclose or accompany a good or service; and (ii) which, had\r\nit been so used, would appear to a reasonably informed purchaser to be affixed to, enclosing\r\nor accompanying an identifiable, genuine good or service. In such a case, the \"infringed\r\nitem\" is the identifiable, genuine good or service.\r\nIn addition to re-promulgating the emergency amendment, the amendment responds to the\r\ndirective by addressing violations of 17 U.S.C. §§ 1201 and 1204 involving circumvention\r\ndevices. The amendment addresses circumvention devices in two ways. First, the\r\namendment adds an application note regarding the determination of the infringement amount\r\nin cases under 17 U.S.C. §§ 1201 and 1204 in which the defendant used a circumvention\r\ndevice and thus obtained unauthorized access to a copyrighted work. Such an offense would\r\ninvolve an identifiable copyrighted work. Accordingly, consistent with the existing rules in\r\n§2B5.3, the \"retail value of the infringed item\" would be used for purposes of determining\r\nthe infringement amount. The amendment adds subsection (viii) to Application Note 2(A),\r\nand explains that the \"retail value of the infringed item\" is the price the user would have paid\r\nto access lawfully the copyrighted work, and the \"infringed item\" is the accessed work. If\r\nthe defendant violated 17 U.S.C. §§ 1201 and 1204 by conduct that did not include use of\r\na circumvention device, Application Note 2(B) would apply by default. Thus, as it does in\r\nany case not otherwise covered by Application Note 2(A), the infringement amount would\r\nbe determined by reference to the value of the infringing item, which in these cases would\r\nbe the circumvention device.\r\nSecond, the amendment expands the sentencing enhancement in §2B5.3(b)(3) to include\r\nconvictions under 17 U.S.C. §§ 1201 and 1204 for trafficking in circumvention devices.\r\nPrior to the amendment, §2B5.3(b)(3) provided a two-level enhancement and a minimum\r\noffense level of 12 for cases involving the manufacture, importation, or uploading of\r\ninfringing items. The purpose of the enhancement in §2B5.3(b)(3) is to provide greater\r\npunishment for defendants who put infringing items into the stream of commerce in a\r\nmanner that enables others to infringe the copyright or trademark. The Commission\r\ndetermined that trafficking in circumvention devices similarly enables others to infringe a\r\ncopyright and warrants greater punishment.\r\nThe amendment also strikes language in Application Note 3 mandating an adjustment under\r\n§3B1.3 (Abuse of Position of Trust or Use of Special Skill) in every case in which the\r\ndefendant de-encrypted or otherwise circumvented a technological security measure to gain\r\ninitial access to an infringed item. Instead, the note indicates that application of the\r\nadjustment may be appropriate in such a case because the Commission determined that not\r\nevery case involving de-encryption or circumvention requires the level of skill contemplated\r\nby the special skill adjustment.\r\nFinally, the amendment modifies Application Note 4 to address downward departures. The\r\naddition of this language recognizes that in some instances the method for calculating the\r\ninfringement amount may be based on a formula or extrapolation that overstates the actual\r\npecuniary harm to the copyright or trademark owner. This language is analogous to\r\ndeparture language in §2B1.1 (Larceny, Embezzlement, and Other Forms of Theft; Offenses\r\n\r\nInvolving Stolen Property; Property Damage or Destruction; Fraud and Deceit; Forgery;\r\nOffenses Involving Altered or Counterfeit Instruments Other than Counterfeit Bearer\r\nObligations of the United States) and thus promotes consistency between these two\r\neconomic crime guidelines.","EffectiveDate":"Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2007."},{"Id":705,"Title":"Amendment 705","Text":"Section 2D1.1(b) is amended by redesingating subdivisions (8) and (9), as\r\nsubdivisions (10) and (11), respectively; by redesignating subdivisions (5) through (7) as\r\nsubdivisions (6) through (8), respectively; by inserting after subdivision (4) the following:\r\n\"(5) If the defendant is convicted under 21 U.S.C. § 865, increase by 2 levels.\";\r\nand by inserting after subdivision (8), as redesignated by this amendment, the following:\r\n\"(9) If the defendant was convicted under 21 U.S.C. § 841(g)(1)(A), increase by\r\n2 levels.\".\r\nSection 2D1.1(b) is amended in subdivision (10), as redesignated by this amendment, by\r\nstriking \"greater\" and inserting \"greatest\"; by redesignating subdivision (C) as subdivision\r\n(D); and by striking subdivision (B) as follows:\r\n\"(B) If the offense (i) involved the manufacture of amphetamine or\r\nmethamphetamine; and (ii) created a substantial risk of harm to (I) human\r\nlife other than a life described in subdivision (C); or (II) the environment,\r\nincrease by 3 levels.

L. 109–177, and the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety\r\nAct of 2006 (the \"Adam Walsh Act\"), Pub. L. 109–248.\r\nFirst, the amendment addresses section 731 of the PATRIOT Reauthorization Act, which\r\ncreated a new offense at 21 U.S.C. § 865. The new offense provides a mandatory\r\nconsecutive sentence of 15 years’ imprisonment for smuggling of methamphetamine or its\r\nprecursor chemicals into the United States by a person enrolled in, or acting on behalf of\r\nsomeone or some entity enrolled in, any dedicated commuter lane, alternative or accelerated\r\ninspection system, or other facilitated entry program administered by the federal government\r\nfor use in entering the United States. The amendment refers the new offense to both\r\n§§2D1.1 (Unlawful Manufacturing, Importing, Exporting, or Trafficking (Including\r\nPossession with Intent to Commit These Offenses); Attempt or Conspiracy) and 2D1.11\r\n(Unlawfully Distributing, Importing, Exporting or Possessing a Listed Chemical; Attempt\r\nor Conspiracy), and provides a new two-level enhancement in §§2D1.1(b)(5) and\r\n2D1.11(b)(5) if the defendant is convicted under 21 U.S.C. § 865. The Commission\r\ndetermined that a two-level enhancement is appropriate because such conduct is analogous\r\nto abusing a position of trust, which receives a two-level adjustment under §3B1.3 (Abuse\r\nof Position of Trust or Use of Special Skill).\r\nSecond, the amendment modifies §2D1.1 to address the new offense in 21 U.S.C. § 841(g)\r\n(Internet Sales of Date Rape Drugs) created by the Adam Walsh Act. This offense, which\r\nis punishable up to statutory maximum term of imprisonment of 20 years, prohibits the use\r\nof the Internet to distribute a date rape drug to any person, \"knowing or with reasonable\r\ncause to believe that — (A) the drug would be used in the commission of criminal sexual\r\nconduct; or (B) the person is not an authorized purchaser.\" The statute defines \"date rape\r\ndrug\" as \"(i) gamma hydroxybutyric acid (GHB) or any controlled substance analogue of\r\nGHB, including gamma butyrolactone (GBL) or 1,4-butanediol; (ii) ketamine; (iii)\r\nflunitrazipam; or (iv) any substance which the Attorney General designates . . . to be used\r\nin committing rape or sexual assault.\" The amendment provides a new two-level\r\nenhancement in §2D1.1(b)(9) that is tailored to focus on the more serious conduct covered\r\nby the new statute, specifically conviction under 21 U.S.C. § 841(g)(1)(A), which covers\r\nindividuals who know or have reasonable cause to believe the drug would be used in the\r\n\r\ncommission of criminal sexual conduct.\r\nThird, the amendment eliminates the maximum base offense level of level 20 for ketamine\r\noffenses. Ketamine is a Schedule III controlled substance. The Drug Quantity Table at\r\n§2D1.1(c) provides a maximum offense level of 20 for most Schedule III substances because\r\nsuch substances are subject to a statutory maximum term of imprisonment of 5 years. If a\r\ndefendant is convicted under 21 U.S.C. § 841(g) for distributing ketamine, however, the\r\ndefendant is subject to a statutory maximum term of imprisonment of 20 years. Accordingly,\r\nthe amendment modifies the Drug Quantity Table in order to allow for appropriate\r\nsentencing of 21 U.S.C. § 841(g) offenses involving larger quantities of ketamine that\r\ncorrespond to offense levels greater than level 20. This approach is consistent with how\r\nother drug offenses with a statutory maximum term of imprisonment of 20 years are\r\npenalized and with how other date rape drugs are penalized. The amendment also provides\r\na marihuana equivalency in Application Note 10 for ketamine (1 unit of ketamine = 1 gram\r\nof marihuana).\r\nFourth, the amendment adds to §2D1.1, Application Note 10, a new drug equivalency for\r\n1,4-butanediol (BD) and gamma butyrolactone (GBL), both of which are included in the\r\ndefinition of date rape drugs under 21 U.S.C. § 841(g). Neither is a controlled substance.\r\nThe drug equivalency is 1 ml of BD or GBL equals 8.8 grams of marihuana. The\r\nCommission has received testimony that both substances are at least equipotent as GHB,\r\nwhich is punished at the same marihuana equivalency.\r\nFifth, the amendment addresses the new offense in 21 U.S.C. § 860a (Consecutive sentence\r\nfor manufacturing or distributing, or possessing with intent to manufacture or distribute,\r\nmethamphetamine on premises where children are present or reside), created by the\r\nPATRIOT Reauthorization Act. The new offense provides that a term of not more than 20\r\nyears’ imprisonment is to be imposed, in addition to any other sentence imposed, for\r\nmanufacturing, distributing, or possessing with the intent to manufacture or distribute,\r\nmethamphetamine on a premises where a minor is present or resides. The amendment\r\nmodifies §2D1.1(b)(8)(C) to provide a two-level increase (with a minimum offense level of\r\n14) if the defendant is convicted under 21 U.S.C. § 860a involving the distribution or\r\npossession with intent to distribute methamphetamine and a three-level increase (with a\r\nminimum offense level of 27) if the defendant is convicted under 21 U.S.C. § 860a involving\r\nthe manufacture or possession with intent to manufacture methamphetamine.\r\nTo account for the spectrum of harms created by methamphetamine offenses, and to address\r\nthe specific harms created by 21 U.S.C. § 860a, the amendment builds on the \"substantial\r\nrisk enhancement.\" This multi-tiered enhancement was added to §2D1.1 in 2000 in response\r\nto the Methamphetamine Anti-Proliferation Act of 2000, Pub. L. 106–310, Title XXXVI.\r\nSee USSG App. C (Amendments 608 and 620 (effective Dec. 12, 2000, and Nov. 1, 2001,\r\nrespectively)). Prior to this amendment, the first tier provided a two-level increase for basic\r\nenvironmental harms, such as discharging hazardous substances into the environment. The\r\nsecond tier provided a three-level increase, and a minimum offense level of 27, for the\r\nsubstantial risk of harm to the life of someone other than a minor or an incompetent. The\r\nfinal tier provided a six-level increase and a minimum offense level of 30 for the substantial\r\nrisk of harm to the life of a minor or incompetent or the environment.\r\nThe Commission determined that distributing, or possessing with the intent to distribute,\r\n\r\nmethamphetamine on a premises where a minor is present or resides presents a greater harm\r\nthan discharging a hazardous substance into the environment, but is a lesser harm than the\r\nsubstantial risk of harm to adults or to the environment created by the manufacture of\r\nmethamphetamine. Therefore, the amendment adds a new tier to the enhancement in the new\r\nsubdivision (b)(10)(B) in order to account for this conduct. A defendant convicted under 21\r\nU.S.C. § 860a for distributing, or possessing with the intent to distribute, methamphetamine\r\non a premises where a minor is present or resides will receive a two-level enhancement, with\r\na minimum offense level of 14.\r\nTo address the overlap of conduct covered by the enhancement for the substantial risk of\r\nharm to the life of a minor and the new offense of manufacturing, or possessing with the\r\nintent to manufacture, methamphetamine on a premises where a minor is present or resides,\r\na three-level enhancement and a minimum offense level of level 27 will apply in a case in\r\nwhich a minor is present, but in which the offense did not create a substantial risk of harm\r\nto the life of a minor. In any methamphetamine manufacturing offense which creates a\r\nsubstantial risk of harm to the life of a minor, a six-level enhancement and a minimum\r\noffense level of level 30 will apply.\r\nSixth, the amendment updates Appendix A (Statutory Index) to include references to the new\r\noffenses created by the PATRIOT Reauthorization and Adam Walsh Acts.","EffectiveDate":"Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2007."},{"Id":706,"Title":"Amendment 706","Text":"Section 2D1.1(c)(1) is amended by striking \"1.5 KG or more of Cocaine\r\nBase\" and inserting \"4.5 KG or more of Cocaine Base\".\r\nSection 2D1.1(c)(2) is amended by striking \"At least 500 G but less than 1.5 KG of Cocaine\r\nBase\" and inserting \"At least 1.5 KG but less than 4.5 KG of Cocaine Base\".\r\nSection 2D1.1(c)(3) is amended by striking \"At least 150 G but less than 500 G of Cocaine\r\nBase\" and inserting \"At least 500 G but less than 1.5 KG of Cocaine Base\".\r\nSection 2D1.1(c)(4) is amended by striking \"At least 50 G but less than 150 G of Cocaine\r\nBase\" and inserting \"At least 150 G but less than 500 G of Cocaine Base\".\r\nSection 2D1.1(c)(5) is amended by striking \"At least 35 G but less than 50 G of Cocaine\r\nBase\" and inserting \"At least 50 G but less than 150 G of Cocaine Base\".\r\nSection 2D1.1(c)(6) is amended by striking \"At least 20 G but less than 35 G of Cocaine\r\nBase\" and inserting \"At least 35 G but less than 50 G of Cocaine Base\".\r\nSection 2D1.1(c)(7) is amended by striking \"At least 5 G but less than 20 G of Cocaine\r\nBase\" and inserting \"At least 20 G but less than 35 G of Cocaine Base\".\r\nSection 2D1.1(c)(8) is amended by striking \"At least 4 G but less than 5 G of Cocaine Base\"\r\nand inserting \"At least 5 G but less than 20 G of Cocaine Base\".\r\nSection 2D1.1(c)(9) is amended by striking \"At least 3 G but less than 4 G of Cocaine Base\"\r\nand inserting \"At least 4 G but less than 5 G of Cocaine Base\".\r\n\r\nSection 2D1.1(c)(10) is amended by striking \"At least 2 G but less than 3 G of Cocaine\r\nBase\" and inserting \"At least 3 G but less than 4 G of Cocaine Base\".\r\nSection 2D1.1(c)(11) is amended by striking \"At least 1 G but less than 2 G of Cocaine\r\nBase\" and inserting \"At least 2 G but less than 3 G of Cocaine Base\".\r\nSection 2D1.1(c)(12) is amended by striking \"At least 500 MG but less than 1 G of Cocaine\r\nBase\" and inserting \"At least 1 G but less than 2 G of Cocaine Base\".\r\nSection 2D1.1(c)(13) is amended by striking \"At least 250 MG but less than 500 MG of\r\nCocaine Base\" and inserting \"At least 500 MG but less than 1 G of Cocaine Base\".\r\nSection 2D1.1(c)(14) is amended by striking \"Less than 250 MG of Cocaine Base\" and\r\ninserting \"Less than 500 MG of Cocaine Base\".\r\nThe Commentary to §2D1.1 captioned \"Application Notes\" is amended in Note 10 in the first\r\nparagraph by inserting before \"The Commission has used the sentences\" the following:\r\n\"Use of Drug Equivalency Tables.—\r\n(A) Controlled Substances Not Referenced in Drug Quantity Table.—\";\r\nby striking \"(A)\" before \"Use\" and inserting \"(i)\";

Pursuant to subdivision (B),\r\nthe equivalent quantity of marihuana for the cocaine and the\r\nmarihuana is 310 kg. (The cocaine converts to an equivalent of 300\r\nkg of marihuana (1.5 kg x 200 g = 300 kg), which when added to\r\nthe quantity of marihuana involved in the offense, results in an\r\nequivalent quantity of 310 kg of marihuana.) This corresponds to\r\na base offense level 26. Pursuant to the table in subdivision (II),\r\nthe base offense level of 26 results in a marihuana equivalency of\r\n\r\n5 kg for the cocaine base. Using this marihuana equivalency for\r\nthe cocaine base results in a marihuana equivalency of 100 kg (20\r\ng x 5 kg = 100 kg). Adding the quantities of marihuana of all three\r\ncontrolled substances results in a combined quantity of 410 kg of\r\nmarihuana, which corresponds to a combined base offense level of\r\n28 in the Drug Quantity Table.\".\r\nThe Commentary to §2D1.1 captioned \"Application Notes\" is amended in Note 10 by\r\nstriking \"DRUG EQUIVALENCY TABLES\" and inserting the following:\r\n\"(E) Drug Equivalency Tables.—\";\r\nand in the subdivision captioned \"Cocaine and Other Schedule I and II Stimulants (and their\r\nimmediate precursors)\" by striking \"1 gm of Cocaine Base (‘Crack’) = 20 kg of marihuana\".","Reason":"Reason for Amendment: The Commission identified as a policy priority for the\r\namendment cycle ending May 1, 2007, \"continuation of its work with the congressional,\r\nexecutive, and judicial branches of the government and other interested parties on cocaine\r\nsentencing policy,\" including reevaluating the Commission’s 2002 report to Congress,\r\nCocaine and Federal Sentencing Policy. As a result of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986,\r\nPub. L. 99–570, 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1) requires a five-year mandatory minimum penalty for\r\na first-time trafficking offense involving 5 grams or more of crack cocaine, or 500 grams of\r\npowder cocaine, and a ten-year mandatory minimum penalty for a first-time trafficking\r\noffense involving 50 grams or more of crack cocaine, or 5,000 grams or more of powder\r\ncocaine. Because 100 times more powder cocaine than crack cocaine is required to trigger\r\nthe same mandatory minimum penalty, this penalty structure is commonly referred to as the\r\n\"100-to-1 drug quantity ratio.\"\r\nTo assist the Commission in its consideration of Federal cocaine sentencing policy, the\r\nCommission received statements and heard expert testimony from the Executive Branch, the\r\nFederal judiciary, defense practitioners, state and local law enforcement representatives,\r\nmedical and treatment experts, academicians, social scientists, and interested community\r\nrepresentatives at hearings on November 14, 2006, and March 20, 2007. The Commission\r\nalso received substantial written public comment on Federal cocaine sentencing policy\r\nthroughout the amendment cycle.\r\nDuring the amendment cycle, the Commission updated its analysis of key sentencing data\r\nabout cocaine offenses and offenders; reviewed recent scientific literature regarding cocaine\r\nuse, effects, dependency, prenatal effects, and prevalence; researched trends in cocaine\r\ntrafficking patterns, price, and use; surveyed the state laws regarding cocaine penalties; and\r\nmonitored case law developments.\r\nCurrent data and information continue to support the Commission’s consistently held\r\nposition that the 100-to-1 drug quantity ratio significantly undermines various congressional\r\nobjectives set forth in the Sentencing Reform Act and elsewhere. These findings will be\r\nmore thoroughly explained in a forthcoming report that will present to Congress, on or\r\nbefore May 15, 2007, a number of recommendations for modifications to the statutory\r\npenalties for crack cocaine offenses. It is the Commission’s firm desire that this report will\r\nfacilitate prompt congressional action addressing the 100-to-1 drug quantity ratio.\r\n\r\nThe Commission’s recommendation and strong desire for prompt legislative action\r\nnotwithstanding, the problems associated with the 100-to-1 drug quantity ratio are so urgent\r\nand compelling that this amendment is promulgated as an interim measure to alleviate some\r\nof those problems. The Commission has concluded that the manner in which the Drug\r\nQuantity Table in §2D1.1 (Unlawful Manufacturing, Importing, Exporting, or Trafficking\r\n(Including Possession with Intent to Commit These Offenses); Attempt or Conspiracy)) was\r\nconstructed to incorporate the statutory mandatory minimum penalties for crack cocaine\r\noffenses is an area in which the Federal sentencing guidelines contribute to the problems\r\nassociated with the 100-to-1 drug quantity ratio.\r\nWhen Congress passed the 1986 Act, the Commission responded by generally incorporating\r\nthe statutory mandatory minimum sentences into the guidelines and extrapolating upward\r\nand downward to set guideline sentencing ranges for all drug quantities. The drug quantity\r\nthresholds in the Drug Quantity Table are set so as to provide base offense levels\r\ncorresponding to guideline ranges that are above the statutory mandatory minimum penalties.\r\nAccordingly, offenses involving 5 grams or more of crack cocaine were assigned a base\r\noffense level (level 26) corresponding to a sentencing guideline range of 63 to 78 months for\r\na defendant in Criminal History Category I (a guideline range that exceeds the five-year\r\nstatutory minimum for such offenses by at least three months). Similarly, offenses involving\r\n50 grams or more of crack cocaine were assigned a base offense level (level 32)\r\ncorresponding to a sentencing guideline range of 121 to 151 months for a defendant in\r\nCriminal History Category I (a guideline range that exceeds the ten-year statutory minimum\r\nfor such offenses by at least one month). Crack cocaine offenses for quantities above and\r\nbelow the mandatory minimum threshold quantities were set accordingly using the 100-to-1\r\ndrug quantity ratio.\r\nThis amendment modifies the drug quantity thresholds in the Drug Quantity Table so as to\r\nassign, for crack cocaine offenses, base offense levels corresponding to guideline ranges that\r\ninclude the statutory mandatory minimum penalties. Accordingly, pursuant to the\r\namendment, 5 grams of cocaine base are assigned a base offense level of 24 (51 to 63\r\nmonths at Criminal History Category I, which includes the five-year (60 month) statutory\r\nminimum for such offenses), and 50 grams of cocaine base are assigned a base offense level\r\nof 30 (97 to 121 months at Criminal History Category I, which includes the ten-year (120\r\nmonth) statutory minimum for such offenses). Crack cocaine offenses for quantities above\r\nand below the mandatory minimum threshold quantities similarly are adjusted downward by\r\ntwo levels. The amendment also includes a mechanism to determine a combined base\r\noffense level in an offense involving crack cocaine and other controlled substances.\r\nThe Commission’s prison impact model predicts that, assuming no change in the existing\r\nstatutory mandatory minimum penalties, this modification to the Drug Quantity Table will\r\naffect 69.7 percent of crack cocaine offenses sentenced under §2D1.1 and will result in a\r\nreduction in the estimated average sentence of all crack cocaine offenses from 121 months\r\nto 106 months, based on an analysis of cases sentenced in fiscal year 2006 under §2D1.1\r\ninvolving crack cocaine.\r\nHaving concluded once again that the 100-to-1 drug quantity ratio should be modified, the\r\nCommission recognizes that establishing federal cocaine sentencing policy ultimately is\r\nCongress’s prerogative. Accordingly, the Commission tailored the amendment to fit within\r\nthe existing statutory penalty scheme by assigning base offense levels that provide guideline\r\n\r\nNovember 1, 2011 APPENDIX C - VOLUME III Amendment 707\r\nranges that include the statutory mandatory minimum penalties for crack cocaine offenses.\r\nThe Commission, however, views the amendment only as an interim solution to some of the\r\nproblems associated with the 100-to-1 drug quantity ratio. It is neither a permanent nor a\r\ncomplete solution to those problems. Any comprehensive solution to the 100-to-1 drug\r\nquantity ratio requires appropriate legislative action by Congress.","EffectiveDate":"Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2007."},{"Id":707,"Title":"Amendment 707","Text":"Section 2D1.11(a) is amended by striking \"(e)\" after \"under subsection\" and\r\ninserting \"(d)\".\r\nThe Commentary to §2K2.1 captioned \"Application Notes\" is amended in Note 14 in\r\nsubdivision (B) by striking \"(b)(1)\" and inserting \"(b)(6)\".\r\nAppendix A (Statutory Index) is amended by inserting after the line referenced to 18 U.S.C.\r\n§ 930 the following:\r\n\"18 U.S.C. § 931 2K2.6\";\r\nand by striking the following:\r\n\"18 U.S.C. § 3147 2J1.7\".\r\nChapter Three, Part D is amended in the Introductory Commentary in the first paragraph by\r\ninserting after the first sentence the following:\r\n\"These rules apply to multiple counts of conviction (A) contained in the same\r\nindictment or information; or (B) contained in different indictments or informations\r\nfor which sentences are to be imposed at the same time or in a consolidated\r\nproceeding.\".\r\nThe Commentary to §3D1.1 captioned \"Application Note\" is amended by striking \"Note\"\r\nand inserting \"Notes\"; by redesignating Note 1 as Note 2; and by inserting the following as\r\nnew Note 1:\r\n\"1.

In addition, this guideline includes a cross reference, instructing\r\nthat if the purpose of the 18 U.S.C. § 1039 offense was to facilitate another offense, the\r\nguideline applicable to an attempt to commit the other offense should be applied, if the\r\nresulting offense level is higher. The Commission concluded that operation of the cross\r\nreference would capture the harms associated with the aggravated forms of this offense\r\nreferenced at 18 U.S.C. § 1039(d) or (e). The amendment also expands the scope of the\r\nexisting three-level enhancement in the guideline to include cases in which the defendant is\r\nconvicted under 18 U.S.C. § 1039(d) or (e). Thus, in a case in which the cross reference\r\ndoes not apply, application of the enhancement will capture the increased harms associated\r\nwith the aggravated offenses. Finally, the amendment expands the upward departure note\r\nto include tax return information of a substantial number of individuals.\r\nSection 153 of the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act of 2006, Pub. L. 109–248\r\n(the \"Adam Walsh Act\"), added a new offense at 42 U.S.C. § 16962, which provides a\r\nstatutory maximum term of imprisonment of 10 years for the improper release of information\r\nobtained in fingerprint-based checks for the background check of either foster or adoptive\r\nparents or of individuals employed by, or considering employment with, a private or public\r\neducational agency. Additionally, section 627 of the Adam Walsh Act added a new Class\r\nA Misdemeanor offense at 42 U.S.C. § 16984 prohibiting the use of a child’s fingerprints\r\nfor any purpose other than providing those fingerprints to the child’s parent or legal\r\nguardian. This amendment references both offenses to §2H3.1, providing a base offense\r\nlevel of 9 under §2H3.1(a)(1) if the defendant was convicted of violating 42 U.S.C. § 16962,\r\nand a base offense level of 6 if the defendant was convicted of violating 42 U.S.C. § 16984.\r\nFinally, this amendment implements the Violence Against Women and Department of Justice\r\nReauthorization Act of 2005, Pub. L. 109–162 (\"VAWA\"). VAWA included the\r\nInternational Marriage Broker Regulation Act of 2005 (\"IMBRA\"), which requires marriage\r\nbrokers to keep private information gathered in the course of their business confidential.\r\n\r\nNovember 1, 2011 APPENDIX C - VOLUME III Amendment 709\r\nNew offenses at 8 U.S.C. §§ 1375a(d)(3)(C) and 1375a(d)(5)(B) involve invasions of\r\nprotected privacy interests and, as such, are referenced to §2H3.1.\r\nThe Commission concluded that referencing these new offenses to §2H3.1 was appropriate\r\nbecause each of the new offenses is similar to the types of privacy offenses referenced to this\r\nguideline.","EffectiveDate":"Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2007."},{"Id":709,"Title":"Amendment 709","Text":"Section 4A1.1(f) is amended by striking \"was considered related to another\r\nsentence resulting from a conviction of a crime of violence\" and inserting \"was counted as\r\na single sentence\"; and by striking the last sentence as follows:\r\n\"Provided, that this item does not apply where the sentences are considered related\r\nbecause the offenses occurred on the same occasion.\".\r\nThe Commentary to §4A1.1 captioned \"Application Notes\" is amended in Note 6 by striking\r\nthe first paragraph as follows:\r\n\"§4A1.1(f).

In November 2006\r\nthe Commission hosted round-table discussions to receive input on criminal history issues\r\nfrom federal judges, prosecutors, defense attorneys, probation officers, and members of\r\nacademia. In addition, the Commission gathered information through its training programs,\r\nthe public comment process, and comments received during a public hearing of the\r\nCommission in March 2007. This amendment addresses two issues that were raised during\r\nthis process.\r\nFirst, the amendment addresses the counting of multiple prior sentences. The Commission\r\nhas heard from a number of practitioners throughout the criminal justice system that the\r\n\"related cases\" rules at subsection (a)(2) of §4A1.2 (Definitions and Instructions for\r\nComputing Criminal History) and Application Note 3 of §4A1.2 are too complex and lead\r\nto confusion. Moreover, a significant amount of litigation has arisen concerning application\r\nof the rules, and circuit conflicts have developed over the meaning of terms in the\r\ncommentary that define when prior sentences may be considered \"related.\" For example, the\r\ncommentary provides that prior sentences for offenses not separated by an intervening arrest\r\nare to be considered related if the sentences resulted from offenses that were consolidated\r\nfor sentencing. In determining whether offenses were consolidated for sentencing, some\r\ncourts have required that the record reflect a formal order of consolidation, while others have\r\nnot. Compare, e.g., United States v. Correa, 114 F.3d 314, 317 (1st Cir. 1997) (order\r\nrequired) with United States v. Huskey, 137 F.3d 283, 288 (5th Cir. 1998) (order not\r\nrequired).\r\nThe amendment simplifies the rules for counting multiple prior sentences and promotes\r\nconsistency in the application of the guideline. The amendment eliminates use of the term\r\n\"related cases\" at §4A1.2(a)(2) and instead uses the terms \"single\" and \"separate\" sentences.\r\nThis change in terminology was made because some have misunderstood the term \"related\r\ncases\" to suggest a relationship between the prior sentences and the instant offense. Prior\r\nsentences for conduct that is part of the instant offense are separately addressed at\r\n§4A1.2(a)(1) and Application Note 1 of that guideline.\r\nUnder the amendment, the initial inquiry will be whether the prior sentences were for\r\noffenses that were separated by an intervening arrest (i.e., the defendant was arrested for the\r\nfirst offense prior to committing the second offense). If so, they are to be considered\r\nseparate sentences, counted separately, and no further inquiry is required.\r\nIf the prior sentences were for offenses that were not separated by an intervening arrest, the\r\nsentences are to be counted as separate sentences unless the sentences (1) were for offenses\r\nthat were named in the same charging document, or (2) were imposed on the same day. In\r\neither of these situations they are treated as a single sentence.\r\nThe amendment further provides that in the case of a single sentence that comprises multiple\r\nconcurrent sentences of varying lengths, the longest sentence is to be used for purposes of\r\n\r\napplying subsection (a), (b) and (c) of §4A1.1 (Criminal History Category). In the case of\r\na single sentence that comprises multiple sentences that include one or more consecutive\r\nsentences, the aggregate sentence is to be used for purposes of applying §4A1.1(a), (b), and\r\n(c).\r\nInstances may arise in which a single sentence comprises multiple prior sentences for crimes\r\nof violence. In such a case, §4A1.1(f) will apply. Consistent with §4A1.1(f) and\r\nApplication Note 6 to §4A1.1, additional criminal history points will be awarded for certain\r\nsentences that otherwise do not receive points because they have been determined to be part\r\nof a single sentence. For example, if a defendant’s criminal history contains two robbery\r\nconvictions for which the defendant received concurrent five-year sentences of imprisonment\r\nand the sentences are considered a single sentence because the offenses were not separated\r\nby an intervening arrest and were imposed on the same day, a total of 3 points would be\r\nadded under §4A1.1(a). An additional point would be added under §4A1.1(f) because the\r\nsecond sentence was for a crime of violence that did not receive any points under §4A1.1(a),\r\n(b), or (c).\r\nThe amendment also provides for an upward departure at Application Note 12(A) to §4A1.1\r\nif counting multiple prior sentences as a single sentence would underrepresent the\r\nseriousness of the defendant’s criminal history and the danger that the defendant presents to\r\nthe public.\r\nSecond, the amendment addresses the use of misdemeanor and petty offenses in determining\r\na defendant’s criminal history score. Sections 4A1.2(c)(1) and (2) govern whether and when\r\ncertain misdemeanor and petty offenses are counted. Section 4A1.2(c)(1) lists offenses that\r\nare counted only when the prior sentence was a term of probation of at least one year or a\r\nterm of imprisonment of at least 30 days. Section 4A1.2(c)(2) lists offenses that are never\r\ncounted toward the defendant’s criminal history score. The amendment responds to concerns\r\nthat (1) some misdemeanor and petty offenses counted under the guidelines involve conduct\r\nthat is not serious enough to warrant increased punishment upon sentencing for a subsequent\r\noffense; (2) the presence of a prior misdemeanor or petty offense in a rare case can affect the\r\nsentence in the instant offense in a way that is greatly disproportionate to the seriousness of\r\nthe prior offense (such as when such a prior offense alone disqualifies a defendant from\r\nsafety valve eligibility); and (3) jurisdictional differences in defining misdemeanor and petty\r\noffenses can result in inconsistent application of criminal history points for substantially\r\nsimilar conduct.\r\nTo evaluate these concerns, the Commission conducted a study of misdemeanor and petty\r\noffenses and the criminal history rules that govern them, particularly §4A1.2(c)(1). The\r\nCommission examined a sample of 11,300 offenders sentenced in fiscal year 2006 to\r\ndetermine the type of misdemeanor and petty offenses counted in the criminal history score,\r\nthe frequency with which they occurred, and the particular guideline provisions that caused\r\nthem to be counted. In addition, the Commission examined a sample of offenders sentenced\r\nin 1992 who were subsequently released from imprisonment and monitored for two years\r\nfor evidence of recidivism. (See U.S. Sentencing Commission Measuring Recidivism: The\r\nCriminal History Computation of the Federal Sentencing Guidelines (2004) for additional\r\ninformation concerning this sample.) Furthermore, the Commission examined how state\r\nguidelines treat minor offenses.\r\n\r\nThe results of these analyses led the Commission to make three modifications to\r\n§4A1.2(c)(1) and (2). First, the amendment moves from §4A1.2(c)(1) to §4A1.2(c)(2) two\r\nclasses of offenses: fish and game violations and local ordinance violations (except those\r\nviolations that are also violations under state criminal law). Second, the amendment changes\r\nthe probation criterion at §4A1.2(c)(1) from a term of \"at least\" one year to a term of \"more\r\nthan\" one year. Finally, the amendment resolves a circuit conflict over the manner in which\r\na non-listed offense is determined to be \"similar to\" an offense listed at §4A1.2(c)(1) and (2).\r\nFish and game violations were moved from §4A1.2(c)(1) to §4A1.2(c)(2) so that they will\r\nnot be counted in a defendant’s criminal history score. Fish and game violations generally\r\ndo not involve criminal conduct that is more serious than the offense of conviction, and the\r\nrelatively minor sentences received by fish and game offenders in the fiscal year 2006 study\r\nsuggest that these offenses are not considered to be among the more serious offenses listed\r\nat §4A1.2(c)(1).\r\nIn addition, local ordinance violations (except those that are also violations of state law)\r\nwere moved from §4A1.2(c)(1) to §4A1.2(c)(2) so that they also will not be counted in a\r\ndefendant’s criminal history score. Similar to fish and game violations, local ordinance\r\nviolations generally do not represent conduct criminalized under state law. Moreover, these\r\noffenses also frequently received minor sentences. The exception in this amendment for\r\nviolations that are also criminal violations under state law will ensure that only the more\r\nserious prior criminal conduct will continue to be included in the criminal history score.\r\nSection 4A1.2(c)(1)(A) is amended to provide that the offenses listed at §4A1.2(c)(1) will\r\nbe counted \"only if (A) the sentence was a term of probation of more than one year or a term\r\nof imprisonment of at least thirty days, or (B) the prior offense was similar to the instant\r\noffense\" (emphasis added). The Commission received comment that some sentences of a\r\none-year term of probation constitute a default punishment summarily imposed by the state\r\nsentencing authority, particularly in those instances in which the probation imposed lacked\r\na supervision component or was imposed in lieu of a fine or to enable the payment of a fine.\r\nThe Commission determined that prior misdemeanor and petty offenses that receive such a\r\nrelatively minor default sentence should not be counted for criminal history purposes.\r\nThe amendment resolves a circuit conflict over the manner in which a court should\r\ndetermine whether a non-listed offense is \"similar to\" an offense listed at §4A1.2(c)(1) or\r\n(2). Some courts have adopted a \"common sense approach,\" first articulated by the Fifth\r\nCircuit in United States v. Hardeman, 933 F.2d 278, 281 (5th Cir. 1991). This common\r\nsense approach includes consideration of all relevant factors of similarity such as\r\n\"punishments imposed for the listed and unlisted offenses, the perceived seriousness of the\r\noffense as indicated by the level of punishment, the elements of the offense, the level of\r\nculpability involved, and the degree to which the commission of the offense indicates a\r\nlikelihood of recurring criminal conduct.\" Id. See also United States v. Martinez-Santos,\r\n184 F.3d 196, 205-06 (2d Cir. 1999) (adopting Hardeman approach); United States v.\r\nBooker, 71 F.3d 685, 689 (7th Cir. 1995) (same). Other courts have adopted a strict\r\n\"elements\" test, which involves solely a comparison between the elements of the two\r\noffenses to determine whether or not the offenses are similar. See United States v. Elmore,\r\n108 F.3d 23, 27 (3d Cir. 1997); United States v. Tigney, 367 F.3d 200, 201-02 (4th Cir.\r\n2004); United States v. Borer, 412 F.3d 987, 992 (8th Cir. 2005). This amendment, at\r\n\r\nNovember 1, 2011 APPENDIX C - VOLUME III Amendment 711\r\nApplication Note 12(A), adopts the Hardeman \"common sense approach\" as a means of\r\nensuring that courts are guided by a number of relevant factors that may help them determine\r\nwhether a non-listed offense is similar to a listed one.","EffectiveDate":"Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2007."},{"Id":710,"Title":"Amendment 710","Text":"Section 1B1.10(c) is amended by striking \"and\" and by inserting \", and 702\"\r\nbefore the period.","Reason":"Reason for Amendment: Amendment 702 corrects typographical errors in subsection\r\n(b)(13)(C) of §2B1.1 (Larceny, Embezzlement, and Other Forms of Theft; Offenses\r\nInvolving Stolen Property; Property Damage or Destruction; Fraud and Deceit; Forgery;\r\nOffenses Involving Altered or Counterfeit Instruments Other than Counterfeit Bearer\r\nObligations of the United States) and subsection (b)(1) of §2L1.1 (Smuggling, Transporting,\r\nor Harboring an Unlawful Alien).

Therefore, the equivalent\r\nquantity of marihuana for the cocaine base is 100 kg (20 g x 5 kg = 100 kg).\r\nPursuant to subdivision (B), the equivalent quantity of marihuana for the\r\ncocaine and marihuana is 310 kg. (The cocaine converts to an equivalent\r\nof 300 kg of marihuana (1.5 kg x 200 g = 300 kg), which, when added to\r\nthe 10 kg of marihuana, results in an equivalent quantity of 310 kg of\r\nmarihuana.) Adding the equivalent quantities of marihuana of all three\r\ndrug types results in a combined quantity of 410 kg of marihuana (100 kg\r\n\r\n+ 310 kg = 410 kg), which corresponds to a combined base offense level of\r\n28 in the Drug Quantity Table.\".\r\nThe Commentary to §2N2.1 captioned \"Application Notes\" is amended in Note 4 by\r\ninserting \"and Narco-Terrorism\" after \"Drugs\".\r\nThe Commentary to §5B1.3 captioned \"Application Note\", as added by Amendment 701,\r\nis amended by striking \"(b)\" each place it appears and inserting \"(a)\".\r\nThe Commentary to §5D1.3 captioned \"Application Note\", as added by Amendment 701,\r\nis amended by striking \"(b)\" each place it appears and inserting \"(a)\".\r\nAppendix A (Statutory Index) is amended by striking the lines referenced to \"50 U.S.C. §\r\n421\" and \"50 U.S.C. § 783(b)\" the first place they appear.","Reason":"Reason for Amendment: This amendment makes various technical and conforming\r\namendments in order to execute properly amendments submitted to Congress on May 1,\r\n2007, and that will become effective on November 1, 2007.

If none of the\r\namendments listed in subsection (c) is applicable, a\r\nreduction in the defendant’s term of imprisonment under\r\n18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2) is not consistent with this policy\r\nstatement and thus is not authorized.\r\n(b) In determining whether, and to what extent, a reduction in\r\nthe term of imprisonment is warranted for a defendant\r\neligible for consideration under 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2),\r\n\r\nthe court should consider the term of imprisonment that it\r\nwould have imposed had the amendment(s) to the\r\nguidelines listed in subsection (c) been in effect at the time\r\nthe defendant was sentenced, except that in no event may\r\nthe reduced term of imprisonment be less than the term of\r\nimprisonment the defendant has already served.\r\n(c) Amendments covered by this policy statement are listed in\r\nAppendix C as follows: 126, 130, 156, 176, 269, 329, 341,\r\n371, 379, 380, 433, 454, 461, 484, 488, 490, 499, 505,\r\n506, 516, 591, 599, 606, 657, and 702.\r\nCommentary\r\nApplication Notes:\r\n1. Eligibility for consideration under 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2) is triggered only\r\nby an amendment listed in subsection (c) that lowers the applicable\r\nguideline range.\r\n2. In determining the amended guideline range under subsection (b), the court\r\nshall substitute only the amendments listed in subsection (c) for the\r\ncorresponding guideline provisions that were applied when the defendant\r\nwas sentenced. All other guideline application decisions remain unaffected.\r\n3. Under subsection (b), the amended guideline range and the term of\r\nimprisonment already served by the defendant limit the extent to which an\r\neligible defendant’s sentence may be reduced under 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2).\r\nWhen the original sentence represented a downward departure, a\r\ncomparable reduction below the amended guideline range may be\r\nappropriate; however, in no case shall the term of imprisonment be reduced\r\nbelow time served. Subject to these limitations, the sentencing court has the\r\ndiscretion to determine whether, and to what extent, to reduce a term of\r\nimprisonment under this section.\r\n4. Only a term of imprisonment imposed as part of the original sentence is\r\nauthorized to be reduced under this section. This section does not authorize\r\na reduction in the term of imprisonment imposed upon revocation of\r\nsupervised release.\r\n5. If the limitation in subsection (b) relating to time already served precludes\r\na reduction in the term of imprisonment to the extent the court determines\r\notherwise would have been appropriate as a result of the amended guideline\r\nrange, the court may consider any such reduction that it was unable to grant\r\nin connection with any motion for early termination of a term of supervised\r\nrelease under 18 U.S.C. § 3583(e)(1). However, the fact that a defendant\r\nmay have served a longer term of imprisonment than the court determines\r\nwould have been appropriate in view of the amended guideline range shall\r\n\r\nnot, without more, provide a basis for early termination of supervised\r\nrelease. Rather, the court should take into account the totality of\r\ncircumstances relevant to a decision to terminate supervised release,\r\nincluding the term of supervised release that would have been appropriate\r\nin connection with a sentence under the amended guideline range.\r\nBackground: Section 3582(c)(2) of Title 18, United States Code, provides: ‘[I]n the\r\ncase of a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a\r\nsentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission\r\npursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 994(o), upon motion of the defendant or the Director of the\r\nBureau of Prisons, or on its own motion, the court may reduce the term of\r\nimprisonment, after considering the factors set forth in section 3553(a) to the extent\r\nthat they are applicable, if such a reduction is consistent with applicable policy\r\nstatements issued by the Sentencing Commission.’\r\nThis policy statement provides guidance for a court when considering a\r\nmotion under 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2) and implements 28 U.S.C. § 994(u), which\r\nprovides: ‘If the Commission reduces the term of imprisonment recommended in the\r\nguidelines applicable to a particular offense or category of offenses, it shall specify\r\nin what circumstances and by what amount the sentences of prisoners serving terms\r\nof imprisonment for the offense may be reduced.’\r\nAmong the factors considered by the Commission in selecting the\r\namendments included in subsection (c) were the purpose of the amendment, the\r\nmagnitude of the change in the guideline range made by the amendment, and the\r\ndifficulty of applying the amendment retroactively to determine an amended\r\nguideline range under subsection (b).\r\nThe listing of an amendment in subsection (c) reflects policy determinations\r\nby the Commission that a reduced guideline range is sufficient to achieve the\r\npurposes of sentencing and that, in the sound discretion of the court, a reduction in\r\nthe term of imprisonment may be appropriate for previously sentenced, qualified\r\ndefendants. The authorization of such a discretionary reduction does not otherwise\r\naffect the lawfulness of a previously imposed sentence, does not authorize a\r\nreduction in any other component of the sentence, and does not entitle a defendant\r\nto a reduced term of imprisonment as a matter of right.\r\nThe Commission has not included in this policy statement amendments that\r\ngenerally reduce the maximum of the guideline range by less than six months. This\r\ncriterion is in accord with the legislative history of 28 U.S.C. § 994(u) (formerly\r\n§ 994(t)), which states: ‘It should be noted that the Committee does not expect that\r\nthe Commission will recommend adjusting existing sentences under the provision\r\nwhen guidelines are simply refined in a way that might cause isolated instances of\r\nexisting sentences falling above the old guidelines* or when there is only a minor\r\ndownward adjustment in the guidelines. The Committee does not believe the courts\r\nshould be burdened with adjustments in these cases.’ S. Rep. 225, 98th Cong., 1st\r\nSess. 180 (1983).\r\n*\r\nSo in original.

Reduction in Term of Imprisonment as a Result of Amended\r\nGuideline Range (Policy Statement)\r\n(a) Authority.—\r\n(1) In General.—In a case in which a defendant is\r\nserving a term of imprisonment, and the guideline\r\nrange applicable to that defendant has\r\nsubsequently been lowered as a result of an\r\namendment to the Guidelines Manual listed in\r\nsubsection (c) below, the court may reduce the\r\ndefendant’s term of imprisonment as provided by\r\n18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2). As required by 18 U.S.C.\r\n§ 3582(c)(2), any such reduction in the\r\ndefendant’s term of imprisonment shall be\r\nconsistent with this policy statement.\r\n(2) Exclusions.—A reduction in the defendant’s term\r\nof imprisonment is not consistent with this policy\r\nstatement and therefore is not authorized under 18\r\nU.S.C. § 3582(c)(2) if—\r\n(A) none of the amendments listed in\r\nsubsection (c) is applicable to the\r\ndefendant; or\r\n(B) an amendment listed in subsection (c)\r\ndoes not have the effect of lowering the\r\ndefendant’s applicable guideline range.\r\n(3) Limitation.—Consistent with subsection (b),\r\nproceedings under 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2) and this\r\npolicy statement do not constitute a full\r\nresentencing of the defendant.\r\n(b) Determination of Reduction in Term of Imprisonment.—\r\n(1) In General.—In determining whether, and to what\r\nextent, a reduction in the defendant’s term of\r\nimprisonment under 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2) and\r\nthis policy statement is warranted, the court shall\r\ndetermine the amended guideline range that would\r\nhave been applicable to the defendant if the\r\namendment(s) to the guidelines listed in\r\nsubsection (c) had been in effect at the time the\r\ndefendant was sentenced. In making such\r\ndetermination, the court shall substitute only the\r\n\r\namendments listed in subsection (c) for the\r\ncorresponding guideline provisions that were\r\napplied when the defendant was sentenced and\r\nshall leave all other guideline application\r\ndecisions unaffected.\r\n(2) Limitations and Prohibition on Extent of\r\nReduction.—\r\n(A) In General.—Except as provided in\r\nsubdivision (B), the court shall not reduce\r\nthe defendant’s term of imprisonment\r\nunder 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2) and this\r\npolicy statement to a term that is less than\r\nthe minimum of the amended guideline\r\nrange determined under subdivision (1) of\r\nthis subsection.\r\n(B) Exception.—If the original term of\r\nimprisonment imposed was less than the\r\nterm of imprisonment provided by the\r\nguideline range applicable to the\r\ndefendant at the time of sentencing, a\r\nreduction comparably less than the\r\namended guideline range determined\r\nunder subdivision (1) of this subsection\r\nmay be appropriate. However, if the\r\noriginal term of imprisonment constituted\r\na non-guideline sentence determined\r\npursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a) and\r\nUnited States v. Booker, 543 U.S. 220\r\n(2005), a further reduction generally\r\nwould not be appropriate.\r\n(C) Prohibition.—In no event may the\r\nreduced term of imprisonment be less\r\nthan the term of imprisonment the\r\ndefendant has already served.\r\n(c) Amendments covered by this policy statement are listed in\r\nAppendix C as follows: 126, 130, 156, 176, 269, 329, 341,\r\n371, 379, 380, 433, 454, 461, 484, 488, 490, 499, 505,\r\n506, 516, 591, 599, 606, 657, and 702.\r\nCommentary\r\nApplication Notes:\r\n1. Application of Subsection (a).—\r\n\r\n(A) Eligibility.—Eligibility for consideration under\r\n18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2) is triggered only by an amendment listed in\r\nsubsection (c) that lowers the applicable guideline range.\r\nAccordingly, a reduction in the defendant’s term of imprisonment\r\nis not authorized under 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2) and is not consistent\r\nwith this policy statement if: (i) none of the amendments listed in\r\nsubsection (c) is applicable to the defendant; or (ii) an amendment\r\nlisted in subsection (c) is applicable to the defendant but the\r\namendment does not have the effect of lowering the defendant’s\r\napplicable guideline range because of the operation of another\r\nguideline or statutory provision (e.g., a statutory mandatory\r\nminimum term of imprisonment).\r\n(B) Factors for Consideration.—\r\n(i) In General.—Consistent with 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2), the\r\ncourt shall consider the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. §\r\n3553(a) in determining: (I) whether a reduction in the\r\ndefendant’s term of imprisonment is warranted; and (II)\r\nthe extent of such reduction, but only within the limits\r\ndescribed in subsection (b).\r\n(ii) Public Safety Consideration.—The court shall consider the\r\nnature and seriousness of the danger to any person or the\r\ncommunity that may be posed by a reduction in the\r\ndefendant’s term of imprisonment in determining: (I)\r\nwhether such a reduction is warranted; and (II) the extent\r\nof such reduction, but only within the limits described in\r\nsubsection (b).\r\n(iii) Post-Sentencing Conduct.—The court may consider post-\r\nsentencing conduct of the defendant that occurred after\r\nimposition of the original term of imprisonment in\r\ndetermining: (I) whether a reduction in the defendant’s\r\nterm of imprisonment is warranted; and (II) the extent of\r\nsuch reduction, but only within the limits described in\r\nsubsection (b).\r\n2. Application of Subsection (b)(1).—In determining the amended guideline\r\nrange under subsection (b)(1), the court shall substitute only the\r\namendments listed in subsection (c) for the corresponding guideline\r\nprovisions that were applied when the defendant was sentenced. All other\r\nguideline application decisions remain unaffected.\r\n3. Application of Subsection (b)(2).—Under subsection (b)(2), the amended\r\nguideline range determined under subsection (b)(1) and the term of\r\nimprisonment already served by the defendant limit the extent to which the\r\ncourt may reduce the defendant’s term of imprisonment under 18 U.S.C. §\r\n\r\n3582(c)(2) and this policy statement. Specifically, if the original term of\r\nimprisonment imposed was within the guideline range applicable to the\r\ndefendant at the time of sentencing, the court shall not reduce the\r\ndefendant’s term of imprisonment to a term that is less than the minimum\r\nterm of imprisonment provided by the amended guideline range determined\r\nunder subsection (b)(1). For example, in a case in which: (A) the guideline\r\nrange applicable to the defendant at the time of sentencing was 41 to 51\r\nmonths; (B) the original term of imprisonment imposed was 41 months; and\r\n(C) the amended guideline range determined under subsection (b)(1) is 30\r\nto 37 months, the court shall not reduce the defendant’s term of\r\nimprisonment to a term less than 30 months.\r\nIf the original term of imprisonment imposed was less than the term of\r\nimprisonment provided by the guideline range applicable to the defendant\r\nat the time of sentencing, a reduction comparably less than the amended\r\nguideline range determined under subsection (b)(1) may be appropriate.\r\nFor example, in a case in which: (A) the guideline range applicable to the\r\ndefendant at the time of sentencing was 70 to 87 months; (B) the\r\ndefendant’s original term of imprisonment imposed was 56 months\r\n(representing a downward departure of 20 percent below the minimum term\r\nof imprisonment provided by the guideline range applicable to the\r\ndefendant at the time of sentencing); and (C) the amended guideline range\r\ndetermined under subsection (b)(1) is 57 to 71 months, a reduction to a term\r\nof imprisonment of 46 months (representing a reduction of approximately\r\n20 percent below the minimum term of imprisonment provided by the\r\namended guideline range determined under subsection (b)(1)) would\r\namount to a comparable reduction and may be appropriate.\r\nIn no case, however, shall the term of imprisonment be reduced below time\r\nserved. Subject to these limitations, the sentencing court has the discretion\r\nto determine whether, and to what extent, to reduce a term of imprisonment\r\nunder this section.\r\n4. Supervised Release.—\r\n(A) Exclusion Relating to Revocation.—Only a term of imprisonment\r\nimposed as part of the original sentence is authorized to be reduced\r\nunder this section. This section does not authorize a reduction in\r\nthe term of imprisonment imposed upon revocation of supervised\r\nrelease.\r\n(B) Modification Relating to Early Termination.—If the prohibition in\r\nsubsection (b)(2)(C) relating to time already served precludes a\r\nreduction in the term of imprisonment to the extent the court\r\ndetermines otherwise would have been appropriate as a result of the\r\namended guideline range determined under subsection (b)(1), the\r\ncourt may consider any such reduction that it was unable to grant\r\nin connection with any motion for early termination of a term of\r\nsupervised release under 18 U.S.C. § 3583(e)(1). However, the\r\n\r\nfact that a defendant may have served a longer term of\r\nimprisonment than the court determines would have been\r\nappropriate in view of the amended guideline range determined\r\nunder subsection (b)(1) shall not, without more, provide a basis for\r\nearly termination of supervised release. Rather, the court should\r\ntake into account the totality of circumstances relevant to a decision\r\nto terminate supervised release, including the term of supervised\r\nrelease that would have been appropriate in connection with a\r\nsentence under the amended guideline range determined under\r\nsubsection (b)(1).\r\nBackground: Section 3582(c)(2) of Title 18, United States Code, provides: ‘[I]n the\r\ncase of a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a\r\nsentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission\r\npursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 994(o), upon motion of the defendant or the Director of the\r\nBureau of Prisons, or on its own motion, the court may reduce the term of\r\nimprisonment, after considering the factors set forth in section 3553(a) to the extent\r\nthat they are applicable, if such a reduction is consistent with applicable policy\r\nstatements issued by the Sentencing Commission.’\r\nThis policy statement provides guidance and limitations for a court when\r\nconsidering a motion under 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2) and implements 28 U.S.C. §\r\n994(u), which provides: ‘If the Commission reduces the term of imprisonment\r\nrecommended in the guidelines applicable to a particular offense or category of\r\noffenses, it shall specify in what circumstances and by what amount the sentences\r\nof prisoners serving terms of imprisonment for the offense may be reduced.’\r\nAmong the factors considered by the Commission in selecting the\r\namendments included in subsection (c) were the purpose of the amendment, the\r\nmagnitude of the change in the guideline range made by the amendment, and the\r\ndifficulty of applying the amendment retroactively to determine an amended\r\nguideline range under subsection (b)(1).\r\nThe listing of an amendment in subsection (c) reflects policy determinations\r\nby the Commission that a reduced guideline range is sufficient to achieve the\r\npurposes of sentencing and that, in the sound discretion of the court, a reduction in\r\nthe term of imprisonment may be appropriate for previously sentenced, qualified\r\ndefendants.

Probably should be ‘to fall above the amended guidelines’.\".","Reason":"Reason for Amendment: This amendment makes a number of modifications to §1B1.10\r\n(Reduction in Term of Imprisonment as a Result of Amended Guideline Range) to clarify\r\nwhen, and to what extent, a reduction in the defendant’s term of imprisonment is consistent\r\nwith the policy statement and is therefore authorized under 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2).\r\nThe amendment modifies subsection (a) to state the statutory requirement under 18 U.S.C.\r\n§ 3582(c)(2) that a reduction in the defendant’s term of imprisonment be consistent with the\r\npolicy statement. The amendment also modifies subsection (a) to state that, consistent with\r\nsubsection (b), proceedings under 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2) do not constitute a full\r\nresentencing of the defendant.\r\nIn addition, the amendment amends subsection (a) to clarify circumstances in which a\r\nreduction in the defendant’s term of imprisonment is not consistent with the policy statement\r\nand therefore is not authorized under 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2). Specifically, the amendment\r\nprovides that a reduction in the defendant’s term of imprisonment is not consistent with\r\n§1B1.10 and therefore is not authorized under 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2) if (1) none of the\r\namendments listed in subsection (c) is applicable to the defendant; or (2) an amendment\r\nlisted in subsection (c) does not have the effect of lowering the defendant’s applicable\r\nguideline range. Application Note 1 provides further explanation that an amendment may\r\nbe listed in subsection (c) but not have the effect of lowering the defendant’s applicable\r\nguideline range because of the operation of another guideline or statutory provision (e.g., a\r\nstatutory mandatory minimum term of imprisonment). In such a case, a reduction in the\r\ndefendant’s term of imprisonment is not consistent with §1B1.10 and therefore is not\r\nauthorized under 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2).\r\nThe amendment modifies subsection (b) to clarify the limitations on the extent to which a\r\ncourt may reduce the defendant’s term of imprisonment under 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2) and\r\n§1B1.10. Specifically, in subsection (b)(1) the amendment provides that, in determining\r\nwhether, and to what extent, a reduction in the defendant’s term of imprisonment is\r\nwarranted, the court shall determine the amended guideline range that would have been\r\napplicable to the defendant if the amendment(s) to the guidelines listed in subsection (c) had\r\nbeen in effect at the time the defendant was sentenced, substituting only the amendments\r\nlisted in subsection (c) for the corresponding guideline provisions that were applied when\r\nthe defendant was sentenced and leaving all other guideline application decisions unaffected.\r\nIn subsection (b)(2) the amendment provides further clarification that the court shall not\r\nreduce the defendant’s term of imprisonment to a term that is less than the minimum of the\r\namended guideline range, except if the original term of imprisonment imposed was less than\r\nthe term of imprisonment provided by the guideline range applicable to the defendant at the\r\ntime of sentencing, a reduction comparably less than the amended guideline range may be\r\nappropriate. However, if the original term of imprisonment constituted a non-guideline\r\nsentence determined pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a) and United States v. Booker, 543 U.S.\r\n\r\nNovember 1, 2011 APPENDIX C - VOLUME III Amendment 714\r\n220 (2005), a further reduction generally would not be appropriate. The amendment clarifies\r\nthat in no event may the reduced term of imprisonment be less than the term of imprisonment\r\nthe defendant has already served. The amendment adds in Application Note 3 examples\r\nillustrating the limitations on the extent to which a court may reduce a defendant’s term of\r\nimprisonment under 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2) and §1B1.10.\r\nThe amendment also modifies Application Note 1 to delineate more clearly factors for\r\nconsideration by the court in determining whether, and to what extent, a reduction in the\r\ndefendant’s term of imprisonment is warranted under 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2). Specifically,\r\nthe amendment provides that the court shall consider the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. §\r\n3553(a), as required by 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2), and the nature and seriousness of the danger\r\nto any person or the community that may be posed by such a reduction, but only within the\r\nlimits described in subsection (b). In addition, the amendment provides that the court may\r\nconsider post-sentencing conduct of the defendant that occurred after imposition of the\r\noriginal term of imprisonment, but only within the limits described in subsection (b).\r\nThe amendment makes conforming changes and adds headings to the application notes, and\r\nmakes conforming changes to the background commentary.","EffectiveDate":"Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is March 3, 2008."},{"Id":713,"Title":"Amendment 713","Text":"Section 1B1.10, as amended by Amendment 712, is further amended in\r\nsubsection (c) by inserting \"Covered Amendments.—\" before \"Amendments\"; by striking\r\n\"and 702\"; and by inserting \"702, and 706 as amended by 711\" before the period.","Reason":"Reason for Amendment: This amendment expands the listing in §1B1.10(c) to implement\r\nthe directive in 28 U.S.C. § 994(u) with respect to guideline amendments that may be\r\nconsidered for retroactive application.

In addition, public safety will be considered in every case because §1B1.10,\r\nas amended by Amendment 712, requires the court, in determining whether and to what\r\nextent a reduction in the defendant’s term of imprisonment is warranted, to consider the\r\nnature and seriousness of the danger to any person or the community that may be posed by\r\nsuch a reduction.","EffectiveDate":"Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is March 3, 2008."},{"Id":714,"Title":"Amendment 714","Text":"Section 2B1.1(b) is amended by adding at the end the following:\r\n\r\n\"(16) If the offense involved fraud or theft involving any benefit authorized,\r\ntransported, transmitted, transferred, disbursed, or paid in connection with\r\na declaration of a major disaster or an emergency, increase by 2 levels.\".\r\nThe Commentary to §2B1.1 captioned \"Application Notes\" is amended in Note 3 by\r\ninserting after the paragraph that begins \"(III) Offenses Under 18 U.S.C. § 1030.—\" the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\"(IV) Disaster Fraud Cases.—In a case in which subsection (b)(16) applies,\r\nreasonably foreseeable pecuniary harm includes the administrative costs to\r\nany federal, state, or local government entity or any commercial or not-for-\r\nprofit entity of recovering the benefit from any recipient thereof who\r\nobtained the benefit through fraud or was otherwise ineligible for the\r\nbenefit that were reasonably foreseeable.\".\r\nThe Commentary to §2B1.1 captioned \"Application Notes\" is amended by redesignating\r\nNotes 15 through 19 as Notes 16 through 20, respectively; and by inserting after Note 14 the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\"15.

Under the Drug Quantity\r\nTable, 20 g of cocaine base corresponds to a base offense level of\r\n26. Pursuant to the table in subdivision (II), the base offense level\r\nof 26 corresponds to a marihuana equivalency of 5 kg per gram of\r\ncocaine base. Therefore, the equivalent quantity of marihuana for\r\nthe cocaine base is 100 kg (20 g x 5 kg = 100 kg). Pursuant to\r\nsubdivision (B), the equivalent quantity of marihuana for the\r\ncocaine and marihuana is 310 kg. (The cocaine converts to an\r\nequivalent of 300 kg of marihuana (1.5 kg x 200 g = 300 kg),\r\nwhich, when added to the 10 kg of marihuana, results in an\r\nequivalent quantity of 310 kg of marihuana.) Adding the\r\nequivalent quantities of marihuana of all three drug types results in\r\na combined quantity of 410 kg of marihuana (100 kg + 310 kg =\r\n410 kg), which corresponds to a combined base offense level of 28\r\nin the Drug Quantity Table.\",\r\nand inserting the following:\r\n\"(D) Determining Base Offense Level in Offenses Involving Cocaine Base and\r\nOther Controlled Substances.—\r\n(i) In General.—Except as provided in subdivision (ii), if the offense\r\ninvolves cocaine base (‘crack’) and one or more other controlled\r\nsubstance, determine the combined offense level as provided by\r\nsubdivision (B) of this note, and reduce the combined offense level\r\nby 2 levels.\r\n\r\n(ii) Exceptions to 2-level Reduction.—The 2-level reduction provided\r\nin subdivision (i) shall not apply in a case in which:\r\n(I) the offense involved 4.5 kg or more, or less than 250 mg,\r\nof cocaine base; or\r\n(II) the 2-level reduction results in a combined offense level\r\nthat is less than the combined offense level that would\r\napply under subdivision (B) of this note if the offense\r\ninvolved only the other controlled substance(s) (i.e., the\r\ncontrolled substance(s) other than cocaine base).\r\n(iii) Examples.—\r\n(I) The case involves 20 gm of cocaine base, 1.5 kg of\r\ncocaine, and 10 kg of marihuana. Under the Drug\r\nEquivalency Tables in subdivision (E) of this note, 20 gm\r\nof cocaine base converts to 400 kg of marihuana (20 gm x\r\n20 kg = 400 kg), and 1.5 kg of cocaine converts to 300 kg\r\nof marihuana (1.5 kg x 200 gm = 300 kg), which, when\r\nadded to the 10 kg of marihuana results in a combined\r\nequivalent quantity of 710 kg of marihuana. Under the\r\nDrug Quantity Table, 710 kg of marihuana corresponds to\r\na combined offense level of 30, which is reduced by two\r\nlevels to level 28. For the cocaine and marihuana, their\r\ncombined equivalent quantity of 310 kg of marihuana\r\ncorresponds to a combined offense level of 26 under the\r\nDrug Quantity Table. Because the combined offense level\r\nfor all three drug types after the 2-level reduction is not\r\nless than the combined base offense level for the cocaine\r\nand marihuana, the combined offense level for all three\r\ndrug types remains level 28.\r\n(II) The case involves 5 gm of cocaine base and 6 kg of heroin.\r\nUnder the Drug Equivalency Tables in subdivision (E) of\r\nthis note, 5 gm of cocaine base converts to 100 kg of\r\nmarihuana (5 gm x 20 kg = 100 kg), and 6 kg of heroin\r\nconverts to 6,000 kg of marihuana (6,000 gm x 1 kg =\r\n6,000 kg), which, when added together results in a\r\ncombined equivalent quantity of 6,100 kg of marihuana.\r\nUnder the Drug Quantity Table, 6,100 kg of marihuana\r\ncorresponds to a combined offense level of 34, which is\r\nreduced by two levels to 32. For the heroin, the 6,000 kg\r\nof marihuana corresponds to an offense level 34 under the\r\nDrug Quantity Table.

Specifically, Application Note 10(D) has resulted in a\r\ncertain sentencing anomaly in which some offenders have not received the benefit of the\r\ntwo-level reduction provided by Amendment 706 because of the conversion of cocaine base\r\nto its marihuana equivalent, and some offenders have received a reduction greater than\r\nintended (see Amendment 706).\r\nIn order to remedy this anomaly, this amendment modifies the Drug Equivalency Tables to\r\nprovide that 1 gram of cocaine base equals 20 kilograms of marihuana, as it did prior to\r\nAmendment 706, and amends Application Note 10(D) to provide that the combined offense\r\nlevel for an offense involving cocaine base and one or more other controlled substance is\r\ndetermined initially in the same manner as for other polydrug cases under Application Note\r\n10(B). In order to effectuate the two-level reduction intended by Amendment 706, this\r\namendment further provides that the resulting combined offense level is reduced by two\r\nlevels. However, the amendment provides three exclusions to application of the two-level\r\nreduction. First, the two-level reduction does not apply if the offense involved 4.5 kilograms\r\nor more of cocaine base because the offense levels for such offenses were unaffected by\r\nAmendment 706. Second, the two-level reduction does not apply if the offense involved less\r\nthan 250 milligrams of cocaine base in order to ensure that the offense level does not reduce\r\nbelow level 12, the minimum offense level in the Drug Quantity Table for offenses involving\r\ncocaine base. Third, the two-level reduction does not apply if it would result in a combined\r\noffense level that is less than the combined offense level that would apply if the offense\r\ninvolved only the other controlled substance(s) (i.e., the controlled substance(s) other than\r\ncocaine base). This third exclusion ensures that offenses involving controlled substances\r\nother than cocaine base do not receive a lower offense level than they otherwise would\r\nreceive merely because cocaine base also is involved in the offense.","EffectiveDate":"Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is May 1, 2008."},{"Id":716,"Title":"Amendment 716","Text":"Section 1B1.10 is amended in subsection (c) by striking \"and\"; and by\r\ninserting \", and 715\" before the period.","Reason":"Reason for Amendment: This amendment expands the listing in §1B1.10(c) (Reduction\r\nin Term of Imprisonment as a Result of Amended Guideline Range (Policy Statement)) to\r\ninclude Amendment 715 as an amendment that may be applied retroactively pursuant to 28\r\nU.S.C. § 994(u).

This introduction was amended occasionally\r\nbetween 1987 and 2003. In 2003, as part of the Commission’s\r\nimplementation of the Prosecutorial Remedies and Other Tools to end the\r\nExploitation of Children Today Act of 2003 (the \"PROTECT Act\", Public\r\nLaw 108–21), the original introduction was transferred to the Editorial Note\r\nat the end of this guideline. The Commission encourages the review of this\r\nmaterial for context and historical purposes.\r\nBackground: The Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 changed the course of federal\r\nsentencing. Among other things, the Act created the United States Sentencing\r\nCommission as an independent agency in the Judicial Branch, and directed it to\r\ndevelop guidelines and policy statements for sentencing courts to use when\r\nsentencing offenders convicted of federal crimes. Moreover, it empowered the\r\nCommission with ongoing responsibilities to monitor the guidelines, submit to\r\nCongress appropriate modifications of the guidelines and recommended changes in\r\ncriminal statutes, and establish education and research programs. The mandate\r\nrested on Congressional awareness that sentencing was a dynamic field that requires\r\ncontinuing review by an expert body to revise sentencing policies, in light of\r\napplication experience, as new criminal statutes are enacted, and as more is learned\r\nabout what motivates and controls criminal behavior.\r\n\r\nEditorial Note: Chapter One, Part A, as in effect on November 1, 1987, read as follows:\r\n\" CHAPTER ONE - INTRODUCTION\r\nAND GENERAL APPLICATION PRINCIPLES\r\nPART A - INTRODUCTION\r\n1. Authority\r\nThe United States Sentencing Commission (‘Commission’) is an independent agency in the judicial\r\nbranch composed of seven voting and two non-voting, ex officio members. Its principal purpose is to establish\r\nsentencing policies and practices for the federal criminal justice system that will assure the ends of justice by\r\npromulgating detailed guidelines prescribing the appropriate sentences for offenders convicted of federal crimes.\r\nThe guidelines and policy statements promulgated by the Commission are issued pursuant to Section\r\n994(a) of Title 28, United States Code.\r\n2. The Statutory Mission\r\nThe Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984 foresees guidelines that will further the basic purposes\r\nof criminal punishment, i.e., deterring crime, incapacitating the offender, providing just punishment, and\r\nrehabilitating the offender. It delegates to the Commission broad authority to review and rationalize the federal\r\nsentencing process.\r\nThe statute contains many detailed instructions as to how this determination should be made, but the\r\nmost important of them instructs the Commission to create categories of offense behavior and offender\r\ncharacteristics. An offense behavior category might consist, for example, of ‘bank robbery/committed with a\r\ngun/$2500 taken.’ An offender characteristic category might be ‘offender with one prior conviction who was not\r\nsentenced to imprisonment.’ The Commission is required to prescribe guideline ranges that specify an appropriate\r\nsentence for each class of convicted persons, to be determined by coordinating the offense behavior categories with\r\nthe offender characteristic categories. The statute contemplates the guidelines will establish a range of sentences\r\nfor every coordination of categories. Where the guidelines call for imprisonment, the range must be narrow: the\r\nmaximum imprisonment cannot exceed the minimum by more than the greater of 25 percent or six months. 28\r\nU.S.C. § 994(b)(2).\r\nThe sentencing judge must select a sentence from within the guideline range. If, however, a particular\r\ncase presents atypical features, the Act allows the judge to depart from the guidelines and sentence outside the\r\nrange. In that case, the judge must specify reasons for departure. 18 U.S.C. § 3553(b). If the court sentences within\r\nthe guideline range, an appellate court may review the sentence to see if the guideline was correctly applied. If the\r\njudge departs from the guideline range, an appellate court may review the reasonableness of the departure.\r\n18 U.S.C. § 3742. The Act requires the offender to serve virtually all of any prison sentence imposed, for it\r\nabolishes parole and substantially restructures good behavior adjustments.\r\nThe law requires the Commission to send its initial guidelines to Congress by April 13, 1987, and under\r\nthe present statute they take effect automatically on November 1, 1987. Pub. L. No. 98-473, § 235, reprinted at 18\r\nU.S.C. § 3551. The Commission may submit guideline amendments each year to Congress between the beginning\r\nof a regular session and May 1. The amendments will take effect automatically 180 days after submission unless\r\na law is enacted to the contrary. 28 U.S.C. § 994(p).\r\nThe Commission, with the aid of its legal and research staff, considerable public testimony, and written\r\ncommentary, has developed an initial set of guidelines which it now transmits to Congress. The Commission\r\nemphasizes, however, that it views the guideline-writing process as evolutionary. It expects, and the governing\r\nstatute anticipates, that continuing research, experience, and analysis will result in modifications and revisions to\r\nthe guidelines by submission of amendments to Congress. To this end, the Commission is established as a\r\npermanent agency to monitor sentencing practices in the federal courts throughout the nation.\r\n3. The Basic Approach (Policy Statement)\r\nTo understand these guidelines and the rationale that underlies them, one must begin with the three\r\nobjectives that Congress, in enacting the new sentencing law, sought to achieve. Its basic objective was to enhance\r\nthe ability of the criminal justice system to reduce crime through an effective, fair sentencing system. To achieve\r\nthis objective, Congress first sought honesty in sentencing. It sought to avoid the confusion and implicit deception\r\nthat arises out of the present sentencing system which requires a judge to impose an indeterminate sentence that is\r\nautomatically reduced in most cases by ‘good time’ credits. In addition, the parole commission is permitted to\r\ndetermine how much of the remainder of any prison sentence an offender actually will serve. This usually results\r\nin a substantial reduction in the effective length of the sentence imposed, with defendants often serving only about\r\none-third of the sentence handed down by the court.\r\n\r\nSecond, Congress sought uniformity in sentencing by narrowing the wide disparity in sentences imposed\r\nby different federal courts for similar criminal conduct by similar offenders. Third, Congress sought proportionality\r\nin sentencing through a system that imposes appropriately different sentences for criminal conduct of different\r\nseverity.\r\nHonesty is easy to achieve: The abolition of parole makes the sentence imposed by the court the\r\nsentence the offender will serve. There is a tension, however, between the mandate of uniformity (treat similar cases\r\nalike) and the mandate of proportionality (treat different cases differently) which, like the historical tension between\r\nlaw and equity, makes it difficult to achieve both goals simultaneously. Perfect uniformity -- sentencing every\r\noffender to five years -- destroys proportionality. Having only a few simple categories of crimes would make the\r\nguidelines uniform and easy to administer, but might lump together offenses that are different in important respects.\r\nFor example, a single category for robbery that lumps together armed and unarmed robberies, robberies with and\r\nwithout injuries, robberies of a few dollars and robberies of millions, is far too broad.\r\nAt the same time, a sentencing system tailored to fit every conceivable wrinkle of each case can become\r\nunworkable and seriously compromise the certainty of punishment and its deterrent effect. A bank robber with (or\r\nwithout) a gun, which the robber kept hidden (or brandished), might have frightened (or merely warned), injured\r\nseriously (or less seriously), tied up (or simply pushed) a guard, a teller or a customer, at night (or at noon), for a\r\nbad (or arguably less bad) motive, in an effort to obtain money for other crimes (or for other purposes), in the\r\ncompany of a few (or many) other robbers, for the first (or fourth) time that day, while sober (or under the influence\r\nof drugs or alcohol), and so forth.\r\nThe list of potentially relevant features of criminal behavior is long; the fact that they can occur in\r\nmultiple combinations means that the list of possible permutations of factors is virtually endless. The appropriate\r\nrelationships among these different factors are exceedingly difficult to establish, for they are often context specific.\r\nSentencing courts do not treat the occurrence of a simple bruise identically in all cases, irrespective of whether that\r\nbruise occurred in the context of a bank robbery or in the context of a breach of peace. This is so, in part, because\r\nthe risk that such a harm will occur differs depending on the underlying offense with which it is connected (and\r\ntherefore may already be counted, to a different degree, in the punishment for the underlying offense); and also\r\nbecause, in part, the relationship between punishment and multiple harms is not simply additive. The relation varies,\r\ndepending on how much other harm has occurred. (Thus, one cannot easily assign points for each kind of harm and\r\nsimply add them up, irrespective of context and total amounts.)\r\nThe larger the number of subcategories, the greater the complexity that is created and the less workable\r\nthe system. Moreover, the subcategories themselves, sometimes too broad and sometimes too narrow, will apply\r\nand interact in unforeseen ways to unforeseen situations, thus failing to cure the unfairness of a simple, broad\r\ncategory system. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, probation officers and courts, in applying a complex\r\nsystem of subcategories, would have to make a host of decisions about whether the underlying facts are sufficient\r\nto bring the case within a particular subcategory. The greater the number of decisions required and the greater their\r\ncomplexity, the greater the risk that different judges will apply the guidelines differently to situations that, in fact,\r\nare similar, thereby reintroducing the very disparity that the guidelines were designed to eliminate.\r\nIn view of the arguments, it is tempting to retreat to the simple, broad-category approach and to grant\r\njudges the discretion to select the proper point along a broad sentencing range. Obviously, however, granting such\r\nbroad discretion risks correspondingly broad disparity in sentencing, for different courts may exercise their\r\ndiscretionary powers in different ways. That is to say, such an approach risks a return to the wide disparity that\r\nCongress established the Commission to limit.\r\nIn the end, there is no completely satisfying solution to this practical stalemate. The Commission has\r\nhad to simply balance the comparative virtues and vices of broad, simple categorization and detailed, complex\r\nsubcategorization, and within the constraints established by that balance, minimize the discretionary powers of the\r\nsentencing court. Any ultimate system will, to a degree, enjoy the benefits and suffer from the drawbacks of each\r\napproach.\r\nA philosophical problem arose when the Commission attempted to reconcile the differing perceptions\r\nof the purposes of criminal punishment. Most observers of the criminal law agree that the ultimate aim of the law\r\nitself, and of punishment in particular, is the control of crime. Beyond this point, however, the consensus seems\r\nto break down. Some argue that appropriate punishment should be defined primarily on the basis of the moral\r\nprinciple of ‘just deserts.’ Under this principle, punishment should be scaled to the offender’s culpability and the\r\nresulting harms. Thus, if a defendant is less culpable, the defendant deserves less punishment. Others argue that\r\npunishment should be imposed primarily on the basis of practical ‘crime control’ considerations. Defendants\r\nsentenced under this scheme should receive the punishment that most effectively lessens the likelihood of future\r\ncrime, either by deterring others or incapacitating the defendant.\r\nAdherents of these points of view have urged the Commission to choose between them, to accord one\r\nprimacy over the other. Such a choice would be profoundly difficult. The relevant literature is vast, the arguments\r\ndeep, and each point of view has much to be said in its favor. A clear-cut Commission decision in favor of one\r\n\r\nof these approaches would diminish the chance that the guidelines would find the widespread acceptance they need\r\nfor effective implementation. As a practical matter, in most sentencing decisions both philosophies may prove\r\nconsistent with the same result.\r\nFor now, the Commission has sought to solve both the practical and philosophical problems of\r\ndeveloping a coherent sentencing system by taking an empirical approach that uses data estimating the existing\r\nsentencing system as a starting point. It has analyzed data drawn from 10,000 presentence investigations, crimes\r\nas distinguished in substantive criminal statutes, the United States Parole Commission’s guidelines and resulting\r\nstatistics, and data from other relevant sources, in order to determine which distinctions are important in present\r\npractice. After examination, the Commission has accepted, modified, or rationalized the more important of these\r\ndistinctions.\r\nThis empirical approach has helped the Commission resolve its practical problem by defining a list of\r\nrelevant distinctions that, although of considerable length, is short enough to create a manageable set of guidelines.\r\nExisting categories are relatively broad and omit many distinctions that some may believe important, yet they\r\ninclude most of the major distinctions that statutes and presentence data suggest make a significant difference in\r\nsentencing decisions. Important distinctions that are ignored in existing practice probably occur rarely. A\r\nsentencing judge may take this unusual case into account by departing from the guidelines.\r\nThe Commission’s empirical approach has also helped resolve its philosophical dilemma. Those who\r\nadhere to a just deserts philosophy may concede that the lack of moral consensus might make it difficult to say\r\nexactly what punishment is deserved for a particular crime, specified in minute detail. Likewise, those who\r\nsubscribe to a philosophy of crime control may acknowledge that the lack of sufficient, readily available data might\r\nmake it difficult to say exactly what punishment will best prevent that crime. Both groups might therefore recognize\r\nthe wisdom of looking to those distinctions that judges and legislators have, in fact, made over the course of time.\r\nThese established distinctions are ones that the community believes, or has found over time, to be important from\r\neither a moral or crime-control perspective.\r\nThe Commission has not simply copied estimates of existing practice as revealed by the data (even\r\nthough establishing offense values on this basis would help eliminate disparity, for the data represent averages).\r\nRather, it has departed from the data at different points for various important reasons. Congressional statutes, for\r\nexample, may suggest or require departure, as in the case of the new drug law that imposes increased and mandatory\r\nminimum sentences. In addition, the data may reveal inconsistencies in treatment, such as punishing economic\r\ncrime less severely than other apparently equivalent behavior.\r\nDespite these policy-oriented departures from present practice, the guidelines represent an approach that\r\nbegins with, and builds upon, empirical data. The guidelines will not please those who wish the Commission to\r\nadopt a single philosophical theory and then work deductively to establish a simple and perfect set of categorizations\r\nand distinctions. The guidelines may prove acceptable, however, to those who seek more modest, incremental\r\nimprovements in the status quo, who believe the best is often the enemy of the good, and who recognize that these\r\ninitial guidelines are but the first step in an evolutionary process. After spending considerable time and resources\r\nexploring alternative approaches, the Commission has developed these guidelines as a practical effort toward the\r\nachievement of a more honest, uniform, equitable, and therefore effective, sentencing system.\r\n4. The Guidelines’ Resolution of Major Issues (Policy Statement)\r\nThe guideline-writing process has required the Commission to resolve a host of important policy\r\nquestions, typically involving rather evenly balanced sets of competing considerations. As an aid to understanding\r\nthe guidelines, this introduction will briefly discuss several of those issues. Commentary in the guidelines explains\r\nothers.\r\n(a) Real Offense vs. Charge Offense Sentencing.\r\nOne of the most important questions for the Commission to decide was whether to base sentences upon\r\nthe actual conduct in which the defendant engaged regardless of the charges for which he was indicted or convicted\r\n(‘real offense’ sentencing), or upon the conduct that constitutes the elements of the offense with which the defendant\r\nwas charged and of which he was convicted (‘charge offense’ sentencing). A bank robber, for example, might have\r\nused a gun, frightened bystanders, taken $50,000, injured a teller, refused to stop when ordered, and raced away\r\ndamaging property during escape. A pure real offense system would sentence on the basis of all identifiable\r\nconduct. A pure charge offense system would overlook some of the harms that did not constitute statutory elements\r\nof the offenses of which the defendant was convicted.\r\nThe Commission initially sought to develop a real offense system. After all, the present sentencing\r\nsystem is, in a sense, a real offense system. The sentencing court (and the parole commission) take account of the\r\nconduct in which the defendant actually engaged, as determined in a presentence report, at the sentencing hearing,\r\nor before a parole commission hearing officer. The Commission’s initial efforts in this direction, carried out in the\r\nspring and early summer of 1986, proved unproductive mostly for practical reasons. To make such a system work,\r\n\r\neven to formalize and rationalize the status quo, would have required the Commission to decide precisely which\r\nharms to take into account, how to add them up, and what kinds of procedures the courts should use to determine\r\nthe presence or absence of disputed factual elements. The Commission found no practical way to combine and\r\naccount for the large number of diverse harms arising in different circumstances; nor did it find a practical way to\r\nreconcile the need for a fair adjudicatory procedure with the need for a speedy sentencing process, given the\r\npotential existence of hosts of adjudicated ‘real harm’ facts in many typical cases. The effort proposed as a solution\r\nto these problems required the use of, for example, quadratic roots and other mathematical operations that the\r\nCommission considered too complex to be workable, and, in the Commission’s view, risked return to wide disparity\r\nin practice.\r\nThe Commission therefore abandoned the effort to devise a ‘pure’ real offense system and instead\r\nexperimented with a ‘modified real offense system,’ which it published for public comment in a September 1986\r\npreliminary draft.\r\nThis version also foundered in several major respects on the rock of practicality. It was highly complex\r\nand its mechanical rules for adding harms (e.g., bodily injury added the same punishment irrespective of context)\r\nthreatened to work considerable unfairness. Ultimately, the Commission decided that it could not find a practical\r\nor fair and efficient way to implement either a pure or modified real offense system of the sort it originally wanted,\r\nand it abandoned that approach.\r\nThe Commission, in its January 1987 Revised Draft and the present guidelines, has moved closer to a\r\n‘charge offense’ system. The system is not, however, pure; it has a number of real elements. For one thing, the\r\nhundreds of overlapping and duplicative statutory provisions that make up the federal criminal law have forced the\r\nCommission to write guidelines that are descriptive of generic conduct rather than tracking purely statutory\r\nlanguage. For another, the guidelines, both through specific offense characteristics and adjustments, take account\r\nof a number of important, commonly occurring real offense elements such as role in the offense, the presence of\r\na gun, or the amount of money actually taken.\r\nFinally, it is important not to overstate the difference in practice between a real and a charge offense\r\nsystem. The federal criminal system, in practice, deals mostly with drug offenses, bank robberies and white collar\r\ncrimes (such as fraud, embezzlement, and bribery). For the most part, the conduct that an indictment charges\r\napproximates the real and relevant conduct in which the offender actually engaged.\r\nThe Commission recognizes its system will not completely cure the problems of a real offense system.\r\nIt may still be necessary, for example, for a court to determine some particular real facts that will make a difference\r\nto the sentence. Yet, the Commission believes that the instances of controversial facts will be far fewer; indeed,\r\nthere will be few enough so that the court system will be able to devise fair procedures for their determination. See\r\nUnited States v. Fatico, 579 F.2d 707 (2d Cir. 1978) (permitting introduction of hearsay evidence at sentencing\r\nhearing under certain conditions), on remand, 458 F. Supp. 388 (E.D.N.Y. 1978), aff’d, 603 F.2d 1053 (2d Cir.\r\n1979) (holding that the government need not prove facts at sentencing hearing beyond a reasonable doubt), cert.\r\ndenied, 444 U.S. 1073 (1980).\r\nThe Commission also recognizes that a charge offense system has drawbacks of its own. One of the most\r\nimportant is its potential to turn over to the prosecutor the power to determine the sentence by increasing or\r\ndecreasing the number (or content) of the counts in an indictment. Of course, the defendant’s actual conduct (that\r\nwhich the prosecutor can prove in court) imposes a natural limit upon the prosecutor’s ability to increase a\r\ndefendant’s sentence. Moreover, the Commission has written its rules for the treatment of multicount convictions\r\nwith an eye toward eliminating unfair treatment that might flow from count manipulation. For example, the\r\nguidelines treat a three-count indictment, each count of which charges sale of 100 grams of heroin, or theft of\r\n$10,000, the same as a single-count indictment charging sale of 300 grams of heroin or theft of $30,000. Further,\r\na sentencing court may control any inappropriate manipulation of the indictment through use of its power to depart\r\nfrom the specific guideline sentence. Finally, the Commission will closely monitor problems arising out of count\r\nmanipulation and will make appropriate adjustments should they become necessary.\r\n(b) Departures.\r\nThe new sentencing statute permits a court to depart from a guideline-specified sentence only when it\r\nfinds ‘an aggravating or mitigating circumstance ...that was not adequately taken into consideration by the\r\nSentencing Commission . . .’. 18 U.S.C. § 3553(b). Thus, in principle, the Commission, by specifying that it had\r\nadequately considered a particular factor, could prevent a court from using it as grounds for departure. In this initial\r\nset of guidelines, however, the Commission does not so limit the courts’ departure powers. The Commission intends\r\nthe sentencing courts to treat each guideline as carving out a ‘heartland,’ a set of typical cases embodying the\r\nconduct that each guideline describes. When a court finds an atypical case, one to which a particular guideline\r\nlinguistically applies but where conduct significantly differs from the norm, the court may consider whether a\r\ndeparture is warranted. Section 5H1.10 (Race, Sex, National Origin, Creed, Religion, Socio-Economic Status), the\r\nthird sentence of §5H1.4, and the last sentence of §5K2.12, list a few factors that the court cannot take into account\r\nas grounds for departure. With those specific exceptions, however, the Commission does not intend to\r\n\r\nlimit the kinds of factors (whether or not mentioned anywhere else in the guidelines) that could constitute grounds\r\nfor departure in an unusual case.\r\nThe Commission has adopted this departure policy for two basic reasons. First is the difficulty of\r\nforeseeing and capturing a single set of guidelines that encompasses the vast range of human conduct potentially\r\nrelevant to a sentencing decision. The Commission also recognizes that in the initial set of guidelines it need not\r\ndo so. The Commission is a permanent body, empowered by law to write and rewrite guidelines, with progressive\r\nchanges, over many years. By monitoring when courts depart from the guidelines and by analyzing their stated\r\nreasons for doing so, the Commission, over time, will be able to create more accurate guidelines that specify\r\nprecisely where departures should and should not be permitted.\r\nSecond, the Commission believes that despite the courts’ legal freedom to depart from the guidelines,\r\nthey will not do so very often. This is because the guidelines, offense by offense, seek to take account of those\r\nfactors that the Commission’s sentencing data indicate make a significant difference in sentencing at the present\r\ntime. Thus, for example, where the presence of actual physical injury currently makes an important difference in\r\nfinal sentences, as in the case of robbery, assault, or arson, the guidelines specifically instruct the judge to use this\r\nfactor to augment the sentence. Where the guidelines do not specify an augmentation or diminution, this is generally\r\nbecause the sentencing data do not permit the Commission, at this time, to conclude that the factor is empirically\r\nimportant in relation to the particular offense. Of course, a factor (say physical injury) may nonetheless sometimes\r\noccur in connection with a crime (such as fraud) where it does not often occur. If, however, as the data indicate,\r\nsuch occurrences are rare, they are precisely the type of events that the court’s departure powers were designed to\r\ncover -- unusual cases outside the range of the more typical offenses for which the guidelines were designed. Of\r\ncourse, the Commission recognizes that even its collection and analysis of 10,000 presentence reports are an\r\nimperfect source of data sentencing estimates. Rather than rely heavily at this time upon impressionistic accounts,\r\nhowever, the Commission believes it wiser to wait and collect additional data from our continuing monitoring\r\nprocess that may demonstrate how the guidelines work in practice before further modification.\r\nIt is important to note that the guidelines refer to three different kinds of departure. The first kind, which\r\nwill most frequently be used, is in effect an interpolation between two adjacent, numerically oriented guideline rules.\r\nA specific offense characteristic, for example, might require an increase of four levels for serious bodily injury but\r\ntwo levels for bodily injury. Rather than requiring a court to force middle instances into either the ‘serious’ or the\r\n‘simple’ category, the guideline commentary suggests that the court may interpolate and select a midpoint increase\r\nof three levels. The Commission has decided to call such an interpolation a ‘departure’ in light of the legal views\r\nthat a guideline providing for a range of increases in offense levels may violate the statute’s 25 percent rule (though\r\nothers have presented contrary legal arguments). Since interpolations are technically departures, the courts will have\r\nto provide reasons for their selection, and it will be subject to review for ‘reasonableness’ on appeal. The\r\nCommission believes, however, that a simple reference by the court to the ‘mid-category’ nature of the facts will\r\ntypically provide sufficient reason. It does not foresee serious practical problems arising out of the application of\r\nthe appeal provisions to this form of departure.\r\nThe second kind involves instances in which the guidelines provide specific guidance for departure, by\r\nanalogy or by other numerical or non-numerical suggestions. For example, the commentary to §2G1.1\r\n(Transportation for Prostitution), recommends a downward adjustment of eight levels where commercial purpose\r\nwas not involved. The Commission intends such suggestions as policy guidance for the courts. The Commission\r\nexpects that most departures will reflect the suggestions, and that the courts of appeals may prove more likely to\r\nfind departures ‘unreasonable’ where they fall outside suggested levels.\r\nA third kind of departure will remain unguided. It may rest upon grounds referred to in Chapter 5, Part\r\nH, or on grounds not mentioned in the guidelines. While Chapter 5, Part H lists factors that the Commission\r\nbelieves may constitute grounds for departure, those suggested grounds are not exhaustive. The Commission\r\nrecognizes that there may be other grounds for departure that are not mentioned; it also believes there may be cases\r\nin which a departure outside suggested levels is warranted. In its view, however, such cases will be highly unusual.\r\n(c) Plea Agreements.\r\nNearly ninety percent of all federal criminal cases involve guilty pleas, and many of these cases involve\r\nsome form of plea agreement. Some commentators on early Commission guideline drafts have urged the\r\nCommission not to attempt any major reforms of the agreement process, on the grounds that any set of guidelines\r\nthat threatens to radically change present practice also threatens to make the federal system unmanageable. Others,\r\nstarting with the same facts, have argued that guidelines which fail to control and limit plea agreements would leave\r\nuntouched a ‘loophole’ large enough to undo the good that sentencing guidelines may bring. Still other\r\ncommentators make both sets of arguments.\r\nThe Commission has decided that these initial guidelines will not, in general, make significant changes\r\nin current plea agreement practices. The court will accept or reject any such agreements primarily in accordance\r\nwith the rules set forth in Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(e). The Commission will collect data on the courts’ plea practices and\r\nwill analyze this information to determine when and why the courts accept or reject plea agreements. In light of\r\n\r\nthis information and analysis, the Commission will seek to further regulate the plea agreement process as\r\nappropriate.\r\nThe Commission nonetheless expects the initial set of guidelines to have a positive, rationalizing impact\r\nupon plea agreements for two reasons. First, the guidelines create a clear, definite expectation in respect to the\r\nsentence that a court will impose if a trial takes place. Insofar as a prosecutor and defense attorney seek to agree\r\nabout a likely sentence or range of sentences, they will no longer work in the dark. This fact alone should help to\r\nreduce irrationality in respect to actual sentencing outcomes. Second, the guidelines create a norm to which judges\r\nwill likely refer when they decide whether, under Rule 11(e), to accept or to reject a plea agreement or\r\nrecommendation. Since they will have before them the norm, the relevant factors (as disclosed in the plea\r\nagreement), and the reason for the agreement, they will find it easier than at present to determine whether there is\r\nsufficient reason to accept a plea agreement that departs from the norm.\r\n(d) Probation and Split Sentences.\r\nThe statute provides that the guidelines are to ‘reflect the general appropriateness of imposing a sentence\r\nother than imprisonment in cases in which the defendant is a first offender who has not been convicted of a crime\r\nof violence or an otherwise serious offense . . .’ 28 U.S.C. § 994(j). Under present sentencing practice, courts\r\nsentence to probation an inappropriately high percentage of offenders guilty of certain economic crimes, such as\r\ntheft, tax evasion, antitrust offenses, insider trading, fraud, and embezzlement, that in the Commission’s view are\r\n‘serious.’ If the guidelines were to permit courts to impose probation instead of prison in many or all such cases,\r\nthe present sentences would continue to be ineffective.\r\nThe Commission’s solution to this problem has been to write guidelines that classify as ‘serious’ (and\r\ntherefore subject to mandatory prison sentences) many offenses for which probation is now frequently given. At\r\nthe same time, the guidelines will permit the sentencing court to impose short prison terms in many such cases. The\r\nCommission’s view is that the definite prospect of prison, though the term is short, will act as a significant deterrent\r\nto many of these crimes, particularly when compared with the status quo where probation, not prison, is the norm.\r\nMore specifically, the guidelines work as follows in respect to a first offender. For offense levels one\r\nthrough six, the sentencing court may elect to sentence the offender to probation (with or without confinement\r\nconditions) or to a prison term. For offense levels seven through ten, the court may substitute probation for a prison\r\nterm, but the probation must include confinement conditions (community confinement or intermittent confinement).\r\nFor offense levels eleven and twelve, the court must impose at least one half the minimum confinement sentence\r\nin the form of prison confinement, the remainder to be served on supervised release with a condition of community\r\nconfinement. The Commission, of course, has not dealt with the single acts of aberrant behavior that still may\r\njustify probation at higher offense levels through departures.\r\n(e) Multi-Count Convictions.\r\nThe Commission, like other sentencing commissions, has found it particularly difficult to develop rules\r\nfor sentencing defendants convicted of multiple violations of law, each of which makes up a separate count in an\r\nindictment. The reason it is difficult is that when a defendant engages in conduct that causes several harms, each\r\nadditional harm, even if it increases the extent to which punishment is warranted, does not necessarily warrant a\r\nproportionate increase in punishment. A defendant who assaults others during a fight, for example, may warrant\r\nmore punishment if he injures ten people than if he injures one, but his conduct does not necessarily warrant ten\r\ntimes the punishment. If it did, many of the simplest offenses, for reasons that are often fortuitous, would lead to\r\nlife sentences of imprisonment--sentences that neither ‘just deserts’ nor ‘crime control’ theories of punishment\r\nwould find justified.\r\nSeveral individual guidelines provide special instructions for increasing punishment when the conduct\r\nthat is the subject of that count involves multiple occurrences or has caused several harms. The guidelines also\r\nprovide general rules for aggravating punishment in light of multiple harms charged separately in separate counts.\r\nThese rules may produce occasional anomalies, but normally they will permit an appropriate degree of aggravation\r\nof punishment when multiple offenses that are the subjects of separate counts take place.\r\nThese rules are set out in Chapter Three, Part D. They essentially provide: (1) When the conduct\r\ninvolves fungible items, e.g., separate drug transactions or thefts of money, the amounts are added and the guidelines\r\napply to the total amount. (2) When nonfungible harms are involved, the offense level for the most serious count\r\nis increased (according to a somewhat diminishing scale) to reflect the existence of other counts of conviction.\r\nThe rules have been written in order to minimize the possibility that an arbitrary casting of a single\r\ntransaction into several counts will produce a longer sentence. In addition, the sentencing court will have adequate\r\npower to prevent such a result through departures where necessary to produce a mitigated sentence.\r\n\r\n(f) Regulatory Offenses.\r\nRegulatory statutes, though primarily civil in nature, sometimes contain criminal provisions in respect\r\nto particularly harmful activity. Such criminal provisions often describe not only substantive offenses, but also more\r\ntechnical, administratively-related offenses such as failure to keep accurate records or to provide requested\r\ninformation. These criminal statutes pose two problems. First, which criminal regulatory provisions should the\r\nCommission initially consider, and second, how should it treat technical or administratively-related criminal\r\nviolations?\r\nIn respect to the first problem, the Commission found that it cannot comprehensively treat all regulatory\r\nviolations in the initial set of guidelines. There are hundreds of such provisions scattered throughout the United\r\nStates Code. To find all potential violations would involve examination of each individual federal regulation.\r\nBecause of this practical difficulty, the Commission has sought to determine, with the assistance of the Department\r\nof Justice and several regulatory agencies, which criminal regulatory offenses are particularly important in light of\r\nthe need for enforcement of the general regulatory scheme. The Commission has sought to treat these offenses in\r\nthese initial guidelines. It will address the less common regulatory offenses in the future.\r\nIn respect to the second problem, the Commission has developed a system for treating technical\r\nrecordkeeping and reporting offenses, dividing them into four categories.\r\nFirst, in the simplest of cases, the offender may have failed to fill out a form intentionally, but without\r\nknowledge or intent that substantive harm would likely follow. He might fail, for example, to keep an accurate\r\nrecord of toxic substance transport, but that failure may not lead, nor be likely to lead, to the release or improper\r\ntreatment of any toxic substance. Second, the same failure may be accompanied by a significant likelihood that\r\nsubstantive harm will occur; it may make a release of a toxic substance more likely. Third, the same failure may\r\nhave led to substantive harm. Fourth, the failure may represent an effort to conceal a substantive harm that has\r\noccurred.\r\nThe structure of a typical guideline for a regulatory offense is as follows:\r\n(1) The guideline provides a low base offense level (6) aimed at the first type of recordkeeping\r\nor reporting offense. It gives the court the legal authority to impose a punishment ranging\r\nfrom probation up to six months of imprisonment.\r\n(2) Specific offense characteristics designed to reflect substantive offenses that do occur (in\r\nrespect to some regulatory offenses), or that are likely to occur, increase the offense level.\r\n(3) A specific offense characteristic also provides that a recordkeeping or reporting offense that\r\nconceals a substantive offense will be treated like the substantive offense.\r\nThe Commission views this structure as an initial effort. It may revise its approach in light of further\r\nexperience and analysis of regulatory crimes.\r\n(g) Sentencing Ranges.\r\nIn determining the appropriate sentencing ranges for each offense, the Commission began by estimating\r\nthe average sentences now being served within each category. It also examined the sentence specified in\r\ncongressional statutes, in the parole guidelines, and in other relevant, analogous sources. The Commission’s\r\nforthcoming detailed report will contain a comparison between estimates of existing sentencing practices and\r\nsentences under the guidelines.\r\nWhile the Commission has not considered itself bound by existing sentencing practice, it has not tried\r\nto develop an entirely new system of sentencing on the basis of theory alone. Guideline sentences in many instances\r\nwill approximate existing practice, but adherence to the guidelines will help to eliminate wide disparity. For\r\nexample, where a high percentage of persons now receive probation, a guideline may include one or more specific\r\noffense characteristics in an effort to distinguish those types of defendants who now receive probation from those\r\nwho receive more severe sentences. In some instances, short sentences of incarceration for all offenders in a\r\ncategory have been substituted for a current sentencing practice of very wide variability in which some defendants\r\nreceive probation while others receive several years in prison for the same offense. Moreover, inasmuch as those\r\nwho currently plead guilty often receive lesser sentences, the guidelines also permit the court to impose lesser\r\nsentences on those defendants who accept responsibility and those who cooperate with the government.\r\nThe Commission has also examined its sentencing ranges in light of their likely impact upon prison\r\npopulation. Specific legislation, such as the new drug law and the career offender provisions of the sentencing law,\r\nrequire the Commission to promulgate rules that will lead to substantial prison population increases. These\r\nincreases will occur irrespective of any guidelines. The guidelines themselves, insofar as they reflect policy\r\ndecisions made by the Commission (rather than legislated mandatory minimum, or career offender, sentences), will\r\n\r\nlead to an increase in prison population that computer models, produced by the Commission and the Bureau of\r\nPrisons, estimate at approximately 10 percent, over a period of ten years.\r\n(h) The Sentencing Table.\r\nThe Commission has established a sentencing table. For technical and practical reasons it has 43 levels.\r\nEach row in the table contains levels that overlap with the levels in the preceding and succeeding rows. By\r\noverlapping the levels, the table should discourage unnecessary litigation. Both prosecutor and defendant will\r\nrealize that the difference between one level and another will not necessarily make a difference in the sentence that\r\nthe judge imposes. Thus, little purpose will be served in protracted litigation trying to determine, for example,\r\nwhether $10,000 or $11,000 was obtained as a result of a fraud. At the same time, the rows work to increase a\r\nsentence proportionately. A change of 6 levels roughly doubles the sentence irrespective of the level at which one\r\nstarts. The Commission, aware of the legal requirement that the maximum of any range cannot exceed the minimum\r\nby more than the greater of 25 percent or six months, also wishes to permit courts the greatest possible range for\r\nexercising discretion. The table overlaps offense levels meaningfully, works proportionately, and at the same time\r\npreserves the maximum degree of allowable discretion for the judge within each level.\r\nSimilarly, many of the individual guidelines refer to tables that correlate amounts of money with offense\r\nlevels. These tables often have many, rather than a few levels. Again, the reason is to minimize the likelihood of\r\nunnecessary litigation. If a money table were to make only a few distinctions, each distinction would become more\r\nimportant and litigation as to which category an offender fell within would become more likely. Where a table has\r\nmany smaller monetary distinctions, it minimizes the likelihood of litigation, for the importance of the precise\r\namount of money involved is considerably less.\r\n5. A Concluding Note\r\nThe Commission emphasizes that its approach in this initial set of guidelines is one of caution. It has\r\nexamined the many hundreds of criminal statutes in the United States Code. It has begun with those that are the\r\nbasis for a significant number of prosecutions. It has sought to place them in a rational order. It has developed\r\nadditional distinctions relevant to the application of these provisions, and it has applied sentencing ranges to each\r\nresulting category. In doing so, it has relied upon estimates of existing sentencing practices as revealed by its own\r\nstatistical analyses, based on summary reports of some 40,000 convictions, a sample of 10,000 augmented\r\npresentence reports, the parole guidelines and policy judgments.\r\nThe Commission recognizes that some will criticize this approach as overly cautious, as representing\r\ntoo little a departure from existing practice. Yet, it will cure wide disparity. The Commission is a permanent body\r\nthat can amend the guidelines each year. Although the data available to it, like all data, are imperfect, experience\r\nwith these guidelines will lead to additional information and provide a firm empirical basis for revision.\r\nFinally, the guidelines will apply to approximately 90 percent of all cases in the federal courts. Because\r\nof time constraints and the nonexistence of statistical information, some offenses that occur infrequently are not\r\nconsidered in this initial set of guidelines. They will, however, be addressed in the near future. Their exclusion\r\nfrom this initial submission does not reflect any judgment about their seriousness. The Commission has also\r\ndeferred promulgation of guidelines pertaining to fines, probation and other sanctions for organizational defendants,\r\nwith the exception of antitrust violations. The Commission also expects to address this area in the near future.\".\r\nAmendments\r\n1989 Amendments\r\nAmendment 67 amended Subpart 4(b) in the first sentence of the first paragraph by striking \"...that was\" and\r\ninserting \"of a kind, or to a degree,\"; in the second sentence of the last paragraph by striking \"Part H\" and inserting\r\n\"Part K (Departures)\"; and in the third sentence of the last paragraph by striking \"Part H\" and inserting \"Part K\".\r\nAmendment 68 amended Subpart 4(b) in the first sentence of the fourth paragraph by striking \"three\" and inserting\r\n\"two\"; in the fourth paragraph by striking the second through eighth sentences as follows:\r\n\"The first kind, which will most frequently be used, is in effect an interpolation between two adjacent,\r\nnumerically oriented guideline rules.

The Statutory Mission\r\nThe Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 (Title II of the Comprehensive Crime Control Act of\r\n1984) provides for the development of guidelines that will further the basic purposes of criminal\r\npunishment: deterrence, incapacitation, just punishment, and rehabilitation. The Act delegates broad\r\nauthority to the Commission to review and rationalize the federal sentencing process.\r\nThe Act contains detailed instructions as to how this determination should be made, the most\r\nimportant of which directs the Commission to create categories of offense behavior and offender\r\ncharacteristics. An offense behavior category might consist, for example, of ‘bank robbery/committed\r\nwith a gun/$2500 taken.’ An offender characteristic category might be ‘offender with one prior\r\nconviction not resulting in imprisonment.’ The Commission is required to prescribe guideline ranges\r\nthat specify an appropriate sentence for each class of convicted persons determined by coordinating the\r\noffense behavior categories with the offender characteristic categories. Where the guidelines call for\r\nimprisonment, the range must be narrow: the maximum of the range cannot exceed the minimum by\r\nmore than the greater of 25 percent or six months. 28 U.S.C. § 994(b)(2).\r\nPursuant to the Act, the sentencing court must select a sentence from within the guideline\r\nrange. If, however, a particular case presents atypical features, the Act allows the court to depart from\r\nthe guidelines and sentence outside the prescribed range. In that case, the court must specify reasons\r\nfor departure. 18 U.S.C. § 3553(b). If the court sentences within the guideline range, an appellate court\r\nmay review the sentence to determine whether the guidelines were correctly applied. If the court departs\r\nfrom the guideline range, an appellate court may review the reasonableness of the departure. 18 U.S.C.\r\n§ 3742. The Act also abolishes parole, and substantially reduces and restructures good behavior\r\nadjustments.\r\nThe Commission’s initial guidelines were submitted to Congress on April 13, 1987. After\r\nthe prescribed period of Congressional review, the guidelines took effect on November 1, 1987, and\r\napply to all offenses committed on or after that date. The Commission has the authority to submit\r\nguideline amendments each year to Congress between the beginning of a regular Congressional session\r\nand May 1. Such amendments automatically take effect 180 days after submission unless a law is\r\nenacted to the contrary. 28 U.S.C. § 994(p).\r\nThe initial sentencing guidelines and policy statements were developed after extensive\r\nhearings, deliberation, and consideration of substantial public comment. The Commission emphasizes,\r\nhowever, that it views the guideline-writing process as evolutionary. It expects, and the governing\r\nstatute anticipates, that continuing research, experience, and analysis will result in modifications and\r\nrevisions to the guidelines through submission of amendments to Congress. To this end, the\r\nCommission is established as a permanent agency to monitor sentencing practices in the federal courts.\r\n3. The Basic Approach (Policy Statement)\r\nTo understand the guidelines and their underlying rationale, it is important to focus on the\r\nthree objectives that Congress sought to achieve in enacting the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984. The\r\nAct’s basic objective was to enhance the ability of the criminal justice system to combat crime through\r\nan effective, fair sentencing system. To achieve this end, Congress first sought honesty in sentencing.\r\nIt sought to avoid the confusion and implicit deception that arose out of the pre-guidelines sentencing\r\nsystem which required the court to impose an indeterminate sentence of imprisonment and empowered\r\nthe parole commission to determine how much of the sentence an offender actually would serve in\r\nprison. This practice usually resulted in a substantial reduction in the effective length of the sentence\r\nimposed, with defendants often serving only about one-third of the sentence imposed by the court.\r\nSecond, Congress sought reasonable uniformity in sentencing by narrowing the wide\r\ndisparity in sentences imposed for similar criminal offenses committed by similar offenders. Third,\r\nCongress sought proportionality in sentencing through a system that imposes appropriately different\r\nsentences for criminal conduct of differing severity.\r\nHonesty is easy to achieve: the abolition of parole makes the sentence imposed by the court\r\n\r\nthe sentence the offender will serve, less approximately fifteen percent for good behavior. There is a\r\ntension, however, between the mandate of uniformity and the mandate of proportionality. Simple\r\nuniformity -- sentencing every offender to five years -- destroys proportionality.\r\nHaving only a few simple categories of crimes would make the guidelines uniform and easy to\r\nadminister, but might lump together offenses that are different in important respects. For example, a\r\nsingle category for robbery that included armed and unarmed robberies, robberies with and without\r\ninjuries, robberies of a few dollars and robberies of millions, would be far too broad.\r\nA sentencing system tailored to fit every conceivable wrinkle of each case would quickly\r\nbecome unworkable and seriously compromise the certainty of punishment and its deterrent effect. For\r\nexample: a bank robber with (or without) a gun, which the robber kept hidden (or brandished), might\r\nhave frightened (or merely warned), injured seriously (or less seriously), tied up (or simply pushed) a\r\nguard, teller, or customer, at night (or at noon), in an effort to obtain money for other crimes (or for other\r\npurposes), in the company of a few (or many) other robbers, for the first (or fourth) time.\r\nThe list of potentially relevant features of criminal behavior is long; the fact that they can\r\noccur in multiple combinations means that the list of possible permutations of factors is virtually endless.\r\nThe appropriate relationships among these different factors are exceedingly difficult to establish, for they\r\nare often context specific. Sentencing courts do not treat the occurrence of a simple bruise identically\r\nin all cases, irrespective of whether that bruise occurred in the context of a bank robbery or in the context\r\nof a breach of peace. This is so, in part, because the risk that such a harm will occur differs depending\r\non the underlying offense with which it is connected; and also because, in part, the relationship between\r\npunishment and multiple harms is not simply additive. The relation varies depending on how much\r\nother harm has occurred. Thus, it would not be proper to assign points for each kind of harm and simply\r\nadd them up, irrespective of context and total amounts.\r\nThe larger the number of subcategories of offense and offender characteristics included in\r\nthe guidelines, the greater the complexity and the less workable the system. Moreover, complex\r\ncombinations of offense and offender characteristics would apply and interact in unforeseen ways to\r\nunforeseen situations, thus failing to cure the unfairness of a simple, broad category system. Finally,\r\nand perhaps most importantly, probation officers and courts, in applying a complex system having\r\nnumerous subcategories, would be required to make a host of decisions regarding whether the\r\nunderlying facts were sufficient to bring the case within a particular subcategory. The greater the\r\nnumber of decisions required and the greater their complexity, the greater the risk that different courts\r\nwould apply the guidelines differently to situations that, in fact, are similar, thereby reintroducing the\r\nvery disparity that the guidelines were designed to reduce.\r\nIn view of the arguments, it would have been tempting to retreat to the simple, broad category\r\napproach and to grant courts the discretion to select the proper point along a broad sentencing range.\r\nGranting such broad discretion, however, would have risked correspondingly broad disparity in\r\nsentencing, for different courts may exercise their discretionary powers in different ways. Such an\r\napproach would have risked a return to the wide disparity that Congress established the Commission to\r\nreduce and would have been contrary to the Commission’s mandate set forth in the Sentencing Reform\r\nAct of 1984.\r\nIn the end, there was no completely satisfying solution to this problem. The Commission had\r\nto balance the comparative virtues and vices of broad, simple categorization and detailed, complex\r\nsubcategorization, and within the constraints established by that balance, minimize the discretionary\r\npowers of the sentencing court. Any system will, to a degree, enjoy the benefits and suffer from the\r\ndrawbacks of each approach.\r\nA philosophical problem arose when the Commission attempted to reconcile the differing\r\nperceptions of the purposes of criminal punishment. Most observers of the criminal law agree that the\r\nultimate aim of the law itself, and of punishment in particular, is the control of crime. Beyond this point,\r\nhowever, the consensus seems to break down. Some argue that appropriate punishment should be\r\ndefined primarily on the basis of the principle of ‘just deserts.’ Under this principle, punishment should\r\nbe scaled to the offender’s culpability and the resulting harms. Others argue that punishment should be\r\nimposed primarily on the basis of practical ‘crime control’ considerations. This theory calls for\r\nsentences that most effectively lessen the likelihood of future crime, either by deterring others or\r\nincapacitating the defendant.\r\nAdherents of each of these points of view urged the Commission to choose between them\r\nand accord one primacy over the other. As a practical matter, however, this choice was unnecessary\r\nbecause in most sentencing decisions the application of either philosophy will produce the same or\r\nsimilar results.\r\n\r\nIn its initial set of guidelines, the Commission sought to solve both the practical and\r\nphilosophical problems of developing a coherent sentencing system by taking an empirical approach that\r\nused as a starting point data estimating pre-guidelines sentencing practice. It analyzed data drawn from\r\n10,000 presentence investigations, the differing elements of various crimes as distinguished in\r\nsubstantive criminal statutes, the United States Parole Commission’s guidelines and statistics, and data\r\nfrom other relevant sources in order to determine which distinctions were important in pre-guidelines\r\npractice. After consideration, the Commission accepted, modified, or rationalized these distinctions.\r\nThis empirical approach helped the Commission resolve its practical problem by defining\r\na list of relevant distinctions that, although of considerable length, was short enough to create a\r\nmanageable set of guidelines. Existing categories are relatively broad and omit distinctions that some\r\nmay believe important, yet they include most of the major distinctions that statutes and data suggest\r\nmade a significant difference in sentencing decisions. Relevant distinctions not reflected in the\r\nguidelines probably will occur rarely and sentencing courts may take such unusual cases into account\r\nby departing from the guidelines.\r\nThe Commission’s empirical approach also helped resolve its philosophical dilemma. Those\r\nwho adhere to a just deserts philosophy may concede that the lack of consensus might make it difficult\r\nto say exactly what punishment is deserved for a particular crime. Likewise, those who subscribe to a\r\nphilosophy of crime control may acknowledge that the lack of sufficient data might make it difficult to\r\ndetermine exactly the punishment that will best prevent that crime. Both groups might therefore\r\nrecognize the wisdom of looking to those distinctions that judges and legislators have, in fact, made over\r\nthe course of time. These established distinctions are ones that the community believes, or has found\r\nover time, to be important from either a just deserts or crime control perspective.\r\nThe Commission did not simply copy estimates of pre-guidelines practice as revealed by the\r\ndata, even though establishing offense values on this basis would help eliminate disparity because the\r\ndata represent averages. Rather, it departed from the data at different points for various important\r\nreasons. Congressional statutes, for example, suggested or required departure, as in the case of the Anti-\r\nDrug Abuse Act of 1986 that imposed increased and mandatory minimum sentences. In addition, the\r\ndata revealed inconsistencies in treatment, such as punishing economic crime less severely than other\r\napparently equivalent behavior.\r\nDespite these policy-oriented departures from pre-guidelines practice, the guidelines\r\nrepresent an approach that begins with, and builds upon, empirical data. The guidelines will not please\r\nthose who wish the Commission to adopt a single philosophical theory and then work deductively to\r\nestablish a simple and perfect set of categorizations and distinctions. The guidelines may prove\r\nacceptable, however, to those who seek more modest, incremental improvements in the status quo, who\r\nbelieve the best is often the enemy of the good, and who recognize that these guidelines are, as the Act\r\ncontemplates, but the first step in an evolutionary process. After spending considerable time and\r\nresources exploring alternative approaches, the Commission developed these guidelines as a practical\r\neffort toward the achievement of a more honest, uniform, equitable, proportional, and therefore effective\r\nsentencing system.\r\n4. The Guidelines’ Resolution of Major Issues (Policy Statement)\r\nThe guideline-drafting process required the Commission to resolve a host of important policy\r\nquestions typically involving rather evenly balanced sets of competing considerations. As an aid to\r\nunderstanding the guidelines, this introduction briefly discusses several of those issues; commentary in\r\nthe guidelines explains others.\r\n(a) Real Offense vs. Charge Offense Sentencing.\r\nOne of the most important questions for the Commission to decide was whether to base\r\nsentences upon the actual conduct in which the defendant engaged regardless of the charges for which\r\nhe was indicted or convicted (‘real offense’ sentencing), or upon the conduct that constitutes the\r\nelements of the offense for which the defendant was charged and of which he was convicted (‘charge\r\noffense’ sentencing). A bank robber, for example, might have used a gun, frightened bystanders, taken\r\n$50,000, injured a teller, refused to stop when ordered, and raced away damaging property during his\r\nescape. A pure real offense system would sentence on the basis of all identifiable conduct. A pure\r\ncharge offense system would overlook some of the harms that did not constitute statutory elements of\r\nthe offenses of which the defendant was convicted.\r\nThe Commission initially sought to develop a pure real offense system. After all, the pre-\r\nguidelines sentencing system was, in a sense, this type of system. The sentencing court and the parole\r\ncommission took account of the conduct in which the defendant actually engaged, as determined in a\r\n\r\npresentence report, at the sentencing hearing, or before a parole commission hearing officer. The\r\nCommission’s initial efforts in this direction, carried out in the spring and early summer of 1986, proved\r\nunproductive, mostly for practical reasons. To make such a system work, even to formalize and\r\nrationalize the status quo, would have required the Commission to decide precisely which harms to take\r\ninto account, how to add them up, and what kinds of procedures the courts should use to determine the\r\npresence or absence of disputed factual elements. The Commission found no practical way to combine\r\nand account for the large number of diverse harms arising in different circumstances; nor did it find a\r\npractical way to reconcile the need for a fair adjudicatory procedure with the need for a speedy\r\nsentencing process given the potential existence of hosts of adjudicated ‘real harm’ facts in many typical\r\ncases. The effort proposed as a solution to these problems required the use of, for example, quadratic\r\nroots and other mathematical operations that the Commission considered too complex to be workable.\r\nIn the Commission’s view, such a system risked return to wide disparity in sentencing practice.\r\nIn its initial set of guidelines submitted to Congress in April 1987, the Commission moved\r\ncloser to a charge offense system. This system, however, does contain a significant number of real\r\noffense elements. For one thing, the hundreds of overlapping and duplicative statutory provisions that\r\nmake up the federal criminal law forced the Commission to write guidelines that are descriptive of\r\ngeneric conduct rather than guidelines that track purely statutory language. For another, the guidelines\r\ntake account of a number of important, commonly occurring real offense elements such as role in the\r\noffense, the presence of a gun, or the amount of money actually taken, through alternative base offense\r\nlevels, specific offense characteristics, cross references, and adjustments.\r\nThe Commission recognized that a charge offense system has drawbacks of its own. One\r\nof the most important is the potential it affords prosecutors to influence sentences by increasing or\r\ndecreasing the number of counts in an indictment. Of course, the defendant’s actual conduct (that which\r\nthe prosecutor can prove in court) imposes a natural limit upon the prosecutor’s ability to increase a\r\ndefendant’s sentence. Moreover, the Commission has written its rules for the treatment of multicount\r\nconvictions with an eye toward eliminating unfair treatment that might flow from count manipulation.\r\nFor example, the guidelines treat a three-count indictment, each count of which charges sale of\r\n100 grams of heroin or theft of $10,000, the same as a single-count indictment charging sale of\r\n300 grams of heroin or theft of $30,000. Furthermore, a sentencing court may control any inappropriate\r\nmanipulation of the indictment through use of its departure power. Finally, the Commission will closely\r\nmonitor charging and plea agreement practices and will make appropriate adjustments should they\r\nbecome necessary.\r\n(b) Departures.\r\nThe sentencing statute permits a court to depart from a guideline-specified sentence only\r\nwhen it finds ‘an aggravating or mitigating circumstance of a kind, or to a degree, not adequately taken\r\ninto consideration by the Sentencing Commission in formulating the guidelines that should result in a\r\nsentence different from that described.’ 18 U.S.C. § 3553(b). The Commission intends the sentencing\r\ncourts to treat each guideline as carving out a ‘heartland,’ a set of typical cases embodying the conduct\r\nthat each guideline describes. When a court finds an atypical case, one to which a particular guideline\r\nlinguistically applies but where conduct significantly differs from the norm, the court may consider\r\nwhether a departure is warranted. Section 5H1.10 (Race, Sex, National Origin, Creed, Religion, and\r\nSocio-Economic Status), the third sentence of §5H1.4 (Physical Condition, Including Drug or Alcohol\r\nDependence or Abuse), and the last sentence of §5K2.12 (Coercion and Duress) list several factors that\r\nthe court cannot take into account as grounds for departure. With those specific exceptions, however,\r\nthe Commission does not intend to limit the kinds of factors, whether or not mentioned anywhere else\r\nin the guidelines, that could constitute grounds for departure in an unusual case.\r\nThe Commission has adopted this departure policy for two reasons. First, it is difficult to\r\nprescribe a single set of guidelines that encompasses the vast range of human conduct potentially\r\nrelevant to a sentencing decision. The Commission also recognizes that the initial set of guidelines need\r\nnot do so. The Commission is a permanent body, empowered by law to write and rewrite guidelines,\r\nwith progressive changes, over many years. By monitoring when courts depart from the guidelines and\r\nby analyzing their stated reasons for doing so and court decisions with references thereto, the\r\nCommission, over time, will be able to refine the guidelines to specify more precisely when departures\r\nshould and should not be permitted.\r\nSecond, the Commission believes that despite the courts’ legal freedom to depart from the\r\nguidelines, they will not do so very often. This is because the guidelines, offense by offense, seek to\r\ntake account of those factors that the Commission’s data indicate made a significant difference in pre-\r\nguidelines sentencing practice. Thus, for example, where the presence of physical injury made an\r\nimportant difference in pre-guidelines sentencing practice (as in the case of robbery or assault), the\r\nguidelines specifically include this factor to enhance the sentence. Where the guidelines do not specify\r\n\r\nan augmentation or diminution, this is generally because the sentencing data did not permit the\r\nCommission to conclude that the factor was empirically important in relation to the particular offense.\r\nOf course, an important factor (e.g., physical injury) may infrequently occur in connection with a\r\nparticular crime (e.g., fraud). Such rare occurrences are precisely the type of events that the courts’\r\ndeparture powers were designed to cover -- unusual cases outside the range of the more typical offenses\r\nfor which the guidelines were designed.\r\nIt is important to note that the guidelines refer to two different kinds of departure. The first\r\ninvolves instances in which the guidelines provide specific guidance for departure by analogy or by\r\nother numerical or non-numerical suggestions. For example, the Commentary to §2G1.1 (Transportation\r\nfor the Purpose of Prostitution or Prohibited Sexual Conduct) recommends a downward departure of\r\neight levels where a commercial purpose was not involved. The Commission intends such suggestions\r\nas policy guidance for the courts. The Commission expects that most departures will reflect the\r\nsuggestions and that the courts of appeals may prove more likely to find departures ‘unreasonable’ where\r\nthey fall outside suggested levels.\r\nA second type of departure will remain unguided. It may rest upon grounds referred to in\r\nChapter Five, Part K (Departures) or on grounds not mentioned in the guidelines. While Chapter\r\nFive, Part K lists factors that the Commission believes may constitute grounds for departure, the list is\r\nnot exhaustive. The Commission recognizes that there may be other grounds for departure that are not\r\nmentioned; it also believes there may be cases in which a departure outside suggested levels is\r\nwarranted. In its view, however, such cases will be highly infrequent.\r\n(c) Plea Agreements.\r\nNearly ninety percent of all federal criminal cases involve guilty pleas and many of these\r\ncases involve some form of plea agreement. Some commentators on early Commission guideline drafts\r\nurged the Commission not to attempt any major reforms of the plea agreement process on the grounds\r\nthat any set of guidelines that threatened to change pre-guidelines practice radically also threatened to\r\nmake the federal system unmanageable. Others argued that guidelines that failed to control and limit\r\nplea agreements would leave untouched a ‘loophole’ large enough to undo the good that sentencing\r\nguidelines would bring.\r\nThe Commission decided not to make major changes in plea agreement practices in the initial\r\nguidelines, but rather to provide guidance by issuing general policy statements concerning the\r\nacceptance of plea agreements in Chapter Six, Part B (Plea Agreements). The rules set forth in Fed. R.\r\nCrim. P. 11(e) govern the acceptance or rejection of such agreements. The Commission will collect data\r\non the courts’ plea practices and will analyze this information to determine when and why the courts\r\naccept or reject plea agreements and whether plea agreement practices are undermining the intent of the\r\nSentencing Reform Act. In light of this information and analysis, the Commission will seek to further\r\nregulate the plea agreement process as appropriate. Importantly, if the policy statements relating to plea\r\nagreements are followed, circumvention of the Sentencing Reform Act and the guidelines should not\r\noccur.\r\nThe Commission expects the guidelines to have a positive, rationalizing impact upon plea\r\nagreements for two reasons. First, the guidelines create a clear, definite expectation in respect to the\r\nsentence that a court will impose if a trial takes place. In the event a prosecutor and defense attorney\r\nexplore the possibility of a negotiated plea, they will no longer work in the dark. This fact alone should\r\nhelp to reduce irrationality in respect to actual sentencing outcomes. Second, the guidelines create a\r\nnorm to which courts will likely refer when they decide whether, under Rule 11(e), to accept or to reject\r\na plea agreement or recommendation.\r\n(d) Probation and Split Sentences.\r\nThe statute provides that the guidelines are to ‘reflect the general appropriateness of imposing\r\na sentence other than imprisonment in cases in which the defendant is a first offender who has not been\r\nconvicted of a crime of violence or an otherwise serious offense . . . .’ 28 U.S.C. § 994(j). Under pre-\r\nguidelines sentencing practice, courts sentenced to probation an inappropriately high percentage of\r\noffenders guilty of certain economic crimes, such as theft, tax evasion, antitrust offenses, insider trading,\r\nfraud, and embezzlement, that in the Commission’s view are ‘serious.’\r\nThe Commission’s solution to this problem has been to write guidelines that classify as\r\nserious many offenses for which probation previously was frequently given and provide for at least a\r\nshort period of imprisonment in such cases. The Commission concluded that the definite prospect of\r\nprison, even though the term may be short, will serve as a significant deterrent, particularly when\r\ncompared with pre-guidelines practice where probation, not prison, was the norm.\r\n\r\nMore specifically, the guidelines work as follows in respect to a first offender. For offense\r\nlevels one through six, the sentencing court may elect to sentence the offender to probation (with or\r\nwithout confinement conditions) or to a prison term. For offense levels seven through ten, the court may\r\nsubstitute probation for a prison term, but the probation must include confinement conditions\r\n(community confinement, intermittent confinement, or home detention). For offense levels eleven and\r\ntwelve, the court must impose at least one-half the minimum confinement sentence in the form of prison\r\nconfinement, the remainder to be served on supervised release with a condition of community\r\nconfinement or home detention. The Commission, of course, has not dealt with the single acts of\r\naberrant behavior that still may justify probation at higher offense levels through departures.\r\n(e) Multi-Count Convictions.\r\nThe Commission, like several state sentencing commissions, has found it particularly difficult\r\nto develop guidelines for sentencing defendants convicted of multiple violations of law, each of which\r\nmakes up a separate count in an indictment. The difficulty is that when a defendant engages in conduct\r\nthat causes several harms, each additional harm, even if it increases the extent to which punishment is\r\nwarranted, does not necessarily warrant a proportionate increase in punishment. A defendant who\r\nassaults others during a fight, for example, may warrant more punishment if he injures ten people than\r\nif he injures one, but his conduct does not necessarily warrant ten times the punishment. If it did, many\r\nof the simplest offenses, for reasons that are often fortuitous, would lead to sentences of life\r\nimprisonment -- sentences that neither just deserts nor crime control theories of punishment would\r\njustify.\r\nSeveral individual guidelines provide special instructions for increasing punishment when\r\nthe conduct that is the subject of that count involves multiple occurrences or has caused several harms.\r\nThe guidelines also provide general rules for aggravating punishment in light of multiple harms charged\r\nseparately in separate counts. These rules may produce occasional anomalies, but normally they will\r\npermit an appropriate degree of aggravation of punishment for multiple offenses that are the subjects\r\nof separate counts.\r\nThese rules are set out in Chapter Three, Part D (Multiple Counts). They essentially provide:\r\n(1) when the conduct involves fungible items (e.g., separate drug transactions or thefts of money), the\r\namounts are added and the guidelines apply to the total amount; (2) when nonfungible harms are\r\ninvolved, the offense level for the most serious count is increased (according to a diminishing scale) to\r\nreflect the existence of other counts of conviction. The guidelines have been written in order to\r\nminimize the possibility that an arbitrary casting of a single transaction into several counts will produce\r\na longer sentence. In addition, the sentencing court will have adequate power to prevent such a result\r\nthrough departures.\r\n(f) Regulatory Offenses.\r\nRegulatory statutes, though primarily civil in nature, sometimes contain criminal provisions\r\nin respect to particularly harmful activity. Such criminal provisions often describe not only substantive\r\noffenses, but also more technical, administratively-related offenses such as failure to keep accurate\r\nrecords or to provide requested information. These statutes pose two problems: first, which criminal\r\nregulatory provisions should the Commission initially consider, and second, how should it treat technical\r\nor administratively-related criminal violations?\r\nIn respect to the first problem, the Commission found that it could not comprehensively treat\r\nall regulatory violations in the initial set of guidelines. There are hundreds of such provisions scattered\r\nthroughout the United States Code. To find all potential violations would involve examination of each\r\nindividual federal regulation. Because of this practical difficulty, the Commission sought to determine,\r\nwith the assistance of the Department of Justice and several regulatory agencies, which criminal\r\nregulatory offenses were particularly important in light of the need for enforcement of the general\r\nregulatory scheme. The Commission addressed these offenses in the initial guidelines.\r\nIn respect to the second problem, the Commission has developed a system for treating\r\ntechnical recordkeeping and reporting offenses that divides them into four categories. First, in the\r\nsimplest of cases, the offender may have failed to fill out a form intentionally, but without knowledge\r\nor intent that substantive harm would likely follow. He might fail, for example, to keep an accurate\r\nrecord of toxic substance transport, but that failure may not lead, nor be likely to lead, to the release or\r\nimproper handling of any toxic substance. Second, the same failure may be accompanied by a\r\nsignificant likelihood that substantive harm will occur; it may make a release of a toxic substance more\r\nlikely. Third, the same failure may have led to substantive harm. Fourth, the failure may represent an\r\neffort to conceal a substantive harm that has occurred.\r\nThe structure of a typical guideline for a regulatory offense provides a low base offense level\r\n\r\n(e.g., 6) aimed at the first type of recordkeeping or reporting offense. Specific offense characteristics\r\ndesigned to reflect substantive harms that do occur in respect to some regulatory offenses, or that are\r\nlikely to occur, increase the offense level. A specific offense characteristic also provides that a\r\nrecordkeeping or reporting offense that conceals a substantive offense will have the same offense level\r\nas the substantive offense.\r\n(g) Sentencing Ranges.\r\nIn determining the appropriate sentencing ranges for each offense, the Commission estimated\r\nthe average sentences served within each category under the pre-guidelines sentencing system. It also\r\nexamined the sentences specified in federal statutes, in the parole guidelines, and in other relevant,\r\nanalogous sources. The Commission’s Supplementary Report on the Initial Sentencing Guidelines\r\n(1987) contains a comparison between estimates of pre-guidelines sentencing practice and sentences\r\nunder the guidelines.\r\nWhile the Commission has not considered itself bound by pre-guidelines sentencing practice,\r\nit has not attempted to develop an entirely new system of sentencing on the basis of theory alone.\r\nGuideline sentences, in many instances, will approximate average pre-guidelines practice and adherence\r\nto the guidelines will help to eliminate wide disparity. For example, where a high percentage of persons\r\nreceived probation under pre-guidelines practice, a guideline may include one or more specific offense\r\ncharacteristics in an effort to distinguish those types of defendants who received probation from those\r\nwho received more severe sentences. In some instances, short sentences of incarceration for all\r\noffenders in a category have been substituted for a pre-guidelines sentencing practice of very wide\r\nvariability in which some defendants received probation while others received several years in prison\r\nfor the same offense. Moreover, inasmuch as those who pleaded guilty under pre-guidelines practice\r\noften received lesser sentences, the guidelines permit the court to impose lesser sentences on those\r\ndefendants who accept responsibility for their misconduct. For defendants who provide substantial\r\nassistance to the government in the investigation or prosecution of others, a downward departure may\r\nbe warranted.\r\nThe Commission has also examined its sentencing ranges in light of their likely impact upon\r\nprison population. Specific legislation, such as the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986 and the career\r\noffender provisions of the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 (28 U.S.C. § 994(h)), required the\r\nCommission to promulgate guidelines that will lead to substantial prison population increases. These\r\nincreases will occur irrespective of the guidelines. The guidelines themselves, insofar as they reflect\r\npolicy decisions made by the Commission (rather than legislated mandatory minimum or career offender\r\nsentences), are projected to lead to an increase in prison population that computer models, produced by\r\nthe Commission and the Bureau of Prisons in 1987, estimated at approximately 10 percent over a period\r\nof ten years.\r\n(h) The Sentencing Table.\r\nThe Commission has established a sentencing table that for technical and practical reasons\r\ncontains 43 levels. Each level in the table prescribes ranges that overlap with the ranges in the preceding\r\nand succeeding levels. By overlapping the ranges, the table should discourage unnecessary litigation.\r\nBoth prosecution and defense will realize that the difference between one level and another will not\r\nnecessarily make a difference in the sentence that the court imposes. Thus, little purpose will be served\r\nin protracted litigation trying to determine, for example, whether $10,000 or $11,000 was obtained as\r\na result of a fraud. At the same time, the levels work to increase a sentence proportionately. A change\r\nof six levels roughly doubles the sentence irrespective of the level at which one starts. The guidelines,\r\nin keeping with the statutory requirement that the maximum of any range cannot exceed the minimum\r\nby more than the greater of 25 percent or six months (28 U.S.C. § 994(b)(2)), permit courts to exercise\r\nthe greatest permissible range of sentencing discretion. The table overlaps offense levels meaningfully,\r\nworks proportionately, and at the same time preserves the maximum degree of allowable discretion for\r\nthe court within each level.\r\nSimilarly, many of the individual guidelines refer to tables that correlate amounts of money\r\nwith offense levels. These tables often have many rather than a few levels. Again, the reason is to\r\nminimize the likelihood of unnecessary litigation. If a money table were to make only a few distinctions,\r\neach distinction would become more important and litigation over which category an offender fell within\r\nwould become more likely. Where a table has many small monetary distinctions, it minimizes the\r\nlikelihood of litigation because the precise amount of money involved is of considerably less importance.\r\n5. A Concluding Note\r\nThe Commission emphasizes that it drafted the initial guidelines with considerable caution.\r\n\r\nIt examined the many hundreds of criminal statutes in the United States Code. It began with those that\r\nwere the basis for a significant number of prosecutions and sought to place them in a rational order. It\r\ndeveloped additional distinctions relevant to the application of these provisions and it applied sentencing\r\nranges to each resulting category. In doing so, it relied upon pre-guidelines sentencing practice as\r\nrevealed by its own statistical analyses based on summary reports of some 40,000 convictions, a sample\r\nof 10,000 augmented presentence reports, the parole guidelines, and policy judgments.\r\nThe Commission recognizes that some will criticize this approach as overly cautious, as\r\nrepresenting too little a departure from pre-guidelines sentencing practice. Yet, it will cure wide\r\ndisparity. The Commission is a permanent body that can amend the guidelines each year. Although the\r\ndata available to it, like all data, are imperfect, experience with the guidelines will lead to additional\r\ninformation and provide a firm empirical basis for consideration of revisions.\r\nFinally, the guidelines will apply to more than 90 percent of all felony and Class A\r\nmisdemeanor cases in the federal courts. Because of time constraints and the nonexistence of statistical\r\ninformation, some offenses that occur infrequently are not considered in the guidelines. Their exclusion\r\ndoes not reflect any judgment regarding their seriousness and they will be addressed as the Commission\r\nrefines the guidelines over time.\".\r\n1992 Amendment\r\nAmendment 466 amended Subpart 4(b) in the first paragraph by inserting \"§5H1.12 (Lack of Guidance as a Youth\r\nand Similar Circumstances)\" after \"§5H1.10 (Race, Sex, National Origin, Creed, Religion, and Socio-Economic\r\nStatus)\".\r\n1995 Amendment\r\nAmendment 534 amended Subpart 4(d) in the second sentence of the third paragraph by striking \"six\" and inserting\r\n\"eight\"; and in the third sentence of the third paragraph by striking \"seven through\" and inserting \"nine and\".\r\n1996 Amendment\r\nAmendment 538 amended Subpart 4(b) in the fourth paragraph by striking the third sentence as follows:\r\n\"For example, the Commentary to §2G1.1 (Transportation for the Purpose of Prostitution or Prohibited\r\nSexual Conduct) recommends a downward departure of eight levels where a commercial purpose was\r\nnot involved.\".\r\n2000 Amendments\r\nAmendment 602 amended Subpart 4(b) in the fifth sentence of the first paragraph by striking \"and\" before \"the last\";\r\nand by inserting \", and §5K2.19 (Post-Sentencing Rehabilitative Efforts)\" after \"(Coercion and Duress)\".\r\nAmendment 603 amended Subpart 4(d) by adding an asterisk at the end of the last paragraph after the period; and\r\nby adding at the end the following footnote:\r\n\"*Note: Although the Commission had not addressed ‘single acts of aberrant behavior’ at the time the\r\nIntroduction to the Guidelines Manual originally was written, it subsequently addressed the issue in\r\nAmendment 603, effective November 1, 2000.

Subpart 1 sets forth the original introduction to the\r\nGuidelines Manual as it first appeared in 1987, with the inclusion of amendments\r\nmade occasionally thereto between 1987 and 2000. The original introduction, as so\r\namended, explained a number of policy decisions made by the United States\r\n\r\nSentencing Commission (‘Commission’) when it promulgated the initial set of\r\nguidelines and therefore provides a useful reference for contextual and historical\r\npurposes. Subpart 2 further describes the evolution of the federal sentencing\r\nguidelines after the initial guidelines were promulgated.\r\nSubpart 3 of this Part states the authority of the Commission to promulgate\r\nfederal sentencing guidelines, policy statements, and commentary.\r\n1. ORIGINAL INTRODUCTION TO THE GUIDELINES MANUAL\r\nThe following provisions of this Subpart set forth the original introduction\r\nto this manual, effective November 1, 1987, and as amended through November 1,\r\n2000:\r\n1. Authority\r\nThe United States Sentencing Commission (‘Commission’) is an\r\nindependent agency in the judicial branch composed of seven voting and\r\ntwo non-voting, ex officio members. Its principal purpose is to establish\r\nsentencing policies and practices for the federal criminal justice system that\r\nwill assure the ends of justice by promulgating detailed guidelines\r\nprescribing the appropriate sentences for offenders convicted of federal\r\ncrimes.\r\nThe guidelines and policy statements promulgated by the\r\nCommission are issued pursuant to Section 994(a) of Title 28, United States\r\nCode.\r\n2. The Statutory Mission\r\nThe Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 (Title II of the Comprehensive\r\nCrime Control Act of 1984) provides for the development of guidelines\r\nthat will further the basic purposes of criminal punishment: deterrence,\r\nincapacitation, just punishment, and rehabilitation. The Act delegates\r\nbroad authority to the Commission to review and rationalize the federal\r\nsentencing process.\r\nThe Act contains detailed instructions as to how this determination\r\nshould be made, the most important of which directs the Commission to\r\ncreate categories of offense behavior and offender characteristics. An\r\noffense behavior category might consist, for example, of ‘bank\r\nrobbery/committed with a gun/$2500 taken.’ An offender characteristic\r\ncategory might be ‘offender with one prior conviction not resulting in\r\nimprisonment.’ The Commission is required to prescribe guideline ranges\r\nthat specify an appropriate sentence for each class of convicted persons\r\ndetermined by coordinating the offense behavior categories with the\r\noffender characteristic categories. Where the guidelines call for\r\nimprisonment, the range must be narrow: the maximum of the range cannot\r\nexceed the minimum by more than the greater of 25 percent or six months.\r\n\r\n28 U.S.C. § 994(b)(2).\r\nPursuant to the Act, the sentencing court must select a sentence\r\nfrom within the guideline range. If, however, a particular case presents\r\natypical features, the Act allows the court to depart from the guidelines and\r\nsentence outside the prescribed range. In that case, the court must specify\r\nreasons for departure. 18 U.S.C. § 3553(b). If the court sentences within\r\nthe guideline range, an appellate court may review the sentence to\r\ndetermine whether the guidelines were correctly applied. If the court\r\ndeparts from the guideline range, an appellate court may review the\r\nreasonableness of the departure. 18 U.S.C. § 3742. The Act also abolishes\r\nparole, and substantially reduces and restructures good behavior\r\nadjustments.\r\nThe Commission’s initial guidelines were submitted to Congress on\r\nApril 13, 1987. After the prescribed period of Congressional review, the\r\nguidelines took effect on November 1, 1987, and apply to all offenses\r\ncommitted on or after that date. The Commission has the authority to\r\nsubmit guideline amendments each year to Congress between the beginning\r\nof a regular Congressional session and May 1. Such amendments\r\nautomatically take effect 180 days after submission unless a law is enacted\r\nto the contrary. 28 U.S.C. § 994(p).\r\nThe initial sentencing guidelines and policy statements were\r\ndeveloped after extensive hearings, deliberation, and consideration of\r\nsubstantial public comment. The Commission emphasizes, however, that\r\nit views the guideline-writing process as evolutionary. It expects, and the\r\ngoverning statute anticipates, that continuing research, experience, and\r\nanalysis will result in modifications and revisions to the guidelines through\r\nsubmission of amendments to Congress. To this end, the Commission is\r\nestablished as a permanent agency to monitor sentencing practices in the\r\nfederal courts.\r\n3. The Basic Approach (Policy Statement)\r\nTo understand the guidelines and their underlying rationale, it is\r\nimportant to focus on the three objectives that Congress sought to achieve\r\nin enacting the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984. The Act’s basic objective\r\nwas to enhance the ability of the criminal justice system to combat crime\r\nthrough an effective, fair sentencing system. To achieve this end, Congress\r\nfirst sought honesty in sentencing. It sought to avoid the confusion and\r\nimplicit deception that arose out of the pre-guidelines sentencing system\r\nwhich required the court to impose an indeterminate sentence of\r\nimprisonment and empowered the parole commission to determine how\r\nmuch of the sentence an offender actually would serve in prison. This\r\npractice usually resulted in a substantial reduction in the effective length of\r\nthe sentence imposed, with defendants often serving only about one-third\r\nof the sentence imposed by the court.\r\n\r\nSecond, Congress sought reasonable uniformity in sentencing by\r\nnarrowing the wide disparity in sentences imposed for similar criminal\r\noffenses committed by similar offenders. Third, Congress sought\r\nproportionality in sentencing through a system that imposes appropriately\r\ndifferent sentences for criminal conduct of differing severity.\r\nHonesty is easy to achieve: the abolition of parole makes the\r\nsentence imposed by the court the sentence the offender will serve, less\r\napproximately fifteen percent for good behavior. There is a tension,\r\nhowever, between the mandate of uniformity and the mandate of\r\nproportionality. Simple uniformity -- sentencing every offender to five\r\nyears -- destroys proportionality. Having only a few simple categories of\r\ncrimes would make the guidelines uniform and easy to administer, but\r\nmight lump together offenses that are different in important respects. For\r\nexample, a single category for robbery that included armed and unarmed\r\nrobberies, robberies with and without injuries, robberies of a few dollars\r\nand robberies of millions, would be far too broad.\r\nA sentencing system tailored to fit every conceivable wrinkle of\r\neach case would quickly become unworkable and seriously compromise the\r\ncertainty of punishment and its deterrent effect. For example: a bank\r\nrobber with (or without) a gun, which the robber kept hidden (or\r\nbrandished), might have frightened (or merely warned), injured seriously\r\n(or less seriously), tied up (or simply pushed) a guard, teller, or customer,\r\nat night (or at noon), in an effort to obtain money for other crimes (or for\r\nother purposes), in the company of a few (or many) other robbers, for the\r\nfirst (or fourth) time.\r\nThe list of potentially relevant features of criminal behavior is long;\r\nthe fact that they can occur in multiple combinations means that the list of\r\npossible permutations of factors is virtually endless. The appropriate\r\nrelationships among these different factors are exceedingly difficult to\r\nestablish, for they are often context specific. Sentencing courts do not treat\r\nthe occurrence of a simple bruise identically in all cases, irrespective of\r\nwhether that bruise occurred in the context of a bank robbery or in the\r\ncontext of a breach of peace. This is so, in part, because the risk that such\r\na harm will occur differs depending on the underlying offense with which\r\nit is connected; and also because, in part, the relationship between\r\npunishment and multiple harms is not simply additive. The relation varies\r\ndepending on how much other harm has occurred. Thus, it would not be\r\nproper to assign points for each kind of harm and simply add them up,\r\nirrespective of context and total amounts.\r\nThe larger the number of subcategories of offense and offender\r\ncharacteristics included in the guidelines, the greater the complexity and the\r\nless workable the system. Moreover, complex combinations of offense and\r\noffender characteristics would apply and interact in unforeseen ways to\r\nunforeseen situations, thus failing to cure the unfairness of a simple, broad\r\ncategory system. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, probation\r\n\r\nofficers and courts, in applying a complex system having numerous\r\nsubcategories, would be required to make a host of decisions regarding\r\nwhether the underlying facts were sufficient to bring the case within a\r\nparticular subcategory. The greater the number of decisions required and\r\nthe greater their complexity, the greater the risk that different courts would\r\napply the guidelines differently to situations that, in fact, are similar,\r\nthereby reintroducing the very disparity that the guidelines were designed\r\nto reduce.\r\nIn view of the arguments, it would have been tempting to retreat to\r\nthe simple, broad category approach and to grant courts the discretion to\r\nselect the proper point along a broad sentencing range. Granting such broad\r\ndiscretion, however, would have risked correspondingly broad disparity in\r\nsentencing, for different courts may exercise their discretionary powers in\r\ndifferent ways. Such an approach would have risked a return to the wide\r\ndisparity that Congress established the Commission to reduce and would\r\nhave been contrary to the Commission’s mandate set forth in the Sentencing\r\nReform Act of 1984.\r\nIn the end, there was no completely satisfying solution to this\r\nproblem. The Commission had to balance the comparative virtues and vices\r\nof broad, simple categorization and detailed, complex subcategorization,\r\nand within the constraints established by that balance, minimize the\r\ndiscretionary powers of the sentencing court. Any system will, to a degree,\r\nenjoy the benefits and suffer from the drawbacks of each approach.\r\nA philosophical problem arose when the Commission attempted to\r\nreconcile the differing perceptions of the purposes of criminal punishment.\r\nMost observers of the criminal law agree that the ultimate aim of the law\r\nitself, and of punishment in particular, is the control of crime. Beyond this\r\npoint, however, the consensus seems to break down. Some argue that\r\nappropriate punishment should be defined primarily on the basis of the\r\nprinciple of ‘just deserts.’ Under this principle, punishment should be\r\nscaled to the offender’s culpability and the resulting harms. Others argue\r\nthat punishment should be imposed primarily on the basis of practical\r\n‘crime control’ considerations. This theory calls for sentences that most\r\neffectively lessen the likelihood of future crime, either by deterring others\r\nor incapacitating the defendant.\r\nAdherents of each of these points of view urged the Commission to\r\nchoose between them and accord one primacy over the other. As a practical\r\nmatter, however, this choice was unnecessary because in most sentencing\r\ndecisions the application of either philosophy will produce the same or\r\nsimilar results.\r\nIn its initial set of guidelines, the Commission sought to solve both\r\nthe practical and philosophical problems of developing a coherent\r\nsentencing system by taking an empirical approach that used as a starting\r\n\r\npoint data estimating pre-guidelines sentencing practice. It analyzed data\r\ndrawn from 10,000 presentence investigations, the differing elements of\r\nvarious crimes as distinguished in substantive criminal statutes, the United\r\nStates Parole Commission’s guidelines and statistics, and data from other\r\nrelevant sources in order to determine which distinctions were important in\r\npre-guidelines practice. After consideration, the Commission accepted,\r\nmodified, or rationalized these distinctions.\r\nThis empirical approach helped the Commission resolve its\r\npractical problem by defining a list of relevant distinctions that, although\r\nof considerable length, was short enough to create a manageable set of\r\nguidelines. Existing categories are relatively broad and omit distinctions\r\nthat some may believe important, yet they include most of the major\r\ndistinctions that statutes and data suggest made a significant difference in\r\nsentencing decisions. Relevant distinctions not reflected in the guidelines\r\nprobably will occur rarely and sentencing courts may take such unusual\r\ncases into account by departing from the guidelines.\r\nThe Commission’s empirical approach also helped resolve its\r\nphilosophical dilemma. Those who adhere to a just deserts philosophy may\r\nconcede that the lack of consensus might make it difficult to say exactly\r\nwhat punishment is deserved for a particular crime. Likewise, those who\r\nsubscribe to a philosophy of crime control may acknowledge that the lack\r\nof sufficient data might make it difficult to determine exactly the\r\npunishment that will best prevent that crime. Both groups might therefore\r\nrecognize the wisdom of looking to those distinctions that judges and\r\nlegislators have, in fact, made over the course of time. These established\r\ndistinctions are ones that the community believes, or has found over time,\r\nto be important from either a just deserts or crime control perspective.\r\nThe Commission did not simply copy estimates of pre-guidelines\r\npractice as revealed by the data, even though establishing offense values on\r\nthis basis would help eliminate disparity because the data represent\r\naverages. Rather, it departed from the data at different points for various\r\nimportant reasons. Congressional statutes, for example, suggested or\r\nrequired departure, as in the case of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986 that\r\nimposed increased and mandatory minimum sentences. In addition, the data\r\nrevealed inconsistencies in treatment, such as punishing economic crime\r\nless severely than other apparently equivalent behavior.\r\nDespite these policy-oriented departures from pre-guidelines\r\npractice, the guidelines represent an approach that begins with, and builds\r\nupon, empirical data. The guidelines will not please those who wish the\r\nCommission to adopt a single philosophical theory and then work\r\ndeductively to establish a simple and perfect set of categorizations and\r\ndistinctions. The guidelines may prove acceptable, however, to those who\r\nseek more modest, incremental improvements in the status quo, who believe\r\nthe best is often the enemy of the good, and who recognize that these\r\nguidelines are, as the Act contemplates, but the first step in an\r\n\r\nevolutionary process. After spending considerable time and resources\r\nexploring alternative approaches, the Commission developed these\r\nguidelines as a practical effort toward the achievement of a more honest,\r\nuniform, equitable, proportional, and therefore effective sentencing system.\r\n4. The Guidelines’ Resolution of Major Issues (Policy Statement)\r\nThe guideline-drafting process required the Commission to resolve\r\na host of important policy questions typically involving rather evenly\r\nbalanced sets of competing considerations. As an aid to understanding the\r\nguidelines, this introduction briefly discusses several of those issues;\r\ncommentary in the guidelines explains others.\r\n(a) Real Offense vs. Charge Offense Sentencing.\r\nOne of the most important questions for the Commission to decide\r\nwas whether to base sentences upon the actual conduct in which the\r\ndefendant engaged regardless of the charges for which he was indicted or\r\nconvicted (‘real offense’ sentencing), or upon the conduct that constitutes\r\nthe elements of the offense for which the defendant was charged and of\r\nwhich he was convicted (‘charge offense’ sentencing). A bank robber, for\r\nexample, might have used a gun, frightened bystanders, taken $50,000,\r\ninjured a teller, refused to stop when ordered, and raced away damaging\r\nproperty during his escape. A pure real offense system would sentence on\r\nthe basis of all identifiable conduct. A pure charge offense system would\r\noverlook some of the harms that did not constitute statutory elements of the\r\noffenses of which the defendant was convicted.\r\nThe Commission initially sought to develop a pure real offense\r\nsystem. After all, the pre-guidelines sentencing system was, in a sense, this\r\ntype of system. The sentencing court and the parole commission took\r\naccount of the conduct in which the defendant actually engaged, as\r\ndetermined in a presentence report, at the sentencing hearing, or before a\r\nparole commission hearing officer. The Commission’s initial efforts in this\r\ndirection, carried out in the spring and early summer of 1986, proved\r\nunproductive, mostly for practical reasons. To make such a system work,\r\neven to formalize and rationalize the status quo, would have required the\r\nCommission to decide precisely which harms to take into account, how to\r\nadd them up, and what kinds of procedures the courts should use to\r\ndetermine the presence or absence of disputed factual elements. The\r\nCommission found no practical way to combine and account for the large\r\nnumber of diverse harms arising in different circumstances; nor did it find\r\na practical way to reconcile the need for a fair adjudicatory procedure with\r\nthe need for a speedy sentencing process given the potential existence of\r\nhosts of adjudicated ‘real harm’ facts in many typical cases. The effort\r\nproposed as a solution to these problems required the use of, for example,\r\nquadratic roots and other mathematical operations that the Commission\r\nconsidered too complex to be workable. In the Commission’s view, such\r\na system risked return to wide disparity in sentencing practice.\r\n\r\nIn its initial set of guidelines submitted to Congress in April 1987,\r\nthe Commission moved closer to a charge offense system. This system,\r\nhowever, does contain a significant number of real offense elements. For\r\none thing, the hundreds of overlapping and duplicative statutory provisions\r\nthat make up the federal criminal law forced the Commission to write\r\nguidelines that are descriptive of generic conduct rather than guidelines that\r\ntrack purely statutory language. For another, the guidelines take account of\r\na number of important, commonly occurring real offense elements such as\r\nrole in the offense, the presence of a gun, or the amount of money actually\r\ntaken, through alternative base offense levels, specific offense\r\ncharacteristics, cross references, and adjustments.\r\nThe Commission recognized that a charge offense system has\r\ndrawbacks of its own. One of the most important is the potential it affords\r\nprosecutors to influence sentences by increasing or decreasing the number\r\nof counts in an indictment. Of course, the defendant’s actual conduct (that\r\nwhich the prosecutor can prove in court) imposes a natural limit upon the\r\nprosecutor’s ability to increase a defendant’s sentence. Moreover, the\r\nCommission has written its rules for the treatment of multicount convictions\r\nwith an eye toward eliminating unfair treatment that might flow from count\r\nmanipulation. For example, the guidelines treat a three-count indictment,\r\neach count of which charges sale of 100 grams of heroin or theft of\r\n$10,000, the same as a single-count indictment charging sale of 300 grams\r\nof heroin or theft of $30,000. Furthermore, a sentencing court may control\r\nany inappropriate manipulation of the indictment through use of its\r\ndeparture power. Finally, the Commission will closely monitor charging\r\nand plea agreement practices and will make appropriate adjustments should\r\nthey become necessary.\r\n(b) Departures.\r\nThe sentencing statute permits a court to depart from a guideline-\r\nspecified sentence only when it finds ‘an aggravating or mitigating\r\ncircumstance of a kind, or to a degree, not adequately taken into\r\nconsideration by the Sentencing Commission in formulating the guidelines\r\nthat should result in a sentence different from that described.’ 18 U.S.C. §\r\n3553(b). The Commission intends the sentencing courts to treat each\r\nguideline as carving out a ‘heartland,’ a set of typical cases embodying the\r\nconduct that each guideline describes. When a court finds an atypical case,\r\none to which a particular guideline linguistically applies but where conduct\r\nsignificantly differs from the norm, the court may consider whether a\r\ndeparture is warranted. Section 5H1.10 (Race, Sex, National Origin, Creed,\r\nReligion, and Socio-Economic Status), §5H1.12 (Lack of Guidance as a\r\nYouth and Similar Circumstances), the third sentence of §5H1.4 (Physical\r\nCondition, Including Drug or Alcohol Dependence or Abuse), the last\r\nsentence of §5K2.12 (Coercion and Duress), and §5K2.19 (Post-Sentencing\r\nRehabilitative Efforts) list several factors that the court cannot take into\r\naccount as grounds for departure. With those specific exceptions,\r\nhowever, the Commission does not intend to limit the kinds of factors,\r\n\r\nwhether or not mentioned anywhere else in the guidelines, that could\r\nconstitute grounds for departure in an unusual case.\r\nThe Commission has adopted this departure policy for two reasons.\r\nFirst, it is difficult to prescribe a single set of guidelines that encompasses\r\nthe vast range of human conduct potentially relevant to a sentencing\r\ndecision. The Commission also recognizes that the initial set of guidelines\r\nneed not do so. The Commission is a permanent body, empowered by law\r\nto write and rewrite guidelines, with progressive changes, over many years.\r\nBy monitoring when courts depart from the guidelines and by analyzing\r\ntheir stated reasons for doing so and court decisions with references thereto,\r\nthe Commission, over time, will be able to refine the guidelines to specify\r\nmore precisely when departures should and should not be permitted.\r\nSecond, the Commission believes that despite the courts’ legal\r\nfreedom to depart from the guidelines, they will not do so very often. This\r\nis because the guidelines, offense by offense, seek to take account of those\r\nfactors that the Commission’s data indicate made a significant difference in\r\npre-guidelines sentencing practice. Thus, for example, where the presence\r\nof physical injury made an important difference in pre-guidelines\r\nsentencing practice (as in the case of robbery or assault), the guidelines\r\nspecifically include this factor to enhance the sentence. Where the\r\nguidelines do not specify an augmentation or diminution, this is generally\r\nbecause the sentencing data did not permit the Commission to conclude that\r\nthe factor was empirically important in relation to the particular offense. Of\r\ncourse, an important factor (e.g., physical injury) may infrequently occur\r\nin connection with a particular crime (e.g., fraud). Such rare occurrences\r\nare precisely the type of events that the courts’ departure powers were\r\ndesigned to cover -- unusual cases outside the range of the more typical\r\noffenses for which the guidelines were designed.\r\nIt is important to note that the guidelines refer to two different kinds\r\nof departure. The first involves instances in which the guidelines provide\r\nspecific guidance for departure by analogy or by other numerical or non-\r\nnumerical suggestions. The Commission intends such suggestions as policy\r\nguidance for the courts. The Commission expects that most departures will\r\nreflect the suggestions and that the courts of appeals may prove more likely\r\nto find departures ‘unreasonable’ where they fall outside suggested levels.\r\nA second type of departure will remain unguided. It may rest upon\r\ngrounds referred to in Chapter Five, Part K (Departures) or on grounds not\r\nmentioned in the guidelines. While Chapter Five, Part K lists factors that\r\nthe Commission believes may constitute grounds for departure, the list is\r\nnot exhaustive. The Commission recognizes that there may be other\r\ngrounds for departure that are not mentioned; it also believes there may be\r\ncases in which a departure outside suggested levels is warranted. In its\r\nview, however, such cases will be highly infrequent.\r\n\r\n(c) Plea Agreements.\r\nNearly ninety percent of all federal criminal cases involve guilty\r\npleas and many of these cases involve some form of plea agreement. Some\r\ncommentators on early Commission guideline drafts urged the Commission\r\nnot to attempt any major reforms of the plea agreement process on the\r\ngrounds that any set of guidelines that threatened to change pre-guidelines\r\npractice radically also threatened to make the federal system unmanageable.\r\nOthers argued that guidelines that failed to control and limit plea\r\nagreements would leave untouched a ‘loophole’ large enough to undo the\r\ngood that sentencing guidelines would bring.\r\nThe Commission decided not to make major changes in plea\r\nagreement practices in the initial guidelines, but rather to provide guidance\r\nby issuing general policy statements concerning the acceptance of plea\r\nagreements in Chapter Six, Part B (Plea Agreements). The rules set forth\r\nin Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(e) govern the acceptance or rejection of such\r\nagreements. The Commission will collect data on the courts’ plea practices\r\nand will analyze this information to determine when and why the courts\r\naccept or reject plea agreements and whether plea agreement practices are\r\nundermining the intent of the Sentencing Reform Act. In light of this\r\ninformation and analysis, the Commission will seek to further regulate the\r\nplea agreement process as appropriate. Importantly, if the policy statements\r\nrelating to plea agreements are followed, circumvention of the Sentencing\r\nReform Act and the guidelines should not occur.\r\nThe Commission expects the guidelines to have a positive,\r\nrationalizing impact upon plea agreements for two reasons. First, the\r\nguidelines create a clear, definite expectation in respect to the sentence that\r\na court will impose if a trial takes place. In the event a prosecutor and\r\ndefense attorney explore the possibility of a negotiated plea, they will no\r\nlonger work in the dark. This fact alone should help to reduce irrationality\r\nin respect to actual sentencing outcomes. Second, the guidelines create a\r\nnorm to which courts will likely refer when they decide whether, under\r\nRule 11(e), to accept or to reject a plea agreement or recommendation.\r\n(d) Probation and Split Sentences.\r\nThe statute provides that the guidelines are to ‘reflect the general\r\nappropriateness of imposing a sentence other than imprisonment in cases in\r\nwhich the defendant is a first offender who has not been convicted of a\r\ncrime of violence or an otherwise serious offense . . . .’ 28 U.S.C. § 994(j).\r\nUnder pre-guidelines sentencing practice, courts sentenced to probation an\r\ninappropriately high percentage of offenders guilty of certain economic\r\ncrimes, such as theft, tax evasion, antitrust offenses, insider trading, fraud,\r\nand embezzlement, that in the Commission’s view are ‘serious.’\r\nThe Commission’s solution to this problem has been to write\r\nguidelines that classify as serious many offenses for which probation\r\n\r\npreviously was frequently given and provide for at least a short period of\r\nimprisonment in such cases. The Commission concluded that the definite\r\nprospect of prison, even though the term may be short, will serve as a\r\nsignificant deterrent, particularly when compared with pre-guidelines\r\npractice where probation, not prison, was the norm.\r\nMore specifically, the guidelines work as follows in respect to a\r\nfirst offender. For offense levels one through eight, the sentencing court\r\nmay elect to sentence the offender to probation (with or without\r\nconfinement conditions) or to a prison term. For offense levels nine and\r\nten, the court may substitute probation for a prison term, but the probation\r\nmust include confinement conditions (community confinement, intermittent\r\nconfinement, or home detention). For offense levels eleven and twelve, the\r\ncourt must impose at least one-half the minimum confinement sentence in\r\nthe form of prison confinement, the remainder to be served on supervised\r\nrelease with a condition of community confinement or home detention. The\r\nCommission, of course, has not dealt with the single acts of aberrant\r\nbehavior that still may justify probation at higher offense levels through\r\ndepartures.*\r\n*Note: Although the Commission had not addressed ‘single acts of aberrant behavior’ at the time the\r\nIntroduction to the Guidelines Manual originally was written, it subsequently addressed the issue in\r\nAmendment 603, effective November 1, 2000. (See Supplement to Appendix C, amendment 603.)\r\n(e) Multi-Count Convictions.\r\nThe Commission, like several state sentencing commissions, has\r\nfound it particularly difficult to develop guidelines for sentencing\r\ndefendants convicted of multiple violations of law, each of which makes up\r\na separate count in an indictment. The difficulty is that when a defendant\r\nengages in conduct that causes several harms, each additional harm, even\r\nif it increases the extent to which punishment is warranted, does not\r\nnecessarily warrant a proportionate increase in punishment. A defendant\r\nwho assaults others during a fight, for example, may warrant more\r\npunishment if he injures ten people than if he injures one, but his conduct\r\ndoes not necessarily warrant ten times the punishment. If it did, many of\r\nthe simplest offenses, for reasons that are often fortuitous, would lead to\r\nsentences of life imprisonment -- sentences that neither just deserts nor\r\ncrime control theories of punishment would justify.\r\nSeveral individual guidelines provide special instructions for\r\nincreasing punishment when the conduct that is the subject of that count\r\ninvolves multiple occurrences or has caused several harms. The guidelines\r\nalso provide general rules for aggravating punishment in light of multiple\r\nharms charged separately in separate counts. These rules may produce\r\noccasional anomalies, but normally they will permit an appropriate degree\r\nof aggravation of punishment for multiple offenses that are the subjects of\r\nseparate counts.\r\nThese rules are set out in Chapter Three, Part D (Multiple Counts).\r\n\r\nThey essentially provide: (1) when the conduct involves fungible items\r\n(e.g., separate drug transactions or thefts of money), the amounts are added\r\nand the guidelines apply to the total amount; (2) when nonfungible harms\r\nare involved, the offense level for the most serious count is increased\r\n(according to a diminishing scale) to reflect the existence of other counts of\r\nconviction. The guidelines have been written in order to minimize the\r\npossibility that an arbitrary casting of a single transaction into several\r\ncounts will produce a longer sentence. In addition, the sentencing court will\r\nhave adequate power to prevent such a result through departures.\r\n(f) Regulatory Offenses.\r\nRegulatory statutes, though primarily civil in nature, sometimes\r\ncontain criminal provisions in respect to particularly harmful activity. Such\r\ncriminal provisions often describe not only substantive offenses, but also\r\nmore technical, administratively-related offenses such as failure to keep\r\naccurate records or to provide requested information. These statutes pose\r\ntwo problems: first, which criminal regulatory provisions should the\r\nCommission initially consider, and second, how should it treat technical or\r\nadministratively-related criminal violations?\r\nIn respect to the first problem, the Commission found that it could\r\nnot comprehensively treat all regulatory violations in the initial set of\r\nguidelines. There are hundreds of such provisions scattered throughout the\r\nUnited States Code. To find all potential violations would involve\r\nexamination of each individual federal regulation. Because of this practical\r\ndifficulty, the Commission sought to determine, with the assistance of the\r\nDepartment of Justice and several regulatory agencies, which criminal\r\nregulatory offenses were particularly important in light of the need for\r\nenforcement of the general regulatory scheme. The Commission addressed\r\nthese offenses in the initial guidelines.\r\nIn respect to the second problem, the Commission has developed\r\na system for treating technical recordkeeping and reporting offenses that\r\ndivides them into four categories. First, in the simplest of cases, the\r\noffender may have failed to fill out a form intentionally, but without\r\nknowledge or intent that substantive harm would likely follow. He might\r\nfail, for example, to keep an accurate record of toxic substance transport,\r\nbut that failure may not lead, nor be likely to lead, to the release or improper\r\nhandling of any toxic substance. Second, the same failure may be\r\naccompanied by a significant likelihood that substantive harm will occur;\r\nit may make a release of a toxic substance more likely. Third, the same\r\nfailure may have led to substantive harm. Fourth, the failure may represent\r\nan effort to conceal a substantive harm that has occurred.\r\nThe structure of a typical guideline for a regulatory offense\r\nprovides a low base offense level (e.g., 6) aimed at the first type of\r\nrecordkeeping or reporting offense. Specific offense characteristics\r\ndesigned to reflect substantive harms that do occur in respect to some\r\n\r\nregulatory offenses, or that are likely to occur, increase the offense level.\r\nA specific offense characteristic also provides that a recordkeeping or\r\nreporting offense that conceals a substantive offense will have the same\r\noffense level as the substantive offense.\r\n(g) Sentencing Ranges.\r\nIn determining the appropriate sentencing ranges for each offense,\r\nthe Commission estimated the average sentences served within each\r\ncategory under the pre-guidelines sentencing system. It also examined the\r\nsentences specified in federal statutes, in the parole guidelines, and in other\r\nrelevant, analogous sources. The Commission’s Supplementary Report on\r\nthe Initial Sentencing Guidelines (1987) contains a comparison between\r\nestimates of pre-guidelines sentencing practice and sentences under the\r\nguidelines.\r\nWhile the Commission has not considered itself bound by pre-\r\nguidelines sentencing practice, it has not attempted to develop an entirely\r\nnew system of sentencing on the basis of theory alone. Guideline\r\nsentences, in many instances, will approximate average pre-guidelines\r\npractice and adherence to the guidelines will help to eliminate wide\r\ndisparity. For example, where a high percentage of persons received\r\nprobation under pre-guidelines practice, a guideline may include one or\r\nmore specific offense characteristics in an effort to distinguish those types\r\nof defendants who received probation from those who received more severe\r\nsentences. In some instances, short sentences of incarceration for all\r\noffenders in a category have been substituted for a pre-guidelines\r\nsentencing practice of very wide variability in which some defendants\r\nreceived probation while others received several years in prison for the\r\nsame offense. Moreover, inasmuch as those who pleaded guilty under pre-\r\nguidelines practice often received lesser sentences, the guidelines permit the\r\ncourt to impose lesser sentences on those defendants who accept\r\nresponsibility for their misconduct. For defendants who provide substantial\r\nassistance to the government in the investigation or prosecution of others,\r\na downward departure may be warranted.\r\nThe Commission has also examined its sentencing ranges in light\r\nof their likely impact upon prison population. Specific legislation, such as\r\nthe Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986 and the career offender provisions of the\r\nSentencing Reform Act of 1984 (28 U.S.C. § 994(h)), required the\r\nCommission to promulgate guidelines that will lead to substantial prison\r\npopulation increases. These increases will occur irrespective of the\r\nguidelines. The guidelines themselves, insofar as they reflect policy\r\ndecisions made by the Commission (rather than legislated mandatory\r\nminimum or career offender sentences), are projected to lead to an increase\r\nin prison population that computer models, produced by the Commission\r\nand the Bureau of Prisons in 1987, estimated at approximately 10 percent\r\nover a period of ten years.\r\n\r\n(h) The Sentencing Table.\r\nThe Commission has established a sentencing table that for\r\ntechnical and practical reasons contains 43 levels. Each level in the table\r\nprescribes ranges that overlap with the ranges in the preceding and\r\nsucceeding levels. By overlapping the ranges, the table should discourage\r\nunnecessary litigation. Both prosecution and defense will realize that the\r\ndifference between one level and another will not necessarily make a\r\ndifference in the sentence that the court imposes. Thus, little purpose will\r\nbe served in protracted litigation trying to determine, for example, whether\r\n$10,000 or $11,000 was obtained as a result of a fraud. At the same time,\r\nthe levels work to increase a sentence proportionately. A change of six\r\nlevels roughly doubles the sentence irrespective of the level at which one\r\nstarts. The guidelines, in keeping with the statutory requirement that the\r\nmaximum of any range cannot exceed the minimum by more than the\r\ngreater of 25 percent or six months (28 U.S.C. § 994(b)(2)), permit courts\r\nto exercise the greatest permissible range of sentencing discretion. The\r\ntable overlaps offense levels meaningfully, works proportionately, and at\r\nthe same time preserves the maximum degree of allowable discretion for the\r\ncourt within each level.\r\nSimilarly, many of the individual guidelines refer to tables that\r\ncorrelate amounts of money with offense levels. These tables often have\r\nmany rather than a few levels. Again, the reason is to minimize the\r\nlikelihood of unnecessary litigation. If a money table were to make only a\r\nfew distinctions, each distinction would become more important and\r\nlitigation over which category an offender fell within would become more\r\nlikely. Where a table has many small monetary distinctions, it minimizes\r\nthe likelihood of litigation because the precise amount of money involved\r\nis of considerably less importance.\r\n5. A Concluding Note\r\nThe Commission emphasizes that it drafted the initial guidelines\r\nwith considerable caution. It examined the many hundreds of criminal\r\nstatutes in the United States Code. It began with those that were the basis\r\nfor a significant number of prosecutions and sought to place them in a\r\nrational order. It developed additional distinctions relevant to the\r\napplication of these provisions and it applied sentencing ranges to each\r\nresulting category. In doing so, it relied upon pre-guidelines sentencing\r\npractice as revealed by its own statistical analyses based on summary\r\nreports of some 40,000 convictions, a sample of 10,000 augmented\r\npresentence reports, the parole guidelines, and policy judgments.\r\nThe Commission recognizes that some will criticize this approach\r\nas overly cautious, as representing too little a departure from pre-guidelines\r\nsentencing practice. Yet, it will cure wide disparity. The Commission is a\r\npermanent body that can amend the guidelines each year. Although the data\r\navailable to it, like all data, are imperfect, experience with the\r\n\r\nguidelines will lead to additional information and provide a firm empirical\r\nbasis for consideration of revisions.\r\nFinally, the guidelines will apply to more than 90 percent of all\r\nfelony and Class A misdemeanor cases in the federal courts. Because of\r\ntime constraints and the nonexistence of statistical information, some\r\noffenses that occur infrequently are not considered in the guidelines. Their\r\nexclusion does not reflect any judgment regarding their seriousness and\r\nthey will be addressed as the Commission refines the guidelines over time.\r\n2. CONTINUING EVOLUTION AND ROLE OF THE GUIDELINES\r\nThe Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 changed the course of federal\r\nsentencing. Among other things, the Act created the United States Sentencing\r\nCommission as an independent agency in the Judicial Branch, and directed it to\r\ndevelop guidelines and policy statements for sentencing courts to use when\r\nsentencing offenders convicted of federal crimes. Moreover, it empowered the\r\nCommission with ongoing responsibilities to monitor the guidelines, submit to\r\nCongress appropriate modifications of the guidelines and recommended changes in\r\ncriminal statutes, and establish education and research programs. The mandate\r\nrested on congressional awareness that sentencing is a dynamic field that requires\r\ncontinuing review by an expert body to revise sentencing policies, in light of\r\napplication experience, as new criminal statutes are enacted, and as more is learned\r\nabout what motivates and controls criminal behavior.\r\nThis statement finds resonance in a line of Supreme Court cases that, taken\r\ntogether, echo two themes. The first theme is that the guidelines are the product of\r\na deliberative process that seeks to embody the purposes of sentencing set forth in\r\nthe Sentencing Reform Act, and as such they continue to play an important role in\r\nthe sentencing court’s determination of an appropriate sentence in a particular case.\r\nThe Supreme Court alluded to this in Mistretta v. United States, 488 U.S. 361\r\n(1989), which upheld the constitutionality of both the federal sentencing guidelines\r\nand the Commission against nondelegation and separation of powers challenges.\r\nTherein the Court stated:\r\nDeveloping proportionate penalties for hundreds of different crimes\r\nby a virtually limitless array of offenders is precisely the sort of\r\nintricate, labor-intensive task for which delegation to an expert\r\nbody is especially appropriate. Although Congress has delegated\r\nsignificant discretion to the Commission to draw judgments from\r\nits analysis of existing sentencing practice and alternative\r\nsentencing models, . . . [w]e have no doubt that in the hands of the\r\nCommission ‘the criteria which Congress has supplied are wholly\r\nadequate for carrying out the general policy and purpose’ of the\r\nAct.\r\nId. at 379 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).\r\nThe continuing importance of the guidelines in federal sentencing was\r\n\r\nfurther acknowledged by the Court in United States v. Booker, 543 U.S. 220 (2005),\r\neven as that case rendered the guidelines advisory in nature. In Booker, the Court\r\nheld that the imposition of an enhanced sentence under the federal sentencing\r\nguidelines based on the sentencing judge’s determination of a fact (other than a prior\r\nconviction) that was not found by the jury or admitted by the defendant violated the\r\nSixth Amendment. The Court reasoned that an advisory guideline system, while\r\nlacking the mandatory features that Congress enacted, retains other features that help\r\nto further congressional objectives, including providing certainty and fairness in\r\nmeeting the purposes of sentencing, avoiding unwarranted sentencing disparities,\r\nand maintaining sufficient flexibility to permit individualized sentences when\r\nwarranted. The Court concluded that an advisory guideline system would ‘continue\r\nto move sentencing in Congress’ preferred direction, helping to avoid excessive\r\nsentencing disparities while maintaining flexibility sufficient to individualize\r\nsentences where necessary.’ Id. at 264-65. An advisory guideline system continues\r\nto assure transparency by requiring that sentences be based on articulated reasons\r\nstated in open court that are subject to appellate review. An advisory guideline\r\nsystem also continues to promote certainty and predictability in sentencing, thereby\r\nenabling the parties to better anticipate the likely sentence based on the\r\nindividualized facts of the case.\r\nThe continuing importance of the guidelines in the sentencing determination\r\nis predicated in large part on the Sentencing Reform Act’s intent that, in\r\npromulgating guidelines, the Commission must take into account the purposes of\r\nsentencing as set forth in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a). See 28 U.S.C. §§ 994(f), 991(b)(1).\r\nThe Supreme Court reinforced this view in Rita v. United States, 127 S. Ct. 2456\r\n(2007), which held that a court of appeals may apply a presumption of\r\nreasonableness to a sentence imposed by a district court within a properly calculated\r\nguideline range without violating the Sixth Amendment. In Rita, the Court relied\r\nheavily on the complementary roles of the Commission and the sentencing court in\r\nfederal sentencing, stating:\r\n[T]he presumption reflects the nature of the Guidelines-writing task\r\nthat Congress set for the Commission and the manner in which the\r\nCommission carried out that task. In instructing both the\r\nsentencing judge and the Commission what to do, Congress\r\nreferred to the basic sentencing objectives that the statute sets forth\r\nin 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a) . . . . The provision also tells the sentencing\r\njudge to ‘impose a sentence sufficient, but not greater than\r\nnecessary, to comply with’ the basic aims of sentencing as set out\r\nabove. Congressional statutes then tell the Commission to write\r\nGuidelines that will carry out these same § 3553(a) objectives.\r\nId. at 2463 (emphasis in original). The Court concluded that ‘[t]he upshot is that the\r\nsentencing statutes envision both the sentencing judge and the Commission as\r\ncarrying out the same basic § 3553(a) objectives, the one, at retail, the other at\r\nwholesale,’ id., and that the Commission’s process for promulgating guidelines\r\nresults in ‘a set of Guidelines that seek to embody the § 3553(a) considerations, both\r\nin principle and in practice.’ Id. at 2464.\r\n\r\nConsequently, district courts are required to properly calculate and consider\r\nthe guidelines when sentencing, even in an advisory guideline system. See 18\r\nU.S.C. § 3553(a)(4), (a)(5); Booker, 543 U.S. at 264 (‘The district courts, while not\r\nbound to apply the Guidelines, must . . . take them into account when sentencing.’);\r\nRita, 127 S. Ct. at 2465 (stating that a district court should begin all sentencing\r\nproceedings by correctly calculating the applicable Guidelines range); Gall v. United\r\nStates, 128 S. Ct. 586, 596 (2007) (‘As a matter of administration and to secure\r\nnationwide consistency, the Guidelines should be the starting point and the initial\r\nbenchmark.’). The district court, in determining the appropriate sentence in a\r\nparticular case, therefore, must consider the properly calculated guideline range, the\r\ngrounds for departure provided in the policy statements, and then the factors under\r\n18 U.S.C. § 3553(a). See Rita, 127 S. Ct. at 2465. The appellate court engages in\r\na two-step process upon review. The appellate court ‘first ensure[s] that the district\r\ncourt committed no significant procedural error, such as failing to calculate (or\r\nimproperly calculating) the Guidelines range . . . [and] then consider[s] the\r\nsubstantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed under an abuse-of-discretion\r\nstandard[,] . . . tak[ing] into account the totality of the circumstances, including the\r\nextent of any variance from the Guidelines range.’ Gall, 128 S. Ct. at 597.\r\nThe second and related theme resonant in this line of Supreme Court cases\r\nis that, as contemplated by the Sentencing Reform Act, the guidelines are\r\nevolutionary in nature. They are the product of the Commission’s fulfillment of its\r\nstatutory duties to monitor federal sentencing law and practices, to seek public input\r\non the operation of the guidelines, and to revise the guidelines accordingly. As the\r\nCourt acknowledged in Rita:\r\nThe Commission’s work is ongoing. The statutes and the\r\nGuidelines themselves foresee continuous evolution helped by the\r\nsentencing courts and courts of appeals in that process. The\r\nsentencing courts, applying the Guidelines in individual cases may\r\ndepart (either pursuant to the Guidelines or, since Booker, by\r\nimposing a non-Guidelines sentence). The judges will set forth\r\ntheir reasons. The Courts of Appeals will determine the\r\nreasonableness of the resulting sentence. The Commission will\r\ncollect and examine the results. In doing so, it may obtain advice\r\nfrom prosecutors, defenders, law enforcement groups, civil liberties\r\nassociations, experts in penology, and others. And it can revise the\r\nGuidelines accordingly.\r\nId. at 2464; see also Booker, 543 U.S. at 264 (‘[T]he Sentencing Commission\r\nremains in place, writing Guidelines, collecting information about actual district\r\ncourt sentencing decisions, undertaking research, and revising the Guidelines\r\naccordingly.’); Gall, 128 S. Ct. at 594 (‘[E]ven though the Guidelines are advisory\r\nrather than mandatory, they are, as we pointed out in Rita, the product of careful\r\nstudy based on extensive empirical evidence derived from the review of thousands\r\nof individual sentencing decisions.’).\r\nProvisions of the Sentencing Reform Act promote and facilitate this\r\nevolutionary process. For example, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 994(x), the\r\n\r\nCommission publishes guideline amendment proposals in the Federal Register and\r\nconducts hearings to solicit input on those proposals from experts and other\r\nmembers of the public. Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 994(o), the Commission\r\nperiodically reviews and revises the guidelines in consideration of comments it\r\nreceives from members of the federal criminal justice system, including the courts,\r\nprobation officers, the Department of Justice, the Bureau of Prisons, defense\r\nattorneys and the federal public defenders, and in consideration of data it receives\r\nfrom sentencing courts and other sources. Statutory mechanisms such as these\r\nbolster the Commission’s ability to take into account fully the purposes of\r\nsentencing set forth in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(2) in its promulgation of the guidelines.\r\nCongress retains authority to require certain sentencing practices and may\r\nexercise its authority through specific directives to the Commission with respect to\r\nthe guidelines. As the Supreme Court noted in Kimbrough v. United States, 128 S.\r\nCt. 558 (2007), ‘Congress has shown that it knows how to direct sentencing\r\npractices in express terms. For example, Congress has specifically required the\r\nSentencing Commission to set Guideline sentences for serious recidivist offenders\r\n‘at or near’ the statutory maximum.’ Id. at 571; 28 U.S.C. § 994(h).\r\nAs envisioned by Congress, implemented by the Commission, and\r\nreaffirmed by the Supreme Court, the guidelines are the product of a deliberative\r\nand dynamic process that seeks to embody within federal sentencing policy the\r\npurposes of sentencing set forth in the Sentencing Reform Act. As such, the\r\nguidelines continue to be a key component of federal sentencing and to play an\r\nimportant role in the sentencing court’s determination of an appropriate sentence in\r\nany particular case.\r\n3.

L. 110–177.\r\nFirst, the amendment addresses section 201 of the Act, which created a new offense at 18\r\nU.S.C. § 1521 prohibiting the filing of, attempts, or conspiracies to file any false lien or\r\nencumbrance against the real or personal property of officers or employees of the United\r\nStates Government, on account of that individual's performance of official duties. The\r\noffense is punishable by a statutory maximum term of imprisonment of ten years. The\r\namendment references the new offense to §2A6.1 (Threatening or Harassing\r\n\r\nCommunications; Hoaxes), and expands the heading of §2A6.1 accordingly. The\r\nCommission determined that referencing offenses under 18 U.S.C. § 1521 to §2A6.1 is\r\nappropriate because the harassment and threatening of an official by the filing of fraudulent\r\nencumbrances is analogous to conduct covered by other statutes referenced to this guideline.\r\nThe amendment also makes a number of modifications to §2A6.1 to address specific harms\r\nassociated with violations of 18 U.S.C. § 1521. Specifically, the amendment expands the\r\nscope of the two-level enhancement at subsection (b)(2) to apply if the defendant is\r\nconvicted under 18 U.S.C. § 1521 and the offense involved more than two false liens or\r\nencumbrances, and also provides an upward departure provision that may apply if the\r\noffense involved substantially more than two false liens or encumbrances against the real or\r\npersonal property of the same victim. These modifications reflect the additional time and\r\nresources required to remove multiple false liens or encumbrances and provide\r\nproportionality between such offenses and other offenses referenced to this guideline that\r\ninvolve more than two threats.\r\nThe amendment also provides an upward departure provision that may apply if the offense\r\ninvolved substantial pecuniary harm to a victim. The upward departure provision reflects\r\nthe increased seriousness of those offenses that result in substantial costs.\r\nIn addition, the amendment adds a new application note specifying that if the defendant is\r\nconvicted under 18 U.S.C. § 1521, the adjustment under §3A1.2 (Official Victim) shall\r\napply. The addition of this note clarifies that the official status of the victim is not taken into\r\naccount in the base offense level.\r\nSecond, the amendment addresses section 202 of the Act, which created a new offense at 18\r\nU.S.C. § 119 prohibiting the public disclosure of restricted personal information about a\r\nfederal officer or employee, witness, juror, or immediate family member of such a person,\r\nwith the intent to threaten or facilitate a crime of violence against such a person. The\r\noffense is punishable by a statutory maximum term of imprisonment of five years. The\r\namendment references the new offense to §2H3.1 (Interception of Communications;\r\nEavesdropping; Disclosure of Certain Private or Protected Information). The Commission\r\ndetermined that referencing offenses under 18 U.S.C. § 119 to §2H3.1 is appropriate because\r\nthe prohibited conduct is analogous to conduct covered by other statutes referenced to this\r\nguideline.\r\nThe amendment also creates a two-pronged enhancement at subsection (b)(2), the greater of\r\nwhich applies. The first prong, at subsection (b)(2)(A), is an eight-level enhancement\r\napplicable if the defendant is convicted under 18 U.S.C. § 119. A corresponding application\r\nnote provides that §3A1.2 shall not apply in such cases. Thus, the enhancement at\r\nsubsection (b)(2)(A) accounts for the official victim adjustment under §3A1.2 that would\r\notherwise apply in many offenses under 18 U.S.C. § 119. Incorporating the official victim\r\nadjustment into subsection (b)(2)(A) was appropriate because the adjustment in §3A1.2 does\r\nnot apply to some individuals, such as witnesses and jurors, who are covered by 18 U.S.C.\r\n§ 119. The enhancement at subsection (b)(2)(A) also reflects the intent to threaten or\r\nfacilitate a crime of violence, which is an element of an offense under 18 U.S.C. § 119. The\r\ncross reference at subsection (c)(1) will apply, however, if the purpose of the offense was\r\nto facilitate another offense and the guideline applicable to an attempt to commit that other\r\noffense results in a greater offense level.\r\n\r\nThe second prong, at subsection (b)(2)(B), is a ten-level enhancement applicable if the\r\ndefendant is convicted under 18 U.S.C. § 119 and the offense involved the use of a computer\r\nor an interactive computer service to make restricted personal information about a covered\r\nperson publicly available. This greater enhancement accounts for the more substantial risk\r\nof harm posed by widely disseminating such protected information via the Internet.","EffectiveDate":"Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2008."},{"Id":719,"Title":"Amendment 719","Text":"Section 2B1.1, effective February 6, 2008 (see Amendment 714), is\r\nrepromulgated with the following changes:\r\nSection 2B1.1(b) is amended by striking subdivision (16) as follows:\r\n\"(16) If the offense involved fraud or theft involving any benefit authorized,\r\ntransported, transmitted, transferred, disbursed, or paid in connection with\r\na declaration of a major disaster or an emergency, increase by 2 levels.\";\r\nby redesignating subdivisions (11) through (15) as subdivisions (12) through (16),\r\nrespectively; by inserting after subdivision (10) the following:\r\n\"(11) If the offense involved conduct described in 18 U.S.C. § 1040, increase by\r\n2 levels.

L. 110–179 (the \"Act\"). The directive, which required the Commission to\r\npromulgate an amendment under emergency amendment authority by February 6, 2008,\r\ndirected that the Commission forthwith shall –\r\npromulgate sentencing guidelines or amend existing sentencing guidelines\r\nto provide for increased penalties for persons convicted of fraud or theft\r\noffenses in connection with a major disaster declaration under section 401\r\nof the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (42\r\nU.S.C. 5170) or an emergency declaration under section 501 of the Robert\r\nT. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5191)\r\n. . ..\r\nSection 5(b) of the Act further required the Commission to –\r\n(1) ensure that the sentencing guidelines and policy statements reflect the\r\nserious nature of the offenses described in subsection (a) and the need for\r\naggressive and appropriate law enforcement action to prevent such offenses;\r\n(2) assure reasonable consistency with other relevant directives and with\r\nother guidelines;\r\n(3) account for any aggravating or mitigating circumstances that might\r\njustify exceptions, including circumstances for which the sentencing\r\nguidelines currently provide sentencing enhancements;\r\n(4) make any necessary conforming changes to the sentencing guidelines;\r\nand\r\n(5) assure that the guidelines adequately meet the purposes of sentencing as\r\nset forth in section 3553(a)(2) of title 18, United States Code.\r\nThe emergency amendment addressed concerns that disaster fraud involves harms not\r\nadequately addressed by §2B1.1 (Larceny, Embezzlement, and Other Forms of Theft;\r\nOffenses Involving Stolen Property; Property Damage or Destruction; Fraud and Deceit;\r\nForgery; Offenses Involving Altered or Counterfeit Instruments Other than Counterfeit\r\nBearer Obligations of the United States) by (1) adding a two-level enhancement if the\r\noffense involved fraud or theft involving any benefit authorized, transported, transmitted,\r\ntransferred, disbursed, or paid in connection with a declaration of a major disaster or an\r\nemergency; (2) modifying the commentary to the guideline as it relates to the calculation of\r\nloss; and (3) providing a reference to §2B1.1 in Appendix A (Statutory Index) for the\r\n\r\noffense at 18 U.S.C. § 1040 (Fraud in connection with major disaster or emergency benefits)\r\ncreated by the Act.\r\nThis amendment repromulgates the temporary, emergency amendment as permanent, with\r\nthe following changes. First, the amendment expands the scope of the two-level\r\nenhancement to include all conduct described in 18 U.S.C. § 1040. Thus, the amendment\r\nexpands the scope of the enhancement to include fraud or theft involving procurement of\r\nproperty or services as a contractor, subcontractor or supplier, rather than limiting it to the\r\nconduct described in the emergency directive. The limited emergency amendment authority\r\ndid not permit the Commission to include such conduct in the enhancement promulgated in\r\nthe emergency amendment. However, the directive in section 5 of the Act covers all \"fraud\r\nor theft offenses in connection with a major disaster declaration\" and, therefore, expansion\r\nof the scope of the enhancement to apply to all conduct described in 18 U.S.C. § 1040 is\r\nappropriate.\r\nSecond, the amendment modifies the enhancement to include a minimum offense level of\r\n12. The Commission frequently adopts a minimum offense level in circumstances in which,\r\nas in these cases, loss as calculated by the guidelines is difficult to compute or does not\r\nadequately account for the harm caused by the offense. The Commission studied a sample\r\nof disaster fraud cases and compared those cases to other cases of defrauding government\r\nprograms. This analysis supported claims made in testimony to the Commission that the\r\nmajority of the disaster fraud cases resulted in probationary sentences because the amount\r\nof loss calculated under subsection (b)(1) of §2B1.1 had little impact on the sentences. The\r\nCommission also received testimony and public comment identifying various harms unique\r\nto disaster fraud cases. For example, charitable institutions may have a more difficult time\r\nsoliciting contributions because fraud in connection with disasters may erode public trust in\r\nthese institutions. Moreover, the pool of funds available to aid legitimate disaster victims\r\nis adversely affected when fraud occurs. Further, the inherent tension between the\r\nimposition of fraud controls and the need to provide aid to disaster victims quickly makes\r\nit difficult for relief agencies and charitable institutions to prevent disaster fraud. All of\r\nthese factors provide support for a minimum offense level.\r\nThird, the amendment adds a downward departure provision that may apply in a case in\r\nwhich the minimum offense level applies, the defendant is a victim of a major disaster or\r\nemergency, and the benefits received illegally were only an extension or overpayment of\r\nbenefits received legitimately. This provision recognizes that a defendant’s legitimate status\r\nas a disaster victim may be a mitigating factor warranting a downward departure in certain\r\ncases involving relatively small amounts of loss.\r\nFourth, the amendment deletes certain commentary relating to the definition of loss that was\r\npromulgated in the emergency amendment. Specifically, the emergency amendment added\r\nsubdivision (IV) to Application Note 3(A)(v) of §2B1.1 providing that in disaster fraud\r\ncases, \"reasonably foreseeable pecuniary harm includes the administrative costs to any\r\nfederal, state, or local government entity or any commercial or not-for-profit entity of\r\nrecovering the benefit from any recipient thereof who obtained the benefit through fraud or\r\nwas otherwise ineligible for the benefit that were reasonably foreseeable.\" The amendment\r\ndeletes this provision because of concerns that administrative costs might be difficult to\r\ndetermine or in some instances could over-represent the harm caused by the offense.\r\n\r\nFinally, the amendment makes conforming changes to the guideline and the commentary.","EffectiveDate":"Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2008."},{"Id":720,"Title":"Amendment 720","Text":"The Commentary to §2C1.1 captioned \"Statutory Provisions\" is amended by\r\ninserting \"227,\" after \"226,\".\r\nAppendix A (Statutory Index) is amended by inserting after the line reference to 18 U.S.C.\r\n§ 226 the following:\r\n\"18 U.S.C. § 227 2C1.1\".","Reason":"Reason for Amendment: This amendment responds to the Honest Leadership and Open\r\nGovernment Act of 2007, Pub.

L. 110–22 (the \"Act\"). The Act amended the Animal\r\nWelfare Act, 7 U.S.C. § 2156, to increase penalties for existing offenses and to create a new\r\noffense. Specifically, the Act increased penalties for criminal violations of 7 U.S.C. § 2156\r\nfrom a one-year statutory maximum term of imprisonment to a three-year statutory\r\nmaximum term of imprisonment. The penalties are set forth in section 49 of title 18, United\r\nStates Code. In addition, the Act created an offense at 7 U.S.C. § 2156(e) making it\r\nunlawful to \"sell, buy, transport, or deliver in interstate or foreign commerce a knife, a gaff,\r\nor any other sharp instrument attached, or designed or intended to be attached, to the leg of\r\na bird for use in an animal fighting venture.\" This new offense also carries a three-year\r\nstatutory maximum term of imprisonment.\r\nBecause 7 U.S.C. § 2156 is now a felony offense, the amendment deletes the reference of\r\n7 U.S.C. § 2156 to §2X5.2 (Class A Misdemeanors) in Appendix A (Statutory Index), and\r\ndeletes the listing of 7 U.S.C. § 2156 from the statutory provisions listed in the commentary\r\nto §2X5.2. The amendment references offenses under 7 U.S.C. § 2156 to §2E3.1 (Gambling\r\nOffenses) as the legislative history and public comment indicate that such offenses often\r\ninvolve gambling. Accordingly, the amendment expands the title of §2E3.1 to include\r\nanimal fighting offenses.\r\nThe amendment also creates a new alternative base offense level at §2E3.1(a)(2) that\r\nprovides a base offense level of level 10 if the offense involved an \"animal fighting venture,\"\r\nwhich is defined in Application Note 1 as having the meaning given that term in 7 U.S.C.\r\n§ 2156(g), i.e., \"any event which involves a fight between at least two animals and is\r\nconducted for purposes of sport, wagering, or entertainment.\" The alternative base offense\r\nlevel reflects the increased harm, i.e., cruelty to animals, resulting from offenses under 7\r\nU.S.C. § 2156(g) that is not associated with offenses that typically receive a base offense\r\nlevel of level 6 under the guideline. Additionally, the amendment adds an instruction to\r\napply the greatest applicable base offense level at §2E3.1(a) because an offense involving\r\nan animal fighting venture may also involve conduct covered by subsection (a)(1) and,\r\ntherefore, should receive the higher base offense level provided by that subsection.\r\nThe amendment also provides an upward departure provision that may apply if an offense\r\ninvolves extraordinary cruelty to an animal that resulted in, for example, maiming or death\r\nto an animal.","EffectiveDate":"Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2008."},{"Id":722,"Title":"Amendment 722","Text":"The Commentary to §2L1.2 captioned \"Application Notes\" is amended in\r\nNote 1 by striking subdivision (B)(iii) as follows:\r\n\"(iii) ‘Crime of violence’ means any of the following: murder, manslaughter,\r\n\r\nAmendment 723 APPENDIX C - VOLUME III November 1, 2011\r\nkidnapping, aggravated assault, forcible sex offenses, statutory rape, sexual\r\nabuse of a minor, robbery, arson, extortion, extortionate extension of credit,\r\nburglary of a dwelling, or any offense under federal, state, or local law that\r\nhas as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force\r\nagainst the person of another.\",\r\nand inserting the following:\r\n\"(iii) ‘Crime of violence’ means any of the following offenses under federal,\r\nstate, or local law: murder, manslaughter, kidnapping, aggravated assault,\r\nforcible sex offenses (including where consent to the conduct is not given\r\nor is not legally valid, such as where consent to the conduct is involuntary,\r\nincompetent, or coerced), statutory rape, sexual abuse of a minor, robbery,\r\narson, extortion, extortionate extension of credit, burglary of a dwelling, or\r\nany other offense under federal, state, or local law that has as an element the\r\nuse, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of\r\nanother.\";\r\nand in subdivision (B)(iv) by inserting \", or offer to sell\" after \"dispensing of\".\r\nThe Commentary to §2L1.2 captioned \"Application Notes\" is amended by adding at the end\r\nthe following:\r\n\"7.

The\r\namendment reflects input the Commission has received from federal judges, prosecutors,\r\ndefense attorneys, and probation officers at several roundtable discussions and public\r\nhearings on the operation of §2L1.2.\r\nFirst, the amendment clarifies the scope of the term \"forcible sex offense\" as that term is used\r\nin the definition of \"crime of violence\" in §2L1.2, Application Note 1(B)(iii). The\r\namendment provides that the term \"forcible sex offense\" includes crimes \"where consent to\r\nthe conduct is not given or is not legally valid, such as where consent to the conduct is\r\ninvoluntary, incompetent, or coerced.\" The amendment makes clear that forcible sex\r\noffenses, like all offenses enumerated in Application Note 1(B)(iii), \"are always classified\r\nas 'crimes of violence,' regardless of whether the prior offense expressly has as an element\r\nthe use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another,\"\r\nUSSC, Guideline Manual, Supplement to Appendix C, Amendment 658. Application of the\r\n\r\nNovember 1, 2011 APPENDIX C - VOLUME III Amendment 723\r\namendment, therefore, would result in an outcome that is contrary to cases excluding crimes\r\nin which \"there may be assent in fact but no legally valid consent\" from the scope of\r\n\"forcible sex offenses.\" See, e.g., United States v. Gomez-Gomez, 493 F.3d 562, 567 (5th\r\nCir. 2007) (holding that a rape conviction was not a forcible sex offense because it could\r\nhave been based on assent given in response to a threat \"to reveal embarrassing secrets\" or\r\nafter \"an employer threatened to fire a subordinate\"); United States v. Luciano-Rodriguez,\r\n442 F.3d 320, 322–23 (5th Cir. 2006) (holding that a conviction for a sexual assault was not\r\na forcible sex offense because it could have been based on assent when \"the actor knows that\r\nas a result of mental disease or defect the other person is at the time of the sexual assault\r\nincapable either of appraising the nature of the act or of resisting it,\" when \"the actor is a\r\npublic servant who coerces the other person to submit or participate,\" or when \"the actor is\r\na member of the clergy or is a mental health service provider who exploits the emotional\r\ndependency engendered by their position\"); United States v. Sarmiento-Funes, 374 F.3d 336,\r\n341 (5th Cir. 2004) (holding that a conviction for sexual assault was not a forcible sex\r\noffense because it could have been based on assent that is \"the product of deception or a\r\njudgment impaired by intoxication\").\r\nSecond, the amendment clarifies that an \"offer to sell\" a controlled substance is a \"drug\r\ntrafficking offense\" for purposes of subsection (b)(1) of §2L1.2 by adding \"offer to sell\" to\r\nthe conduct listed in Application Note 1(B)(iv).\r\nFinally, the amendment addresses the concern that in some cases the categorical\r\nenhancements in subsection (b) may not adequately reflect the seriousness of a prior offense.\r\nThe amendment adds a departure provision that may apply in a case \"in which the applicable\r\noffense level substantially overstates or understates the seriousness of a prior conviction.\"\r\nThe amendment provides two examples of cases that may warrant such a departure. The first\r\nexample suggests that an upward departure may be warranted in a case in which \"subsection\r\n(b)(1)(A) or (b)(1)(B) does not apply and the defendant has a prior conviction for possessing\r\nor transporting a quantity of a controlled substance that exceeds a quantity consistent with\r\npersonal use.\" The second example suggests that a downward departure may be warranted\r\nin a case in which \"subsection (b)(1)(A) applies, and the prior conviction does not meet the\r\ndefinition of aggravated felony at 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43).\"","EffectiveDate":"Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2008."},{"Id":723,"Title":"Amendment 723","Text":"Section 2N2.1 is amended by redesignating subsection (b) as subsection (c)\r\nand inserting after subsection (a) the following:\r\n\"(b) Specific Offense Characteristic\r\n(1) If the defendant was convicted under 21 U.S.C. § 331 after\r\nsustaining a prior conviction under 21 U.S.C. § 331, increase by 4\r\nlevels.\".\r\nThe Commentary to §2N2.1 captioned \"Application Notes\" is amended in Note 2 by striking\r\n\"(b)(1)\" and inserting \"(c)(1)\"; and by striking \"(b)(2)\" and inserting \"(c)(2)\".\r\nThe Commentary to §2N2.1 captioned \"Application Notes\" is amended in Note 3 by striking\r\n\"Death\" and inserting \"The offense created a substantial risk of bodily injury or death;\"; by\r\n\r\ninserting \"death,\" before \"extreme\"; and by inserting \"from the offense\" after \"resulted\".","Reason":"Reason for Amendment: This amendment makes two changes to §2N2.1 (Violations of\r\nStatutes and Regulations Dealing With Any Food, Drug, Biological Product, Device,\r\nCosmetic, or Agricultural Product) to address offenses under the Federal Food, Drug, and\r\nCosmetic Act, 21 U.S.C. §§ 301 et seq.

L.\r\n110–326 (the \"Act\"), and addresses other related issues arising from case law. Section\r\n209(a) of the Act directed the Commission to—\r\nreview its guidelines and policy statements applicable to persons convicted\r\nof offenses under sections 1028, 1028A, 1030, 2511, and 2701 of title 18,\r\nUnited States Code, and any other relevant provisions of law, in order to\r\nreflect the intent of Congress that such penalties be increased in comparison\r\nto those currently provided by such guidelines and policy statements.\r\n\r\nThe Act further required the Commission, in determining the appropriate sentence for the\r\nabove referenced offenses, to consider the extent to which the guidelines and policy\r\nstatements adequately account for 13 factors listed in section 209(b) of the Act.\r\nIn response to the congressional directive, the amendment increases penalties provided by\r\nthe applicable guidelines and policy statements by adding a new enhancement and a new\r\nupward departure provision. In addition, the amendment expands both the definition of\r\n\"victim\" and the factors to be considered in the calculation of loss; each of these expansions\r\nmay, in an appropriate case, increase penalties in comparison to those provided prior to the\r\namendment.\r\nFirst, the amendment adds a new two-level enhancement in §2B1.1 (Larceny,\r\nEmbezzlement, and Other Forms of Theft; Offenses Involving Stolen Property; Property\r\nDamage or Destruction; Fraud and Deceit; Forgery; Offenses Involving Altered or\r\nCounterfeit Instruments Other than Counterfeit Bearer Obligations of the United States).\r\nThe new enhancement, which addresses offenses involving personal information, is at\r\nsubsection (b)(15). An existing enhancement, which addresses offenses under 18 U.S.C. §\r\n1030 (i.e., computer crimes), was at subsection (b)(15) but has been redesignated as\r\nsubsection (b)(16).\r\nThe new enhancement for offenses involving personal information applies if (A) the\r\ndefendant was convicted of an offense under 18 U.S.C. § 1030 and the offense involved an\r\nintent to obtain personal information, or (B) the offense involved the unauthorized public\r\ndissemination of personal information. The \"(A)\" prong of the new personal information\r\nenhancement had been a prong of the existing computer crime enhancement, but the tiered\r\nstructure of that enhancement was such that if a computer crime involved both an intent to\r\nobtain personal information and another harm (such as an intrusion into a government\r\ncomputer, an intent to cause damage, or a disruption of a critical infrastructure), only the\r\ngreatest applicable increase would apply. The amendment responds to concerns that a case\r\ninvolving those other harms is different in kind from a case involving an intent to obtain\r\npersonal information. Moving the intent to obtain personal information prong out of the\r\ncomputer crime enhancement and into the new enhancement ensures that a defendant\r\nconvicted under section 1030 receives an incremental increase in punishment if the offense\r\ninvolved both an intent to obtain personal information and another harm addressed by the\r\ncomputer crime enhancement. The \"(B)\" prong of the new personal information\r\nenhancement ensures that any defendant, regardless of the statute of conviction, receives an\r\nadditional incremental increase in punishment if the offense involved the unauthorized\r\npublic dissemination of personal information. This prong accounts for the greater harm to\r\nprivacy caused by such an offense.\r\nSecond, the amendment amends the Commentary to §2B1.1 to provide that, for purposes of\r\nthe victims table in subsection (b)(2), an individual whose means of identification was used\r\nunlawfully or without authority is considered a \"victim.\" The Commentary to §2B1.1 in\r\nApplication Note 1 defines \"victim\" in pertinent part to mean \"any person who sustained any\r\npart of the actual loss determined under subsection (b)(1)\". An identity theft case may\r\ninvolve an individual whose means of identification was taken and used but who was fully\r\nreimbursed by a third party (e.g., a bank or credit card company). Some courts have held\r\nthat such an individual is not counted as a \"victim\" for purposes of the victims table at\r\n§2B1.1(b)(2). See United States v. Kennedy, 554 F.3d 415 (3d Cir. 2009) (discussing\r\n\r\nvarious cases addressing this issue, including United States v. Armstead, 552 F.3d 769 (9th\r\nCir. 2008); United States v. Abiodun, 536 F.3d 162 (2d Cir. 2008); United States v. Connor,\r\n537 F.3d 480 (5th Cir. 2008); United States v. Icaza, 492 F.3d 967 (8th Cir. 2007); United\r\nStates v. Lee, 427 F.3d 881 (11th Cir. 2005); and United States v. Yagar, 404 F.3d 967 (6th\r\nCir. 2005)). The Commission determined that such an individual should be considered a\r\n\"victim\" for purposes of subsection (b)(2) because such an individual, even if fully\r\nreimbursed, must often spend significant time resolving credit problems and related issues,\r\nand such lost time may not be adequately accounted for in the loss calculations under the\r\nguidelines. The Commission received testimony that the incidence of data breach cases, in\r\nwhich large numbers of means of identification are compromised, is increasing. This new\r\ncategory of \"victim\" for purposes of subsection (b)(2) is appropriately limited, however, to\r\ncover only those individuals whose means of identification are actually used.\r\nThird, the amendment makes two changes to Application Note 3(C) regarding the calculation\r\nof loss. The first change specifies that the estimate of loss may be based upon the fair market\r\nvalue of property that is copied. This change responds to concerns that the calculation of\r\nloss does not adequately account for a case in which an owner of proprietary information\r\nretains possession of such information, but the proprietary information is unlawfully copied.\r\nThe amendment recognizes, for example, that a computer crime that does not deprive the\r\nowner of the information in the computer nonetheless may cause loss inasmuch as it reduces\r\nthe value of the information. The amendment makes clear that in such a case the court may\r\nuse the fair market value of the copied property to estimate loss. The second change adds\r\na new provision to Application Note 3(C) specifying that, in a case involving proprietary\r\ninformation (e.g., trade secrets), the court may estimate loss using the cost of developing that\r\ninformation or the reduction in the value of that information that resulted from the offense.\r\nThe new provision responds to concerns that the guidelines did not adequately explain how\r\nto estimate loss in a case involving proprietary information such as trade secrets.\r\nFourth, the amendment moves the definitions of \"means of identification\" and \"personal\r\ninformation\" to Application Note 1, and clarifies that for information to be considered\r\n\"personal information,\" it must involve information of an identifiable individual.\r\nFifth, the amendment amends §2H3.1 (Interception of Communications; Eavesdropping;\r\nDisclosure of Certain Private or Protected Information) to provide that an upward departure\r\nmay be warranted in a case in which the offense involved personal information or means of\r\nidentification of a substantial number of individuals. As a conforming change, in\r\nApplication Note 4 the amendment adds definitions of \"means of identification\" and\r\n\"personal information\" that are identical to the definitions of those terms in §2B1.1. The\r\ndeparture provision responds to concerns that the guideline may not adequately account for\r\nthe rare wiretapping offense that involves a substantial number of victims.\r\nSixth, the amendment clarifies Application Note 2(B) of §3B1.3 (Abuse of Position of Trust\r\nor Use of Special Skill). The first sentence of Application Note 2(B) specifies that an\r\nadjustment under §3B1.3 shall apply to a defendant who exceeds or abuses his or her\r\nauthority to \"obtain\" or \"use\" a means of identification. The second sentence then provides,\r\nas an example of such a defendant, an employee of a state motor vehicle department who\r\nexceeds or abuses his or her authority by \"issuing\" a means of identification. To make the\r\ntwo sentences consistent, the amendment clarifies the first sentence so that it expressly\r\n\r\nNovember 1, 2011 APPENDIX C - VOLUME III Amendment 727\r\napplies not only to obtaining or using a means of identification, but also to issuing or\r\ntransferring a means of identification.\r\nFinally, the amendment makes several technical changes. In particular, it corrects several\r\nplaces in the Guidelines Manual that erroneously refer to subsection \"(b)(15)(iii)\" of §2B1.1;\r\nthe reference should be to subsection (b)(15)(A)(iii) (redesignated by the amendment as\r\n(b)(16)(A)(iii)). Also, it conforms a statutory reference in §2B1.1(b)(15)(A)(ii)\r\n(redesignated by the amendment as (b)(16)(A)(ii)), which refers to 18 U.S.C. §\r\n1030(a)(5)(A)(i); the Act redesignated this statute as 18 U.S.C. § 1030(a)(5)(A).\r\nThe Commission determined that certain factors listed in the directive are adequately\r\naccounted for by existing provisions in the Guidelines Manual. See, e.g., §§2B1.1(b)(1),\r\n(b)(9)(C), (b)(13), (b)(16) (as redesignated by the amendment); 2B2.3(b)(1), (b)(3);\r\n2B3.2(b)(3)(B); 2H3.1(b)(1)(B); and 3B1.4 (Using a Minor To Commit a Crime)).","EffectiveDate":"Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2009."},{"Id":727,"Title":"Amendment 727","Text":"Section 2D1.1(a) is amended by redesignating subdivision (3) as subdivision\r\n(5);

L. 110–425 (the \"Act\").\r\nThe Act amended the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. § 801 et seq.) to create two new\r\noffenses involving controlled substances, increased the statutory maximum terms of\r\nimprisonment for all Schedule III and IV controlled substance offenses and for second and\r\nsubsequent Schedule V controlled substance offenses, and added a sentencing enhancement\r\nfor Schedule III controlled substance offenses in a case in which \"death or serious bodily\r\ninjury results from the use of such substance\". The Act also included a directive to the\r\nCommission that states:\r\nThe United States Sentencing Commission, in determining whether to\r\namend, or establish new, guidelines or policy statements, to conform the\r\nFederal sentencing guidelines and policy statements to this Act and the\r\namendments made by this Act, should not construe any change in the\r\nmaximum penalty for a violation involving a controlled substance in a\r\nparticular schedule as being the sole reason to amend, or establish a new,\r\nguideline or policy statement.\r\nFirst, the amendment addresses the sentencing enhancement added by the Act, which applies\r\nwhen the offense involved a Schedule III controlled substance and death or serious bodily\r\ninjury resulted from the use of such substance. The statutory enhancement provides a\r\nmaximum term of imprisonment of 15 years, or 30 years if the violation is committed after\r\na prior conviction for a felony drug offense. See 21 U.S.C. §§ 841(b)(1)(E), 960(b)(5). The\r\namendment addresses the statutory enhancement by amending §2D1.1 (Unlawful\r\nManufacturing, Importing, Exporting, or Trafficking (Including Possession with Intent to\r\nCommit These Offenses); Attempt or Conspiracy) to provide two new alternative base\r\noffense levels at subsections (a)(3) and (a)(4) for offenses involving Schedule III controlled\r\nsubstances in which death or injury results that are comparable to the alternative base offense\r\nlevels at subsections (a)(1) and (a)(2) for offenses involving Schedule I and II controlled\r\nsubstances in which death or injury results. To reflect the harms involved in these offenses\r\nand the criminal histories of repeat drug offenders, the alternative base offense levels are set\r\nat level 30 if the defendant committed the offense after one or more prior convictions for a\r\nsimilar offense and level 26 otherwise.\r\n\r\nSecond, the amendment modifies the Drug Quantity Table in §2D1.1 to increase the\r\nmaximum base offense level for offenses involving Schedule III hydrocodone from level 20\r\nto level 30, without modifying any other offense level. The amendment extends the Drug\r\nQuantity Table for Schedule III hydrocodone offenses to level 30 using the existing\r\nmarihuana equivalency (i.e., 1 pill of Schedule III hydrocodone = 1 gram of marihuana).\r\nThe Commission determined that a maximum base offense level of 30 is appropriate for\r\nSchedule III hydrocodone offenses because of data and testimony indicating a relatively high\r\nprevalence of misuse (when compared to other, non-marihuana drugs of abuse), an\r\nincreasing number of emergency room visits involving this drug, and the very large volume\r\nof hydrocodone pills illicitly distributed, either over the Internet or in specialized pain\r\nclinics.\r\nFinally, the amendment addresses the two new offenses created by the Act. The first new\r\noffense, at 21 U.S.C. § 841(h), prohibits the delivery, distribution, or dispensing of\r\ncontrolled substances over the Internet without a valid prescription. The applicable statutory\r\nmaximum term of imprisonment depends on the controlled substance involved. The\r\namendment amends Appendix A (Statutory Index) to reference 21 U.S.C. § 841(h) to §2D1.1\r\nbecause distribution of a controlled substance is an element of the offense. That guideline\r\nalso is appropriate because it includes an enhancement at subsection (b)(6) that provides a\r\ntwo-level increase in a case in which \"a person distributes a controlled substance through\r\nmass-marketing by means of an interactive computer service\" (e.g., sale of a controlled\r\nsubstance by means of the Internet).\r\nThe second new offense, at 21 U.S.C. § 843(c)(2)(A), prohibits the use of the Internet to\r\nadvertise for sale a controlled substance and has a statutory maximum term of imprisonment\r\nof four years. Offenses under 21 U.S.C. § 843(c) already are referenced in Appendix A\r\n(Statutory Index) to §2D3.1 (Regulatory Offenses Involving Registration Numbers;\r\nUnlawful Advertising Relating to Schedule I Substances; Attempt or Conspiracy). The\r\namendment modifies the title of that guideline to indicate that it covers any scheduled\r\ncontrolled substance.","EffectiveDate":"Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2009."},{"Id":728,"Title":"Amendment 728","Text":"Section 2D1.1(b)(2) is amended by striking \"or\" before \"(B)\"; and by\r\ninserting \"a submersible vessel or semi-submersible vessel as described in 18 U.S.C. § 2285\r\nwas used, or (C)\" after \"(B)\".\r\nThe Commentary to §2D1.1 captioned \"Application Notes\" is amended in Note 8 in the\r\nparagraph that begins \"Note, however\" by striking \"(B)\" and inserting \"(C)\".\r\nChapter Two, Part X, Subpart 7 is amended in the heading by adding at the end \"AND\r\nSUBMERSIBLE AND SEMI-SUBMERSIBLE VESSELS\".\r\nChapter Two, Part X, Subpart 7 is amended by adding at the end the following guideline and\r\naccompanying commentary:\r\n\"§2X7.2.

L. 110–407 (the \"Act\"). The Act created a new offense at 18\r\nU.S.C. § 2285 making it unlawful to operate, attempt or conspire to operate, or embark in\r\nan unflagged submersible or semi-submersible vessel in international waters with the intent\r\nto evade detection. Section 103 of the Act directed the Commission to amend the guidelines,\r\nor promulgate new guidelines, to provide adequate penalties for persons convicted of\r\noffenses under 18 U.S.C. § 2285 and included a list of circumstances for the Commission\r\nto consider.\r\nFirst, the amendment amends §2D1.1 (Unlawful Manufacturing, Importing, Exporting, or\r\nTrafficking (Including Possession with Intent to Commit These Offenses); Attempt or\r\n\r\nConspiracy) by expanding the scope of the specific offense characteristic at subsection (b)(2)\r\nto apply if a submersible or semi-submersible vessel was used in a drug importation offense.\r\nThe Commission determined that a drug importation offense involving the use of a\r\nsubmersible or semi-submersible vessel poses similar risks and harms as a drug importation\r\noffense involving an unscheduled aircraft (which subsection (b)(2) already covers). The\r\namendment also makes a conforming change to a reference in Application Note 8.\r\nSecond, the amendment creates a new guideline at §2X7.2 (Submersible and\r\nSemi-Submersible Vessels) for the new offense at 18 U.S.C. § 2285. The new guideline\r\nprovides a base offense level of 26 and includes a tiered specific offense characteristic and\r\nupward departure provisions to address certain aggravating circumstances listed in the\r\ndirective. Public testimony indicates that submersible and semi-submersible vessels to date\r\nhave been used for the purpose of transporting drugs. Such conduct receives a minimum\r\noffense level of 26 under §2D1.1(b)(2), discussed above, regardless of the type or quantity\r\nof drug involved in the offense. The Commission determined that a base offense level of 26\r\nin §2X7.2 for an offense under section 2285 would be appropriate to promote\r\nproportionality.\r\nThe specific offense characteristic in §2X7.2 provides a two-level enhancement for failing\r\nto heave to, a four-level enhancement for attempting to sink the vessel, and an eight-level\r\nenhancement for sinking the vessel; the greatest applicable enhancement applies. Offenses\r\ninvolving such conduct are more serious because they create greater risk of harm to the crew\r\nof the illegal vessel and the interdicting law enforcement personnel, particularly in a case in\r\nwhich the illegal vessel is sunk and its crew must be rescued. In addition, sinking the vessel\r\ndestroys evidence of illegal activity. The upward departure provisions provide that an\r\nupward departure may be warranted if the defendant engaged in a pattern of activity\r\ninvolving the use of a submersible or semi-submersible vessel, or if the offense involved the\r\nuse of the vessel as a part of an ongoing criminal organization or criminal enterprise.\r\nThird, the amendment amends Appendix A (Statutory Index) to reference 18 U.S.C. § 2285\r\nto §2X7.2.","EffectiveDate":"Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2009."},{"Id":729,"Title":"Amendment 729","Text":"Section 2A6.1(b) is amended by redesignating subdivision (5) as subdivision\r\n(6); by inserting after subdivision (4) the following:\r\n\"(5) If the defendant (A) is convicted under 18 U.S.C. § 115, (B) made a public\r\nthreatening communication, and (C) knew or should have known that the\r\npublic threatening communication created a substantial risk of inciting\r\nothers to violate 18 U.S.C. § 115, increase by 2 levels.\";\r\nand in subdivision (6), as redesignated by this amendment, by striking \"and (4)\" and\r\ninserting \"(4), and (5)\".\r\nThe Commentary to §2A6.1 captioned \"Background\" is amended by adding at the end the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\n\" Subsection (b)(5) implements, in a broader form, the directive to the\r\nCommission in section 209 of the Court Security Improvement Act of 2007, Public\r\nLaw 110–177.\".\r\nAppendix A (Statutory Index) is amended in the line referenced to 18 U.S.C. § 1513 by\r\ninserting \"2A1.1, 2A1.2, 2A1.3, 2A2.1, 2A2.2, 2A2.3, 2B1.1,\" before \"2J1.2\".","Reason":"Reason for Amendment: This amendment responds to the Court Security Improvement\r\nAct of 2007, Pub.

The Commission\r\ndetermined that the policy concerns underlying the directive regarding threats occurring over\r\nthe Internet apply equally to threats made public by other means (e.g., radio, television\r\nbroadcast) and that the response to the directive therefore should be technology neutral. The\r\nthreat guideline, §2A6.1, adequately accounts for offenses involving multiple threats and\r\nmultiple victims through the existing specific offense characteristic at subsection (b)(2) and\r\nthe upward departure provision in Application Note 4.\r\nSecond, the amendment amends Appendix A (Statutory Index) to add references for 18\r\nU.S.C. § 1513 (Retaliating against a witness, victim, or an informant) to §§2A1.1 (First\r\nDegree Murder), 2A1.2 (Second Degree Murder), 2A1.3 (Voluntary Manslaughter), 2A2.1\r\n(Assault with Intent to Commit Murder; Attempted Murder), 2A2.2 (Aggravated Assault),\r\n2A2.3 (Minor Assault), and 2B1.1 (Larceny, Embezzlement, and Other Forms of Theft;\r\nOffenses Involving Stolen Property; Property Damage or Destruction; Fraud and Deceit;\r\nForgery; Offenses Involving Altered or Counterfeit Instruments Other than Counterfeit\r\nBearer Obligations of the United States), in addition to §2J1.2 (Obstruction of Justice). The\r\nadditional references more adequately reflect the range of conduct covered by 18 U.S.C. §\r\n1513, including killing or attempting to kill a witness, causing bodily injury to a witness, and\r\ndamaging the tangible property of a witness. In addition, 18 U.S.C. § 1512 (Tampering with\r\na witness, victim, or an informant), which covers a similar range of conduct, including\r\nkilling or attempting to kill a witness and using physical force against a witness, is\r\nreferenced to the same Chapter Two, Part A guidelines.","EffectiveDate":"Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2009."},{"Id":730,"Title":"Amendment 730","Text":"Section 2H4.1(a) is amended by striking \"(Apply the greater)\" after \"Offense\r\nLevel\"; and by striking subdivision (2) as follows:\r\n\"(2) 18, if the defendant was convicted of an offense under 18 U.S.C. § 1592.\",\r\nand inserting the following:\r\n\"(2) 18, if (A) the defendant was convicted of an offense under 18 U.S.C.\r\n§ 1592, or (B) the defendant was convicted of an offense under 18 U.S.C.\r\n§ 1593A based on an act in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1592.\".\r\nThe Commentary to §2H4.1 captioned \"Statutory Provisions\" is amended by inserting\r\n\", 1593A\" after \"1592\".\r\nThe Commentary to §2H4.1 captioned \"Application Notes\" is amended by adding at the end\r\nthe following:\r\n\"4.

It directed the\r\nCommission to—\r\nreview and, if appropriate, amend the sentencing guidelines and policy\r\nstatements applicable to persons convicted of alien harboring to ensure\r\nconformity with the sentencing guidelines applicable to persons convicted\r\nof promoting a commercial sex act if–\r\n(1) the harboring was committed in furtherance of prostitution; and\r\n(2) the defendant to be sentenced is an organizer, leader, manager, or\r\nsupervisor of the criminal activity.\r\nThe amendment amends §2L1.1 (Smuggling, Transporting, or Harboring an Unlawful Alien)\r\nto provide an alternative prong to the enhancement at subsection (b)(8), which covers cases\r\nin which an alien was involuntarily detained through coercion or threat, or in connection\r\nwith a demand for payment. The new alternative prong, at subsection (b)(8)(B), applies in\r\na case in which the defendant was convicted of alien harboring, the alien harboring was for\r\nthe purpose of prostitution, and the defendant receives an adjustment under §3B1.1\r\n(Aggravating Role). In such a case, a two-level increase applies, but if the alien engaging\r\nin the prostitution had not attained the age of 18 years, a six-level increase applies. Because\r\nthis is an alternative enhancement, it does not apply if the enhancement for coercion at\r\n§2L1.1(b)(8)(A) is greater.\r\nThe amendment also amends Application Note 6 to provide that, while an adjustment under\r\n§3A1.3 (Restraint of Victim) does not apply in a case that receives an enhancement under\r\n§2L1.1(b)(8)(A), such an adjustment may apply in a case that receives an enhancement under\r\n§2L1.1(b)(8)(B).\r\nSecond, the amendment responds to a new offense created by the Act, 18 U.S.C. § 1351\r\n(Fraud in foreign labor contracting). The new offense has a statutory maximum term of\r\nimprisonment of five years. Because this new offense has fraud as an element, the\r\namendment references this new offense in Appendix A (Statutory Index) to §2B1.1\r\n\r\n(Larceny, Embezzlement, and Other Forms of Theft; Offenses Involving Stolen Property;\r\nProperty Damage or Destruction; Fraud and Deceit; Forgery; Offenses Involving Altered or\r\nCounterfeit Instruments Other than Counterfeit Bearer Obligations of the United States).\r\nThird, the amendment responds to another new offense created by the Act, 18 U.S.C. §\r\n1593A (Benefitting financially from peonage, slavery, and trafficking in persons). This new\r\noffense applies when a person has knowingly benefitted financially from participating in a\r\nventure that has engaged in a violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 1581(a), 1592, or 1595(a), knowing\r\nor in reckless disregard of the fact that the venture has engaged in such violation. The\r\namendment amends Appendix A (Statutory Index) to reference 18 U.S.C. § 1593A to\r\n§2H4.1 (Peonage, Involuntary Servitude, and Slave Trade) because that guideline covers the\r\nrelevant underlying statutes, 18 U.S.C. §§ 1581(a) and 1592. The amendment also amends\r\n§2H4.1 to provide that a defendant convicted of 18 U.S.C. § 1593A receives the same base\r\noffense level as if the defendant were convicted of committing the underlying violation.\r\nAccordingly, if the defendant was convicted under section 1593A under circumstances in\r\nwhich the defendant benefitted from participation in a venture that engaged in a violation of\r\n18 U.S.C. § 1592, the defendant would receive the same base offense level, 18, as if the\r\ndefendant had been convicted of 18 U.S.C. § 1592. If the defendant was convicted under\r\nsection 1593A under circumstances in which the defendant benefitted from participation in\r\na venture that engaged in a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1581(a), the defendant would receive\r\nthe same base offense level, 22, as if the defendant had been convicted of 18 U.S.C. §\r\n1581(a).\r\nThe amendment also amends the Commentary to §2H4.1 to provide that a downward\r\ndeparture may be warranted in a case in which the defendant is convicted under 18 U.S.C.\r\n§§ 1589(b) or 1593A if the defendant benefitted from participating in a venture described\r\nin those sections in reckless disregard of the fact that the venture had engaged in the criminal\r\nactivities described in those sections. This downward departure provision recognizes that\r\na defendant who commits such an offense in reckless disregard of the fact that the venture\r\nengaged in such criminal activities may be less culpable than a defendant who acts with\r\nknowledge of that fact.\r\nFinally, the amendment makes a technical change to §2H4.1(a) by striking the phrase\r\n\"(Apply the greater)\".","EffectiveDate":"Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2009."},{"Id":731,"Title":"Amendment 731","Text":"Section 2B5.1(b)(2)(B) is amended by inserting \"(ii) genuine United States\r\ncurrency paper from which the ink or other distinctive counterfeit deterrent has been\r\ncompletely or partially removed;\" after \"paper;\"; and by striking \"or (ii)\" and inserting \"or\r\n(iii)\".\r\nThe Commentary to §2B5.1 captioned \"Application Notes\" is amended in Note 1 by\r\ninserting after the paragraph that begins \"Definitions.—\" the following:\r\n\"‘Counterfeit’ refers to an instrument that has been falsely made, manufactured, or\r\naltered.

The\r\namendment responds to concerns expressed by federal judges and members of Congress\r\nregarding which guideline should apply to offenses involving bleached notes.\r\nCourts in different circuits have resolved differently the question of whether an offense\r\ninvolving bleached notes should be sentenced under §2B5.1 or §2B1.1 (Larceny,\r\nEmbezzlement, and Other Forms of Theft; Offenses Involving Stolen Property; Property\r\nDamage or Destruction; Fraud and Deceit; Forgery; Offenses Involving Altered or\r\nCounterfeit Instruments Other than Counterfeit Bearer Obligations of the United States).\r\nCompare United States v.

Vice,\r\n2008 WL 113970 (W.D. La. Jan. 3, 2008) (same).\r\nThe amendment resolves this issue by providing that an offense involving bleached notes is\r\nsentenced under §2B5.1. The amendment does so by deleting Application Note 3 and\r\nrevising the definition of \"counterfeit\" to more closely parallel relevant counterfeiting\r\nstatutes, including 18 U.S.C. §§ 471 (Obligations or securities of the United States) and 472\r\n(Uttering counterfeit obligations or securities). It establishes a new definition at Application\r\nNote 1 providing that counterfeit \"refers to an instrument that has been falsely made,\r\nmanufactured, or altered.\" Under the new definition, altered instruments are treated as\r\ncounterfeit and sentenced under §2B5.1. Technological advances in counterfeiting, such as\r\nbleaching notes, have rendered obsolete the previous distinction in the guidelines between\r\nan instrument falsely made or manufactured in its entirety and a genuine instrument that is\r\naltered.\r\n\r\nThe amendment also adds a prong to the enhancement at subsection (b)(2)(B) to cover a case\r\nin which the defendant controlled or possessed genuine United States currency paper from\r\nwhich the ink or other distinctive counterfeit deterrent has been completely or partially\r\nremoved. Blank or partially blank bleached notes are similar to counterfeiting paper in how\r\nthey are involved in counterfeiting offenses. Accordingly, this new prong ensures that an\r\noffender who controlled or possessed blank or partially blank bleached notes is subject to\r\nthe same two-level enhancement as an offender who controlled or possessed \"counterfeiting\r\npaper similar to a distinctive paper\", as subsection (b)(2)(B)(i) already provides.\r\nFinally, the amendment amends Appendix A (Statutory Index) by striking the reference to\r\n§2B1.1 for two offenses that do not involve elements of fraud. Specifically, the amendment\r\ndeletes the reference to §2B1.1 for offenses under 18 U.S.C. §§ 474A (Deterrents to\r\ncounterfeiting of obligations and securities) and 476 (Taking impressions of tools used for\r\nobligations or securities).","EffectiveDate":"Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2009."},{"Id":732,"Title":"Amendment 732","Text":"The Commentary to §2A3.2 captioned \"Application Notes\" is amended in\r\nNote 3(B) in the paragraph that begins \"Undue Influence\" by adding at the end \"The\r\nvoluntariness of the minor’s behavior may be compromised without prohibited sexual\r\nconduct occurring.\"; by inserting after the paragraph that begins \"Undue Influence\" the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\"However, subsection (b)(2)(B)(ii) does not apply in a case in which the only\r\n‘minor’ (as defined in Application Note 1) involved in the offense is an undercover\r\nlaw enforcement officer.\";\r\nand in the paragraph that begins \"In a case\" by striking \", for purposes of subsection\r\n(b)(2)(B), that such participant unduly influenced the minor to engage in prohibited sexual\r\nconduct\" and inserting \"that subsection (b)(2)(B)(ii) applies\".\r\nThe Commentary to §2A3.2 captioned \"Background\" is amended by striking \"two-level\" and\r\ninserting \"four-level\" each place it appears.\r\nThe Commentary to §2G1.3 captioned \"Application Notes\" is amended in Note 3(B) in the\r\nparagraph that begins \"Undue Influence\" by adding at the end \"The voluntariness of the\r\nminor’s behavior may be compromised without prohibited sexual conduct occurring.\"; by\r\ninserting after the paragraph that begins \"Undue Influence\" the following:\r\n\"However, subsection (b)(2)(B) does not apply in a case in which the only ‘minor’\r\n(as defined in Application Note 1) involved in the offense is an undercover law\r\nenforcement officer.\";\r\nand in the paragraph that begins \"In a case\" by striking \", for purposes of subsection\r\n(b)(2)(B), that such participant unduly influenced the minor to engage in prohibited sexual\r\nconduct\" and inserting \"that subsection (b)(2)(B) applies\".","Reason":"Reason for Amendment: This amendment addresses a circuit conflict regarding\r\napplication of the undue influence enhancement at subsection (b)(2)(B)(ii) of §2A3.2\r\n\r\n(Criminal Sexual Abuse of a Minor Under the Age of Sixteen Years (Statutory Rape) or\r\nAttempt to Commit Such Acts) and at subsection (b)(2)(B) of §2G1.3 (Promoting a\r\nCommercial Sex Act or Prohibited Sexual Conduct with a Minor; Transportation of Minors\r\nto Engage in a Commercial Sex Act or Prohibited Sexual Conduct; Travel to Engage in\r\nCommercial Sex Act or Prohibited Sexual Conduct with a Minor; Sex Trafficking of\r\nChildren; Use of Interstate Facilities to Transport Information about a Minor). The undue\r\ninfluence enhancement applies if \"a participant otherwise unduly influenced the minor to\r\nengage in prohibited sexual conduct.\" The Commentary to both guidelines states that in\r\ndetermining whether the undue influence enhancement applies, \"the court should closely\r\nconsider the facts of the case to determine whether a participant’s influence over the minor\r\ncompromised the voluntariness of the minor’s behavior.\" The Commentary also provides\r\nfor a rebuttable presumption of undue influence \"[i]n a case in which a participant is at least\r\n10 years older than the minor.\"\r\nIn both guidelines, the term \"minor\" is defined to include \"an individual, whether fictitious\r\nor not, who a law enforcement officer represented to a participant . . . could be provided for\r\nthe purposes of engaging in sexually explicit conduct\" or \"an undercover law enforcement\r\nofficer who represented to a participant that the officer had not attained\" the age of majority.\r\nThree circuits have expressed different views on two issues: first, whether the undue\r\ninfluence enhancement can apply in a case involving attempted sexual conduct; and second,\r\nwhether the undue influence enhancement can apply in a case in which the only minor\r\ninvolved is a law enforcement officer. Compare United States v. Root, 296 F.3d 1222, 1234\r\n(11th Cir. 2002) (holding that the undue influence enhancement in §2A3.2 can apply in\r\ninstances of attempted sexual conduct, including a case in which the only \"victim\" involved\r\nin the case is an undercover law enforcement officer), and United States v. Vance, 494 F.3d\r\n985, 996 (11th Cir. 2007) (holding that the undue influence enhancement in §2G1.3 can\r\napply in a case in which the minor is fictitious), with United States v. Mitchell, 353 F.3d\r\n552, 554, 557 (7th Cir. 2003) (holding that the undue influence enhancement in §2A3.2\r\n\"cannot apply in the case of an attempt where the victim is an undercover police officer\", and\r\nsuggesting that it cannot apply in any case in which \"the offender and victim have not\r\nengaged in illicit sexual conduct\"), and United States v. Chriswell, 401 F.3d 459, 469 (6th\r\nCir. 2005) (holding that the undue influence enhancement in §2A3.2 \"is not applicable in\r\ncases where the victim is an undercover agent representing himself to be a child under the\r\nage of sixteen\" but leaving open the possibility that it can apply in other instances of\r\nattempted sexual conduct).\r\nThe amendment resolves the first issue by providing that the undue influence enhancement\r\ncan apply in a case involving attempted sexual conduct. Specifically, the amendment\r\namends the Commentary in §§2A3.2 and 2G1.3 to provide that \"[t]he voluntariness of the\r\nminor’s behavior may be compromised without prohibited sexual conduct occurring.\"\r\nThe amendment resolves the second issue by providing in the Commentary to §§2A3.2 and\r\n2G1.3 that the undue influence enhancement does not apply in a case in which the only\r\n\"minor\" involved in the offense is an undercover law enforcement officer. The Commission\r\ndetermined that the undue influence enhancement should not apply in a case involving only\r\nan undercover law enforcement officer because, unlike other enhancements in the sex\r\noffense guidelines, the undue influence enhancement is properly focused on the effect of the\r\ndefendant’s actions on the minor’s behavior.\r\n\r\nThe amendment also makes a stylistic change to the language in the Commentary of both\r\n§§2A3.2 and 2G1.3, and makes a technical change to the Background of §2A3.2.","EffectiveDate":"Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2009."},{"Id":733,"Title":"Amendment 733","Text":"Section 2B1.1(b)(6) is amended by striking \"or\" after \"damage to,\"; and by\r\ninserting \"or trafficking in,\" after \"destruction of,\".\r\nThe Commentary to §2B1.1 captioned \"Background\" is amended in the paragraph that\r\nbegins \"Subsection (b)(6)\" by inserting \"and the directive to the Commission in section 3 of\r\nPublic Law 110–384\" after \"105–101\".\r\nSection 2G2.1(b)(6) is amended by inserting \"or for the purpose of transmitting such\r\nmaterial live\" after \"explicit material\".\r\nThe Commentary to §2G2.1 captioned \"Application Notes\" is amended in Note 1 in the\r\nparagraph that begins \"‘Distribution’ means\" by inserting \"transmission,\" after \"production,\";\r\nand by inserting after the paragraph that begins \"‘Interactive computer service’\" the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\"‘Material’ includes a visual depiction, as defined in 18 U.S.C. § 2256.\".\r\nThe Commentary to §2G2.1 captioned \"Application Notes\" is amended in Note 4 by\r\ninserting \"or for the purpose of transmitting such material live\" after \"explicit material\" each\r\nplace it appears; and in subdivision (B) by striking \"purpose\" after \"for such\" and inserting\r\n\"purposes\".\r\nSection 2G2.2(a)(1) is amended by striking \"or\" after \"2252(a)(4),\"; and by inserting \", or\r\n§ 2252A(a)(7)\" after \"2252A(a)(5)\".\r\nSection 2G2.2(b)(6) is amended by inserting \"or for accessing with intent to view the\r\nmaterial,\" after \"material,\".\r\nSection 2G2.2(c)(1) is amended by inserting \"or for the purpose of transmitting a live visual\r\ndepiction of such conduct\" after \"such conduct\".\r\nThe Commentary to §2G2.2 captioned \"Application Notes\" is amended in Note 1 in the\r\nparagraph that begins \"‘Distribution’ means\" by inserting \"transmission,\" after \"production,\";\r\nby inserting after the paragraph that begins \"‘Interactive computer service’\" the following:\r\n\"‘Material’ includes a visual depiction, as defined in 18 U.S.C. § 2256.\"; and\r\nin the paragraph that begins \"‘Sexual abuse or exploitation’\" by inserting \"accessing with\r\nintent to view,\" after \"possession,\".\r\nThe Commentary to §2G2.2 captioned \"Application Notes\" is amended in Note 2 by\r\ninserting \"access with intent to view,\" after \"possess,\".\r\n\r\nThe Commentary to §2G2.2 captioned \"Application Notes\" is amended in Note 4(B)(ii) by\r\nstriking \"recording\" and inserting \"visual depiction\" each place it appears.\r\nThe Commentary to §2G2.2 captioned \"Application Notes\" is amended in Note 5(A) by\r\ninserting \"or for the purpose of transmitting live any visual depiction of such conduct\" after\r\n\"such conduct\".\r\nThe Commentary to §2G2.2 captioned \"Application Notes\" is amended by redesignating\r\nNote 6 as Note 7; and by inserting after Note 5 the following:\r\n\"6.

Accordingly, the conditions now\r\nreferenced are restitution ((b)(2)), notice to victims pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3555\r\n((b)(3)), and an order that the defendant reside, or refrain from residing, in a\r\nspecified place or area ((b)(13)).\".\r\nAppendix A (Statutory Index) is amended by inserting before the line referenced to 2 U.S.C.\r\n§ 437g(d) the following:\r\n\"2 U.S.C. § 192 2J1.1, 2J1.5\r\n2 U.S.C. § 390 2J1.1, 2J1.5\";\r\n\r\nby inserting after the line referenced to 7 U.S.C. § 87b the following:\r\n\"7 U.S.C. § 87f(e) 2J1.1, 2J1.5\";\r\nby inserting after the line referenced to 8 U.S.C. § 1375a(d)(3)(C),(d)(5)(B) the following:\r\n\"10 U.S.C. § 987(f) 2X5.2\";\r\nby inserting after the line referenced to 12 U.S.C. § 631 the following:\r\n\"12 U.S.C. § 1818(j) 2B1.1\r\n12 U.S.C. § 1844(f) 2J1.1, 2J1.5\r\n12 U.S.C. § 2273 2J1.1, 2J1.5\r\n12 U.S.C. § 3108(b)(6) 2J1.1, 2J1.5\r\n12 U.S.C. § 4636b 2B1.1\r\n12 U.S.C. § 4641 2J1.1, 2J1.5\";\r\nby inserting after the line referenced to 15 U.S.C. § 78ff the following:\r\n\"15 U.S.C. § 78u(c) 2J1.1, 2J1.5\r\n15 U.S.C. § 80a-41(c) 2J1.1, 2J1.5\";\r\nby inserting after the line referenced to 15 U.S.C. § 80b-6 the following:\r\n\"15 U.S.C. § 80b-9(c) 2J1.1, 2J1.5\";\r\nby inserting after the line referenced to 15 U.S.C. § 714m(c) the following:\r\n\"15 U.S.C. § 717m(d) 2J1.1, 2J1.5\";\r\nby inserting after the line referenced to 15 U.S.C. § 1176 the following:\r\n\"15 U.S.C. § 1192 2N2.1\r\n15 U.S.C. § 1197(b) 2N2.1\r\n15 U.S.C. § 1202(c) 2N2.1\r\n15 U.S.C. § 1263 2N2.1\";\r\nby inserting after the line referenced to 15 U.S.C. § 1990c the following:\r\n\"15 U.S.C. § 2068 2N2.1\";\r\nby inserting after the line referenced to 16 U.S.C. § 773g the following:\r\n\"16 U.S.C. § 825f(c) 2J1.1, 2J1.5\";\r\nby inserting after the line referenced to 18 U.S.C. § 115(b)(4) the following:\r\n\"18 U.S.C. § 117 2A6.2\";\r\n\r\nin the line referenced to 18 U.S.C. § 2280 by inserting \"2A6.1,\" after \"2A4.1,\";\r\nin the line referenced to 18 U.S.C. § 2332a by inserting \"2A6.1,\" before \"2K1.4\";\r\nby inserting after the line referenced to 18 U.S.C. § 2425 the following:\r\n\"18 U.S.C. § 2442 2H4.1\";\r\nin the line referenced to 26 U.S.C. § 7210 by inserting \", 2J1.5\" after \"2J1.1\";\r\nby striking the line referenced to 33 U.S.C. § 506 as follows:\r\n\"33 U.S.C. § 506 2J1.1\";\r\nin the line referenced to 33 U.S.C. § 1227(b) by inserting \", 2J1.5\" after \"2J1.1\";\r\nin the line referenced to 42 U.S.C. § 3611(f) by inserting \", 2J1.5\" after \"2J1.1\";\r\nby inserting after the line referenced to 47 U.S.C. § 223(b)(1)(A) the following:\r\n\"47 U.S.C. § 409(m) 2J1.1, 2J1.5\";\r\nin the line referenced to 49 U.S.C. § 14909 by inserting \", 2J1.5\" after \"2J1.1\";\r\nin the line referenced to 49 U.S.C. § 16104 by inserting \", 2J1.5\" after \"2J1.1\";\r\nand by inserting after the line referenced to 50 U.S.C. § 783(c) the following:\r\n\"50 U.S.C. App. § 527(e) 2X5.2\".","Reason":"Reason for Amendment: This multi-part amendment responds to miscellaneous issues\r\narising from legislation recently enacted and other miscellaneous guideline application\r\nissues.\r\nFirst, the amendment amends Appendix A (Statutory Index) to include offenses created by\r\nthe Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008, Pub. L. 110–289, and other offenses\r\nsimilar to those offenses, as follows:\r\n(1) The new offense at 12 U.S.C. § 4636b is referenced to §2B1.1 (Larceny,\r\nEmbezzlement, and Other Forms of Theft; Offenses Involving Stolen Property;\r\nProperty Damage or Destruction; Fraud and Deceit; Forgery; Offenses Involving\r\nAltered or Counterfeit Instruments Other than Counterfeit Bearer Obligations of the\r\nUnited States). The similar existing offense at 12 U.S.C. § 1818(j) is also referenced\r\nto §2B1.1. These offenses are similar to economic crimes and are best accounted\r\nfor by §2B1.1.\r\n(2) The new offense at 12 U.S.C. § 4641 is referenced to §2J1.1 (Contempt) and §2J1.5\r\n(Failure to Appear by Material Witness); similar existing offenses (2 U.S.C. §§ 192,\r\n390; 7 U.S.C. § 87f(e); 12 U.S.C. §§ 1844(f), 2273, 3108(b)(6); 15 U.S.C. §§\r\n\r\n78u(c), 80a-41(c), 80b-9(c), 717m(d); 16 U.S.C. § 825f(c); 26 U.S.C. § 7210; 33\r\nU.S.C. § 1227(b); 42 U.S.C. § 3611; 47 U.S.C. § 409(m); 49 U.S.C. §§ 14909,\r\n16104) are also referenced to §2J1.1 and §2J1.5. Contempt offenses can involve\r\na range of conduct. The Commission determined that referencing these offenses to\r\nboth §2J1.1 and §2J1.5 will best account for the range of conduct involved.\r\nAnother similar offense, 33 U.S.C. § 506, is deleted from Appendix A (Statutory\r\nIndex) because it has been repealed.\r\nSecond, the amendment amends Appendix A (Statutory Index) to include offenses upgraded\r\nfrom misdemeanors to felonies by the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008,\r\nPub. L. 110–314. These offenses (15 U.S.C. §§ 1192, 1197(b), 1202(c), 1263, 2068) are\r\nreferenced to §2N2.1 (Violations of Statutes and Regulations Dealing With Any Food, Drug,\r\nBiological Product, Device, Cosmetic, or Agricultural Product). These offenses cover a\r\nrange of conduct (from paperwork violations to making or selling a nonconforming product)\r\nand a range of mental states (from strict liability to knowing, willful, or intentional\r\nmisconduct). The Commission determined that these offenses are similar to offenses\r\nreferenced to §2N2.1, which has provisions to account for aggravating and mitigating\r\ncircumstances that may be involved in such offenses. Technical and conforming changes\r\nare also made to indicate that §2N2.1 covers consumer product safety offenses.\r\nThird, the amendment amends Appendix A (Statutory Index) to include an offense created\r\nby the Veterans’ Benefits Improvement Act of 2008, Pub. L. 110–389. The new offense, 50\r\nU.S.C. App. § 527(e), is a Class A misdemeanor and, accordingly, is referenced to §2X5.2\r\n(Class A Misdemeanors (Not Covered by Another Specific Offense Guideline)). The\r\namendment also references 10 U.S.C. § 987(f), a similar Class A misdemeanor, to §2X5.2.\r\nFourth, the amendment amends Appendix A (Statutory Index) to include an offense created\r\nby the Violence Against Women and Department of Justice Reauthorization Act of 2005,\r\nPub. L. 109–162. The offense, 18 U.S.C. § 117, covers domestic assault by a person with\r\ntwo or more prior convictions for domestic assault offenses. It is similar to the offenses\r\nreferenced to §2A6.2 (Stalking or Domestic Violence) and, therefore, is referenced to that\r\nguideline.\r\nFifth, the amendment amends Appendix A (Statutory Index) to include an offense created\r\nby the Child Soldiers Accountability Act of 2008, Pub. L. 110–340. The offense, 18 U.S.C.\r\n§ 2442, is referenced to §2H4.1 (Peonage, Involuntary Servitude, and Slave Trade). The\r\noffenses currently indexed to §2H4.1 include five offenses that relate to illegal use of an\r\nindividual’s labor and have the same statutory maximum term of imprisonment as the new\r\nchild soldiers offense (20 years imprisonment or, if death results, life). Likewise, §2H4.1\r\nhas provisions to account for aggravating and mitigating circumstances that may be involved\r\nin a child soldiers offense. Technical and conforming changes are also made to indicate that\r\n§2H4.1 applies to the new offense.\r\nSixth, the amendment makes changes throughout the Guidelines Manual to reflect the\r\namendments made by the Judicial Administration and Technical Amendments Act of 2008,\r\nPub. L. 110–406, to the probation and supervised release statutes (18 U.S.C. §§ 3563, 3583).\r\nThe changes include a new guideline for intermittent confinement at §5F1.8 (Intermittent\r\nConfinement) that parallels the statutory language, as well as technical and conforming\r\n\r\nchanges. These changes conform the Guidelines Manual to reflect what Congress has\r\nprovided.\r\nSeventh, the amendment responds to the Let Our Veterans Rest in Peace Act of 2008, Pub.\r\nL. 110–384, which directed the Commission to review and, if appropriate, amend the\r\nguidelines to \"provide adequate sentencing enhancements\" for any offense involving\r\n\"desecration, theft, or trafficking\" in a veteran’s grave marker. There is a specific offense\r\ncharacteristic at subsection (b)(6) of §2B1.1 for damage, destruction, or theft of a veteran’s\r\ngrave marker. The amendment amends this specific offense characteristic so that it also\r\ncovers trafficking in a veteran’s grave marker.\r\nEighth, the amendment makes changes in the child pornography guidelines, §2G2.1\r\n(Sexually Exploiting a Minor by Production of Sexually Explicit Visual or Printed Material;\r\nCustodian Permitting Minor to Engage in Sexually Explicit Conduct; Advertisement for\r\nMinors to Engage in Production) and §2G2.2 (Trafficking in Material Involving the Sexual\r\nExploitation of a Minor; Receiving, Transporting, Shipping, Soliciting, or Advertising\r\nMaterial Involving the Sexual Exploitation of a Minor; Possessing Material Involving the\r\nSexual Exploitation of a Minor with Intent to Traffic; Possessing Material Involving the\r\nSexual Exploitation of a Minor), so that they reflect the amendments made to the child\r\npornography statutes (18 U.S.C. §§ 2251 et seq.) by the Effective Child Pornography\r\nProsecution Act of 2007, Pub. L. 110–358, and the PROTECT Our Children Act of 2008,\r\nPub. L. 110–401. The changes relate primarily to cases in which child pornography is\r\ntransmitted over the Internet. Under the amendment, where the guidelines refer to the\r\npurpose of producing a visual depiction, they will also refer to the purpose of transmitting\r\na live visual depiction; where the guidelines refer to possessing material, they will also refer\r\nto accessing with intent to view the material. The amendment also amends the child\r\npornography guidelines so that the term \"distribution\" includes \"transmission\", and the term\r\n\"material\" includes any visual depiction, as now defined by 18 U.S.C. § 2256 (i.e., to include\r\ndata which is capable of conversion into a visual image that has been transmitted by any\r\nmeans, whether or not stored in a permanent format). These changes conform the child\r\npornography guidelines to reflect what Congress has provided.\r\nNinth, the amendment amends Appendix A (Statutory Index) so that the threat guideline,\r\n§2A6.1 (Threatening or Harassing Communications; Hoaxes; False Liens), is included on\r\nthe list of guidelines to which 18 U.S.C. § 2280 and § 2332a are referenced. A person may\r\nbe charged and convicted of committing such an offense by threat. In such a case, §2A6.1\r\nmay be the most appropriate guideline.\r\nTenth, the amendment addresses subsection (a)(7) of 18 U.S.C. § 2252A, a new child\r\npornography offense created by the PROTECT Our Children Act of 2008, Pub. L. 110–401.\r\nThe offense makes it unlawful to knowingly produce with intent to distribute, or to\r\nknowingly distribute, \"child pornography that is an adapted or modified depiction of an\r\nidentifiable minor.\" A violator is subject to a maximum term of imprisonment of 15 years.\r\nThis offense is already referenced in Appendix A (Statutory Index) to the child pornography\r\ndistribution guideline, §2G2.2, by virtue of the fact that all offenses under section 2252A(a)\r\nare referenced to that guideline. The Commission determined that the distribution guideline\r\nis the appropriate guideline for this offense because distribution is a required element of this\r\noffense, in that the offender must either distribute the material or produce it with intent to\r\ndistribute. The distribution guideline also has provisions to account for aggravating and\r\n\r\nNovember 1, 2011 APPENDIX C - VOLUME III Amendment 734\r\nmitigating circumstances that may be involved in these offenses. The amendment provides\r\na base offense level of 18 for this offense, which is four levels lower than the base offense\r\nlevel for other child pornography distribution offenses referenced to §2G2.2. The\r\nCommission determined that the lower base offense level was appropriate for this offense\r\nbecause, unlike for other child pornography distribution offenses, the process of creating the\r\nimage does not involve the sexual exploitation of a child, and Congress provided a lower\r\npenalty structure for this offense (a maximum term of imprisonment of 15 years, and no\r\nmandatory minimum term of imprisonment) than for other child pornography distribution\r\noffenses (typically, a maximum term of imprisonment of 20 years and a mandatory minimum\r\nof 5 years). The lower base offense level also accounts for the fact that the enhancements\r\nat subsections (b)(3) (for distribution) and (b)(6) (for use of a computer) will likely apply in\r\nthese cases. Finally, to ensure that §2G2.2 treats material involving an adapted or modified\r\nimage in the same manner as it treats material involving any other form of child\r\npornography, the amendment provides a new Application Note to §2G2.2 to clarify that, if\r\nthe offense involved material that is an adapted or modified depiction of an identifiable\r\nminor, the term \"material involving the sexual exploitation of a minor\" includes such\r\nmaterial.","EffectiveDate":"Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2009."},{"Id":734,"Title":"Amendment 734","Text":"The Commentary to §3C1.3 captioned \"Application Note\" is amended in\r\nNote 1 by striking \"as adjusted\" and inserting \"including, as in any other case in which a\r\nChapter Three adjustment applies (see §1B1.1 (Application Instructions)), the adjustment\r\nprovided\"; and by adding at the end \"Similarly, if the applicable adjusted guideline range is\r\n30-37 months and the court determines a ‘total punishment’ of 30 months is appropriate, a\r\nsentence of 24 months for the underlying offense plus 6 months under 18 U.S.C. § 3147\r\nwould satisfy this requirement.\".","Reason":"Reason for Amendment: This amendment clarifies Application Note 1 in §3C1.3\r\n(Commission of Offense While on Release). Section 3C1.3 (formerly §2J1.7, see Appendix\r\nC to the Guidelines Manual, Amendment 684) provides a three-level adjustment if the\r\ndefendant is subject to the statutory enhancement at 18 U.S.C. § 3147—that is, if the\r\ndefendant has committed the underlying offense while on release. Application Note 1 to\r\n§3C1.3 states that, in order to comply with the statute’s requirement that a consecutive\r\nsentence be imposed, the sentencing court must \"divide the sentence on the judgment form\r\nbetween the sentence attributable to the underlying offense and the sentence attributable to\r\nthe enhancement.\"\r\nThe Second and Seventh Circuits have held that, according to the terms of Application Note\r\n2 to §2J1.7 (now Application Note 1 to §3C1.3), a sentencing court cannot apportion to the\r\nunderlying offense more than the maximum of the guideline range absent the three-level\r\nadjustment. See United States v. Confredo, 528 F.3d 143 (2d Cir. 2008); United States v.\r\nStevens, 66 F.3d 431 (2d Cir. 1995); United States v. Wilson, 966 F.2d 243 (7th Cir. 1992).\r\nThe amendment clarifies that the court determines the applicable guideline range for a\r\ndefendant who committed an offense while on release and is subject to the enhancement at\r\n18 U.S.C. § 3147 as in any other case. Therefore, under ordinary guideline application\r\nprinciples, only one guideline range applies to such a defendant. See §1B1.1 (Application\r\nInstructions) (instructing the sentencing court to, in this order: (1) determine the offense\r\n\r\nAmendment 735 APPENDIX C - VOLUME III November 1, 2010\r\nguideline applicable to the offense of conviction (the underlying offense); (2) determine the\r\nbase offense level and specific offense characteristics, and follow other instructions in\r\nChapter Two; (3) apply adjustments from Chapter Three; and, ultimately, (4) \"[d]etermine\r\nthe guideline range in Part A of Chapter Five that corresponds to the offense level and\r\ncriminal history category determined above\"). At that point, the court determines an\r\nappropriate \"total punishment\" using that applicable guideline range, and then divides the\r\ntotal sentence between the underlying offense and the section 3147 enhancement as the court\r\nconsiders appropriate.","EffectiveDate":"Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2009."},{"Id":735,"Title":"Amendment 735","Text":"Section 2B5.3(b)(5) is amended by inserting \"death or\" after \"risk of\"; and by\r\nstriking \"13\" and inserting \"14\" each place it appears.","Reason":"Reason for Amendment: This amendment responds to the Prioritizing Resources and\r\nOrganization for Intellectual Property Act of 2008, Pub. L. 110–403, which added two\r\nsentencing enhancements to violations of 18 U.S.C. § 2320 (Trafficking in counterfeit goods\r\nor services). Under those sentencing enhancements, if the offender causes or attempts to\r\ncause serious bodily injury, the statutory maximum term of imprisonment is increased from\r\n10 years to 20 years; if the offender causes or attempts to cause death, the statutory\r\nmaximum is increased to any term of years (or to life).\r\nThe amendment amends §2B5.3 (Criminal Infringement of Copyright or Trademark) at\r\nsubsection (b)(5) to clarify that the enhancement in that subsection, which applies when the\r\noffense involved the risk of serious bodily injury, also applies when the offense involved the\r\nrisk of death. This brings the language of that enhancement back into parallel with the\r\ncorresponding enhancement in subsection (b)(13) of §2B1.1 (Larceny, Embezzlement, and\r\nOther Forms of Theft; Offenses Involving Stolen Property; Property Damage or Destruction;\r\nFraud and Deceit; Forgery; Offenses Involving Altered or Counterfeit Instruments Other\r\nthan Counterfeit Bearer Obligations of the United States). The Commission envisioned,\r\nwhen it added the enhancement to §2B5.3, that paralleling the fraud guideline would\r\npromote proportionality. See Appendix C to the Guidelines Manual, Amendment 590 (\"The\r\nCommission determined that this kind of aggravating conduct in connection with\r\ninfringement cases should be treated under the guidelines in the same way it is treated in\r\nconnection with fraud cases; therefore, this enhancement is consistent with an identical\r\nprovision in the fraud guideline.\"). Accordingly, the amendment also increases the minimum\r\noffense level in §2B5.3(b)(5) from level 13 to level 14, bringing it back into parallel with the\r\nminimum offense level in §2B1.1(b)(13).","EffectiveDate":"Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2009."},{"Id":736,"Title":"Amendment 736","Text":"The Commentary to §1B1.8 captioned \"Application Notes\" is amended in\r\nNote 3 by striking \"(e)(6) (Inadmissibility of Pleas,\" and inserting \"(f) (Admissibility or\r\nInadmissibility of a Plea,\".\r\nThe Commentary to §2G2.1 captioned \"Statutory Provisions\" is amended by inserting\r\n\"(a)-(c), 2251(d)(1)(B)\" after \"2251\".\r\nThe Commentary to §2G2.2 captioned \"Statutory Provisions\" is amended by inserting \"(a)-\r\n\r\n(b)\" after \"2252A\".\r\nThe Commentary to §2G2.2 captioned \"Application Notes\" is amended in Note 1 in the\r\nparagraph that begins \"‘Sexual abuse\" by inserting \"(a)-(c), § 2251(d)(1)(B)\" after \"2251\".\r\nThe Commentary to §2G2.3 captioned \"Background\" is amended by striking \"twenty\" and\r\ninserting \"thirty\".\r\nSection 2G3.1(c)(1) is amended by inserting \"Soliciting,\" after \"Shipping,\"; and by striking\r\n\"Traffic) or §2G2.4 (Possession of Materials Depicting a Minor Engaged in Sexually\r\nExplicit Conduct), as appropriate.\" and inserting \"Traffic; Possessing Material Involving the\r\nSexual Exploitation of a Minor).\".\r\nThe Commentary to §2J1.1 captioned \"Application Notes\" is amended in Note 3 by striking\r\n\"(7)\" and inserting \"(8)\".\r\nThe Commentary to §4B1.2 captioned \"Application Notes\" is amended in Note 1 in the\r\nparagraph that begins \"Unlawfully possessing a listed\" by striking \"(d)\" and inserting \"(c)\".\r\nThe Commentary to §5C1.2 captioned \"Application Notes\" is amended in Note 8 by striking\r\n\"(c)(1), (3)\" and inserting \"(f), (i)\".\r\nThe Commentary to §5D1.2 captioned \"Background\" is amended by striking \"(b)\" and\r\ninserting \"(c)\".\r\nAppendix A (Statutory Index) is amended by inserting after the line referenced to 18 U.S.C.\r\n§ 2251(a),(b) the following:\r\n\"18 U.S.C. § 2251(c) 2G2.1\";\r\nin the line referenced to 18 U.S.C. § 2251(c)(1)(A) by striking \"(c)\" and inserting \"(d)\";\r\nin the line referenced to 18 U.S.C. § 2251(c)(1)(B) by striking \"(c)\" and inserting \"(d)\";\r\nin the line referenced to 18 U.S.C. § 2252A by inserting \"(a), (b)\" after \"2252A\";\r\nby inserting before the line referenced to 18 U.S.C. § 2252B the following:\r\n\"18 U.S.C. § 2252A(g) 2G2.6\";\r\nand in the line referenced to 42 U.S.C. § 3611(f) by striking \"(f)\" and inserting \"(c)\".","Reason":"Reason for Amendment: This multi-part amendment makes various technical and\r\nconforming changes to the guidelines.\r\nThe amendment addresses several cases in which the Guidelines Manual refers to a\r\nguideline, or to a statute or rule, but the reference has become incorrect or obsolete. First,\r\nit makes technical changes in §1B1.8 (Use of Certain Information) to address the fact that\r\nprovisions that had been contained in subsection (e)(6) of Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of\r\n\r\nCriminal Procedure are now contained in subsection (f) of that rule. Second, it makes a\r\ntechnical change in §2J1.1 (Contempt), Application Note 3, to address the fact that the\r\nprovision that had been contained in subsection (b)(7)(C) of §2B1.1 (Larceny,\r\nEmbezzlement, and Other Forms of Theft; Offenses Involving Stolen Property; Property\r\nDamage or Destruction; Fraud and Deceit; Forgery; Offenses Involving Altered or\r\nCounterfeit Instruments Other than Counterfeit Bearer Obligations of the United States)) is\r\nnow contained in subsection (b)(8)(C) of that guideline. Third, it makes a technical change\r\nin §4B1.2 (Definitions of Terms Used in Section 4B1.1), Application Note 1, to address the\r\nfact that the offense that had been contained in subsection (d)(1) of 21 U.S.C. § 841 is now\r\ncontained in subsection (c)(1) of that section. Fourth, it makes technical changes in §5C1.2\r\n(Limitation on Applicability of Statutory Minimum Sentences in Certain Cases), Application\r\nNote 8, to address the fact that subsections (c)(1) and (c)(3) of Rule 32 of the Federal Rules\r\nof Criminal Procedure are now contained in subsections (f) and (i) of that rule. Fifth, it\r\nmakes a technical change to the Commentary in §5D1.2 (Term of Supervised Release) to\r\naddress the fact that the provision that had been contained in subsection (b) of §5D1.2 is now\r\ncontained in subsection (c) of that guideline. Sixth, it makes a technical change in Appendix\r\nA (Statutory Index) to address the fact that the offense that had been contained in subsection\r\n(f) of 42 U.S.C. § 3611 is now contained in subsection (c) of that section.\r\nThe amendment also resolves certain technical issues that have arisen in the Guidelines\r\nManual with respect to child pornography offenses. First, it makes technical changes to the\r\nCommentary in §2G2.1 (Sexually Exploiting a Minor by Production of Sexually Explicit\r\nVisual or Printed Material; Custodian Permitting Minor to Engage in Sexually Explicit\r\nConduct; Advertisement for Minors to Engage in Production) to more accurately indicate\r\nwhich offenses under 18 U.S.C. § 2251 are referenced to §2G2.1. Second, it makes technical\r\nchanges to the Commentary in §2G2.2 (Trafficking in Material Involving the Sexual\r\nExploitation of a Minor; Receiving, Transporting, Shipping, Soliciting, or Advertising\r\nMaterial Involving the Sexual Exploitation of a Minor; Possessing Material Involving the\r\nSexual Exploitation of a Minor with Intent to Traffic; Possessing Material Involving the\r\nSexual Exploitation of a Minor) to address the fact that offenses under 18 U.S.C. § 2252A(g)\r\nare now covered by §2G2.6 (Child Exploitation Enterprises)(see Appendix C to the\r\nGuidelines Manual, Amendment 701), while offenses under section 2252A(a) and (b)\r\ncontinue to be covered by §2G2.2.

Fourth, it makes technical changes in\r\nsubsection (c)(1) of §2G3.1 (Importing, Mailing, or Transporting Obscene Matter;\r\nTransferring Obscene Matter to a Minor; Misleading Domain Names) to address the fact that\r\n§2G2.4 no longer exists, having been consolidated into §2G2.2 effective November 1, 2004\r\n(see Appendix C to the Guidelines Manual, Amendment 664). Fifth, it makes a technical\r\nchange in Appendix A (Statutory Index) to address the fact that the offenses that had been\r\ncontained in subsections (c)(1)(A) and (c)(1)(B) of 18 U.S.C. § 2251 are now contained in\r\nsubsections (d)(1)(A) and (d)(1)(B) of that section. In doing so, it also provides the\r\nappropriate reference for the offense that is now contained in subsection (c) of that section.\r\nSixth, it makes a technical change in Appendix A (Statutory Index) to address the fact that\r\noffenses under section 2252A(g) are now covered by §2G2.6, while offenses under section\r\n2252A(a) and (b) continue to be covered by §2G2.2.","EffectiveDate":"Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2009."},{"Id":737,"Title":"Amendment 737","Text":"The Commentary to §2A6.2 captioned \"Application Notes\" is amended in\r\nNote 4 in the second paragraph by striking \"2\" after \"Note\" and inserting \"3\".\r\nThe Commentary to §2B1.1 captioned \"Application Notes\", as amended by Amendment 726,\r\nis further amended in Note 1, in the paragraph that begins \"'Personal information' means\",\r\nby striking \"(i)\" and inserting \"(A)\";

The amendment provides a greater range of\r\nsentencing options to courts with respect to certain offenders by expanding Zones B and C\r\nof the Sentencing Table by one level each and addresses cases in which a departure from\r\nimprisonment to an alternative to incarceration (such as intermittent confinement,\r\ncommunity confinement, or home confinement) may be appropriate to accomplish a specific\r\ntreatment purpose.\r\nThe amendment is a result of the Commission’s continued multi-year study of alternatives\r\nto incarceration. The Commission initiated this study in recognition of increased interest in\r\nalternatives to incarceration by all three branches of government and renewed public debate\r\nabout the size of the federal prison population and the need for greater availability of\r\nalternatives to incarceration for certain nonviolent first offenders. See generally 28 U.S.C.\r\n§§ 994(g), (j).\r\nAs part of the study, the Commission held a two-day national symposium at which the\r\nCommission heard from experts on alternatives to incarceration, including federal and state\r\njudges, congressional staff, professors of law and the social sciences, corrections and\r\nalternative sentencing practitioners and specialists, federal and state prosecutors and defense\r\nattorneys, prison officials, and others involved in criminal justice. See United States\r\nSentencing Commission, Symposium on Alternatives to Incarceration (July 2008). In\r\nconsidering the amendment, the Commission also reviewed federal sentencing data, public\r\n\r\ncomment and testimony, recent scholarly literature, current federal and state practices, and\r\nfeedback in various forms from federal judges.\r\nFirst, the amendment expands Zones B and C of the Sentencing Table in Chapter Five.\r\nSpecifically, it expands Zone B by one level for each Criminal History Category (taking this\r\narea from Zone C), and expands Zone C by one level for each Criminal History Category\r\n(taking this area from Zone D). Accordingly, under the amendment, defendants in Zone C\r\nwith an applicable guideline range of 8-14 months or 9-15 months are moved to Zone B, and\r\ndefendants in Zone D with an applicable guideline range of 12-18 months are moved to Zone\r\nC. Conforming changes also are made to §§5B1.1 (Imposition of a Term of Probation) and\r\n5C1.1. In considering this one-level expansion, the Commission observed that\r\napproximately 42 percent of the Zone C offenders covered by the amendment and\r\napproximately 52 percent of the Zone D offenders covered by the amendment already\r\nreceive sentences below the applicable guideline range.\r\nThe Commission estimates that of the 71,054 offenders sentenced in fiscal year 2009 for\r\nwhich complete sentencing guideline application information is available, 1,565 offenders\r\nin Zone C, or 2.2 percent, would have been in Zone B of the Sentencing Table under the\r\namendment, and 2,734 offenders in Zone D, or 3.8 percent, would have been in Zone C. Not\r\nall of these offenders would have been eligible for an alternative to incarceration, however,\r\nbecause many were non-citizens who may have been subject to an immigration detainer and\r\nsome were statutorily prohibited from being sentenced to a term of probation, see, e.g., 18\r\nU.S.C. § 3561(a)(1) (prohibiting a defendant convicted of a Class A or Class B felony from\r\nbeing sentenced to a term of probation).\r\nAs a further reason for the zone expansion, Commission data indicate that courts often\r\nsentence offenders in Zone D with an applicable guideline range of 12-18 months to a term\r\nof imprisonment of 12 months and one day for the specific purpose of making such offenders\r\neligible for credit for satisfactory behavior while in prison. See 18 U.S.C. § 3624(b). For\r\nsuch an offender, assuming the maximum \"good time credit\" is earned, the sentence\r\neffectively becomes approximately ten and one-half months. Given that prior to the\r\namendment the highest guideline range in Zone C was 10-16 months, the Commission\r\ndetermined that offenders in Zone D with an applicable guideline range of 12-18 months,\r\nmany of whom effectively serve a sentence at the lower end of the highest Zone C\r\nsentencing range, should be included in Zone C.\r\nSecond, the amendment clarifies and illustrates certain cases in which a departure may be\r\nappropriate to accomplish a specific treatment purpose. Specifically, it amends an existing\r\ndeparture provision at §5C1.1 (Imposition of a Term of Imprisonment), Application Note 6.\r\nAs amended, the application note states that a departure from the sentencing options\r\nauthorized for Zone C of the Sentencing Table to accomplish a specific treatment purpose\r\nshould be considered only in cases where the court finds that (A) the defendant is an abuser\r\nof narcotics, other controlled substances, or alcohol, or suffers from a significant mental\r\nillness, and (B) the defendant's criminality is related to the treatment problem to be\r\naddressed.\r\nUnder the application note as amended, the court may depart from the sentencing options\r\nauthorized for Zone C (under which at least half the minimum term must be satisfied by\r\nimprisonment) to the sentencing options authorized for Zone B (under which all or most of\r\n\r\nNovember 1, 2011 APPENDIX C - VOLUME III Amendment 739\r\nthe minimum term may be satisfied by intermittent confinement, community confinement,\r\nor home detention instead of imprisonment) to accomplish a specific treatment purpose. The\r\napplication note also provides that, in determining whether such a departure is appropriate,\r\nthe court should consider, among other things, two factors relating to public safety: (1) the\r\nlikelihood that completion of the treatment program will successfully address the treatment\r\nproblem, thereby reducing the risk to the public from further crimes of the defendant, and\r\n(2) whether imposition of less imprisonment than required by Zone C will increase the risk\r\nto the public from further crimes of the defendant. Some public comment, testimony, and\r\nresearch suggested that successful completion of treatment programs may reduce recidivism\r\nrates and that, for some defendants, confinement at home or in the community instead of\r\nimprisonment may better address both the defendant's need for treatment and the need to\r\nprotect the public. Accordingly, the Commission amended the application note to clarify the\r\ncriteria and to provide examples of such cases.\r\nThe amendment also makes two other changes to the Commentary to §5C1.1 regarding the\r\nfactors to be considered in determining whether to impose an alternative to incarceration.\r\nThe amendment adds an application note providing that, in a case in which community\r\nconfinement in a residential treatment program is imposed to accomplish a specific treatment\r\npurpose, the court should consider the effectiveness of the treatment program. The\r\namendment also deletes as unnecessary the second sentence of Application Note 7.","EffectiveDate":"Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2010."},{"Id":739,"Title":"Amendment 739","Text":"Chapter Five, Part H, is amended in the Introductory Commentary by striking\r\nthe first paragraph as follows:\r\n\" The following policy statements address the relevance of certain offender\r\ncharacteristics to the determination of whether a sentence should be outside the\r\napplicable guideline range and, in certain cases, to the determination of a sentence\r\nwithin the applicable guideline range. Under 28 U.S.C. § 994(d), the Commission\r\nis directed to consider whether certain specific offender characteristics ‘have any\r\nrelevance to the nature, extent, place of service, or other incidents of an appropriate\r\nsentence’ and to take them into account only to the extent they are determined to be\r\nrelevant by the Commission.\",\r\nand inserting the following:\r\n\" This Part addresses the relevance of certain specific offender characteristics\r\nin sentencing. The Sentencing Reform Act (the ‘Act’) contains several provisions\r\nregarding specific offender characteristics:\r\nFirst, the Act directs the Commission to ensure that the guidelines and\r\npolicy statements ‘are entirely neutral’ as to five characteristics – race, sex,\r\nnational origin, creed, and socioeconomic status. See 28 U.S.C. § 994(d).\r\nSecond, the Act directs the Commission to consider whether eleven specific\r\noffender characteristics, ‘among others’, have any relevance to the nature,\r\nextent, place of service, or other aspects of an appropriate sentence, and to\r\ntake them into account in the guidelines and policy statements only to the\r\n\r\nextent that they do have relevance. See 28 U.S.C. § 994(d).\r\nThird, the Act directs the Commission to ensure that the guidelines and\r\npolicy statements, in recommending a term of imprisonment or length of a\r\nterm of imprisonment, reflect the ‘general inappropriateness’ of considering\r\nfive of those characteristics – education; vocational skills; employment\r\nrecord; family ties and responsibilities; and community ties. See 28 U.S.C.\r\n§ 994(e).\r\nFourth, the Act also directs the sentencing court, in determining the\r\nparticular sentence to be imposed, to consider, among other factors, ‘the\r\nhistory and characteristics of the defendant’. See 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(1).\r\nSpecific offender characteristics are taken into account in the guidelines in\r\nseveral ways. One important specific offender characteristic is the defendant’s\r\ncriminal history, see 28 U.S.C. § 994(d)(10), which is taken into account in the\r\nguidelines in Chapter Four (Criminal History and Criminal Livelihood). See §5H1.8\r\n(Criminal History). Another specific offender characteristic in the guidelines is the\r\ndegree of dependence upon criminal history for a livelihood, see 28 U.S.C. §\r\n994(d)(11), which is taken into account in Chapter Four, Part B (Career Offenders\r\nand Criminal Livelihood). See §5H1.9 (Dependence upon Criminal Activity for a\r\nLivelihood). Other specific offender characteristics are accounted for elsewhere in\r\nthis manual. See, e.g., §§2C1.1(a)(1) and 2C1.2(a)(1) (providing alternative base\r\noffense levels if the defendant was a public official); 3B1.3 (Abuse of Position of\r\nTrust or Use of Special Skill); and 3E1.1 (Acceptance of Responsibility).\r\nThe Supreme Court has emphasized that the advisory guideline system\r\nshould ‘continue to move sentencing in Congress’ preferred direction, helping to\r\navoid excessive sentencing disparities while maintaining flexibility sufficient to\r\nindividualize sentences where necessary.’ See United States v. Booker, 543 U.S.\r\n220, 264-65 (2005). Although the court must consider ‘the history and\r\ncharacteristics of the defendant’ among other factors, see 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a), in\r\norder to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities the court should not give them\r\nexcessive weight. Generally, the most appropriate use of specific offender\r\ncharacteristics is to consider them not as a reason for a sentence outside the\r\napplicable guideline range but for other reasons, such as in determining the sentence\r\nwithin the applicable guideline range, the type of sentence (e.g., probation or\r\nimprisonment) within the sentencing options available for the applicable Zone on\r\nthe Sentencing Table, and various other aspects of an appropriate sentence. To\r\navoid unwarranted sentencing disparities among defendants with similar records\r\nwho have been found guilty of similar conduct, see 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(6), 28\r\nU.S.C. § 991(b)(1)(B), the guideline range, which reflects the defendant’s criminal\r\nconduct and the defendant’s criminal history, should continue to be ‘the starting\r\npoint and the initial benchmark.’ Gall v. United States, 552 U.S. 38, 49 (2007).\r\nAccordingly, the purpose of this Part is to provide sentencing courts with\r\na framework for addressing specific offender characteristics in a reasonably\r\nconsistent manner. Using such a framework in a uniform manner will help ‘secure\r\n\r\nnationwide consistency,’ see Gall v. United States, 552 U.S. 38, 49 (2007), ‘avoid\r\nunwarranted sentencing disparities,’ see 28 U.S.C. § 991(b)(1)(B), 18 U.S.C. §\r\n3553(a)(6), ‘provide certainty and fairness,’ see 28 U.S.C. § 991(b)(1)(B), and\r\n‘promote respect for the law,’ see 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(2)(A).\r\nThis Part allocates specific offender characteristics into three\r\ngeneral categories.\r\nIn the first category are specific offender characteristics the consideration\r\nof which Congress has prohibited (e.g., §5H1.10 (Race, Sex, National Origin, Creed,\r\nReligion, and Socio-Economic Status)) or that the Commission has determined\r\nshould be prohibited.\r\nIn the second category are specific offender characteristics that Congress\r\ndirected the Commission to take into account in the guidelines only to the extent that\r\nthey have relevance to sentencing. See 28 U.S.C. § 994(d). For some of these, the\r\npolicy statements indicate that these characteristics may be relevant in determining\r\nwhether a sentence outside the applicable guideline range is warranted (e.g., age;\r\nmental and emotional condition; physical condition). These characteristics may\r\nwarrant a sentence outside the applicable guideline range if the characteristic,\r\nindividually or in combination with other such characteristics, is present to an\r\nunusual degree and distinguishes the case from the typical cases covered by the\r\nguidelines.

The Commission expects, and the\r\nSentencing Reform Act contemplates, that continuing research, experience, and\r\nanalysis will result in modifications and revisions.\r\nThe nature, extent, and significance of specific offender characteristics can\r\ninvolve a range of considerations. The Commission will continue to provide\r\ninformation to the courts on the relevance of specific offender characteristics in\r\nsentencing, as the Sentencing Reform Act contemplates. See, e.g., 28 U.S.C. §\r\n995(a)(12)(A) (the Commission serves as a ‘clearinghouse and information center’\r\non federal sentencing). Among other things, this may include information on the\r\nuse of specific offender characteristics, individually and in combination, in\r\ndetermining the sentence to be imposed (including, where available, information on\r\nrates of use, criteria for use, and reasons for use); the relationship, if any, between\r\nspecific offender characteristics and (A) the ‘forbidden factors’ specified in 28\r\nU.S.C. § 994(d) and (B) the ‘discouraged factors’ specified in 28 U.S.C. § 994(e);\r\nand the relationship, if any, between specific offender characteristics and the\r\nstatutory purposes of sentencing.\".\r\nSection 5H1.1 is amended by striking the first sentence as follows:\r\n\"Age (including youth) is not ordinarily relevant in determining whether a departure\r\nis warranted.\",\r\nand inserting the following:\r\n\"Age (including youth) may be relevant in determining whether a departure is\r\nwarranted, if considerations based on age, individually or in combination with other\r\noffender characteristics, are present to an unusual degree and distinguish the case\r\nfrom the typical cases covered by the guidelines.\".\r\nSection 5H1.3 is amended by striking the first paragraph as follows:\r\n\"Mental and emotional conditions are not ordinarily relevant in determining whether\r\na departure is warranted, except as provided in Chapter Five, Part K, Subpart 2\r\n(Other Grounds for Departure).\",\r\nand inserting the following:\r\n\"Mental and emotional conditions may be relevant in determining whether a\r\ndeparture is warranted, if such conditions, individually or in combination with other\r\noffender characteristics, are present to an unusual degree and distinguish the case\r\nfrom the typical cases covered by the guidelines.

The amendment is a\r\nresult of a review of the departure provisions in the Guidelines Manual begun by the\r\nCommission this year. See 74 Fed. Reg. 46478, 46479 (September 9, 2009). The\r\nCommission undertook this review, in part, in response to an observed decrease in reliance\r\non departure provisions in the Guidelines Manual in favor of an increased use of variances.\r\nFirst, the amendment revises the introductory commentary to Chapter Five, Part H. As\r\n\r\namended, the introductory commentary explains that the purpose of Part H is to provide\r\nsentencing courts with a framework for addressing specific offender characteristics in a\r\nreasonably consistent manner. Using such a framework in a uniform manner will help\r\n\"secure nationwide consistency,\" Gall v. United States, 552 U.S. 38, 49 (2007), \"avoid\r\nunwarranted sentencing disparities,\" 28 U.S.C. § 991(b)(1)(B), and \"promote respect for the\r\nlaw,\" 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(2)(A).\r\nAccordingly, the amended introductory commentary outlines three categories of specific\r\noffender characteristics described in the Sentencing Reform Act and the statutory and\r\nguideline standards that apply to consideration of each category. Courts must consider \"the\r\nhistory and characteristics of the defendant\" among other factors. See 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a).\r\nHowever, in order to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities, see 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(6),\r\n28 U.S.C. § 991(b)(1)(B), courts should not give specific offender characteristics excessive\r\nweight. The guideline range, which reflects the defendant’s criminal conduct and the\r\ndefendant’s criminal history, should continue to be \"the starting point and the initial\r\nbenchmark.\" Gall, supra, at 49.\r\nThe amended introductory commentary also states that the Commission will continue to\r\nprovide information to the courts on the relevance of specific offender characteristics in\r\nsentencing, as contemplated by the Sentencing Reform Act. See, e.g., 28 U.S.C. §\r\n995(a)(12)(A). The Commission expects that providing such information on an ongoing\r\nbasis will promote nationwide consistency in the consideration of specific offender\r\ncharacteristics by courts and help avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities.\r\nSecond, the amendment amends several policy statements that cover specific offender\r\ncharacteristics addressed in 28 U.S.C. § 994(d): §§5H1.1 (Age), 5H1.3 (Mental and\r\nEmotional Conditions), and 5H1.4 (Physical Condition, Including Drug or Alcohol\r\nDependence or Abuse; Gambling Addiction). As amended, these policy statements generally\r\nprovide that age; mental and emotional conditions; and physical condition or appearance,\r\nincluding physique, \"may be relevant in determining whether a departure is warranted, if [the\r\noffender characteristic], individually or in combination with other offender characteristics,\r\nis present to an unusual degree and distinguishes the case from the typical cases covered by\r\nthe guidelines.\" The Commission adopted this departure standard after reviewing recent\r\nfederal sentencing data, trial and appellate court case law, scholarly literature, public\r\ncomment and testimony, and feedback in various forms from federal judges.\r\nThe amendment also amends §§5H1.3 and 5H1.4 to provide that in certain cases described\r\nin Application Note 6 to §5C1.1 (Imposition of a Term of Imprisonment) a departure may\r\nbe appropriate.\r\nThird, the amendment amends §5H1.11 (Military, Civic, Charitable, or Public Service;\r\nEmployment-Related Contributions; Record of Prior Good Works) to draw a distinction\r\nbetween military service and the other circumstances covered by that policy statement. As\r\namended, the policy statement provides that military service \"may be relevant in determining\r\nwhether a departure is warranted, if the military service, individually or in combination with\r\nother offender characteristics, is present to an unusual degree and distinguishes the case\r\nfrom the typical cases covered by the guidelines\". The Commission determined that\r\napplying this departure standard to consideration of military service is appropriate\r\n\r\nNovember 1, 2011 APPENDIX C - VOLUME III Amendment 740\r\nbecause such service has been recognized as a traditional mitigating factor at sentencing.\r\nSee, e.g., Porter v. McCollum, 130 S. Ct. 447, 455 (2009) (\"Our Nation has a long tradition\r\nof according leniency to veterans in recognition of their service, especially for those who\r\nfought on the front lines . . . .\").\r\nFinally, the amendment makes conforming changes to §5K2.0 (Grounds for Departure).","EffectiveDate":"Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2010."},{"Id":740,"Title":"Amendment 740","Text":"The Commentary to §2L1.2 captioned \"Application Notes\" is amended in\r\nNote 7 by striking \"Consideration\" and inserting \"Based on Seriousness of a Prior\r\nConviction\".\r\nThe Commentary to §2L1.2 captioned \"Application Notes\" is amended by adding at the end\r\nthe following:\r\n\"8. Departure Based on Cultural Assimilation.—There may be cases in which\r\na downward departure may be appropriate on the basis of cultural\r\nassimilation. Such a departure should be considered only in cases where\r\n(A) the defendant formed cultural ties primarily with the United States from\r\nhaving resided continuously in the United States from childhood, (B) those\r\ncultural ties provided the primary motivation for the defendant’s illegal\r\nreentry or continued presence in the United States, and (C) such a departure\r\nis not likely to increase the risk to the public from further crimes of the\r\ndefendant.\r\nIn determining whether such a departure is appropriate, the court should\r\nconsider, among other things, (1) the age in childhood at which the\r\ndefendant began residing continuously in the United States, (2) whether and\r\nfor how long the defendant attended school in the United States, (3) the\r\nduration of the defendant’s continued residence in the United States, (4) the\r\nduration of the defendant’s presence outside the United States, (5) the\r\nnature and extent of the defendant’s familial and cultural ties inside the\r\nUnited States, and the nature and extent of such ties outside the United\r\nStates, (6) the seriousness of the defendant’s criminal history, and (7)\r\nwhether the defendant engaged in additional criminal activity after illegally\r\nreentering the United States.\".","Reason":"Reason for Amendment: This amendment addresses when a downward departure may\r\nbe appropriate in an illegal reentry case sentenced under §2L1.2 (Unlawfully Entering or\r\nRemaining in the United States) on the basis of the defendant’s cultural assimilation to the\r\nUnited States.\r\nSeveral circuits have upheld departures based on cultural assimilation. See, e.g., United\r\nStates v. Rodriguez-Montelongo, 263 F.3d 429, 433 (5th Cir. 2001); United States v.\r\nSanchez-Valencia, 148 F.3d 1273, 1274 (11th Cir. 1998); United States v. Lipman, 133 F.3d\r\n726, 730 (9th Cir. 1998). Other circuits have declined to rule on whether such a departure\r\nmay be warranted. See, e.g., United States v. Galarza-Payan, 441 F.3d 885, 889 (10th Cir.\r\n2006) (\"We need not address that debate in the altered post-Booker landscape.\"); United\r\n\r\nStates v. Melendez-Torres, 420 F.3d 45, 51 n.3 (1st Cir. 2005); see also United States v.\r\nTicas, 219 F. App’x 44, 45 (2d Cir. 2007) (acknowledging that the Second Circuit has never\r\nrecognized cultural assimilation as a basis for a downward departure). Some circuits, though\r\nnot foreclosing the possibility of cultural assimilation departures, have stated that district\r\ncourts are within their discretion to deny such departures in light of a defendant’s criminal\r\npast and society’s increased interest in \"keeping aliens who have committed crimes out of\r\nthe United States following their deportation.\" United States v. Roche-Martinez, 467 F.3d\r\n591, 595 (7th Cir. 2006); see also Galarza-Payan, supra, at 889-90 (stating that \"in assessing\r\nthe reasonableness of a sentence [] a particular defendant's cultural ties must be weighed\r\nagainst other factors such as (1) sentencing disparities among defendants with similar\r\nbackgrounds and characteristics, and (2) the need for the sentence to reflect the seriousness\r\nof the crime and promote respect for the law\").\r\nIn order to promote uniform consideration of cultural assimilation by courts, the amendment\r\nadds an application note to §2L1.2 providing that a downward departure may be appropriate\r\non the basis of cultural assimilation. The application note provides that such a departure may\r\nbe appropriate if (A) the defendant formed cultural ties primarily with the United States from\r\nhaving resided continuously in the United States from childhood, (B) those cultural ties\r\nprovided the primary motivation for the defendant's illegal reentry or continued presence in\r\nthe United States, and (C) such a departure is not likely to increase the risk to the public from\r\nfurther crimes of the defendant.

See United\r\nStates v. Dixon, 449 F.3d 194, 203-04 (1st Cir. 2006) (court must consider \"any applicable\r\ndepartures\"); United States v.

These other factors remain included in the criminal history\r\nscore after the amendment.\r\nThe amendment is a result of the Commission’s continued review of criminal history issues.\r\nThis multi-year review was prompted in part because criminal history issues are often cited\r\nby sentencing courts as reasons for imposing non-government sponsored below range\r\nsentences, particularly in cases in which recency points were added to the criminal history\r\nscore under §4A1.1(e).\r\nAs part of its review, the Commission undertook analyses to determine the extent to which\r\nrecency points contribute to the ability of the criminal history score to predict the\r\n\r\ndefendant’s risk of recidivism. See generally USSG Ch. 4, Pt. A, intro. comment (\"To\r\nprotect the public from further crimes of the particular defendant, the likelihood of\r\nrecidivism and future criminal behavior must be considered.\"). Recent research isolating the\r\neffect of §4A1.1(e) on the predictive ability of the criminal history score indicated that\r\nconsideration of recency only minimally improves the predictive ability.\r\nIn addition, the Commission received public comment and testimony suggesting that the\r\nrecency of the instant offense to the defendant’s release from imprisonment does not\r\nnecessarily reflect increased culpability.

L. 111–84) (the \"Act\"). The Act\r\ncreated two new offenses and amended a 1994 directive to the Commission regarding crimes\r\nmotivated by hate.\r\nThe first new offense, 18 U.S.C. § 249 (Hate crime acts), makes it unlawful, whether or not\r\nacting under color of law, to willfully cause bodily injury to any person or, through the use\r\nof fire, a firearm, a dangerous weapon, or an explosive or incendiary device, to attempt to\r\ncause bodily injury to any person because of the actual or perceived race, color, religion,\r\nnational origin, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability of any person. A\r\nperson who violates 18 U.S.C. § 249 is subject to a term of imprisonment of up to 10 years\r\nor, if the offense includes kidnapping, aggravated sexual abuse, or an attempt to kill, or if\r\ndeath results from the offense, to imprisonment for any term of years or life. The\r\namendment amends Appendix A (Statutory Index) to refer offenses under 18 U.S.C. § 249\r\nto §2H1.1 (Offenses Involving Individual Rights) because that guideline covers similar\r\noffenses, e.g., 18 U.S.C. §§ 241 (Conspiracy against rights) and 242 (Deprivation of rights\r\nunder color of law), and contains appropriate enhancements to account for aggravating\r\ncircumstances that may be involved in a section 249 offense, e.g., subsection (b)(1), which\r\nprovides a 6-level increase if the offense was committed under color of law.\r\nThe Act also amended section 280003 of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement\r\nAct of 1994 (Pub. L. 103–322; 28 U.S.C. § 994 note), which contains a directive to the\r\nCommission regarding hate crimes. The Commission implemented that directive by\r\npromulgating subsection (a) of §3A1.1 (Hate Crime Motivation or Vulnerable Victim). See\r\nUSSG App. C, Amendment 521 (effective November 1, 1995). The Act broadened the\r\ndefinition of \"hate crime\" in section 280003(a) to include crimes motivated by actual or\r\nperceived \"gender identity\", which has the effect of expanding the scope of the directive in\r\nsection 280003(b) so that it now requires the Commission to provide an enhancement for\r\ncrimes motivated by actual or perceived \"gender identity\". To reflect the broadened\r\ndefinition, the amendment amends §3A1.1 so that the enhancement in subsection (a) covers\r\ncrimes motivated by actual or perceived \"gender identity\" and makes conforming changes\r\nto §§2H1.1. The amendment also deletes as unnecessary the parenthetical in the Background\r\nto §3A1.1, which provided an example of \"hate crime motivation\".\r\nThe second new offense, 18 U.S.C. § 1389 (Prohibition on attacks on United States\r\nservicemen on account of service), makes it unlawful to knowingly assault or batter a United\r\nStates serviceman or an immediate family member of a United States serviceman, or to\r\nknowingly destroy or injure the property of such serviceman or immediate family member,\r\non the account of the military service of that serviceman or the status of that individual as\r\na United States serviceman. A person who violates 18 U.S.C. § 1389 is subject to a term of\r\n\r\nimprisonment of not more than 2 years in the case of a simple assault, or damage of not more\r\nthan $500, of not more than 5 years in the case of damage of more than $500, or of not less\r\nthan 6 months nor more than 10 years in the case of a battery, or an assault resulting in\r\nbodily injury. The Commission determined that offenses under 18 U.S.C. § 1389 are similar\r\nto offenses involving assault or property damage that are already referenced to §§2A2.2\r\n(Aggravated Assault), 2A2.3 (Minor Assault), and 2B1.1 (Theft, Property Destruction, and\r\nFraud) and therefore amended Appendix A (Statutory Index) to refer the new offense to\r\nthose guidelines.","EffectiveDate":"Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2010."},{"Id":744,"Title":"Amendment 744","Text":"Section 8B2.1(b)(4) is amended by striking \"subdivision\" and inserting\r\n\"subparagraph\" each place it appears.\r\nThe Commentary to §8B2.1 captioned \"Application Notes\" is amended in Note 2(D) by\r\nstriking \"subdivision\" and inserting \"subparagraph\".\r\nThe Commentary to §8B2.1 captioned \"Application Notes\" is amended by redesignating\r\nNote 6 as Note 7, and by inserting after Note 5 the following:\r\n\"6.

Subsection (b)(7) requires an organization, after criminal conduct\r\nhas been detected, to take reasonable steps (1) to respond appropriately to the criminal\r\n\r\nconduct and (2) to prevent further similar criminal conduct.\r\nThe new application note describes the two aspects of subsection (b)(7). With respect to the\r\nfirst aspect, the application note provides that the organization should take reasonable steps,\r\nas warranted under the circumstances, to remedy the harm resulting from the criminal\r\nconduct. The application note further provides that such steps may include, where\r\nappropriate, providing restitution to identifiable victims, other forms of remediation, and\r\nself-reporting and cooperation with authorities. With respect to the second aspect, the\r\napplication note provides that an organization should assess the compliance and ethics\r\nprogram and make modifications necessary to ensure the program is effective. The\r\napplication note further provides that such steps should be consistent with §8B2.1(b)(5) and\r\n(c), which also require assessment and modification of the program, and may include the use\r\nof an outside professional advisor to ensure adequate assessment and implementation of any\r\nmodifications.\r\nThis application note was added in response to public comment and testimony suggesting\r\nthat further guidance regarding subsection (b)(7) may encourage organizations to take\r\nreasonable steps upon discovery of criminal conduct. The steps outlined by the application\r\nnote are consistent with factors considered by enforcement agencies in evaluating\r\norganizational compliance and ethics practices.\r\nSecond, the amendment amends subsection (f) of §8C2.5 (Culpability Score) to create a\r\nlimited exception to the general prohibition against applying the 3-level decrease for having\r\nan effective compliance and ethics program when an organization’s high-level or substantial\r\nauthority personnel are involved in the offense. Specifically, the amendment adds subsection\r\n(f)(3)(C), which allows an organization to receive the decrease if the organization meets four\r\ncriteria: (1) the individual or individuals with operational responsibility for the compliance\r\nand ethics program have direct reporting obligations to the organization’s governing\r\nauthority or appropriate subgroup thereof; (2) the compliance and ethics program detected\r\nthe offense before discovery outside the organization or before such discovery was\r\nreasonably likely; (3) the organization promptly reported the offense to the appropriate\r\ngovernmental authorities; and (4) no individual with operational responsibility for the\r\ncompliance and ethics program participated in, condoned, or was willfully ignorant of the\r\noffense.\r\nThe new subsection (f)(3)(C) responds to concerns expressed in public comment and\r\ntestimony that the general prohibition in §8C2.5(f)(3) operates too broadly and that internal\r\nand external reporting of criminal conduct could be better encouraged by providing an\r\nexception to that general prohibition in appropriate cases.\r\nThe amendment also adds an application note that describes the \"direct reporting\r\nobligations\" necessary to meet the first criterion under §8C2.5(f)(3)(C). The application note\r\nprovides that an individual has \"direct reporting obligations\" if the individual has express\r\nauthority to communicate personally to the governing authority \"promptly on any matter\r\ninvolving criminal conduct or potential criminal conduct\" and \"no less than annually on the\r\nimplementation and effectiveness of the compliance and ethics program\". The application\r\nnote responds to public comment and testimony regarding the challenges operational\r\ncompliance personnel may face when seeking to report criminal conduct to the governing\r\nauthority of an organization and encourages compliance and ethics policies that\r\n\r\nNovember 1, 2011 APPENDIX C - VOLUME III Amendment 745\r\nprovide operational compliance personnel with access to the governing authority when\r\nnecessary.\r\nThird, the amendment amends §8D1.4 (Recommended Conditions of Probation –\r\nOrganizations (Policy Statement)) to augment and simplify the recommended conditions of\r\nprobation for organizations. The amendment removes the distinction between conditions of\r\nprobation imposed solely to enforce a monetary penalty and conditions of probation imposed\r\nfor any other reason so that all conditional probation terms are available for consideration\r\nby the court in determining an appropriate sentence.\r\nFinally, the amendment makes technical and conforming changes to various provisions in\r\nChapter Eight.","EffectiveDate":"Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2010."},{"Id":745,"Title":"Amendment 745","Text":"Section 2B1.1(c)(4) is amended by inserting \"or a paleontological resource\"\r\nafter \"resource\";

Section 2B1.1 includes an enhancement at subsection\r\n(b)(17)(B) that applies when specified persons who have fiduciary duties violate\r\ncommodities law. \"Commodities law\" is defined in Application Note 14 to mean the\r\nCommodities Exchange Act (7 U.S.C. § 1 et seq.), including the rules, regulations, and\r\norders issued by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. The amendment adds 18\r\nU.S.C. § 1348 to the definition of \"commodities law\" for purposes of subsection (b)(17)(B).\r\nThe Commission determined that including 18 U.S.C. § 1348 within the scope of subsection\r\n(b)(17)(B) is appropriate to reflect the expanded scope of the statute.\r\nSecond, the amendment responds to the Omnibus Public Land Management Act of 2009,\r\nPub.

The amendment amends Appendix A (Statutory Index) to refer\r\noffenses under 16 U.S.C. § 470aaa-5 to §§2B1.1 and 2B1.5 (Theft of, Damage to, or\r\nDestruction of, Cultural Heritage Resources; Unlawful Sale, Purchase, Exchange,\r\nTransportation, or Receipt of Cultural Heritage Resources) because such offenses are similar\r\neither to offenses involving cultural heritage resources or, to the extent they involve false\r\nrecords, to fraud offenses. The amendment also makes technical and conforming changes\r\nto §§2B1.1 and 2B1.5.\r\nThird, the amendment responds to the Children’s Health Insurance Program Reauthorization\r\nAct of 2009, Pub. L. 111–3, which created a new Class A misdemeanor offense at 42 U.S.C.\r\n§ 1396w-2 regarding the unlawful disclosure of certain protected information related to\r\nsocial security eligibility. The amendment amends Appendix A (Statutory Index) to refer\r\noffenses under 42 U.S.C. § 1396w-2 to §2H3.1 (Interception of Communications;\r\nEavesdropping; Disclosure of Certain Private or Protected Information) because such\r\noffenses involve invasions of privacy.\r\nFourth, the amendment responds to a regulatory change in which iodine was upgraded from\r\na List II chemical to a List I chemical.

statutory reference.\r\nSecond, the amendment makes a series of changes to the Guidelines Manual to promote\r\nstylistic consistency in how subdivisions are designated. When dividing guideline sections\r\ninto subdivisions, the guidelines generally follow the structure used by Congress to divide\r\nstatutory sections into subdivisions. Thus, a section is broken into subsections (starting with\r\n\"(a)\"), which are broken into paragraphs (starting with \"(1)\"), which are broken into\r\nsubparagraphs (starting with \"(A)\"), which are broken into clauses (starting with \"(i)\"),\r\nwhich are broken into subclauses (starting with \"(I)\"). For a generic term, \"subdivision\" is\r\nalso used. When dividing application notes into subdivisions, the guidelines generally\r\nfollow the same structure, except that subsections and paragraphs are not used; the first\r\nsubdivisions used are subparagraphs (starting with \"(A)\"). The amendment identifies places\r\nin the Guidelines Manual where these principles are not followed and brings them into\r\nconformity.","EffectiveDate":"Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2010."},{"Id":747,"Title":"Amendment 747","Text":"The Commentary to §2B1.1 captioned \"Application Notes\" is amended in\r\nNote 1 by inserting \"or Paleontological Resources\" after \"Resources\" both places it appears.\r\nThe Commentary to §2B1.1 captioned \"Application Notes\" is amended in Note 3 in the last\r\nparagraph by inserting \"or Paleontological Resources\" after \"Resources\"; by inserting \"or\r\npaleontological resource\" before \", loss\"; by striking \"cultural heritage\" after \"to that\" and\r\nby striking \"cultural heritage\" after \"of the\".\r\nThe Commentary to §2K1.3 captioned \"Application Notes\" is amended in Note 9 by striking\r\n\"; §4A1.2, comment.

Under the Drug\r\nEquivalency Tables in subdivision (E) of this note, 20 gm\r\nof cocaine base converts to 400 kg of marihuana (20 gm x\r\n20 kg = 400 kg), and 1.5 kg of cocaine converts to 300 kg\r\nof marihuana (1.5 kg x 200 gm = 300 kg), which, when\r\nadded to the 10 kg of marihuana results in a combined\r\nequivalent quantity of 710 kg of marihuana. Under the\r\nDrug Quantity Table, 710 kg of marihuana corresponds to\r\na combined offense level of 30, which is reduced by two\r\nlevels to level 28. For the cocaine and marihuana, their\r\ncombined equivalent quantity of 310 kg of marihuana\r\ncorresponds to a combined offense level of 26 under the\r\nDrug Quantity Table. Because the combined offense level\r\nfor all three drug types after the 2-level reduction is not\r\nless than the combined base offense level for the cocaine\r\nand marihuana, the combined offense level for all three\r\ndrug types remains level 28.\r\n(II) The case involves 5 gm of cocaine base and 6 kg of heroin.\r\nUnder the Drug Equivalency Tables in subdivision (E) of\r\nthis note, 5 gm of cocaine base converts to 100 kg of\r\nmarihuana (5 gm x 20 kg = 100 kg), and 6 kg of heroin\r\n\r\nconverts to 6,000 kg of marihuana (6,000 gm x 1 kg =\r\n6,000 kg), which, when added together results in a\r\ncombined equivalent quantity of 6,100 kg of marihuana.\r\nUnder the Drug Quantity Table, 6,100 kg of marihuana\r\ncorresponds to a combined offense level of 34, which is\r\nreduced by two levels to 32. For the heroin, the 6,000 kg\r\nof marihuana corresponds to an offense level 34 under the\r\nDrug Quantity Table. Because the combined offense level\r\nfor the two drug types after the 2-level reduction is less\r\nthan the offense level for the heroin, the reduction does not\r\napply and the combined offense level for the two drugs\r\nremains level 34.\";\r\nand by redesignating subdivision (E) as subdivision (D).\r\nThe Commentary to §2D1.1 captioned \"Application Notes\" is amended in Note 10(D), as\r\nredesignated by this amendment, in the table captioned \"Cocaine and Other Schedule I and\r\nII Stimulants (and their immediate precursors)*\" in the line referenced to Cocaine Base by\r\nstriking \"20 kg\" and inserting \"3,571 gm\".\r\nThe Commentary to §2D1.1 captioned \"Application Notes\" is amended in Note 18 by\r\nstriking \"(2)\" and inserting \"(3)\", and by striking \"(4)\" and inserting \"(5)\";\r\nin Note 19 by striking \"(10)\" and inserting \"(13)\" in both places;\r\nin Note 20 by striking \"(10)\" and inserting \"(13)\" in both places;\r\nin Note 21 by striking \"(11)\" and inserting \"(16)\" each place it appears;\r\nin Note 23 by striking \"(6)\" and inserting \"(7)\" each place it appears;\r\nin Note 25 by striking \"(7)\" and inserting \"(8)\" in both places;\r\nand in Note 26 by striking \"(8)\" and inserting \"(9)\" in both places.\r\nThe Commentary to §2D1.1 captioned \"Application Notes\" is amended by adding at the end\r\nthe following:\r\n\"27. Application of Subsection (b)(11).—Subsection (b)(11) does not apply if\r\nthe purpose of the bribery was to obstruct or impede the investigation,\r\nprosecution, or sentencing of the defendant. Such conduct is covered by\r\n§3C1.1 (Obstructing or Impeding the Administration of Justice) and, if\r\napplicable, §2D1.1(b)(14)(D).\r\n28. Application of Subsection (b)(12).—Subsection (b)(12) applies to a\r\ndefendant who knowingly maintains a premises (i.e., a ‘building, room, or\r\nenclosure,’ see §2D1.8, comment. (backg'd.)) for the purpose of\r\nmanufacturing or distributing a controlled substance.\r\n\r\nAmong the factors the court should consider in determining whether the\r\ndefendant ‘maintained’ the premises are (A) whether the defendant held a\r\npossessory interest in (e.g., owned or rented) the premises and (B) the\r\nextent to which the defendant controlled access to, or activities at, the\r\npremises.\r\nManufacturing or distributing a controlled substance need not be the sole\r\npurpose for which the premises was maintained, but must be one of the\r\ndefendant's primary or principal uses for the premises, rather than one of\r\nthe defendant's incidental or collateral uses for the premises. In making this\r\ndetermination, the court should consider how frequently the premises was\r\nused by the defendant for manufacturing or distributing a controlled\r\nsubstance and how frequently the premises was used by the defendant for\r\nlawful purposes.\r\n29. Application of Subsection (b)(14).—\r\n(A) Distributing to a Specified Individual or Involving Such an\r\nIndividual in the Offense (Subsection (b)(14)(B)).—If the\r\ndefendant distributes a controlled substance to an individual or\r\ninvolves an individual in the offense, as specified in subsection\r\n(b)(14)(B), the individual is not a ‘vulnerable victim’ for purposes\r\nof §3A1.1(b).\r\n(B) Directly Involved in the Importation of a Controlled Substance\r\n(Subsection (b)(14)(C)).—Subsection (b)(14)(C) applies if the\r\ndefendant is accountable for the importation of a controlled\r\nsubstance under subsection (a)(1)(A) of §1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct\r\n(Factors that Determine the Guideline Range)), i.e., the defendant\r\ncommitted, aided, abetted, counseled, commanded, induced,\r\nprocured, or willfully caused the importation of a controlled\r\nsubstance.\r\nIf subsection (b)(3) or (b)(5) applies, do not apply subsection\r\n(b)(14)(C).\r\n(C) Pattern of Criminal Conduct Engaged in as a Livelihood\r\n(Subsection (b)(14)(E)).—For purposes of subsection (b)(14)(E),\r\n‘pattern of criminal conduct’ and ‘engaged in as a livelihood’ have\r\nthe meaning given such terms in §4B1.3 (Criminal Livelihood).\".\r\nThe Commentary to §2D1.1 captioned \"Background\" is amended by inserting after the\r\nparagraph that begins \"For marihuana plants\" the following:\r\n\" The last sentence of subsection (a)(5) implements the directive to the\r\nCommission in section 7(1) of Public Law 111–220.\r\nSubsection (b)(2) implements the directive to the Commission in section 5\r\nof Public Law 111–220.\";\r\n\r\nin the paragraph that begins \"Specific Offense Characteristic\" by striking \"Specific Offense\r\nCharacteristic (b)(2)\" and inserting \"Subsection (b)(3)\";\r\nby inserting after the paragraph that begins \"The dosage weight\" the following:\r\n\" Subsection (b)(11) implements the directive to the Commission in section\r\n6(1) of Public Law 111–220.\r\nSubsection (b)(12) implements the directive to the Commission in section\r\n6(2) of Public Law 111–220.\";\r\nin the paragraph that begins \"Subsection (b)(10)(A)\" by striking \"(10)\" and inserting \"(13)\";\r\nin the paragraph that begins \"Subsections (b)(10)(C)(ii)\" by striking \"(10)\" and inserting\r\n\"(13)\";\r\nand by adding at the end the following:\r\n\" Subsection (b)(14) implements the directive to the Commission in section\r\n6(3) of Public Law 111–220.\r\nSubsection (b)(15) implements the directive to the Commission in section\r\n7(2) of Public Law 111–220.\".\r\nSection 2D1.14(a)(1) is amended by striking \"(11)\" and inserting \"(16)\".\r\nSection 2D2.1(b) is amended by striking \"References\" and inserting \"Reference\"; by striking\r\nsubdivision (1) as follows:\r\n\"(1) If the defendant is convicted of possession of more than 5 grams of a\r\nmixture or substance containing cocaine base, apply §2D1.1 (Unlawful\r\nManufacturing, Importing, Exporting, or Trafficking) as if the defendant\r\nhad been convicted of possession of that mixture or substance with intent\r\nto distribute.\";\r\nand by redesignating subdivision (2) as subdivision (1).\r\nThe Commentary to §2D2.1 captioned \"Background\" is amended by striking \"five\" and\r\ninserting \"three\"; and by striking the last paragraph as follows:\r\n\" Section 2D2.1(b)(1) provides a cross reference to §2D1.1 for possession of\r\nmore than five grams of a mixture or substance containing cocaine base, an offense\r\nsubject to an enhanced penalty under 21 U.S.C. § 844(a). Other cases for which\r\nenhanced penalties are provided under 21 U.S.C. § 844(a)(e.g., for a person with\r\none prior conviction, possession of more than three grams of a mixture or substance\r\ncontaining cocaine base; for a person with two or more prior convictions,\r\npossession of more than one gram of a mixture or substance containing cocaine\r\nbase) are to be sentenced in accordance with §5G1.1(b).\".\r\n\r\nSection 2K2.4 captioned \"Application Notes\" is amended in Note 4 by inserting after the\r\nfirst paragraph the following:\r\n\"A sentence under this guideline also accounts for conduct that would subject the\r\ndefendant to an enhancement under §2D1.1(b)(2) (pertaining to use of violence,\r\ncredible threat to use violence, or directing the use of violence). Do not apply that\r\nenhancement when determining the sentence for the underlying offense.\".\r\nThe Commentary to §3B1.4 captioned \"Application Notes\" is amended in Note 2 by adding\r\nat the end as the last sentence the following: \"For example, if the defendant receives an\r\nenhancement under §2D1.1(b)(14)(B) for involving an individual less than 18 years of age\r\nin the offense, do not apply this adjustment.\".\r\nThe Commentary to §3C1.1 captioned \"Application Notes\" is amended in Note 7 by adding\r\nat the end the following new paragraph:\r\n\"Similarly, if the defendant receives an enhancement under §2D1.1(b)(14)(D), do\r\nnot apply this adjustment.\".","Reason":"Reason for Amendment: This amendment implements the emergency directive in section\r\n8 of the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010, Pub. L. 111–220 (the \"Act\"). The Act reduced the\r\nstatutory penalties for cocaine base (\"crack cocaine\") offenses, eliminated the statutory\r\nmandatory minimum sentence for simple possession of crack cocaine, and contained\r\ndirectives requiring the Commission to review and amend the guidelines to account for\r\nspecified aggravating and mitigating circumstances in certain drug cases. The emergency\r\namendment authority provided in section 8 of the Act required the Commission to\r\npromulgate the guidelines, policy statements, or amendments provided for in the Act, and\r\nto make such conforming changes to the guidelines as the Commission determines necessary\r\nto achieve consistency with other guideline provisions and applicable law, not later than 90\r\ndays after the date of enactment of the Act.\r\nFirst, the amendment amends the Drug Quantity Table in §2D1.1 (Unlawful Manufacturing,\r\nImporting, Exporting, or Trafficking (Including Possession with Intent to Commit These\r\nOffenses); Attempt or Conspiracy) to account for the changes in the statutory penalties made\r\nin section 2 of the Act. Section 2 of the Act reduced the statutory penalties for offenses\r\ninvolving manufacturing or trafficking in crack cocaine by increasing the quantity thresholds\r\nrequired to trigger a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment. The quantity threshold\r\nrequired to trigger the 5-year mandatory minimum term of imprisonment was increased from\r\n5 grams to 28 grams, and the quantity threshold required to trigger the 10-year mandatory\r\nminimum term of imprisonment was increased from 50 grams to 280 grams. See 21 U.S.C.\r\n§§ 841(b)(1)(A), (B), (C), 960(b)(1), (2), (3).\r\nTo account for these statutory changes, the amendment conforms the guideline penalty\r\nstructure for crack cocaine offenses to the approach followed for other drugs, i.e., the base\r\noffense levels for crack cocaine are set in the Drug Quantity Table so that the statutory\r\nminimum penalties correspond to levels 26 and 32. See generally §2D1.1, comment.\r\n(backg'd.). Accordingly, using the new drug quantities established by the Act, offenses\r\ninvolving 28 grams or more of crack cocaine are assigned a base offense level of 26,\r\noffenses involving 280 grams or more of crack cocaine are assigned a base offense level of\r\n\r\n32, and other offense levels are established by extrapolating upward and downward.\r\nConforming to this approach ensures that the relationship between the statutory penalties\r\nfor crack cocaine offenses and the statutory penalties for offenses involving other drugs is\r\nconsistently and proportionally reflected throughout the Drug Quantity Table.\r\nTo provide a means of obtaining a single offense level in cases involving crack cocaine and\r\none or more other controlled substances, the amendment also establishes a marihuana\r\nequivalency for crack cocaine under which 1 gram of crack cocaine is equivalent to 3,571\r\ngrams of marihuana. (The marihuana equivalency for any controlled substance is a constant\r\nthat can be calculated using any threshold in the Drug Quantity Table by dividing the\r\namount of marihuana corresponding to that threshold by the amount of the other controlled\r\nsubstance corresponding to that threshold. For example, the threshold quantities at base\r\noffense level 26 are 100,000 grams of marihuana and 28 grams of crack cocaine; 100,000\r\ngrams divided by 28 is 3,571 grams.) In the commentary to §2D1.1, the amendment makes\r\na conforming change to the rules for cases involving both crack cocaine and one or more\r\nother controlled substances. The amendment deletes the special rules in Note 10(D) for\r\ncases involving crack cocaine and one or more other controlled substances, and revises Note\r\n10(C) so that it provides an example of such a case.\r\nSecond, the amendment amends §2D1.1 to add a sentence at the end of subsection (a)(5)\r\n(often referred to as the \"mitigating role cap\"). The new provision provides that if the\r\noffense level otherwise resulting from subsection (a)(5) is greater than level 32, and the\r\ndefendant receives the 4-level (\"minimal participant\") reduction in subsection (a) of §3B1.2\r\n(Mitigating Role), the base offense level shall be decreased to level 32. This provision\r\nresponds to section 7(1) of the Act, which directed the Commission to ensure that \"if the\r\ndefendant is subject to a minimal role adjustment under the guidelines, the base offense\r\nlevel for the defendant based solely on drug quantity shall not exceed level 32\".\r\nThird, the amendment amends §2D1.1 to create a new specific offense characteristic at\r\nsubsection (b)(2) providing an enhancement of 2 levels if the defendant used violence, made\r\na credible threat to use violence, or directed the use of violence. The new specific offense\r\ncharacteristic responds to section 5 of the Act, which directed the Commission to \"ensure\r\nthat the guidelines provide an additional penalty increase of at least 2 offense levels if the\r\ndefendant used violence, made a credible threat to use violence, or directed the use of\r\nviolence during a drug trafficking offense.\"\r\nThe amendment also revises the commentary to §2D1.1 to clarify how this new specific\r\noffense characteristic interacts with subsection (b)(1). Specifically, Application Note 3 is\r\namended to provide that the enhancements in subsections (b)(1) (regarding possession of\r\na dangerous weapon) and (b)(2) may be applied cumulatively. However, in a case in which\r\nthe defendant merely possessed a dangerous weapon but did not use violence, make a\r\ncredible threat to use violence, or direct the use of violence, subsection (b)(2) would not\r\napply.\r\nIn addition, the amendment makes a conforming change to the commentary to §2K2.4 (Use\r\nof Firearm, Armor-Piercing Ammunition, or Explosive During or in Relation to Certain\r\nCrimes) to address cases in which the defendant is sentenced under both §2D1.1 (for a drug\r\ntrafficking offense) and §2K2.4 (for an offense under 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)). In such a case,\r\nthe sentence under §2K2.4 accounts for any weapon enhancement; therefore, in determining\r\n\r\nthe sentence under §2D1.1, the weapon enhancement in §2D1.1(b)(1) does not apply. See\r\n§2K2.4, comment. (n. 4). The amendment amends this commentary to similarly provide\r\nthat, in a case in which the defendant is sentenced under both §§2D1.1 and 2K2.4, the new\r\nenhancement at §2D1.1(b)(2) also is accounted for by §2K2.4 and, therefore, does not apply.\r\nFourth, the amendment amends §2D1.1 to create a new specific offense characteristic at\r\nsubsection (b)(11) providing an enhancement of 2 levels if the defendant bribed, or\r\nattempted to bribe, a law enforcement officer to facilitate the commission of the offense.\r\nThe new specific offense characteristic responds to section 6(1) of the Act, which directed\r\nthe Commission \"to ensure an additional increase of at least 2 offense levels if . . . the\r\ndefendant bribed, or attempted to bribe, a Federal, State, or local law enforcement official\r\nin connection with a drug trafficking offense\".\r\nThe amendment also revises the commentary to §2D1.1 to clarify how this new specific\r\noffense characteristic interacts with the adjustment at §3C1.1 (Obstructing or Impeding the\r\nAdministration of Justice). Specifically, new Application Note 27 provides that subsection\r\n(b)(11) does not apply if the purpose of the bribery was to obstruct or impede the\r\ninvestigation, prosecution, or sentencing of the defendant because such conduct is covered\r\nby §3C1.1.\r\nFifth, the amendment amends §2D1.1 to create a new specific offense characteristic at\r\nsubsection (b)(12) providing an enhancement of 2 levels if the defendant maintained a\r\npremises for the purpose of manufacturing or distributing a controlled substance. The new\r\nspecific offense characteristic responds to section 6(2) of the Act, which directed the\r\nCommission to \"ensure an additional increase of at least 2 offense levels if . . . the defendant\r\nmaintained an establishment for the manufacture or distribution of a controlled substance,\r\nas generally described in section 416 of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 856)\".\r\nThe amendment also adds commentary in §2D1.1 at Application Note 28 providing that\r\namong the factors the court should consider in determining whether the defendant\r\n\"maintained\" the premises are (A) whether the defendant held a possessory interest (e.g.,\r\nowned or rented) the premises and (B) the extent to which the defendant controlled access\r\nto, or activities at, the premises. Application Note 28 also provides that manufacturing or\r\ndistributing a controlled substance need not be the sole purpose for which the premises was\r\nmaintained, but must be one of the defendant’s primary or principal uses for the premises,\r\nrather than one of the defendant’s incidental or collateral uses of the premises. In making\r\nthis determination, the court should consider how frequently the premises was used by the\r\ndefendant for manufacturing or distributing a controlled substance and how frequently the\r\npremises was used by the defendant for lawful purposes.\r\nSixth, the amendment amends §2D1.1 to create a new specific offense characteristic at\r\nsubsection (b)(14) that provides an enhancement of 2 levels if the defendant receives an\r\nadjustment under §3B1.1 (Aggravating Role) and the offense involved one or more of five\r\nspecified factors. The new specific offense characteristic responds to section 6(3) of the\r\nAct, which directed the Commission \"to ensure an additional increase of at least 2 offense\r\nlevels if . . . (A) the defendant is an organizer, leader, manager, or supervisor of drug\r\ntrafficking activity subject to an aggravating role enhancement under the guidelines; and (B)\r\nthe offense involved 1 or more of the following super-aggravating factors:\r\n\r\n(i) The defendant--\r\n(I) used another person to purchase, sell, transport, or store controlled\r\nsubstances;\r\n(II) used impulse, fear, friendship, affection, or some combination thereof to\r\ninvolve such person in the offense; and\r\n(III) such person had a minimum knowledge of the illegal enterprise and was to\r\nreceive little or no compensation from the illegal transaction.\r\n(ii) The defendant--\r\n(I) knowingly distributed a controlled substance to a person under the age of\r\n18 years, a person over the age of 64 years, or a pregnant individual;\r\n(II) knowingly involved a person under the age of 18 years, a person over the\r\nage of 64 years, or a pregnant individual in drug trafficking;\r\n(III) knowingly distributed a controlled substance to an individual who was\r\nunusually vulnerable due to physical or mental condition, or who was\r\nparticularly susceptible to criminal conduct; or\r\n(IV) knowingly involved an individual who was unusually vulnerable due to\r\nphysical or mental condition, or who was particularly susceptible to\r\ncriminal conduct, in the offense.\r\n(iii) The defendant was involved in the importation into the United States of a controlled\r\nsubstance.\r\n(iv) The defendant engaged in witness intimidation, tampered with or destroyed\r\nevidence, or otherwise obstructed justice in connection with the investigation or\r\nprosecution of the offense.\r\n(v) The defendant committed the drug trafficking offense as part of a pattern of\r\ncriminal conduct engaged in as a livelihood.\"\r\nThe amendment also revises the commentary to §2D1.1 to provide guidance in applying the\r\nnew specific offense characteristic at §2D1.1(b)(14). Specifically, new Application Note\r\n29 provides that if the defendant distributes a controlled substance to an individual or\r\ninvolves an individual in the offense, as specified in subsection (b)(14)(B), the individual\r\nis not a \"vulnerable victim\" for purposes of subsection (b) of §3A1.1 (Hate Crime\r\nMotivation or Vulnerable Victim). Application Note 29 also provides that subsection\r\n(b)(14)(C) applies if the defendant committed, aided, abetted, counseled, commanded,\r\ninduced, procured, or willfully caused the importation of a controlled substance. Subsection\r\n(b)(14)(C), however, does not apply if subsection (b)(3) or (b)(5) (as redesignated by the\r\namendment) applies because the defendant’s involvement in importation is adequately\r\naccounted for by those subsections. In addition, Application Note 29 defines \"pattern of\r\ncriminal conduct\" and \"engaged in as a livelihood\" for purposes of subsection (b)(14)(E) as\r\nthose terms are defined in §4B1.3 (Criminal Livelihood).\r\nThe amendment also revises the commentary in §3B1.4 (Using a Minor To Commit a\r\nCrime) and §3C1.1 (Obstructing or Impeding the Administration of Justice) to specify how\r\nthose adjustments interact with §2D1.1(b)(14)(B) and (D), respectively. Specifically,\r\nApplication Note 2 to §3B1.4 is amended to clarify that the increase of two levels under this\r\nsection would not apply if the defendant receives an enhancement under §2D1.1(b)(14)(B).\r\n\r\nNovember 1, 2011 APPENDIX C - VOLUME III Amendment 749\r\nSimilarly, Application Note 7 to §3C1.1 is amended to clarify that the increase of two levels\r\nunder this section would not apply if the defendant receives an enhancement under\r\n§2D1.1(b)(14)(D).\r\nSeventh, the amendment amends §2D1.1 to create a new specific offense characteristic\r\nproviding a 2-level downward adjustment if the defendant receives the 4-level (\"minimal\r\nparticipant\") reduction in subsection (a) of §3B1.2 (Mitigating Role) and the offense\r\ninvolved each of three additional specified factors: namely, the defendant was motivated by\r\nan intimate or familial relationship or by threats or fear to commit the offense when the\r\ndefendant was otherwise unlikely to commit such an offense; was to receive no monetary\r\ncompensation from the illegal purchase, sale, transport, or storage of controlled substances;\r\nand had minimal knowledge of the scope and structure of the enterprise. The specific\r\noffense characteristic responds to section 7(2) of the Act, which directed the Commission\r\nto ensure that \"there is an additional reduction of 2 offense levels if the defendant—\r\n(A) otherwise qualifies for a minimal role adjustment under the guidelines and had a\r\nminimum knowledge of the illegal enterprise;\r\n(B) was to receive no monetary compensation from the illegal transaction; and\r\n(C) was motivated by an intimate or familial relationship or by threats or fear when the\r\ndefendant was otherwise unlikely to commit such an offense.\"\r\nEighth, to reflect the renumbering of specific offense characteristics in §2D1.1(b) by the\r\namendment, technical and conforming changes are made to the commentary to §2D1.1 and\r\nto §2D1.14 (Narco-Terrorism).\r\nNinth, the amendment amends §2D2.1 (Unlawful Possession; Attempt or Conspiracy) to\r\naccount for the changes in the statutory penalties for simple possession of crack cocaine\r\nmade in section 3 of the Act. Section 3 of the Act amended 21 U.S.C. § 844(a) to eliminate\r\nthe 5-year mandatory minimum term of imprisonment (and 20-year statutory maximum) for\r\nsimple possession of more than 5 grams of crack cocaine (or, for certain repeat offenders,\r\nmore than 1 gram of crack cocaine). Accordingly, the statutory penalty for simple\r\npossession of crack cocaine is now the same as for simple possession of most other\r\ncontrolled substances: for a first offender, a maximum term of imprisonment of one year;\r\nfor repeat offenders, maximum terms of 2 years or 3 years, and minimum terms of 15 days\r\nor 90 days, depending on the prior convictions. See 21 U.S.C. § 844(a). To account for this\r\nstatutory change, the amendment deletes the cross reference at §2D2.1(b)(1) under which\r\nan offender who possessed more than 5 grams of crack cocaine was sentenced under the\r\ndrug trafficking guideline, §2D1.1.","EffectiveDate":"Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2010."},{"Id":749,"Title":"Amendment 749","Text":"Section 2B1.1(b) is amended by redesignating subdivisions (8) through (17)\r\nas subdivisions (9) through (18); and by inserting after subdivision (7) the following:\r\n\"(8) If (A) the defendant was convicted of a Federal health care offense\r\ninvolving a Government health care program; and (B) the loss under\r\nsubsection (b)(1) to the Government health care program was (i) more than\r\n$1,000,000, increase by 2 levels; (ii) more than $7,000,000, increase by 3\r\nlevels; or (iii) more than $20,000,000, increase by 4 levels.\".\r\n\r\nSection 2B1.1(b) is amended in subdivision (15), as redesignated by this amendment, by\r\nstriking \"(14)\" and inserting \"(15)\".\r\nThe Commentary to §2B1.1 captioned \"Application Notes\" is amended in Note 1 by\r\ninserting after the paragraph that begins \"‘Equity securities’\" the following:\r\n\"‘Federal health care offense’ has the meaning given that term in 18 U.S.C. § 24.\";\r\nand by inserting after the paragraph that begins \"‘Foreign instrumentality’\" the following:\r\n\"‘Government health care program’ means any plan or program that provides health\r\nbenefits, whether directly, through insurance, or otherwise, which is funded\r\ndirectly, in whole or in part, by federal or state government.

L. 111–148 (the \"Patient\r\nProtection Act\"), and addresses certain new offenses created by the Patient Protection Act\r\nand by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street and Consumer Protection Act, Pub. L. 111–203 (the\r\n\"Dodd-Frank Act\").\r\nResponse to Directive\r\nSection 10606(a)(2)(B) of the Patient Protection Act directed the Commission to—\r\namend the Federal Sentencing Guidelines and policy statements applicable\r\nto persons convicted of Federal health care offenses involving Government\r\nhealth care programs to provide that the aggregate dollar amount of\r\nfraudulent bills submitted to the Government health care program shall\r\nconstitute prima facie evidence of the amount of the intended loss by the\r\ndefendant[.]\r\nSection 10606(a)(2)(C) directed the Commission to amend the guidelines to provide—\r\n(i) a 2-level increase in the offense level for any defendant convicted\r\nof a Federal health care offense relating to a Government health\r\ncare program which involves a loss of not less than $1,000,000 and\r\nless than $7,000,000;\r\n(ii) a 3-level increase in the offense level for any defendant convicted of a\r\nFederal health care offense relating to a Government health care program\r\nwhich involves a loss of not less than $7,000,000 and less than\r\n$20,000,000;\r\n(iii) a 4-level increase in the offense level for any defendant convicted of a\r\nFederal health care offense relating to a Government health care program\r\nwhich involves a loss of not less than $20,000,000; and\r\n(iv) if appropriate, otherwise amend the Federal Sentencing Guidelines and\r\npolicy statements applicable to persons convicted of Federal health care\r\noffenses involving Government health care programs.\r\nSection 10606(a)(3) required the Commission, in carrying out the directive, to \"ensure\r\nreasonable consistency with other relevant directives and with other guidelines\" and to\r\n\"account for any aggravating or mitigating circumstances that might justify exceptions,\"\r\namong other requirements.\r\nThe amendment implements the directive by adding two provisions to §2B1.1 (Theft,\r\nProperty Destruction, and Fraud), both of which apply to cases in which \"the defendant was\r\nconvicted of a Federal health care offense involving a Government health care program\".\r\n\r\nThe first provision is a new tiered enhancement at subsection (b)(8) that applies in such\r\ncases (i.e., Federal health care offenses involving a Government health care program) if the\r\nloss is more than $1,000,000. The enhancement is 2 levels if the loss is more than\r\n$1,000,000, 3 levels if the loss is more than $7,000,000, and 4 levels if the loss is more than\r\n$20,000,000. The tiers of the enhancement apply to loss amounts \"more than\" the specified\r\ndollar amounts rather than to loss amounts \"not less than\" the specified dollar amounts to\r\n\"ensure reasonable consistency\" as required by the directive. The consistent practice in the\r\nGuidelines Manual is to apply enhancements to loss amounts \"more than\" specified dollar\r\namounts.\r\nThe second provision is a new special rule in Application Note 3(F) for determining\r\nintended loss in a case in which the defendant is convicted of a Federal health care offense\r\ninvolving a Government health care program. The special rule provides that, in such a case,\r\n\"the aggregate dollar amount of fraudulent bills submitted to the Government health care\r\nprogram shall constitute prima facie evidence of the amount of the intended loss, i.e., is\r\nevidence sufficient to establish the amount of the intended loss, if not rebutted\". The special\r\nrule includes language making clear that the government's proof of intended loss may be\r\nrebutted by the defendant.\r\nThe amendment also adds definitions to the commentary in §2B1.1 for the terms \"Federal\r\nhealth care offense\" and \"Government health care program\". \"Federal health care offense\"\r\nis defined to have the meaning given that term in 18 U.S.C. § 24, as required by section\r\n10606(a)(1) of the Patient Protection Act. \"Government health care program\" is defined to\r\nmean \"any plan or program that provides health benefits, whether directly, through\r\ninsurance, or otherwise, which is funded directly, in whole or in part, by federal or state\r\ngovernment.\" The amendment lists the Medicare program, the Medicaid program, and the\r\nCHIP program as examples of such programs. The Commission adopted this definition\r\nbecause health care fraud involving federally funded programs and health care fraud\r\ninvolving state-funded programs are similar offenses, committed in similar ways and posing\r\nsimilar harms to the taxpaying public. In addition, defining \"Government health care\r\nprogram\" in this manner avoids application difficulties likely to arise from a narrower\r\ndefinition that would require the disaggregation of losses program by program in cases in\r\nwhich the defendant defrauded both federal and state health care programs. Finally, the\r\nstatutory language in the directive indicates congressional concern with health care fraud\r\nthat adversely affects the public fisc beyond health care programs funded solely with federal\r\nfunds.\r\nFinally, the amendment amends Application Note 3(A) to §3B1.2 (Mitigating Role) to make\r\nclear that a defendant who is accountable under §1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct) for a loss\r\namount under §2B1.1 that greatly exceeds the defendant's personal gain from a fraud\r\noffense, and who had limited knowledge of the scope of the scheme, is not precluded from\r\nconsideration for a mitigating role adjustment. The amended commentary provides as an\r\nexample \"a defendant in a health care fraud scheme, whose role in the scheme was limited\r\nto serving as a nominee owner and who received little personal gain relative to the loss\r\namount\". This part of the amendment is consistent with the directive in section\r\n10606(a)(3)(D) of the Patient Protection Act that the Commission should \"account for any\r\naggravating or mitigating circumstances that might justify exceptions\" to the new tiered\r\nenhancement.\r\n\r\nNew Offenses\r\nIn addition to responding to the directives, the amendment amends Appendix A (Statutory\r\nIndex) to include offenses created by both the Patient Protection Act and the Dodd-Frank\r\nAct.\r\nThe Patient Protection Act created a new offense at 29 U.S.C. § 1149 that prohibits making\r\na false statement in connection with the marketing or sale of a multiple employer welfare\r\narrangement under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. Pursuant to 29 U.S.C.\r\n§ 1131(b), a person who commits this new offense is subject to a term of imprisonment of\r\nnot more than 10 years. The amendment references the new offense at 29 U.S.C. § 1149 to\r\n§2B1.1 because the offense has fraud or misrepresentation as a element of the offense. As\r\na clerical change, the amendment also amends Appendix A (Statutory Index) to make clear\r\nthat 29 U.S.C. § 1131(a), not the new § 1131(b), is referenced to §2E5.3 (False Statements\r\nand Concealment of Facts in Relation to Documents Required by the Employee Retirement\r\nIncome Security Act; Failure to Maintain and Falsification of Records Required by the\r\nLabor Management Reporting and Disclosure Act; Destruction and Failure to Maintain\r\nCorporate Audit Records).\r\nThe Dodd-Frank Act created two new offenses, 12 U.S.C. § 5382 and 15 U.S.C. § 78jjj(d).\r\nWith regard to 12 U.S.C. § 5382, under authority granted by sections 202-203 of the Dodd-\r\nFrank Act, the Secretary of the Treasury may make a \"systemic risk determination\"\r\nconcerning a financial company and, if the company fails the determination, may commence\r\nthe orderly liquidation of the company by appointing the Federal Deposit Insurance\r\nCorporation as receiver. Before making the appointment, the Secretary must either obtain\r\nthe consent of the company or petition under seal for approval by a federal district court.\r\nThe Dodd-Frank Act makes it a crime, codified at 12 U.S.C. § 5382, to recklessly disclose\r\na systemic risk determination or the pendency of court proceedings on such a petition. A\r\nperson who violates 12 U.S.C. § 5382 is subject to imprisonment for not more than five\r\nyears. The amendment references 12 U.S.C. § 5382 to §2H3.1 (Interception of\r\nCommunications; Eavesdropping; Disclosure of Certain Private or Protected Information).\r\nSection 2H3.1 covers several criminal statutes with similar elements and the same maximum\r\nterm of imprisonment.\r\nThe second new offense, 15 U.S.C. § 78jjj(d), makes it a crime for a person to falsely\r\nrepresent that he or she is a member of the Security Investor Protection Corporation or that\r\nany person or account is protected or eligible for protection under the Security Investor\r\nProtection Act. See Dodd-Frank Act, Pub. L. 111–203, § 929V. Section 78jjj also contains\r\ntwo other offenses, at subsections (c)(1) and (c)(2), that are not referenced in Appendix A\r\n(Statutory Index). All three subsections are subject to the same maximum term of\r\nimprisonment of five years. In addition, all three concern fraud and deceit: the newly\r\ncreated 15 U.S.C. § 78jjj(d) involves false representation; 15 U.S.C. § 78jjj(c)(1) involves\r\nfraud in connection with or in contemplation of a liquidation proceeding; and 15 U.S.C. §\r\n78jjj(c)(2) involves fraudulent conversion of assets of the Security Investor Protection\r\nCorporation. The amendment references these offenses to §2B1.1 because the elements of\r\nthe offenses involve fraud and deceit.","EffectiveDate":"Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2011."},{"Id":750,"Title":"Amendment 750","Text":"Sections 2D1.1, 2D1.14, 2D2.1, 2K2.4, 3B1.4, and 3C1.1, effective\r\nNovember 1, 2010 (see Appendix C, Amendment 748), as set forth in Supplement to the\r\n2010 Guidelines Manual (effective November 1, 2010); see also 75 FR 66188 (October 27,\r\n2010), are repromulgated as follows:\r\nPART A\r\nThe Drug Quantity Table in §2D1.1(c) and Note 10 of the Commentary to §2D1.1 captioned\r\n\"Application Notes\" are repromulgated without change.\r\nPART B\r\nAll provisions of §2D1.1 not repromulgated by Part A of this amendment are repromulgated\r\nwithout change, except as follows:\r\nThe Commentary to §2D1.1 captioned \"Application Notes\" is amended by striking Note 28\r\nas follows:\r\n\"28.

L. 111–220 (the \"Act\"). The\r\nAct reduced the statutory penalties for cocaine base (\"crack cocaine\") offenses, eliminated\r\nthe statutory mandatory minimum sentence for simple possession of crack cocaine, and\r\ncontained directives to the Commission to review and amend the guidelines to account for\r\nspecified aggravating and mitigating circumstances in certain drug cases.\r\nThe emergency amendment authority provided in section 8 of the Act required the\r\nCommission to promulgate the guidelines, policy statements, or amendments provided for\r\nin the Act, and to make such conforming changes to the guidelines as the Commission\r\ndetermines necessary to achieve consistency with other guideline provisions and applicable\r\nlaw, not later than 90 days after the date of enactment of the Act. Pursuant to this\r\nemergency directive, the Commission promulgated an amendment effective November 1,\r\n2010, that made temporary, emergency revisions to §2D1.1 (Unlawful Manufacturing,\r\nImporting, Exporting, or Trafficking (Including Possession with Intent to Commit These\r\nOffenses); Attempt or Conspiracy) and §2D2.1 (Unlawful Possession; Attempt or\r\nConspiracy). Conforming changes to certain other guidelines were also promulgated on a\r\ntemporary, emergency basis. See USSG App. C, Amendment 748 (effective November 1,\r\n2010).\r\nThis amendment re-promulgates the temporary, emergency amendment. Part A\r\nre-promulgates the revisions to the crack cocaine quantity levels in the Drug Quantity Table\r\nin §2D1.1 without change. Part B re-promulgates the various aggravating and mitigating\r\nprovisions in §2D1.1 without change, except for a revision to the new Application Note 28\r\n(relating to the new enhancement for maintaining premises). Part C re-promulgates the\r\nrevision to §2D2.1 accounting for the reduction in the statutory penalties for simple\r\npossession of crack cocaine without change.\r\nPart A. Changes to the Drug Quantity Table for Offenses Involving Crack Cocaine\r\n\r\nPart A re-promulgates without change the emergency, temporary revisions to the Drug\r\nQuantity Table in §2D1.1 and related revisions to Application Note 10 to account for the\r\nchanges in the statutory penalties made in section 2 of the Act. Section 2 of the Act reduced\r\nthe statutory penalties for offenses involving manufacturing or trafficking in crack cocaine\r\nby increasing the quantity thresholds required to trigger a mandatory minimum term of\r\nimprisonment. The quantity threshold required to trigger the 5-year mandatory minimum\r\nterm of imprisonment was increased from 5 grams to 28 grams, and the quantity threshold\r\nrequired to trigger the 10-year mandatory minimum term of imprisonment was increased\r\nfrom 50 grams to 280 grams. See 21 U.S.C. §§ 841(b)(1)(A), (B), (C), 960(b)(1), (2), (3).\r\nThe new mandatory minimum quantity threshold levels for crack cocaine offenses are\r\nconsistent with the Commission’s 2007 report to Congress, Cocaine and Federal Sentencing\r\nPolicy, in which the Commission, based on available information, defined crack cocaine\r\noffenders who deal in quantities of one ounce (approximately 28 grams) or more in a single\r\ntransaction as wholesalers.\r\nTo account for these statutory changes, the amendment conforms the guideline penalty\r\nstructure for crack cocaine offenses to the approach followed for other drugs, i.e., the base\r\noffense levels for crack cocaine are set in the Drug Quantity Table so that the statutory\r\nminimum penalties correspond to levels 26 and 32, which was the approach used for crack\r\ncocaine offenses prior to November 1, 2007. See §2D1.1, comment. (backg'd.); USSG App.\r\nC, Amendment 706 (effective November 1, 2007). Accordingly, using the new drug\r\nquantities established by the Act, offenses involving 28 grams or more of crack cocaine are\r\nassigned a base offense level of 26, offenses involving 280 grams or more of crack cocaine\r\nare assigned a base offense level of 32, and other offense levels are established by\r\nextrapolating proportionally upward and downward on the Drug Quantity Table.\r\nConforming the guideline penalty structure for crack cocaine offenses to the approach\r\nfollowed for all other drugs ensures that the quantity-based relationship established by\r\nstatute between crack cocaine offenses and offenses involving all other drugs is consistently\r\nand proportionally reflected throughout the Drug Quantity Table at all drug quantities.\r\nEstimating the likely future sentencing impact of the amendment to the Drug Quantity Table\r\nis difficult because the reductions in the statutory penalties for crack cocaine offenses may\r\nresult in changes in prosecutorial and other practices. With that important caveat, the\r\nCommission estimates that approximately 63 percent of crack cocaine offenders sentenced\r\nafter November 1, 2011, will receive a lower sentence as a result of the change to the Drug\r\nQuantity Table, with an average sentence decrease of approximately 26 percent. For\r\nexample, under the Drug Quantity Table in effect from November 1, 2007 through October\r\n31, 2010, an offense involving 5 grams of crack cocaine was assigned a base offense level\r\nof 24, which corresponds to a guideline sentencing range of 51 to 63 months. Under the\r\nDrug Quantity Table as amended, 5 grams of crack cocaine is assigned a base offense level\r\nof 16, which corresponds to a guideline sentencing range of 21 to 27 months. Similarly,\r\nunder the Drug Quantity Table in effect from November 1, 2007 through October 31, 2010,\r\nan offense involving 50 grams of crack cocaine was assigned a base offense level of 30,\r\nwhich corresponds to a guideline sentencing range of 97 to121 months. Under the Drug\r\nQuantity Table as amended, 50 grams of crack cocaine is assigned a base offense level of\r\n26, which corresponds to a guideline sentencing range of 63 to 78 months.\r\nIt is important to note that no crack cocaine offender will receive an increased sentence as\r\n\r\na result of the amendment to the Drug Quantity Table. As indicated above, not all crack\r\ncocaine offenders sentenced after November 1, 2011, will receive a lower sentence as a\r\nresult of the change to the Drug Quantity Table. This is the case for a variety of reasons.\r\nAmong the reasons, compared to the Drug Quantity Table in effect from November 1, 2007\r\nthrough October 31, 2010, the amendment does not lower the base offense levels, and\r\ntherefore does not lower the sentences, for offenses involving the following quantities of\r\ncrack cocaine: less than 500 milligrams; at least 28 grams but less than 35 grams; at least\r\n280 grams but less than 500 grams; at least 840 grams but less than 1.5 kilograms; at least\r\n2.8 kilograms but less than 4.5 kilograms; and 8.5 kilograms or more. In addition, some\r\noffenders are sentenced at the statutory mandatory minimum and therefore cannot have their\r\nsentences lowered by an amendment to the guidelines. See §5G1.1(b) (Sentencing on a\r\nSingle Count of Conviction). Other offenders are sentenced pursuant to §§4B1.1 (Career\r\nOffender) and 4B1.4 (Armed Career Criminal), which result in sentencing guideline ranges\r\nthat are unaffected by a reduction in the Drug Quantity Table.\r\nTo provide a means of obtaining a single offense level in cases involving crack cocaine and\r\none or more other controlled substances, the amendment also establishes a marihuana\r\nequivalency for crack cocaine under which 1 gram of crack cocaine is equivalent to 3,571\r\ngrams of marihuana. (The marihuana equivalency for any controlled substance is a constant\r\nthat can be calculated using any threshold in the Drug Quantity Table by dividing the\r\namount of marihuana corresponding to that threshold by the amount of the other controlled\r\nsubstance corresponding to that threshold. For example, the threshold quantities at base\r\noffense level 26 are 100,000 grams of marihuana and 28 grams of crack cocaine; 100,000\r\ngrams divided by 28 is 3,571 grams.) In the commentary to §2D1.1, the amendment makes\r\na conforming change to the rules for cases involving both crack cocaine and one or more\r\nother controlled substances. The amendment deletes the special rules in Note 10(D) for\r\ncases involving crack cocaine and one or more other controlled substances, and revises Note\r\n10(C) so that it provides an example of such a case.\r\nPart B. Aggravating and Mitigating Factors in Drug Trafficking Cases\r\nPart B re-promulgates the temporary, emergency revisions to §2D1.1 and accompanying\r\ncommentary that account for certain aggravating and mitigating factors in drug trafficking\r\ncases. These changes implement directives to the Commission in sections 5, 6, and 7 of the\r\nAct. The emergency revisions are re-promulgated without change, except for the new\r\nApplication Note 28 (relating to the new enhancement for maintaining a premises), as\r\nexplained below.\r\nFirst, Part B amends §2D1.1 to add a sentence at the end of subsection (a)(5) (often referred\r\nto as the \"mitigating role cap\"). The new provision provides that if the offense level\r\notherwise resulting from subsection (a)(5) is greater than level 32, and the defendant\r\nreceives the 4-level (\"minimal participant\") reduction in subsection (a) of §3B1.2\r\n(Mitigating Role), the base offense level shall be decreased to level 32. This provision\r\nresponds to section 7(1) of the Act, which directed the Commission to ensure that \"if the\r\ndefendant is subject to a minimal role adjustment under the guidelines, the base offense\r\nlevel for the defendant based solely on drug quantity shall not exceed level 32\".\r\nSecond, Part B amends §2D1.1 to create a new specific offense characteristic at subsection\r\n(b)(2) providing an enhancement of 2 levels if the defendant used violence, made a credible\r\n\r\nthreat to use violence, or directed the use of violence. The new specific offense\r\ncharacteristic responds to section 5 of the Act, which directed the Commission to \"ensure\r\nthat the guidelines provide an additional penalty increase of at least 2 offense levels if the\r\ndefendant used violence, made a credible threat to use violence, or directed the use of\r\nviolence during a drug trafficking offense.\"\r\nThe amendment also revises the commentary to §2D1.1 to clarify how this new specific\r\noffense characteristic interacts with subsection (b)(1), which provides an enhancement of\r\n2 levels if a dangerous weapon (including a firearm) was possessed. Specifically,\r\nApplication Note 3 is amended to provide that the enhancements in subsections (b)(1) and\r\n(b)(2) may be applied cumulatively. However, in a case in which the defendant merely\r\npossessed a dangerous weapon but did not use violence, make a credible threat to use\r\nviolence, or direct the use of violence, subsection (b)(2) would not apply.\r\nIn addition, the amendment makes a conforming change to the commentary to §2K2.4 (Use\r\nof Firearm, Armor-Piercing Ammunition, or Explosive During or in Relation to Certain\r\nCrimes) to address cases in which the defendant is sentenced under both §2D1.1 (for a drug\r\ntrafficking offense) and §2K2.4 (for an offense under 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)). In such a case,\r\nthe sentence under §2K2.4 accounts for any weapon enhancement; therefore, in determining\r\nthe sentence under §2D1.1, the weapon enhancement in §2D1.1(b)(1) does not apply. See\r\n§2K2.4, comment. (n. 4). The amendment amends this commentary to similarly provide\r\nthat, in a case in which the defendant is sentenced under both §§2D1.1 and 2K2.4, the new\r\nenhancement at §2D1.1(b)(2) also is accounted for by §2K2.4 and, therefore, does not apply.\r\nThird, Part B amends §2D1.1 to create a new specific offense characteristic at subsection\r\n(b)(11) providing an enhancement of 2 levels if the defendant bribed, or attempted to bribe,\r\na law enforcement officer to facilitate the commission of the offense. The new specific\r\noffense characteristic responds to section 6(1) of the Act, which directed the Commission\r\n\"to ensure an additional increase of at least 2 offense levels if . . . the defendant bribed, or\r\nattempted to bribe, a Federal, State, or local law enforcement official in connection with a\r\ndrug trafficking offense\".\r\nThe amendment also revises the commentary to §2D1.1 to clarify how this new specific\r\noffense characteristic interacts with the adjustment at §3C1.1 (Obstructing or Impeding the\r\nAdministration of Justice). Specifically, new Application Note 27 provides that subsection\r\n(b)(11) does not apply if the purpose of the bribery was to obstruct or impede the\r\ninvestigation, prosecution, or sentencing of the defendant because such conduct is covered\r\nby §3C1.1.\r\nFourth, Part B amends §2D1.1 to create a new specific offense characteristic at subsection\r\n(b)(12) providing an enhancement of 2 levels if the defendant maintained premises for the\r\npurpose of manufacturing or distributing a controlled substance. The new specific offense\r\ncharacteristic responds to section 6(2) of the Act, which directed the Commission to \"ensure\r\nan additional increase of at least 2 offense levels if . . . the defendant maintained an\r\nestablishment for the manufacture or distribution of a controlled substance, as generally\r\ndescribed in section 416 of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 856)\".\r\nThe amendment also adds commentary in §2D1.1 at Application Note 28 providing that the\r\nenhancement applies to a defendant who knowingly maintains premises (i.e., a building,\r\n\r\nroom, or enclosure) for the purpose of maintaining or distributing a controlled substance.\r\nThe new amendment differs from the temporary, emergency revisions in clarifying that\r\ndistribution includes storage of a controlled substance for the purpose of distribution.\r\nApplication Note 28 also provides that among the factors the court should consider in\r\ndetermining whether the defendant \"maintained\" the premises are (A) whether the defendant\r\nheld a possessory interest in (e.g., owned or rented) the premises and (B) the extent to which\r\nthe defendant controlled access to, or activities at, the premises. Application Note 28 also\r\nprovides that manufacturing or distributing a controlled substance need not be the sole\r\npurpose for which the premises was maintained, but must be one of the defendant’s primary\r\nor principal uses for the premises, rather than one of the defendant’s incidental or collateral\r\nuses of the premises. In making this determination, the court should consider how\r\nfrequently the premises was used by the defendant for manufacturing or distributing a\r\ncontrolled substance and how frequently the premises was used by the defendant for lawful\r\npurposes.\r\nFifth, Part B amends §2D1.1 to create a new specific offense characteristic at subsection\r\n(b)(14) providing an enhancement of 2 levels if the defendant receives an adjustment under\r\n§3B1.1 (Aggravating Role) and the offense involved one or more of five specified factors.\r\nThe new specific offense characteristic responds to section 6(3) of the Act, which directed\r\nthe Commission \"to ensure an additional increase of at least 2 offense levels if . . . (A) the\r\ndefendant is an organizer, leader, manager, or supervisor of drug trafficking activity subject\r\nto an aggravating role enhancement under the guidelines; and (B) the offense involved 1 or\r\nmore of the following super-aggravating factors:\r\n(i) The defendant—\r\n(I) used another person to purchase, sell, transport, or store\r\ncontrolled substances;\r\n(II) used impulse, fear, friendship, affection, or some\r\ncombination thereof to involve such person in the offense;\r\nand\r\n(III) such person had a minimum knowledge of the illegal\r\nenterprise and was to receive little or no compensation\r\nfrom the illegal transaction.\r\n(ii) The defendant—\r\n(I) knowingly distributed a controlled substance to a person\r\nunder the age of 18 years, a person over the age of 64\r\nyears, or a pregnant individual;\r\n(II) knowingly involved a person under the age of 18 years, a\r\nperson over the age of 64 years, or a pregnant individual\r\nin drug trafficking;\r\n(III) knowingly distributed a controlled substance to an\r\nindividual who was unusually vulnerable due to physical\r\nor mental condition, or who was particularly susceptible to\r\ncriminal conduct; or\r\n(IV) knowingly involved an individual who was unusually\r\nvulnerable due to physical or mental condition, or who\r\nwas particularly susceptible to criminal conduct, in the\r\n\r\noffense.\r\n(iii) The defendant was involved in the importation into the United\r\nStates of a controlled substance.\r\n(iv) The defendant engaged in witness intimidation, tampered with or\r\ndestroyed evidence, or otherwise obstructed justice in connection\r\nwith the investigation or prosecution of the offense.\r\n(v) The defendant committed the drug trafficking offense as part of a\r\npattern of criminal conduct engaged in as a livelihood.\"\r\nThe amendment also revises the commentary to §2D1.1 to provide guidance in applying the\r\nnew specific offense characteristic at §2D1.1(b)(14). Specifically, new Application Note\r\n29 provides that if the defendant distributes a controlled substance to an individual or\r\ninvolves an individual in the offense, as specified in subsection (b)(14)(B), the individual\r\nis not a \"vulnerable victim\" for purposes of subsection (b) of §3A1.1 (Hate Crime\r\nMotivation or Vulnerable Victim). Application Note 29 also provides that subsection\r\n(b)(14)(C) applies if the defendant committed, aided, abetted, counseled, commanded,\r\ninduced, procured, or willfully caused the importation of a controlled substance. Subsection\r\n(b)(14)(C), however, does not apply if subsection (b)(3) or (b)(5) (as redesignated by the\r\namendment) applies because the defendant’s involvement in importation is adequately\r\naccounted for by those subsections. In addition, Application Note 29 defines \"pattern of\r\ncriminal conduct\" and \"engaged in as a livelihood\" for purposes of subsection (b)(14)(E) as\r\nthose terms are defined in §4B1.3 (Criminal Livelihood).\r\nThe amendment also revises the commentary in §3B1.4 (Using a Minor To Commit a\r\nCrime) and §3C1.1 (Obstructing or Impeding the Administration of Justice) to specify how\r\nthose adjustments interact with §2D1.1(b)(14)(B) and (D), respectively. Specifically,\r\nApplication Note 2 to §3B1.4 is amended to clarify that the increase of two levels under this\r\nsection would not apply if the defendant receives an enhancement under §2D1.1(b)(14)(B).\r\nSimilarly, Application Note 7 to §3C1.1 is amended to clarify that the increase of two levels\r\nunder this section would not apply if the defendant receives an enhancement under\r\n§2D1.1(b)(14)(D).\r\nSixth, Part B amends §2D1.1 to create a new specific offense characteristic at subsection\r\n(b)(15) providing a 2-level downward adjustment if the defendant receives the 4-level\r\n(\"minimal participant\") reduction in subsection (a) of §3B1.2 (Mitigating Role) and the\r\noffense involved each of three additional specified factors: namely, the defendant was\r\nmotivated by an intimate or familial relationship or by threats or fear to commit the offense\r\nwhen the defendant was otherwise unlikely to commit such an offense; was to receive no\r\nmonetary compensation from the illegal purchase, sale, transport, or storage of controlled\r\nsubstances; and had minimal knowledge of the scope and structure of the enterprise. The\r\nspecific offense characteristic responds to section 7(2) of the Act, which directed the\r\nCommission to ensure that \"there is an additional reduction of 2 offense levels if the\r\ndefendant—\r\n(A) otherwise qualifies for a minimal role adjustment under the\r\nguidelines and had a minimum knowledge of the illegal enterprise;\r\n\r\n(B) was to receive no monetary compensation from the illegal\r\ntransaction; and\r\n(C) was motivated by an intimate or familial relationship or by threats\r\nor fear when the defendant was otherwise unlikely to commit such\r\nan offense.\"\r\nSeventh, to reflect the renumbering of specific offense characteristics in §2D1.1(b) by the\r\namendment, technical and conforming changes are made to the commentary to §2D1.1 and\r\nto §2D1.14 (Narco-Terrorism).\r\nPart C. Simple Possession of Crack Cocaine\r\nPart C re-promulgates without change the temporary, emergency revisions to §2D2.1 to\r\naccount for the changes in the statutory penalties for simple possession of crack cocaine\r\nmade in section 3 of the Act. Section 3 of the Act amended 21 U.S.C. § 844(a) to eliminate\r\nthe 5-year mandatory minimum term of imprisonment (and 20-year statutory maximum) for\r\nsimple possession of more than 5 grams of crack cocaine (or, for certain repeat offenders,\r\nmore than 1 gram of crack cocaine). Accordingly, the statutory penalty for simple\r\npossession of crack cocaine is now the same as for simple possession of most other\r\ncontrolled substances: for a first offender, a maximum term of imprisonment of one year;\r\nfor repeat offenders, maximum terms of 2 years or 3 years, and minimum terms of 15 days\r\nor 90 days, depending on the prior convictions. See 21 U.S.C. § 844(a). To account for this\r\nstatutory change, the amendment deletes the cross reference at §2D2.1(b)(1) under which\r\nan offender who possessed more than 5 grams of crack cocaine was sentenced under the\r\ndrug trafficking guideline, §2D1.1.","EffectiveDate":"Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2011."},{"Id":751,"Title":"Amendment 751","Text":"The Commentary to §2D1.1 captioned \"Application Notes\" is amended in\r\nNote 8, in the first paragraph by adding at the end as the last sentence the following:\r\n\"Likewise, an adjustment under §3B1.3 ordinarily would apply in a case in which\r\nthe defendant is convicted of a drug offense resulting from the authorization of the\r\ndefendant to receive scheduled substances from an ultimate user or long-term care\r\nfacility.

The amendment reflects the likelihood that in such\r\na case the offender abused a position of trust (i.e., the authority provided by 21 U.S.C. § 822\r\nto receive controlled substances for the purpose of disposal) to facilitate the commission or\r\nconcealment of the offense.","EffectiveDate":"Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2011."},{"Id":752,"Title":"Amendment 752","Text":"The Commentary to §2J1.1 captioned \"Application Notes\" is amended in\r\nNote 2 by inserting \"In such a case, do not apply §2B1.1(b)(8)(C) (pertaining to a violation\r\nof a prior, specific judicial order).\" after \"failed to pay.\".","Reason":"Reason for Amendment: This amendment addresses a circuit conflict on whether the\r\nspecific offense characteristic at subsection (b)(8)(C) of §2B1.1 (Theft, Property\r\nDestruction, and Fraud) applies to a defendant convicted of an offense involving the willful\r\nfailure to pay court-ordered child support (i.e., a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 228). The specific\r\noffense characteristic in §2B1.1(b)(8)(C) applies if the offense involved \"a violation of any\r\nprior, specific judicial or administrative order, injunction, decree, or process not addressed\r\nelsewhere in the guidelines\".\r\nIt provides an enhancement of 2 levels and a minimum offense level of level 10.\r\nOffenses under section 228 are referenced in Appendix A (Statutory Index) to §2J1.1\r\n(Contempt), which directs the court to apply §2X5.1 (Other Offenses), which in turn directs\r\nthe court to apply the most analogous offense guideline. The commentary to §2J1.1\r\nprovides that, in a case involving a violation of section 228, the most analogous offense\r\nguideline is §2B1.1. See §2J1.1, comment. (n.2).\r\nSome circuits have disagreed over whether to apply §2B1.1(b)(8)(C) in a case involving a\r\nviolation of section 228. The Second and Eleventh Circuits have held that applying\r\n§2B1.1(b)(8)(C) in a section 228 case is permissible because the failure to pay the child\r\nsupport and the violation of the order are distinct harms. See United States v. Maloney, 406\r\nF.3d 149, 153-54 (2d Cir. 2005); United States v. Phillips, 363 F.3d 1167, 1169 (11th Cir.\r\n2004).

The Commission undertook this\r\nreview in response to concerns that the illegal flow of firearms across the southwestern\r\nborder of the United States is contributing to violence along the border and ultimately\r\nharming the national security of the United States. The Commission has considered\r\nsentencing data, heard testimony, and received comment on the general concern of firearms\r\ncrossing the border illegally and a specific concern that \"straw purchasers\" (i.e., individuals\r\nwho buy firearms on behalf of others, typically \"prohibited persons\" who are not allowed\r\nto buy or possess firearms themselves) are contributing to this illegal flow of firearms to a\r\nsignificant degree.\r\nThe amendment amends the primary firearms guideline, §2K2.1 (Unlawful Receipt,\r\nPossession, or Transportation of Firearms or Ammunition; Prohibited Transactions\r\nInvolving Firearms or Ammunition), to address the general concern of firearms crossing the\r\nborder and the specific concern about straw purchasers. The amendment also amends the\r\nguideline for arms export violations, §2M5.2 (Exportation of Arms, Munitions, or Military\r\nEquipment or Services Without Required Validated Export License), to provide greater\r\npenalties for export offenses involving small arms and more guidance on export offenses\r\n\r\ninvolving ammunition. Finally, the amendment revises the references in Appendix A\r\n(Statutory Index) for certain offenses, including providing a reference for a new offense\r\ncreated by the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act of 2010,\r\nPub. L. 111–195.\r\nFirearms Leaving the United States\r\nSubsection (b)(6) provides a 4-level enhancement, and a minimum offense level of 18, if the\r\ndefendant used or possessed any firearm or ammunition in connection with another felony\r\noffense, or possessed or transferred any firearm or ammunition with knowledge, intent, or\r\nreason to believe that it would be used or possessed in connection with another felony\r\noffense. The amendment establishes a new prong (A) in subsection (b)(6) that applies \"if\r\nthe defendant possessed any firearm or ammunition while leaving or attempting to leave the\r\nUnited States; or possessed or transferred any firearm or ammunition with knowledge,\r\nintent, or reason to believe that it would be transferred out of the United States\", and\r\nredesignates the existing provision as prong (B). Under the amendment, a defendant\r\nreceives the 4-level enhancement and minimum offense level 18 if either prong applies. The\r\nCommission determined that possessing a firearm while leaving or attempting to leave the\r\nUnited States is conduct sufficiently similar in seriousness to possessing a firearm in\r\nconnection with another felony offense to warrant similar punishment. Likewise, possessing\r\nor transferring a firearm with knowledge, intent, or reason to believe that it would be\r\ntransported out of the United States is conduct sufficiently similar in seriousness to\r\npossessing or transferring a firearm with knowledge, intent, or reason to believe that it\r\nwould be used or possessed in connection with another felony offense to warrant similar\r\npunishment.\r\nPrior to the amendment, some courts have applied subsection (b)(6) to cases in which the\r\ndefendant has transported or attempted to transport firearms across the border. These courts\r\nhave concluded that because transporting a firearm outside the United States is generally a\r\nfelony under federal law, such conduct may qualify as \"another felony offense\" for purposes\r\nof subsection (b)(6). See, e.g., United States v. Juarez, 626 F.3d 246 (5th Cir. 2010)\r\n(holding that, under the guideline as amended by the Commission in 2008, the district court\r\ndid not plainly err in applying §2K2.1(b)(6) to a defendant who transferred firearms with\r\nreason to believe they would be taken across the border in a manner that would violate 22\r\nU.S.C. § 2778(b) and (c), which prohibits, among other things, the unlicensed export of\r\ndefense articles and punishes such violations by up to 20 years' imprisonment). However,\r\nfor clarity and to promote consistency of application, the Commission created a separate,\r\ndistinct prong (A) in subsection (b)(6) to cover this conduct.\r\nStraw Purchasers\r\nSecond, the amendment amends §2K2.1 to address the concerns about straw purchasers.\r\nThe amendment increases penalties for certain defendants convicted under 18 U.S.C. §§\r\n922(a)(6) or 924(a)(1)(A) for making a false statement in connection with a firearms\r\ntransaction. Specifically, the amendment increases penalties for a defendant who is\r\nconvicted under 18 U.S.C. §§ 922(a)(6) or 924(a)(1)(A) and committed the offense with\r\nknowledge, intent, or reason to believe that the offense would result in the transfer of a\r\nfirearm or ammunition to a prohibited person. The base offense level for a defendant\r\nconvicted under either of these statutes has been level 12, or level 18 if the offense involved\r\n\r\na firearm described in 26 U.S.C. § 5845(a). See §2K2.1(a)(5), (7). The amendment amends\r\nsubsections (a)(4)(B) and (a)(6) to increase the base offense level for these defendants to\r\nlevel 14, or 20 if the offense involved either a semiautomatic firearm that is capable of\r\naccepting a large capacity magazine or a firearm described in 26 U.S.C. § 5845(a).\r\nThe amendment ensures that defendants convicted under 18 U.S.C. §§ 922(a)(6) or\r\n924(a)(1)(A) receive the same punishment as defendants convicted under a third statute used\r\nto prosecute straw purchasers, 18 U.S.C. § 922(d), when the conduct is similar. Section\r\n922(d) differs from 18 U.S.C. §§ 922(a)(6) and 924(a)(1)(A) in that it requires as an element\r\nof the offense that the defendant sell or otherwise dispose of a firearm or ammunition to a\r\nprohibited person knowing or having reasonable cause to believe that such person is a\r\nprohibited person. Section 2K2.1 has accounted for the increased offense seriousness and\r\noffender culpability in violations of 18 U.S.C. § 922(d) by providing base offense levels for\r\nconvictions under section 922(d) that are generally 2 levels higher than for convictions\r\nunder 18 U.S.C. §§ 922(a)(6) and 924(a)(1)(A). See §2K2.1(a)(4)(B), (a)(6)(B). The\r\nCommission determined that defendants who are convicted under 18 U.S.C. §§ 922(a)(6)\r\nor 924(a)(1)(A) for making a false statement in connection with a firearms transaction and\r\ncommitted the offense with knowledge, intent, or reason to believe that the offense would\r\nresult in the transfer of a firearm or ammunition to a prohibited person have engaged in\r\nconduct similar to the elements of 18 U.S.C. § 922(d), are similarly culpable, and therefore\r\nwarrant a similar sentence under §2K2.1.\r\nIn addition, the amendment provides a new Application Note 15 stating that, in a case in\r\nwhich the defendant is convicted under any of the three statutes, a downward departure may\r\nbe warranted if (A) none of the enhancements in subsection (b) of §2K2.1 apply, (B) the\r\ndefendant was motivated by an intimate or familial relationship or by threats or fear to\r\ncommit the offense and was otherwise unlikely to commit such an offense, and (C) the\r\ndefendant received no monetary compensation from the offense. The Commission\r\ndetermined that a defendant meeting these criteria may be less culpable than the typical\r\nstraw purchaser.\r\nExport Offenses Involving Small Arms or Ammunition\r\nThird, the amendment amends §2M5.2 to narrow the application of the alternative base\r\noffense level of 14 at subsection (a)(2). The alternative base offense level of 14 has applied\r\n\"if the offense involved only non-fully automatic small arms (rifles, handguns, or shotguns)\r\nand the number of weapons did not exceed ten.\" See §2M5.2(a)(2). The amendment\r\nreduces the threshold number of small arms in subsection (a)(2) from ten to two. The\r\nCommission determined that export offenses involving more than two firearms are more\r\nserious and more likely to involve trafficking. Narrowing the application of subsection\r\n(a)(2) also brings §2M5.2 into greater conformity with §2K2.1 in how it accounts for the\r\nnumber of firearms involved in the offense. See §2K2.1(b)(1) (providing a tiered\r\nenhancement of 2 to 10 levels if the offense involved three or more firearms); §2K2.1,\r\ncomment. (n.13) (specifying that the trafficking enhancement in §2K2.1(b)(5) applies if the\r\noffense involved two or more firearms and other requirements are also met).\r\nThe amendment also amends §2M5.2 to address cases in which the defendant possessed\r\nammunition, either in a case involving ammunition only or in a case involving ammunition\r\nand small arms. There appears to be differences in how §2M5.2 is being applied by the\r\n\r\ncourts in such cases. Under the amendment, a defendant with ammunition will receive the\r\nalternative base offense level of 14 if the ammunition consisted of not more than 500 rounds\r\nof ammunition for small arms. Such ammunition typically is sold in quantities of not more\r\nthan 500 rounds, depending on the manufacturer and the type of ammunition. The\r\nCommission determined that, as with export offenses involving more than two firearms,\r\nexport offenses involving more than 500 rounds of ammunition are more serious and more\r\nlikely to involve trafficking.\r\nReferences in Appendix A (Statutory Index)\r\nFourth, the amendment amends Appendix A (Statutory Index) to expand the number of\r\nguidelines to which offenses under 50 U.S.C. § 1705 are referenced. Section 1705 makes\r\nit unlawful to violate, attempt to violate, conspire to violate, or cause a violation of any\r\nlicense, order, regulation, or prohibition issued under the International Emergency Economic\r\nPowers Act (50 U.S.C. § 1701 et seq.). Any person who willfully commits, willfully\r\nattempts or conspires to commit, or aids or abets in the commission of such an unlawful act\r\nmay be imprisoned for not more than 20 years. See 50 U.S.C. § 1705(c). Appendix A\r\n(Statutory Index) previously contained two separate entries: the criminal offense, 50 U.S.C.\r\n§ 1705, was referenced to §2M5.3 (Providing Material Support or Resources to Designated\r\nForeign Terrorist Organizations or Specially Designated Global Terrorists, or For a Terrorist\r\nPurpose), while another statute that contains no criminal offense, 50 U.S.C. § 1701, was\r\nreferenced to §2M5.3 as well as to §§2M5.1 (Evasion of Export Controls; Financial\r\nTransactions with Countries Supporting International Terrorism) and 2M5.2 (Exportation\r\nof Arms, Munitions, or Military Equipment or Services Without Required Validated Export\r\nLicense). The amendment revises the entry for 50 U.S.C. § 1705 to include all three\r\nguidelines, §§2M5.1, 2M5.2, and 2M5.3, and deletes as unnecessary the entry for 50 U.S.C.\r\n§ 1701.\r\nFinally, the amendment addresses a new offense created by the Comprehensive Iran\r\nSanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act of 2010, Pub. L. 111–195. Section 103 of\r\nthat Act (22 U.S.C. § 8512) makes it unlawful to import into the United States certain goods\r\nor services of Iranian origin, or export to Iran certain goods, services, or technology, and\r\nprovides that the penalties under 50 U.S.C. § 1705 apply to a violation. The amendment\r\namends Appendix A (Statutory Index) to reference the new offense at 22 U.S.C. § 8512 to\r\n§§2M5.1, 2M5.2, and 2M5.3.","EffectiveDate":"Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2011."},{"Id":754,"Title":"Amendment 754","Text":"Section 2L1.2(b)(1)(A) is amended by inserting \"if the conviction receives\r\ncriminal history points under Chapter Four or by 12 levels if the conviction does not receive\r\ncriminal history points\" after \"16 levels\".\r\nSection 2L1.2(b)(1)(B) is amended by inserting \"if the conviction receives criminal history\r\npoints under Chapter Four or by 8 levels if the conviction does not receive criminal history\r\npoints\" after \"12 levels\".\r\nThe Commentary to 2L1.2 captioned \"Application Notes\" is amended in Note 1 by adding\r\nat the end the following:\r\n\r\n\"(C) Prior Convictions.—In determining the amount of an enhancement under\r\nsubsection (b)(1), note that the levels in subsections (b)(1)(A) and (B)\r\ndepend on whether the conviction receives criminal history points under\r\nChapter Four (Criminal History and Criminal Livelihood), while\r\nsubsections (b)(1)(C), (D), and (E) apply without regard to whether the\r\nconviction receives criminal history points.\".\r\nThe Commentary to 2L1.2 captioned \"Application Notes\" is amended in Note 7 by inserting\r\nafter \"warranted.

(C)\".","Reason":"Reason for Amendment: This amendment amends §2L1.2 (Unlawfully Entering or\r\nRemaining in the United States) to limit the extent of the enhancement at subsection (b)(1)\r\nprovided for certain offenders. Subsection (b)(1) provides an enhancement if the defendant\r\npreviously was deported, or unlawfully remained in the United States, after a predicate\r\nconviction. The amount of the enhancement ranges from 16 levels to 4 levels, depending\r\non the nature of the prior conviction. Specifically, prior to the amendment, subsection\r\n(b)(1)(A) has provided a 16-level increase for a prior conviction for a felony that is (i) a\r\ndrug trafficking offense for which the sentence imposed exceeded 13 months, (ii) a crime\r\nof violence, (iii) a firearms offense, (iv) a child pornography offense, (v) a national security\r\nor terrorism offense, (vi) a human trafficking offense, or (vii) an alien smuggling offense;\r\nand subsection (b)(1)(B) has provided a 12-level increase for a felony drug trafficking\r\noffense for which the sentence imposed was 13 months or less. Both of these enhancements\r\nhave applied regardless of whether the prior conviction received criminal history points\r\nunder Chapter Four (Criminal History and Criminal Livelihood).\r\nThe amendment reduces the enhancements at subsections (b)(1)(A) and (B) to 12 or 8 levels,\r\nrespectively, if the prior conviction does not receive criminal history points under Chapter\r\nFour. Subsections (b)(1)(A) and (B) as amended continue to provide a 16- or 12-level\r\nenhancement, as applicable, if the prior conviction receives criminal history points under\r\nChapter Four. Thus, for reasons of proportionality, the amendment maintains the 4-level\r\ndistinction between defendants who receive an enhancement under subsection (b)(1)(A) and\r\nthose who receive an enhancement under subsection (b)(1)(B), regardless of whether the\r\nprior conviction receives criminal history points.\r\nThe amendment responds to case law and public comment regarding the magnitude of the\r\nenhancement when a defendant's predicate conviction does not receive criminal history\r\npoints. Compare United States v. Amezcua-Vasquez, 567 F.3d 1050, 1055 (9th Cir. 2009)\r\n(defendant had two convictions that were 25 years old; court stated that the 16-level\r\nenhancement in §2L1.2(b)(1)(A) \"addresses the seriousness of the offense\" but \"does not\r\n. . . justify increasing a defendant's sentence by the same magnitude irrespective of the age\r\nof the prior conviction at the time of reentry\" [emphasis in original]); with United States v.\r\nChavez-Suarez, 597 F.3d 1137, 1139 (10th Cir. 2010) (defendant had a conviction that was\r\n11 years old; court discussed Amezcua-Vasquez but was \"not convinced that this conviction\r\nwas so stale\" as to require the sentencing court to vary downward from the 16-level\r\nenhancement).\r\n\r\nUnder the amendment, defendants with predicate offenses that qualify for an enhancement\r\nunder subsections (b)(1)(A) and (B) continue to receive an enhancement, regardless of\r\nwhether the prior convictions receive criminal history points under Chapter Four. Other\r\nprovisions in the guidelines exclude consideration of a predicate conviction because of the\r\nage of the predicate conviction. See, e.g., §2K1.3 (Unlawful Receipt, Possession, or\r\nTransportation of Explosive Materials; Prohibited Transactions Involving Explosive\r\nMaterials), comment. (n.9); §2K2.1 (Unlawful Receipt, Possession, or Transportation of\r\nFirearms or Ammunition; Prohibited Transactions Involving Firearms or Ammunition),\r\ncomment. (n.10); §4B1.2 (Definitions of Terms Used in Section 4B1.1), comment. (n.3).\r\nThe amendment conforms §2L1.2(b)(1)(A) and (B) more closely to those provisions, but\r\nbecause of the seriousness of the predicate offenses covered by subsection (b)(1)(A) and (B)\r\nreduces, rather than eliminates, the 16- and 12-level enhancements. See, e.g., Amezcua-\r\nVasquez, 567 F.3d at 1055 (acknowledging that it is \"reasonable to take some account of an\r\naggravated felony, no matter how stale, in assessing the seriousness of an unlawful reentry\r\ninto the country\"). See also id. at 1055 (in certain cases in which the prior conviction is\r\n\"stale\", an enhancement may be appropriate to address the \"seriousness\" of the prior\r\nconviction but need not be of the \"same magnitude\"); Chavez-Suarez, 597 F.3d at 1139\r\n(same). For similar reasons, the amendment also adds an upward departure provision at\r\nApplication Note 7 for cases in which the lower 12- or 8-level enhancement does not\r\nadequately reflect the extent or seriousness of the conduct underlying the prior conviction.\r\nConforming changes to the Commentary are also made.","EffectiveDate":"Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2011."},{"Id":755,"Title":"Amendment 755","Text":"The Commentary to §3B1.2 captioned \"Application Notes\" is amended in\r\nNote 3(C) by inserting \"is based on the totality of the circumstances and\" after\r\n\"adjustment,\"; and by striking the last sentence as follows:\r\n\"As with any other factual issue, the court, in weighing the totality of the\r\ncircumstances, is not required to find, based solely on the defendant’s bare\r\nassertion, that such a role adjustment is warranted.\".\r\nThe Commentary to §3B1.2 captioned \"Application Notes\" is amended in Note 4 by striking\r\nthe last sentence as follows:\r\n\"It is intended that the downward adjustment for a minimal participant will be used\r\ninfrequently\".","Reason":"Reason for Amendment: This amendment deletes two sentences from the commentary to\r\n§3B1.2 (Mitigating Role).

Under subsection (b), the court may impose a term of supervised release to\r\nfollow a term of imprisonment of one year or less for any of the reasons set\r\nforth in Application Note 1.\",\r\nand inserting the following:\r\n\"1. Application of Subsection (a).—Under subsection (a), the court is required\r\nto impose a term of supervised release to follow imprisonment when\r\n\r\nsupervised release is required by statute or, except as provided in\r\nsubsection (c), when a sentence of imprisonment of more than one year is\r\nimposed. The court may depart from this guideline and not impose a term\r\nof supervised release if supervised release is not required by statute and the\r\ncourt determines, after considering the factors set forth in Note 3, that\r\nsupervised release is not necessary.\r\n2. Application of Subsection (b).—Under subsection (b), the court may\r\nimpose a term of supervised release to follow a term of imprisonment in\r\nany other case, after considering the factors set forth in Note 3.\r\n3. Factors to Be Considered.—\r\n(A) Statutory Factors.—In determining whether to impose a term of\r\nsupervised release, the court is required by statute to consider,\r\namong other factors:\r\n(i) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history\r\nand characteristics of the defendant;\r\n(ii) the need to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct,\r\nto protect the public from further crimes of the defendant,\r\nand to provide the defendant with needed educational or\r\nvocational training, medical care, or other correctional\r\ntreatment in the most effective manner;\r\n(iii) the need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities among\r\ndefendants with similar records who have been found\r\nguilty of similar conduct; and\r\n(iv) the need to provide restitution to any victims of the\r\noffense.\r\nSee 18 U.S.C. § 3583(c).\r\n(B) Criminal History.—The court should give particular consideration\r\nto the defendant's criminal history (which is one aspect of the\r\n‘history and characteristics of the defendant’ in subparagraph\r\n(A)(i), above). In general, the more serious the defendant's\r\ncriminal history, the greater the need for supervised release.\r\n(C) Substance Abuse.—In a case in which a defendant sentenced to\r\nimprisonment is an abuser of controlled substances or alcohol, it\r\nis highly recommended that a term of supervised release also be\r\nimposed. See §5H1.4 (Physical Condition, Including Drug or\r\nAlcohol Dependence or Abuse; Gambling Addiction).\r\n4. Community Confinement or Home Detention Following Imprisonment.—A\r\nterm of supervised release must be imposed if the court wishes to impose\r\n\r\na ‘split sentence’ under which the defendant serves a term of imprisonment\r\nfollowed by a period of community confinement or home detention\r\npursuant to subsection (c)(2) or (d)(2) of §5C1.1 (Imposition of a Term of\r\nImprisonment). In such a case, the period of community confinement or\r\nhome detention is imposed as a condition of supervised release.\r\n5. Application of Subsection (c).—In a case in which the defendant is a\r\ndeportable alien specified in subsection (c) and supervised release is not\r\nrequired by statute, the court ordinarily should not impose a term of\r\nsupervised release. Unless such a defendant legally returns to the United\r\nStates, supervised release is unnecessary. If such a defendant illegally\r\nreturns to the United States, the need to afford adequate deterrence and\r\nprotect the public ordinarily is adequately served by a new prosecution.\r\nThe court should, however, consider imposing a term of supervised release\r\non such a defendant if the court determines it would provide an added\r\nmeasure of deterrence and protection based on the facts and circumstances\r\nof a particular case.\".\r\nSection 5D1.2(a) is amended in subdivision (1) by striking \"three\" and inserting \"two\"; and\r\nby adding at the end the following: \"See 18 U.S.C. § 3583(b)(1).\".\r\nSection 5D1.2(a) is amended in subdivision (2) by striking \"two years\" and inserting \"one\r\nyear\"; and by adding at the end the following: \"See 18 U.S.C. § 3583(b)(2).\".\r\nSection 5D1.2(a) is amended in subdivision (3) by adding at the end the following: \"See 18\r\nU.S.C. § 3583(b)(3).\".\r\nThe Commentary to §5D1.2 captioned \"Application Notes\" is amended by adding at the end\r\nthe following:\r\n\"4. Factors Considered.—The factors to be considered in determining the\r\nlength of a term of supervised release are the same as the factors considered\r\nin determining whether to impose such a term. See 18 U.S.C. § 3583(c);\r\nApplication Note 3 to §5D1.1 (Imposition of a Term of Supervised\r\nRelease). The court should ensure that the term imposed on the defendant\r\nis long enough to address the purposes of imposing supervised release on\r\nthe defendant.\r\n5. Early Termination and Extension.—The court has authority to terminate or\r\nextend a term of supervised release. See 18 U.S.C. § 3583(e)(1), (2). The\r\ncourt is encouraged to exercise this authority in appropriate cases. The\r\nprospect of exercising this authority is a factor the court may wish to\r\nconsider in determining the length of a term of supervised release. For\r\nexample, the court may wish to consider early termination of supervised\r\nrelease if the defendant is an abuser of narcotics, other controlled\r\nsubstances, or alcohol who, while on supervised release, successfully\r\ncompletes a treatment program, thereby reducing the risk to the public from\r\nfurther crimes of the defendant.\".","Reason":"Reason for Amendment: This amendment makes revisions to the supervised release\r\nguidelines, §5D1.1 (Imposition of a Term of Supervised Release) and §5D1.2 (Term of\r\nSupervised Release), in response to both the findings in the Commission’s July 2010 report,\r\nFederal Offenders Sentenced to Supervised Release, and changes in federal immigration law\r\nand the federal offender population in recent years.\r\nFirst, the amendment creates an exception to the general rule in §5D1.1(a) that a term of\r\nsupervised release be imposed when a sentence of imprisonment of more than one year is\r\nimposed or when required by statute. The exception, which appears in a new subsection (c)\r\nin §5D1.1, states that supervised release ordinarily should not be imposed in a case in which\r\nsupervised release is not required by statute and the defendant is a deportable alien who\r\nlikely will be deported after imprisonment. A corresponding application note explains that\r\nimposing supervised release in such a case is generally unnecessary, although there may be\r\nparticular cases in which it is appropriate. Non-citizens now are approximately half of the\r\noverall population of federal offenders, see 2010 Sourcebook of Federal Sentencing\r\nStatistics, Table 9 (showing that 47.5% of federal offenders in fiscal year 2010 were non-\r\ncitizens), and supervised release is imposed in more than 91 percent of cases in which the\r\ndefendant is a non-citizen, see Federal Offenders Sentenced to Supervised Release at 60.\r\nThe Commission determined that such a high rate of imposition of supervised release for\r\nnon-citizen offenders is unnecessary because \"recent changes in our immigration law have\r\nmade removal nearly an automatic result for a broad class of noncitizen offenders.\" Padilla\r\nv. Kentucky, 130 S. Ct. 1473, 1481 (2010); see also id. at 1478 (\"[D]eportation or removal\r\n. . . is now virtually inevitable for a vast number of noncitizens convicted of crimes.\").\r\nFurthermore, such offenders likely would face prosecution for a new offense under the\r\nfederal immigration laws if they were to return illegally to the United States.\r\nSecond, the amendment lowers the minimum term of supervised release required by the\r\nguidelines for certain defendants (regardless of their citizenship status) when a statute does\r\nnot require a higher minimum term. Section 5D1.2 requires the court to impose a term of\r\nsupervised release of at least three years when the defendant is convicted of a Class A or B\r\nfelony and at least two years when the defendant is convicted of a Class C or D felony. The\r\namendment lowers these minimum terms to two years for a defendant convicted of a Class\r\nA and B felony and one year for a defendant convicted of a Class C or D felony. Thus, for\r\nreasons of proportionality, the amendment maintains a 1-year distinction in the minimum\r\nterm of supervised release between a defendant convicted of a Class A or B felony and a\r\ndefendant convicted of a Class C or D felony. The Commission determined that these lesser\r\nminimum terms should be sufficient in most cases because research indicates that the\r\nmajority of defendants who violate a condition of supervised release do so during the first\r\nyear of the term of supervised release. See Federal Offenders Sentenced to Supervised\r\nRelease at 63 & n. 265. Furthermore, if an offender shows non-compliance during such a\r\nminimum term, the court may extend the term of supervision up to the statutory maximum.\r\nSee 18 U.S.C. § 3583(e)(2). The amendment also adds commentary at new Application\r\nNote 5 encouraging courts to exercise their authority to terminate supervised release at any\r\ntime after the expiration of one year of supervised release in appropriate cases. See 18\r\nU.S.C. § 3583(e)(1).\r\nFinally, the amendment adds commentary in §§5D1.1 and 5D1.2 that provides guidance on\r\nthe factors a court should consider in deciding whether to order a term of supervised release\r\n(when not required by statute) and, if so, how long such a term should be. Such factors\r\n\r\nNovember 1, 2011 APPENDIX C - VOLUME III Amendment 757\r\ninclude the extent of an offender’s criminal record, which research shows to be predictive\r\nof an offender’s likelihood of complying with the conditions of supervision.

Booker, 543 U.S. 220 (2005). Specifically,\r\nit amends §6B1.2 to provide standards for acceptance of plea agreements when the sentence\r\nis outside the applicable guideline range, including when the sentence is a \"variance\" (i.e.,\r\na sentence that is outside the guidelines framework). These changes to §6B1.2 are\r\nconsistent with the changes to §1B1.1 (Application Instructions) that the Commission\r\npromulgated last year, see USSG App. C, Amendment 741 (effective November 1, 2010),\r\nand reflect Booker and subsequent case law.\r\nThe amendment also responds to the Federal Judiciary Administrative Improvements Act\r\nof 2010, Pub. L. 111–174 (enacted May 27, 2010), which amended 18 U.S.C. § 3553(c)(2)\r\nto require that the reasons for a sentence be set forth in the statement of reasons form (rather\r\nthan in the judgment and commitment order). The amendment makes appropriate clerical\r\nchanges to §6B1.2 and subsection (e) of §5K2.0 (Grounds for Departure) to reflect this\r\nstatutory change.\r\nCoast Guard Authorization Act of 2010\r\nSecond, the amendment responds to the Coast Guard Authorization Act of 2010, Pub. L.\r\n111–281 (enacted October 15, 2010), which provided statutory sentencing enhancements\r\nfor certain offenses under 18 U.S.C. § 2237 (Criminal sanctions for failure to heave to,\r\nobstruction of boarding, or providing false information) and created a new criminal offense\r\nat 33 U.S.C. § 3851.\r\nThe amendment addresses the section 2237 offenses by expanding the range of guidelines\r\nto which certain section 2237 offenses are referenced. Section 2237 makes it unlawful for—\r\nthe operator of a vessel to knowingly fail to obey a law enforcement order to heave\r\nto, see 18 U.S.C. § 2237(a)(1);\r\na person on board a vessel to forcibly interfere with a law enforcement boarding or\r\nother law enforcement action, or to resist arrest, see 18 U.S.C. § 2237(a)(2)(A); or\r\na person on board a vessel to provide materially false information to a law\r\nenforcement officer during a boarding regarding the vessel's destination, origin,\r\nownership, registration, nationality, cargo, or crew, see 18 U.S.C. § 2237(a)(2)(B).\r\nAll three of these offenses are punishable by not more than 5 years of imprisonment. The\r\nfirst two are referenced in Appendix A (Statutory Index) to §2A2.4 (Obstructing or\r\nImpeding Officers); the third is referenced to §2B1.1 (Theft, Property Destruction, and\r\nFraud). However, the Coast Guard Authorization Act of 2010 provided statutory sentencing\r\nenhancements that apply to persons convicted under either of the first two offenses under\r\nsection 2237 (i.e., the failure-to-heave-to and forcible-interference offenses referenced to\r\n§2A2.4; the statutory sentencing enhancements do not apply to the false-information offense\r\n\r\nreferenced to §2B1.1). The amendment addresses these new statutory sentencing\r\nenhancements by referencing them in Appendix A (Statutory Index) to Chapter Two offense\r\nguidelines most analogous to the conduct forming the basis for the statutory sentencing\r\nenhancements, as follows.\r\nIf the section 2237 offense results in death, the statutory maximum term of imprisonment\r\nis raised to any term of years or life. See 18 U.S.C. § 2237(b)(2)(B)(i). The Commission\r\nreferenced this statutory sentencing enhancement to §§2A1.3 (Voluntary Manslaughter) and\r\n2A1.4 (Involuntary Manslaughter) because the statutory sentencing enhancement involves\r\ndeath without proof of malice aforethought.\r\nIf the section 2237 offense involves an attempt to kill, kidnapping or an attempt to kidnap,\r\nor an offense under 18 U.S.C. § 2241 (aggravated sexual abuse), the statutory maximum\r\nterm of imprisonment likewise is raised to any term of years or life. See 18 U.S.C. §\r\n2237(b)(2)(B)(ii). The Commission referenced this statutory sentencing enhancement to\r\n§§2A2.1 (Assault with Intent to Commit Murder; Attempted Murder) and 2A2.2\r\n(Aggravated Assault) to account for when the section 2237 offense involves an attempt to\r\nkill, because those guidelines apply to attempted murder and attempted manslaughter,\r\nrespectively; to §2A3.1 (Criminal Sexual Abuse; Attempt to Commit Criminal Sexual\r\nAbuse) to account for when the section 2237 offense involves an offense under 18 U.S.C.\r\n§ 2241, because offenses under section 2241 are referenced to that guideline; and to §2A4.1\r\n(Kidnapping, Abduction, Unlawful Restraint) to account for when the section 2237 offense\r\ninvolves kidnapping or attempted kidnapping, because that guideline applies to kidnapping.\r\nIf the section 2237 offense results in serious bodily injury, the statutory maximum term of\r\nimprisonment is raised to 15 years. See 18 U.S.C. § 2237(b)(3). The Commission\r\nreferenced this statutory sentencing enhancement to §2A2.2 because a section 2237 offense\r\ninvolving this statutory sentencing enhancement is similar to an assault that results in bodily\r\ninjury, and that guideline applies to such an assault. See USSG §2A2.2, comment. (n.1)\r\n(defining aggravated assault to include any assault that involved serious bodily injury).\r\nIf the section 2237 offense involves knowing transportation under inhumane conditions, and\r\nis committed in the course of a violation of 8 U.S.C. § 1324; chapter 77 of title 18, United\r\nStates Code; or section 113 or 117 of such title, the statutory maximum term of\r\nimprisonment is raised to 15 years. See 18 U.S.C. § 2237(b)(4). The Commission\r\nreferenced this statutory sentencing enhancement to the following guidelines:\r\nto §§2A2.1 (Assault with Intent to Commit Murder; Attempted Murder) and 2A2.2\r\nto account for when the section 2237 offense involves a violation of section 113,\r\nbecause section 113 offenses are referenced to those guidelines;\r\nto §§2G1.1 (Promoting a Commercial Sex Act or Prohibited Sexual Conduct with\r\nan Individual Other than a Minor), 2G1.3 (Promoting a Commercial Sex Act or\r\nProhibited Sexual Conduct with a Minor; Transportation of Minors to Engage in a\r\nCommercial Sex Act or Prohibited Sexual Conduct; Travel to Engage in\r\nCommercial Sex Act or Prohibited Sexual Conduct with a Minor; Sex Trafficking\r\nof Children; Use of Interstate Facilities to Transport Information about a Minor),\r\nand 2G2.1 (Sexually Exploiting a Minor by Production of Sexually Explicit Visual\r\nor Printed Material; Custodian Permitting Minor to Engage in Sexually Explicit\r\n\r\nConduct; Advertisement for Minors to Engage in Production) to account for when\r\nthe section 2237 offense involve a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1591 (which is within\r\nchapter 77), because offenses under section 1591 are referenced to those guidelines;\r\nto §2H4.1 (Peonage, Involuntary Servitude, Slave Trade, and Child Soldiers) to\r\naccount for when the section 2237 offense involves a violation of any provision of\r\nchapter 77 other than 18 U.S.C. § 1591, because such violations generally are\r\nreferenced to that guideline; and\r\nto §2L1.1 (Smuggling, Transporting, or Harboring an Unlawful Alien) to account\r\nfor when the section 2237 offense involves a violation of 8 U.S.C. § 1324, because\r\nsection 1324 offenses are referenced to that guideline.\r\nFinally, the amendment addresses the new criminal offense at 33 U.S.C. § 3851, which\r\nmakes it a felony, punishable by imprisonment for not more than six years, to sell or\r\ndistribute an organotin or to sell, distribute, make, use, or apply an anti-fouling system (e.g.,\r\npaint) containing an organotin. The Commission referenced this offense to §2Q1.2\r\n(Mishandling of Hazardous or Toxic Substances or Pesticides; Recordkeeping, Tampering,\r\nand Falsification; Unlawfully Transporting Hazardous Materials in Commerce) because the\r\noffense involves pesticides known to be toxic.","EffectiveDate":"Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2011."},{"Id":758,"Title":"Amendment 758","Text":"Chapter Two is amended in the introductory commentary by inserting \"and\r\nRelated Adjustments\" after \"(Obstruction\".\r\nThe Commentary to §2J1.2 captioned \"Application Notes\" is amended in Note 2(A) by\r\ninserting \"and Related Adjustments\" after \"(Obstruction\"; and in Note 3 by inserting \"and\r\nRelated Adjustments\" after \"(Obstruction\".\r\nThe Commentary to §2J1.3 captioned \"Application Notes\" is amended in Note 2 by inserting\r\n\"and Related Adjustments\" after \"(Obstruction\"; and in Note 3 by inserting \"and Related\r\nAdjustments\" after \"(Obstruction\".\r\nThe Commentary to §2J1.6 captioned \"Application Notes\" is amended in Note 2 by inserting\r\n\"and Related Adjustments\" after \"(Obstruction\"; and in Note 4 by striking \"Obstruction of\r\nJustice\" and inserting \"Obstructing or Impeding the Administration of Justice\".\r\nThe Commentary to §2J1.9 captioned \"Application Notes\" is amended in Note 1 by inserting\r\n\"and Related Adjustments\" after \"(Obstruction\"; and in Note 2 by inserting \"and Related\r\nAdjustments\" after \"(Obstruction\".\r\nSection 2Q2.1(c)(1) is amended by inserting \"or paleontological resource\" after \"heritage\r\nresource\"; and by inserting \"or Paleontological Resources\" after \"Heritage Resources\" in\r\nboth places.\r\nSection 3C1.1 is amended by striking \"(A)\" and inserting \"(1)\"; by striking \"(B)\" and\r\ninserting \"(2)\"; by striking \"(i)\" and inserting \"(A)\"; and by striking \"(ii)\" and inserting\r\n\"(B)\".\r\n\r\nSection 4A1.2(k)(2) is amended by striking \"(i)\" and inserting \"(A)\"; by striking \"(ii)\" and\r\ninserting \"(B)\"; and by striking \"(iii)\" and inserting \"(C)\".\r\nSection 4B1.1(b) is amended by redesignating (A) through (G) as (1) through (7).\r\nThe Commentary to §5E1.2 captioned \"Application Notes\" is amended in Note 6 by\r\ninserting \"and Related Adjustments\" after \"(Obstruction\".\r\nThe Commentary to §8A1.2 captioned \"Application Notes\" is amended in Note 2 by\r\ninserting \"and Related Adjustments\" after \"(Obstruction\".\r\nSection 8B2.1(a) is amended by striking \"(c)\" and inserting \"(b)\".\r\nThe Commentary to §8C2.3 captioned \"Application Notes\" is amended in Note 2 by\r\ninserting \"and Related Adjustments\" after \"(Obstruction\".","Reason":"Reason for Amendment: This amendment makes various technical and conforming\r\nchanges to the guidelines.\r\nFirst, the amendment makes certain technical and conforming changes in connection with\r\nthe amendments that the Commission submitted to Congress on April 29, 2010. See 75 Fed.\r\nReg. 27388 (May 14, 2010); USSG App. C, Amendments 738–746. Those changes are as\r\nfollows:\r\n(1) Amendment 744 made changes to the organizational guidelines in Chapter\r\nEight, including a change that consolidated subsections (b) and (c) of\r\n§8D1.4 (Recommended Conditions of Probation — Organizations) into a\r\nsingle subsection (b). To reflect this consolidation, subsection (a) of\r\n§8B2.1 (Effective Compliance and Ethics Program) is changed so that it\r\nrefers to the correct subsection of §8D1.4.\r\n(2) Amendment 745 expanded the scope of §2B1.5 (Theft of, Damage to, or\r\nDestruction of, Cultural Heritage Resources; Unlawful Sale, Purchase,\r\nExchange, Transportation, or Receipt of Cultural Heritage Resources) to\r\ncover not only cultural heritage resources but also paleontological\r\nresources. To reflect this expanded scope, a conforming change is made to\r\nsubsection (c)(1) of §2Q2.1 (Offenses Involving Fish, Wildlife, and Plants).\r\nSecond, the amendment makes technical changes to §3C1.1 (Obstructing or Impeding the\r\nAdministration of Justice), subsection (k)(2) of §4A1.2 (Definitions and Instructions for\r\nComputing Criminal History), and subsection (b) of §4B1.1 (Career Offender) to promote\r\nstylistic consistency in how subdivisions are designated throughout the Guidelines Manual.\r\nFinally, the amendment makes a series of changes throughout the Guidelines Manual to\r\nprovide full and accurate references to the titles of Chapter Three, Part C (Obstruction and\r\nRelated Adjustments) and §3C1.1.","EffectiveDate":"Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2011."},{"Id":759,"Title":"Amendment 759","Text":"Section 1B1.10(b) is amended in subdivision (2) by striking \"Limitations\" and\r\ninserting \"Limitation\"; in subdivision (2)(A) by striking \"In General\" and inserting\r\n\"Limitation\"; in subdivision (2)(B) by inserting \"for Substantial Assistance\" after\r\n\"Exception\"; by striking \"original\"; by inserting \"pursuant to a government motion to reflect\r\nthe defendant's substantial assistance to authorities\" after \"of sentencing\"; and by striking\r\nthe last sentence as follows:\r\n\"However, if the original term of imprisonment constituted a non-guideline sentence\r\ndetermined pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a) and United States v.

For example, in a case in\r\nwhich: (A) the guideline range applicable to the defendant at the time of sentencing\r\nwas 70 to 87 months; (B) the defendant’s original term of imprisonment imposed\r\nwas 56 months (representing a downward departure of 20 percent below the\r\nminimum term of imprisonment provided by the guideline range applicable to the\r\ndefendant at the time of sentencing); and (C) the amended guideline range\r\ndetermined under subsection (b)(1) is 57 to 71 months, a reduction to a term of\r\nimprisonment of 46 months (representing a reduction of approximately 20 percent\r\nbelow the minimum term of imprisonment provided by the amended guideline range\r\ndetermined under subsection (b)(1)) would amount to a comparable reduction and\r\nmay be appropriate.\",\r\nand inserting the following new paragraphs:\r\n\"If the term of imprisonment imposed was outside the guideline range applicable\r\nto the defendant at the time of sentencing, the limitation in subsection (b)(2)(A) also\r\napplies. Thus, if the term of imprisonment imposed in the example provided above\r\n\r\nwas not a sentence of 70 months (within the guidelines range) but instead was a\r\nsentence of 56 months (constituting a downward departure or variance), the court\r\nlikewise may reduce the defendant's term of imprisonment, but shall not reduce it\r\nto a term less than 51 months.\r\nSubsection (b)(2)(B) provides an exception to this limitation, which applies if the\r\nterm of imprisonment imposed was less than the term of imprisonment provided by\r\nthe guideline range applicable to the defendant at the time of sentencing pursuant\r\nto a government motion to reflect the defendant's substantial assistance to\r\nauthorities. In such a case, the court may reduce the defendant's term, but the\r\nreduction is not limited by subsection (b)(2)(A) to the minimum of the amended\r\nguideline range. Instead, as provided in subsection (b)(2)(B), the court may, if\r\nappropriate, provide a reduction comparably less than the amended guideline range.\r\nThus, if the term of imprisonment imposed in the example provided above was 56\r\nmonths pursuant to a government motion to reflect the defendant's substantial\r\nassistance to authorities (representing a downward departure of 20 percent below\r\nthe minimum term of imprisonment provided by the guideline range applicable to\r\nthe defendant at the time of sentencing), a reduction to a term of imprisonment of\r\n41 months (representing a reduction of approximately 20 percent below the\r\nminimum term of imprisonment provided by the amended guideline range) would\r\namount to a comparable reduction and may be appropriate.\r\nThe provisions authorizing such a government motion are §5K1.1 (Substantial\r\nAssistance to Authorities) (authorizing, upon government motion, a downward\r\ndeparture based on the defendant's substantial assistance); 18 U.S.C. § 3553(e)\r\n(authorizing the court, upon government motion, to impose a sentence below a\r\nstatutory minimum to reflect the defendant's substantial assistance); and Fed.

Ct. 2683 (2010).\".","Reason":"Reason for Amendment: This amendment amends §1B1.10 (Reduction in Term of\r\nImprisonment as a Result of Amended Guideline Range) (Policy Statement) in four ways.\r\nFirst, it expands the listing in §1B1.10(c) to implement the directive in 28 U.S.C. § 994(u)\r\nwith respect to guideline amendments that may be considered for retroactive application.\r\nSecond, it amends §1B1.10 to change the limitations that apply in cases in which the term\r\nof imprisonment was less than the minimum of the applicable guideline range at the time of\r\nsentencing. Third, it amends the commentary to §1B1.10 to address an application issue\r\nabout what constitutes the \"applicable guideline range\" for purposes of §1B1.10. Fourth,\r\nit adds an application note to §1B1.10 to specify that the court shall use the version of\r\n§1B1.10 that is in effect on the date on which the court reduces the defendant's term of\r\nimprisonment as provided by 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2).\r\nFirst, the Commission has determined, under the applicable standards set forth in the\r\nbackground commentary to §1B1.10, that Amendment 750 (Parts A and C only) should be\r\nincluded in §1B1.10(c) as an amendment that may be considered for retroactive application.\r\nPart A amended the Drug Quantity Table in §2D1.1 (Unlawful Manufacturing, Importing,\r\nExporting, or Trafficking (Including Possession with Intent to Commit These Offenses);\r\nAttempt or Conspiracy) for crack cocaine and made related revisions to Application Note\r\n10 to §2D1.1. Part C deleted the cross reference in §2D2.1(b) under which an offender who\r\npossessed more than 5 grams of crack cocaine was sentenced under §2D1.1.\r\nUnder the applicable standards set forth in the background commentary to §1B1.10, the\r\nCommission considers, among other factors, (1) the purpose of the amendment, (2) the\r\nmagnitude of the change in the guideline range made by the amendment, and (3) the\r\ndifficulty of applying the amendment retroactively. See §1B1.10, comment. (backg'd.).\r\nApplying those standards to Parts A and C of Amendment 750, the Commission determined\r\nthat, among other factors:\r\n(1) The purpose of Parts A and C of Amendment 750 was to account for the changes\r\nin the statutory penalties made by the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010, Pub. L.\r\n111–220, 124 Stat. 2372, for offenses involving cocaine base (\"crack cocaine\").\r\nSee USSG App. C, Amend. 750 (Reason for Amendment). The Fair Sentencing Act\r\nof 2010 did not contain a provision making the statutory changes retroactive. The\r\nAct directed the Commission to promulgate guideline amendments implementing\r\nthe Act. The guideline amendments implementing the Act have the effect of\r\nreducing the term of imprisonment recommended in the guidelines for certain\r\ndefendants, and the Commission has a statutory duty to consider whether the\r\n\r\nresulting guideline amendments should be made available for retroactive\r\napplication. See 28 U.S.C. § 994(u) (\"If the Commission reduces the term of\r\nimprisonment recommended in the guidelines . . . it shall specify in what\r\ncircumstances and by what amount sentences of prisoners . . . may be reduced.\").\r\nIn carrying out its statutory duty to consider whether to give Amendment 750\r\nretroactive effect, the Commission also considered the purpose of the underlying\r\nstatutory changes made by the Act. Those statutory changes reflect congressional\r\naction consistent with the Commission's long-held position that the then-existing\r\nstatutory penalty structure for crack cocaine \"significantly undermines the various\r\ncongressional objectives set forth in the Sentencing Reform Act and elsewhere\" (see\r\nUSSG App. C, Amend. 706 (Reason for Amendment)). The Fair Sentencing Act\r\nof 2010 specified in its statutory text that its purpose was to \"restore fairness to\r\nFederal cocaine sentencing\" and provide \"cocaine sentencing disparity reduction\".\r\nSee 124 Stat. at 2372.\r\nIt is important to note that the inclusion of Amendment 750 (Parts A and C) in\r\n§1B1.10(c) only allows the guideline changes to be considered for retroactive\r\napplication; it does not make any of the statutory changes in the Fair Sentencing Act\r\nof 2010 retroactive.\r\n(2) The number of cases potentially involved is substantial, and the magnitude of the\r\nchange in the guideline range is significant. As indicated in the Commission’s\r\nanalysis of cases potentially eligible for retroactive application of Parts A and C of\r\nAmendment 750, approximately 12,000 offenders would be eligible to seek a\r\nreduced sentence and the average sentence reduction would be approximately 23\r\npercent.\r\n(3) The administrative burdens of applying Parts A and C of Amendment 750\r\nretroactively are manageable. This determination was informed by testimony at the\r\nCommission's June 1, 2011, public hearing on retroactivity and by other public\r\ncomment received by the Commission on retroactivity. The Commission also\r\nconsidered the administrative burdens that were involved when its 2007 crack\r\ncocaine amendments were applied retroactively. See USSG App. C, Amendments\r\n706 and 711 (amending the guidelines applicable to crack cocaine, effective\r\nNovember 1, 2007) and Amendment 713 (expanding the listing in §1B1.10(c) to\r\ninclude Amendments 706 and 711 as amendments that may be considered for\r\nretroactive application, effective March 3, 2008). The Commission received\r\ncomment and testimony indicating that those burdens were manageable and that\r\nmotions routinely were decided based on the filings, without the need for a hearing\r\nor the presence of the defendant, and did not constitute full resentencings. The\r\nCommission determined that applying Parts A and C of Amendment 750 would\r\nlikewise be manageable, given that, among other things, significantly fewer cases\r\nwould be involved. As indicated in the Commission’s Preliminary Crack Cocaine\r\nRetroactivity Report (April 2011 Data) regarding retroactive application of the 2007\r\ncrack cocaine amendments, approximately 25,500 offenders have requested a\r\nsentence reduction pursuant to retroactive application of the 2007 crack cocaine\r\namendments and approximately 16,500 of those requests have been granted.\r\nIn addition, public safety will be considered in every case because §1B1.10 requires the\r\n\r\ncourt, in determining whether and to what extent a reduction in the defendant’s term of\r\nimprisonment is warranted, to consider the nature and seriousness of the danger to any\r\nperson or the community that may be posed by such a reduction. See §1B1.10, comment.\r\n(n.1(B)(ii)).\r\nSecond, in light of public comment and testimony and recent case law, the amendment\r\namends §1B1.10 to change the limitations that apply in cases in which the term of\r\nimprisonment was less than the minimum of the applicable guideline range at the time of\r\nsentencing. Under the amendment, the general limitation in subsection (b)(2)(A) continues\r\nto be that the court shall not reduce the defendant's term of imprisonment to a term that is\r\nless than the minimum of the amended guideline range. The amendment restricts the\r\nexception in subsection (b)(2)(B) to cases involving a government motion to reflect the\r\ndefendant's substantial assistance to authorities (i.e., under §5K1.1 (Substantial Assistance\r\nto Authorities), 18 U.S.C. § 3553(e), or Fed. R. Crim. P. 35(b)). For those cases, a reduction\r\ncomparably less than the amended guideline range may be appropriate.\r\nThe version of §1B1.10 currently in effect draws a different distinction for cases in which\r\nthe term of imprisonment was less than the minimum of the applicable guideline range, one\r\nrule for downward departures (stating that \"a reduction comparably less than the amended\r\nguideline range . . . may be appropriate\") and another rule for variances (stating that \"a\r\nfurther reduction generally would not be appropriate\"). See §1B1.10(b)(2)(B). The\r\nCommission has received public comment and testimony indicating that this distinction has\r\nbeen difficult to apply and has prompted litigation. The Commission has determined that,\r\nin the specific context of §1B1.10, a single limitation applicable to both departures and\r\nvariances furthers the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities and avoids litigation\r\nin individual cases. The limitation that prohibits a reduction below the amended guideline\r\nrange in such cases promotes conformity with the amended guideline range and avoids\r\nundue complexity and litigation.\r\nNonetheless, the Commission has determined that, in a case in which the term of\r\nimprisonment was below the guideline range pursuant to a government motion to reflect the\r\ndefendant's substantial assistance to authorities (e.g., under §5K1.1), a reduction comparably\r\nless than the amended guideline range may be appropriate. Section 5K1.1 implements the\r\ndirective to the Commission in its organic statute to \"assure that the guidelines reflect the\r\ngeneral appropriateness of imposing a lower sentence than would otherwise be imposed . . .\r\nto take into account a defendant's substantial assistance in the investigation or prosecution\r\nof another person who has committed an offense.\" See 28 U.S.C. § 994(n). For other\r\nprovisions authorizing such a government motion, see 18 U.S.C. § 3553(e) (authorizing the\r\ncourt, upon government motion, to impose a sentence below a statutory minimum to reflect\r\na defendant's substantial assistance); Fed. R. Crim. P. 35(b) (authorizing the court, upon\r\ngovernment motion, to reduce a sentence to reflect a defendant's substantial assistance). The\r\nguidelines and the relevant statutes have long recognized that defendants who provide\r\nsubstantial assistance are differently situated than other defendants and should be considered\r\nfor a sentence below a guideline or statutory minimum even when defendants who are\r\notherwise similar (but did not provide substantial assistance) are subject to a guideline or\r\nstatutory minimum. Applying this principle when the guideline range has been reduced and\r\nmade available for retroactive application under section 3582(c)(2) appropriately maintains\r\nthis distinction and furthers the purposes of sentencing.\r\n\r\nNovember 1, 2011 APPENDIX C - VOLUME III Amendment 760\r\nThird, the amendment amends the commentary to §1B1.10 to address an application issue.\r\nCircuits have conflicting interpretations about when, if at all, the court applies a departure\r\nprovision before determining the \"applicable guideline range\" for purposes of §1B1.10. The\r\nFirst, Second, and Fourth Circuits have held that, for §1B1.10 purposes, at least some\r\ndepartures (e.g., departures under §4A1.3 (Departures Based on Inadequacy of Criminal\r\nHistory Category) (Policy Statement)) are considered before determining the applicable\r\nguideline range, while the Sixth, Eighth, and Tenth Circuits have held that \"the only\r\napplicable guideline range is the one established before any departures\". See United States\r\nv. Guyton, 636 F.3d 316, 320 (7th Cir. 2011) (collecting and discussing cases; holding that\r\ndepartures under §5K1.1 are considered after determining the applicable guideline range but\r\ndeclining to address whether departures under §4A1.3 are considered before or after).\r\nEffective November 1, 2010, the Commission amended §1B1.1 (Application Instructions)\r\nto provide a three-step approach in determining the sentence to be imposed. See USSG App.\r\nC, Amend. 741 (Reason for Amendment). Under §1B1.1 as so amended, the court first\r\ndetermines the guideline range and then considers departures. Id. (\"As amended, subsection\r\n(a) addresses how to apply the provisions in the Guidelines Manual to properly determine\r\nthe kinds of sentence and the guideline range. Subsection (b) addresses the need to consider\r\nthe policy statements and commentary to determine whether a departure is warranted.\").\r\nConsistent with the three-step approach adopted by Amendment 741 and reflected in\r\n§1B1.1, the amendment adopts the approach of the Sixth, Eighth, and Tenth Circuits and\r\namends Application Note 1 to clarify that the applicable guideline range referred to in\r\n§1B1.10 is the guideline range determined pursuant to §1B1.1(a), which is determined\r\nbefore consideration of any departure provision in the Guidelines Manual or any variance.\r\nFourth, the amendment adds an application note to §1B1.10 to specify that, consistent with\r\nsubsection (a) of §1B1.11 (Use of Guidelines Manual in Effect on Date of Sentencing), the\r\ncourt shall use the version of §1B1.10 that is in effect on the date on which the court reduces\r\nthe defendant's term of imprisonment as provided by 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2).\r\nFinally, the amendment amends the commentary to §1B1.10 to refer to Dillon v. United\r\nStates, 130 S. Ct. 2683 (2010). In Dillon, the Supreme Court concluded that proceedings\r\nunder section 3582(c)(2) are not governed by United States v. Booker, 543 U.S. 220 (2005),\r\nand that §1B1.10 remains binding on courts in such proceedings.","EffectiveDate":"Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2011."},{"Id":760,"Title":"Amendment 760","Text":"The Commentary to §2D1.1 captioned \"Application Notes\" is amended in\r\nNote 3(A) by striking \", and 2D2.1(b)(1)\"; and inserting \"and\" before \"2D1.12(c)(1)\".\r\nThe Commentary to §2J1.1 captioned \"Application Notes\" is amended in each of Note 2 and\r\nNote 3 by striking \"§2B1.1(b)(8)(C)\" and inserting \"§2B1.1(b)(9)(C)\".\r\nThe Commentary to §2K2.4 captioned \"Application Notes\" is amended in Note 4 in the third\r\nparagraph by striking \"§2K2.1(b)(6)\" and inserting \"§2K2.1(b)(6)(B)\" in both places.\r\nThe Commentary following §3D1.5 captioned \"Illustrations of the Operation of the\r\nMultiple-Count Rules\" is amended in Note 3 by striking \"§2B1.1(b)(9)\" and inserting\r\n\"§2B1.1(b)(10)\".","Reason":"Reason for Amendment: This amendment makes certain technical and conforming\r\nchanges in connection with certain recently promulgated amendments.
