This document contains the principal statutory provisions governing sentencing, the Sentencing
Commission, and the drafting of sentencing guidelines, as of May 1, 2016.
APPENDIX B
SELECTED SENTENCING STATUTES
This appendix sets forth the principal statutory provisions governing sentencing, the Sentencing
Commission, and the drafting of sentencing guidelines, as of May 1, 2016, as follows:
Title 18. First, it sets forth relevant provisions of title 18, United States Code (Crimes and Crimi-
nal Procedure), as extracted from the following chapters of title 18:
● Chapter 227 (Sentences);
● Chapter 229 (Postsentence Administration);
● Chapter 232 (Miscellaneous Sentencing Provisions); and
● Chapter 235 (Appeal).
Title 28. Second, it sets forth relevant provisions of title 28, United States Code (Judiciary and
Judicial Procedure), as extracted from the following chapter of title 28:
● Chapter 58 (United States Sentencing Commission).
Public Laws Governing the Commission and the Drafting of Sentencing Guidelines. Third, it
sets forth other relevant provisions of freestanding public laws governing the Commission and
the drafting of sentencing guidelines (e.g., congressional directives). These provisions ordinarily
appear in the United States Code in the notes following 28 U.S.C. § 994. This appendix sets them
forth separately and in fuller detail for ease of reference.
The legal authority for the Commission and the related authority and procedures for sentencing
in federal courts have their legislative foundation in the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 (Chapter II
of the Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984, Pub. L. 98–473, October 12, 1984).
These statutory provisions are presented in this appendix solely for the purpose of providing a
reference to federal sentencing law as it stands as of May 1, 2016. For the sake of brevity, certain
miscellaneous provisions are omitted. The Commission makes no representations concerning the
accuracy of these provisions and recommends that authoritative sources be consulted where legal
reliance is necessary.

Sentencing Considerations Prior to Enact-
ment of Guidelines. Section 239 of Pub.L. 98–473,
Title II, c. II, Oct. 12, 1984, 98 Stat. 2039, provided:
“Since, due to an impending crisis in prison
over-crowding, available Federal prison space must
be treated as a scarce resource in the sentencing of
criminal defendants;
“Since, sentencing decisions should be designed to
ensure that prison resources are, first and foremost,
18 U.S.C. § 3552
Appendix B (May 1, 2016) ║ 5
reserved for those violent and serious criminal of-
fenders who pose the most dangerous threat to soci-
ety;
“Since, in cases of nonviolent and nonserious of-
fenders, the interests of society as a whole as well as
individual victims of crime can continue to be served
through the imposition of alternative sentences, such
as restitution and community service;
“Since, in the two years preceding the enactment
of sentencing guidelines, Federal sentencing practice
should ensure that scarce prison resources are avail-
able to house violent and serious criminal offenders
by the increased use of restitution, community ser-
vice, and other alternative sentences in cases of non-
violent and nonserious offenders: Now, therefore, be
it
“Declared, That it is the sense of the Senate that
in the two years preceding the enactment of the sen-
tencing guidelines, Federal judges, in determining
the particular sentence to be imposed, consider—
(1) the nature and circumstances of the offense
and the history and characteristics of the defend-
ant;
(2) the general appropriateness of imposing a
sentence other than imprisonment in cases in
which the defendant has not been convicted of a
crime of violence or otherwise serious offense; and
(3) the general appropriateness of imposing a
sentence of imprisonment in cases in which the
defendant has been convicted of a crime of vio-
lence or otherwise serious offense.”
§ 3552. Presentence reports
(a) Presentence investigation and re-
port by probation officer.—A United States
probation officer shall make a presentence in-
vestigation of a defendant that is required pur-
suant to the provisions of Rule 32(c) of the Fed-
eral Rules of Criminal Procedure, and shall, be-
fore the imposition of sentence, report the re-
sults of the investigation to the court.
(b) Presentence study and report by bu-
reau of prisons.—If the court, before or after
its receipt of a report specified in subsection (a)
or (c), desires more information than is other-
wise available to it as a basis for determining
the sentence to be imposed on a defendant found
guilty of a misdemeanor or felony, it may order
a study of the defendant. The study shall be con-
ducted in the local community by qualified con-
sultants unless the sentencing judge finds that
there is a compelling reason for the study to be
done by the Bureau of Prisons or there are no
adequate professional resources available in the
local community to perform the study. The pe-
riod of the study shall be no more than sixty
days. The order shall specify the additional in-
formation that the court needs before determin-
ing the sentence to be imposed. Such an order
shall be treated for administrative purposes as
a provisional sentence of imprisonment for the
maximum term authorized by section 3581(b)
for the offense committed. The study shall in-
quire into such matters as are specified by the
court and any other matters that the Bureau of
Prisons or the professional consultants believe
are pertinent to the factors set forth in section
3553(a). The period of the study may, in the dis-
cretion of the court, be extended for an addi-
tional period of not more than sixty days. By the
expiration of the period of the study, or by the
expiration of any extension granted by the court,
the United States marshal shall, if the defend-
ant is in custody, return the defendant to the
court for final sentencing. The Bureau of Prisons
or the professional consultants shall provide the
court with a written report of the pertinent re-
sults of the study and make to the court what-
ever recommendations the Bureau or the con-
sultants believe will be helpful to a proper reso-
lution of the case. The report shall include rec-
ommendations of the Bureau or the consultants
concerning the guidelines and policy state-
ments, promulgated by the Sentencing Commis-
sion pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 994(a), that they be-
lieve are applicable to the defendant’s case. Af-
ter receiving the report and the recommenda-
tions, the court shall proceed finally to sentence
the defendant in accordance with the sentencing
alternatives and procedures available under
this chapter.
(c) Presentence examination and report
by psychiatric or psychological examin-
ers.—If the court, before or after its receipt of a
report specified in subsection (a) or (b) desires
more information than is otherwise available to
it as a basis for determining the mental condi-
tion of the defendant, the court may order the
18 U.S.C. § 3553
6 ║ Appendix B (May 1, 2016)
same psychiatric or psychological examination
and report thereon as may be ordered under sec-
tion 4244(b) of this title.
(d) Disclosure of presentence reports.—
The court shall assure that a report filed pursu-
ant to this section is disclosed to the defendant,
the counsel for the defendant, and the attorney
for the Government at least ten days prior to the
date set for sentencing, unless this minimum pe-
riod is waived by the defendant. The court shall
provide a copy of the presentence report to the
attorney for the Government to use in collecting
an assessment, criminal fine, forfeiture or resti-
tution imposed.

pose a sentence of the kind, and within the
range, referred to in subsection (a)(4) unless the
court finds that there exists an aggravating or
mitigating circumstance of a kind, or to a de-
gree, not adequately taken into consideration by
the Sentencing Commission in formulating the
guidelines that should result in a sentence dif-
ferent from that described. In determining
whether a circumstance was adequately taken
into consideration, the court shall consider only
the sentencing guidelines, policy statements,
and official commentary of the Sentencing Com-
mission. In the absence of an applicable sentenc-
ing guideline, the court shall impose an appro-
priate sentence, having due regard for the pur-
poses set forth in subsection (a)(2). In the ab-
sence of an applicable sentencing guideline in
the case of an offense other than a petty offense,
the court shall also have due regard for the rela-
tionship of the sentence imposed to sentences
prescribed by guidelines applicable to similar of-
fenses and offenders, and to the applicable pol-
icy statements of the Sentencing Commission.
(2) Child crimes and sexual offenses.—
(A) Sentencing.—In sentencing a defend-
ant convicted of an offense under section 1201
involving a minor victim, an offense under
section 1591, or an offense under chapter 71,
109A, 110, or 117, the court shall impose a
sentence of the kind, and within the range,
referred to in subsection (a)(4) unless—
(i) the court finds that there exists an
aggravating circumstance of a kind, or to a
degree, not adequately taken into consid-
eration by the Sentencing Commission in
formulating the guidelines that should re-
sult in a sentence greater than that de-
scribed;
(ii) the court finds that there exists a
mitigating circumstance of a kind or to a
degree, that—
(I) has been affirmatively and specif-
ically identified as a permissible ground
of downward departure in the sentenc-
ing guidelines or policy statements is-
sued under section 994(a) of title 28,
taking account of any amendments to
such sentencing guidelines or policy
statements by Congress;
(II) has not been taken into consid-
eration by the Sentencing Commission
in formulating the guidelines; and
(III) should result in a sentence dif-
ferent from that described; or
(iii) the court finds, on motion of the
Government, that the defendant has pro-
vided substantial assistance in the inves-
tigation or prosecution of another person
who has committed an offense and that
this assistance established a mitigating
circumstance of a kind, or to a degree, not
adequately taken into consideration by the
Sentencing Commission in formulating
the guidelines that should result in a sen-
tence lower than that described.
In determining whether a circumstance was ad-
equately taken into consideration, the court
shall consider only the sentencing guidelines,
policy statements, and official commentary of
18 U.S.C. § 3553
8 ║ Appendix B (May 1, 2016)
the Sentencing Commission, together with any
amendments thereto by act of Congress. In the
absence of an applicable sentencing guideline,
the court shall impose an appropriate sentence,
having due regard for the purposes set forth in
subsection (a)(2). In the absence of an applicable
sentencing guideline in the case of an offense
other than a petty offense, the court shall also
have due regard for the relationship of the sen-
tence imposed to sentences prescribed by guide-
lines applicable to similar offenses and offend-
ers, and to the applicable policy statements of
the Sentencing Commission, together with any
amendments to such guidelines or policy state-
ments by act of Congress.
(c) Statement of reasons for imposing a
sentence.—The court, at the time of sentenc-
ing, shall state in open court the reasons for its
imposition of the particular sentence, and, if the
sentence—
(1) is of the kind, and within the range, de-
scribed in subsection (a)(4), and that range
exceeds 24 months, the reason for imposing a
sentence at a particular point within the
range; or
(2) is not of the kind, or is outside the
range, described in subsection (a)(4), the spe-
cific reason for the imposition of a sentence
different from that described, which reasons
must also be stated with specificity in a state-
ment of reasons form issued under section
994(w)(1)(B) of title 28, except to the extent
that the court relies upon statements re-
ceived in camera in accordance with Federal
Rule of Criminal Procedure 32. In the event
that the court relies upon statements re-
ceived in camera in accordance with Federal
Rule of Criminal Procedure 32 the court shall
state that such statement were so received
and that it relied upon the content of such
statements.
If the court does not order restitution, or orders
only partial restitution, the court shall include
in the statement the reason therefor. The court
shall provide a transcription or other
1 So in original. The second comma probably should
not appear.
ate public record of the court’s statement of rea-
sons, together with the order of judgement and
commitment, to the Probation System and to the
Sentencing Commission,1 and, if the sentence
includes a term of imprisonment, to the Bureau
of Prisons.
(d) Presentence procedure for an order
of notice.—Prior to imposing an order of notice
pursuant to section 3555, the court shall give no-
tice to the defendant and the Government that
it is considering imposing such an order. Upon
motion of the defendant or the Government, or
on its own motion, the court shall—
(1) permit the defendant and the Govern-
ment to submit affidavits and written memo-
randa addressing matters relevant to the im-
position of such an order;
(2) afford counsel an opportunity in open
court to address orally the appropriateness of
the imposition of such an order; and
(3) include in its statement of reasons pur-
suant to subsection (c) specific reasons under-
lying its determinations regarding the nature
of such an order.
Upon motion of the defendant or the Govern-
ment, or on its own motion, the court may in its
discretion employ any additional procedures
that it concludes will not unduly complicate or
prolong the sentencing process.
(e) Limited authority to impose a sen-
tence below a statutory minimum.—Upon
motion of the Government, the court shall have
the authority to impose a sentence below a level
established by statute as a minimum sentence
so as to reflect a defendant’s substantial assis-
tance in the investigation or prosecution of an-
other person who has committed an offense.
Such sentence shall be imposed in accordance
with the guidelines and policy statements issued
by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to sec-
tion 994 of title 28, United States Code.
(f) Limitation on applicability of statu-
tory minimums in certain cases.—Notwith-
standing any other provision of law, in the case
of an offense under section 401, 404, or 406 of
the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 841,
18 U.S.C. § 3554
Appendix B (May 1, 2016) ║ 9
844, 846) or section 1010 or 1013 of the Con-
trolled Substances Import and Export Act
(21 U.S.C. 960, 963), the court shall impose a
sentence pursuant to guidelines promulgated by
the United States Sentencing Commission un-
der section 994 of title 28 without regard to any
statutory minimum sentence, if the court finds
at sentencing, after the Government has been
afforded the opportunity to make a recommen-
dation, that—
(1) the defendant does not have more than
1 criminal history point, as determined under
the sentencing guidelines;
(2) the defendant did not use violence or
credible threats of violence or possess a fire-
arm or other dangerous weapon (or induce
another participant to do so) in connection
with the offense;
(3) the offense did not result in death or
serious bodily injury to any person;
(4) the defendant was not an organizer,
leader, manager, or supervisor of others in
the offense, as determined under the sentenc-
ing guidelines and was not engaged in a con-
tinuing criminal enterprise, as defined in sec-
tion 408 of the Controlled Substances Act;
and
(5) not later than the time of the sentenc-
ing hearing, the defendant has truthfully pro-
vided to the Government all information and
evidence the defendant has concerning the of-
fense or offenses that were part of the same
course of conduct or of a common scheme or
plan, but the fact that the defendant has no
relevant or useful other information to pro-
vide or that the Government is already aware
of the information shall not preclude a deter-
mination by the court that the defendant has
complied with this requirement.

§ 3561. Sentence of probation
(a) In general.—A defendant who has been
found guilty of an offense may be sentenced to a
term of probation unless—
(1) the offense is a Class A or Class B fel-
ony and the defendant is an individual;
(2) the offense is an offense for which pro-
bation has been expressly precluded; or

fense.
(b) Domestic violence offenders.—A de-
fendant who has been convicted for the first time
of a domestic violence crime shall be sentenced
to a term of probation if not sentenced to a term
of imprisonment. The term “domestic violence
crime” means a crime of violence for which the
defendant may be prosecuted in a court of the
United States in which the victim or intended
victim is the spouse, former spouse, intimate
partner, former intimate partner, child, or for-
mer child of the defendant, or any other relative

§ 3562. Imposition of a sentence of proba-
tion
(a) Factors to be considered in imposing
a term of probation.—The court, in determin-
ing whether to impose a term of probation, and,
if a term of probation is to be imposed, in deter-
mining the length of the term and the conditions
of probation, shall consider the factors set forth
in section 3553(a) to the extent that they are ap-
plicable.
(b) Effect of finality of judgment.—Not-
withstanding the fact that a sentence of proba-
tion can subsequently be—
(1) modified or revoked pursuant to the
provisions of section 3564 or 3565;
(2) corrected pursuant to the provisions of
rule 35 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Pro-
cedure and section 3742; or
(3) appealed and modified, if outside the
guideline range, pursuant to the provisions of
section 3742;
a judgment of conviction that includes such a
sentence constitutes a final judgment for all
other purposes.
(Added Pub.L. 98–473, Title II, § 212(a)(2), Oct. 12,

XXXV, § 3583, Nov. 29, 1990, 104 Stat. 4930.)
§ 3563. Conditions of probation
(a) Mandatory conditions.—The court
shall provide, as an explicit condition of a sen-
tence of probation—
(1) for a felony, a misdemeanor, or an in-
fraction, that the defendant not commit an-
other Federal, State, or local crime during the
term of probation;
(2) for a felony, that the defendant also
abide by at least one condition set forth in
subsection (b)(2) or (b)(12), unless the court
has imposed a fine under this chapter, or un-
less the court finds on the record that extraor-
dinary circumstances exist that would make
such a condition plainly unreasonable, in
which event the court shall impose one or
more of the other conditions set forth under
subsection (b);
(3) for a felony, a misdemeanor, or an in-
fraction, that the defendant not unlawfully
possess a controlled substance;
(4) for a domestic violence crime as defined
in section 3561(b) by a defendant convicted of
such an offense for the first time that the de-
fendant attend a public, private, or private
non-profit offender rehabilitation program
that has been approved by the court, in con-
sultation with a State Coalition Against Do-
mestic Violence or other appropriate experts,
if an approved program is readily available
within a 50-mile radius of the legal residence
of the defendant; and
(5) for a felony, a misdemeanor, or an in-
fraction, that the defendant refrain from any
unlawful use of a controlled substance and
submit to one drug test within 15 days of re-
lease on probation and at least 2 periodic
drug tests thereafter (as determined by the
court) for use of a controlled substance, but
the condition stated in this paragraph may be
ameliorated or suspended by the court for any
individual defendant if the defendant’s
presentence report or other reliable sentenc-
ing information indicates a low risk of future
substance abuse by the defendant;
(6) that the defendant—
(A) make restitution in accordance with
sections 2248, 2259, 2264, 2327, 3663,
3663A, and 3664; and
(B) pay the assessment imposed in ac-
cordance with section 3013; and
(7) that the defendant will notify the court
of any material change in the defendant’s eco-
nomic circumstances that might affect the de-
fendant’s ability to pay restitution, fines, or
special assessments;
(8) for a person required to register under
the Sex Offender Registration and Notifica-
tion Act, that the person comply with the re-
quirements of that Act; and
(9) that the defendant cooperate in the col-
lection of a DNA sample from the defendant
if the collection of such a sample is authorized
pursuant to section 3 of the DNA Analysis
Backlog Elimination Act of 2000.
18 U.S.C. § 3563
16 ║ Appendix B (May 1, 2016)
If the court has imposed and ordered execution
of a fine and placed the defendant on probation,
payment of the fine or adherence to the court-es-
tablished installment schedule shall be a condi-
tion of the probation.
(b) Discretionary conditions.—The court
may provide, as further conditions of a sentence
of probation, to the extent that such conditions
are reasonably related to the factors set forth in
section 3553(a)(1) and (a)(2) and to the extent
that such conditions involve only such depriva-
tions of liberty or property as are reasonably
necessary for the purposes indicated in section
3553(a)(2), that the defendant—
(1) support his dependents and meet other
family responsibilities;
(2) make restitution to a victim of the of-
fense under section 3556 (but not subject to
the limitation of section 3663(a) or

(3) give to the victims of the offense the no-
tice ordered pursuant to the provisions of sec-
tion 3555;

stated degree or under stated circumstances;
(6) refrain from frequenting specified
kinds of places or from associating unneces-
sarily with specified persons;
(7) refrain from excessive use of alcohol, or

(8) refrain from possessing a firearm, de-
structive device, or other dangerous weapon;
(9) undergo available medical, psychiatric,
or psychological treatment, including treat-
ment for drug or alcohol dependency, as spec-
ified by the court, and remain in a specified
institution if required for that purpose;
(10) remain in the custody of the Bureau
of Prisons during nights, weekends, or other
intervals of time, totaling no more than the
lesser of one year or the term of imprison-
ment authorized for the offense, during the
first year of the term of probation or super-
vised release;
(11) reside at, or participate in the pro-

ment officer;
(19) remain at his place of residence dur-
ing nonworking hours and, if the court finds

only as an alternative to incarceration;
(20) comply with the terms of any court or-
der or order of an administrative process pur-
suant to the law of a State, the District of Co-
lumbia, or any other possession or territory of
the United States, requiring payments by the
defendant for the support and maintenance
of a child or of a child and the parent with
whom the child is living;
18 U.S.C. § 3564
Appendix B (May 1, 2016) ║ 17
(21) be ordered deported by a United
States district court, or United States magis-
trate judge, pursuant to a stipulation entered
into by the defendant and the United States
under section 238(d)(5) of the Immigration
and Nationality Act, except that, in the ab-
sence of a stipulation, the United States dis-
trict court or a United States magistrate
judge, may order deportation as a condition
of probation, if, after notice and hearing pur-
suant to such section, the Attorney General
demonstrates by clear and convincing evi-
dence that the alien is deportable;
(22) satisfy such other conditions as the
court may impose; or
(23) if required to register under the Sex
Offender Registration and Notification Act,
submit his person, and any property, house,

enforcement or probation officer with reason-
able suspicion concerning a violation of a con-
dition of probation or unlawful conduct by the
person, and by any probation officer in the
lawful discharge of the officer’s supervision
functions.
(c) Modifications of conditions.—The
court may modify, reduce, or enlarge the condi-
tions of a sentence of probation at any time prior
to the expiration or termination of the term of
probation, pursuant to the provisions of the Fed-
eral Rules of Criminal Procedure relating to the
modification of probation and the provisions ap-
plicable to the initial setting of the conditions of
probation.
(d) Written statement of conditions.—
The court shall direct that the probation officer
provide the defendant with a written statement
that sets forth all the conditions to which the
sentence is subject, and that is sufficiently clear
and specific to serve as a guide for the defend-
ant’s conduct and for such supervision as is re-
quired.
(e) Results of Drug Testing.—The results
of a drug test administered in accordance with
subsection (a)(5) shall be subject to confirmation
only if the results are positive, the defendant is
subject to possible imprisonment for such fail-
ure, and either the defendant denies the accu-
racy of such test or there is some other reason to
question the results of the test. A defendant who
tests positive may be detained pending verifica-
tion of a positive drug test result. A drug test
confirmation shall be a urine drug test con-
firmed using gas chromatography/mass spec-
trometry techniques or such test as the Director
of the Administrative Office of the United States
Courts after consultation with the Secretary of
Health and Human Services may determine to
be of equivalent accuracy. The court shall con-
sider whether the availability of appropriate
substance abuse treatment programs, or an in-
dividual’s current or past participation in such
programs, warrants an exception in accordance
with United States Sentencing Commission
guidelines from the rule of section 3565(b), when
considering any action against a defendant who
fails a drug test administered in accordance
with subsection (a)(5).

§ 3564. Running of a term of probation
(a) Commencement.—A term of probation
commences on the day that the sentence of pro-
bation is imposed, unless otherwise ordered by
the court.
(b) Concurrence with other sentences.—
Multiple terms of probation, whether imposed at
18 U.S.C. § 3565
18 ║ Appendix B (May 1, 2016)
the same time or at different times, run concur-
rently with each other. A term of probation runs
concurrently with any Federal, State, or local
term of probation, supervised release, or parole
for another offense to which the defendant is
subject or becomes subject during the term of
probation. A term of probation does not run
while the defendant is imprisoned in connection
with a conviction for a Federal, State, or local
crime unless the imprisonment is for a period of
less than thirty consecutive days.
(c) Early termination.—The court, after
considering the factors set forth in section
3553(a) to the extent that they are applicable,
may, pursuant to the provisions of the Federal
Rules of Criminal Procedure relating to the
modification of probation, terminate a term of
probation previously ordered and discharge the
defendant at any time in the case of a misde-
meanor or an infraction or at any time after the
expiration of one year of probation in the case of
a felony, if it is satisfied that such action is war-
ranted by the conduct of the defendant and the
interest of justice.
(d) Extension.—The court may, after a
hearing, extend a term of probation, if less than
the maximum authorized term was previously
imposed, at any time prior to the expiration or
termination of the term of probation, pursuant
to the provisions applicable to the initial setting
of the term of probation.
(e) Subject to revocation.—A sentence of
probation remains conditional and subject to
revocation until its expiration or termination.
(Added Pub.L. 98–473, Title II, § 212(a)(2), Oct. 12,

7, 1987, 101 Stat. 1268.)
§ 3565. Revocation of probation
(a) Continuation or revocation.—If the
defendant violates a condition of probation at
any time prior to the expiration or termination
of the term of probation, the court may, after a
hearing pursuant to Rule 32.1 of the Federal
Rules of Criminal Procedure, and after consider-
ing the factors set forth in section 3553(a) to the
extent that they are applicable—
(1) continue him on probation, with or
without extending the term or modifying or
enlarging the conditions; or
(2) revoke the sentence of probation and
resentence the defendant under subchapter
A.
(b) Mandatory revocation for possession
of controlled substance or firearm or re-
fusal to comply with drug testing.—If the
defendant—
(1) possesses a controlled substance in vi-
olation of the condition set forth in section
3563(a)(3);
(2) possesses a firearm, as such term is de-
fined in section 921 of this title, in violation
of Federal law, or otherwise violates a condi-
tion of probation prohibiting the defendant
from possessing a firearm;
(3) refuses to comply with drug testing,
thereby violating the condition imposed by
section 3563(a)(4); or
(4) as a part of drug testing, tests positive
for illegal controlled substances more than 3
times over the course of 1 year;
the court shall revoke the sentence of probation
and resentence the defendant under subchapter
A to a sentence that includes a term of impris-
onment.
(c) Delayed revocation.—The power of the
court to revoke a sentence of probation for viola-
tion of a condition of probation, and to impose
another sentence, extends beyond the expiration
of the term of probation for any period reasona-
bly necessary for the adjudication of matters
arising before its expiration if, prior to its expi-
ration, a warrant or summons has been issued
on the basis of an allegation of such a violation.

§ 3571. Sentence of fine
(a) In general.—A defendant who has been
found guilty of an offense may be sentenced to
pay a fine.
(b) Fines for individuals.—Except as pro-
vided in subsection (e) of this section, an individ-
ual who has been found guilty of an offense may
be fined not more than the greatest of—
(1) the amount specified in the law setting
forth the offense;
(2) the applicable amount under subsec-
tion (d) of this section;
(3) for a felony, not more than $250,000;
(4) for a misdemeanor resulting in death,
not more than $250,000;
(5) for a Class A misdemeanor that does
not result in death, not more than $100,000;

does not result in death, not more than
$5,000; or
(7) for an infraction, not more than $5,000.
(c) Fines for organizations.—Except as
provided in subsection (e) of this section, an or-
ganization that has been found guilty of an of-
fense may be fined not more than the greatest
of—

forth the offense;
(2) the applicable amount under subsec-
tion (d) of this section;
(3) for a felony, not more than $500,000;

$10,000; and
(7) for an infraction, not more than
$10,000.
(d) Alternative fine based on gain or
loss.—If any person derives pecuniary gain
from the offense, or if the offense results in pe-
cuniary loss to a person other than the defend-
ant, the defendant may be fined not more than
the greater of twice the gross gain or twice the
gross loss, unless imposition of a fine under this
subsection would unduly complicate or prolong
the sentencing process.
(e) Special rule for lower fine specified
in substantive provision.—If a law setting
forth an offense specifies no fine or a fine that is
lower than the fine otherwise applicable under
this section and such law, by specific reference,
exempts the offense from the applicability of the
fine otherwise applicable under this section, the
defendant may not be fined more than the
amount specified in the law setting forth the of-
fense.

ment of a fine, the court shall consider, in addi-
tion to the factors set forth in section 3553(a)—
(1) the defendant’s income, earning capac-
ity, and financial resources;
(2) the burden that the fine will impose
upon the defendant, any person who is finan-
cially dependent on the defendant, or any
18 U.S.C. § 3572
20 ║ Appendix B (May 1, 2016)
other person (including a government) that
would be responsible for the welfare of any
person financially dependent on the defend-
ant, relative to the burden that alternative
punishments would impose;
(3) any pecuniary loss inflicted upon oth-
ers as a result of the offense;
(4) whether restitution is ordered or made
and the amount of such restitution;
(5) the need to deprive the defendant of il-
legally obtained gains from the offense;
(6) the expected costs to the government of
any imprisonment, supervised release, or
probation component of the sentence;
(7) whether the defendant can pass on to
consumers or other persons the expense of
the fine; and
(8) if the defendant is an organization, the
size of the organization and any measure
taken by the organization to discipline any of-
ficer, director, employee, or agent of the or-
ganization responsible for the offense and to
prevent a recurrence of such an offense.
(b) Fine not to impair ability to make
restitution.—If, as a result of a conviction, the
defendant has the obligation to make restitution
to a victim of the offense, other than the United
States, the court shall impose a fine or other
monetary penalty only to the extent that such
fine or penalty will not impair the ability of the
defendant to make restitution.
(c) Effect of finality of judgment.—Not-
withstanding the fact that a sentence to pay a
fine can subsequently be—
(1) modified or remitted under section
3573;
(2) corrected under rule 35 of the Federal
Rules of Criminal Procedure and section
3742; or
(3) appealed and modified under section
3742;
a judgment that includes such a sentence is a fi-
nal judgment for all other purposes.
(d) Time, method of payment, and re-
lated items.—(1) A person sentenced to pay a
fine or other monetary penalty, including resti-
tution, shall make such payment immediately,
unless, in the interest of justice, the court pro-
vides for payment on a date certain or in install-
ments. If the court provides for payment in in-
stallments, the installments shall be in equal
monthly payments over the period provided by
the court, unless the court establishes another
schedule.
(2) If the judgment, or, in the case of a resti-
tution order, the order, permits other than im-
mediate payment, the length of time over which
scheduled payments will be made shall be set by
the court, but shall be the shortest time in which
full payment can reasonably be made.
(3) A judgment for a fine which permits pay-
ments in installments shall include a require-
ment that the defendant will notify the court of
any material change in the defendant’s eco-
nomic circumstances that might affect the de-
fendant’s ability to pay the fine. Upon receipt of
such notice the court may, on its own motion or
the motion of any party, adjust the payment
schedule, or require immediate payment in full,
as the interests of justice require.
(e) Alternative sentence precluded.—At
the time a defendant is sentenced to pay a fine,
the court may not impose an alternative sen-
tence to be carried out if the fine is not paid.
(f) Responsibility for payment of mone-
tary obligation relating to organization.—
If a sentence includes a fine, special assessment,
restitution or other monetary obligation (includ-
ing interest) with respect to an organization,
each individual authorized to make disburse-
ments for the organization has a duty to pay the
obligation from assets of the organization. If
such an obligation is imposed on a director, of-
ficer, shareholder, employee, or agent of an or-
ganization, payments may not be made, directly
or indirectly, from assets of the organization,
unless the court finds that such payment is ex-
pressly permissible under applicable State law.
(g) Security for stayed fine.—If a sentence
imposing a fine is stayed, the court shall, absent
exceptional circumstances (as determined by
the court)—
(1) require the defendant to deposit, in the
registry of the district court, any amount of
the fine that is due;
18 U.S.C. § 3581
Appendix B (May 1, 2016) ║ 21
(2) require the defendant to provide a bond
or other security to ensure payment of the
fine; or
(3) restrain the defendant from transfer-
ring or dissipating assets.
(h) Delinquency.—A fine or payment of res-
titution is delinquent if a payment is more than
30 days late.
(i) Default.—A fine or payment of restitu-
tion is in default if a payment is delinquent for
more than 90 days. Notwithstanding any in-
stallment schedule, when a fine or payment of
restitution is in default, the entire amount of the
fine or restitution is due within 30 days after no-
tification of the default, subject to the provisions
of section 3613A.

§ 3573. Petition of the Government for
modification or remission
Upon petition of the Government showing
that reasonable efforts to collect a fine or assess-
ment are not likely to be effective, the court may,
in the interest of justice—
(1) remit all or part of the unpaid portion
of the fine or special assessment, including
interest and penalties;
(2) defer payment of the fine or special as-
sessment to a date certain or pursuant to an
installment schedule; or
(3) extend a date certain or an installment
schedule previously ordered.
A petition under this subsection shall be filed in
the court in which sentence was originally im-
posed, unless the court transfers jurisdiction to
another court. This section shall apply to all
fines and assessments irrespective of the date of
imposition.

§ 3582. Imposition of a sentence of impris-
onment
(a) Factors to be considered in imposing
a term of imprisonment.—The court, in deter-
mining whether to impose a term of imprison-
ment, and, if a term of imprisonment is to be im-
posed, in determining the length of the term,
shall consider the factors set forth in section
3553(a) to the extent that they are applicable,
recognizing that imprisonment is not an appro-
priate means of promoting correction and reha-
bilitation. In determining whether to make a
recommendation concerning the type of prison
facility appropriate for the defendant, the court
shall consider any pertinent policy statements
issued by the Sentencing Commission pursuant
to 28 U.S.C. 994(a)(2).
(b) Effect of finality of judgment.—Not-
withstanding the fact that a sentence to impris-
onment can subsequently be—
(1) modified pursuant to the provisions of
subsection (c);
(2) corrected pursuant to the provisions of
rule 35 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Pro-
cedure and section 3742; or
(3) appealed and modified, if outside the
guideline range, pursuant to the provisions of
section 3742;
a judgment of conviction that includes such a
sentence constitutes a final judgment for all
other purposes.
(c) Modification of an imposed term of
imprisonment.—The court may not modify a
term of imprisonment once it has been imposed
except that—
(1) in any case—
(A) the court, upon motion of the Direc-
tor of the Bureau of Prisons, may reduce
the term of imprisonment (and may im-
pose a term of probation or supervised re-
lease with or without conditions that does
not exceed the unserved portion of the
original term of imprisonment), after con-
sidering the factors set forth in section
3553(a) to the extent that they are appli-
cable, if it finds that—
(i) extraordinary and compelling
reasons warrant such a reduction; or
(ii) the defendant is at least 70 years
of age, has served at least 30 year in
prison, pursuant to a sentence imposed
under section 3559(c), for the offense or
offenses for which the defendant is cur-
rently imprisoned, and a determination
has been made by the Director of the
Bureau of Prisons that the defendant is
not a danger to the safety of any other
person or the community, as provided
under section 3142(g);
and that such a reduction is consistent
with applicable policy statements issued
by the Sentencing Commission; and
(B) the court may modify an imposed
term of imprisonment to the extent other-
wise expressly permitted by statute or by
Rule 35 of the Federal Rules of Criminal
Procedure; and
(2) in the case of a defendant who has been
sentenced to a term of imprisonment based
on a sentencing range that has subsequently
been lowered by the Sentencing Commission
pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 994(o), upon motion of
the defendant or the Director of the Bureau
of Prisons, or on its own motion, the court
may reduce the term of imprisonment, after
considering the factors set forth in section
3553(a) to the extent that they are applicable,
if such a reduction is consistent with applica-
ble policy statements issued by the Sentenc-
ing Commission.
(d) Inclusion of an order to limit crimi-
nal association of organized crime and
drug offenders.—The court, in imposing a sen-
tence to a term of imprisonment upon a defend-
ant convicted of a felony set forth in chapter 95
(racketeering) or 96 (racketeer influenced and
corrupt organizations) of this title or in the Com-
prehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control
Act of 1970 (21 U.S.C. 801 et seq.), or at any time
thereafter upon motion by the Director of the
Bureau of Prisons or a United States attorney,
may include as a part of the sentence an order
that requires that the defendant not associate or
communicate with a specified person, other than
his attorney, upon a showing of probable cause
18 U.S.C. § 3583
Appendix B (May 1, 2016) ║ 23
to believe that association or communication
with such person is for the purpose of enabling
the defendant to control, manage, direct, fi-
nance, or otherwise participate in an illegal en-
terprise.

§ 3583. Inclusion of a term of supervised re-
lease after imprisonment
(a) In general.—The court, in imposing a
sentence to a term of imprisonment for a felony
or a misdemeanor, may include as a part of the
sentence a requirement that the defendant be
placed on a term of supervised release after im-
prisonment, except that the court shall include
as a part of the sentence a requirement that the
defendant be placed on a term of supervised re-
lease if such a term is required by statute or if
the defendant has been convicted for the first
time of a domestic violence crime as defined in
section 3561(b).
(b) Authorized terms of supervised re-
lease.—Except as otherwise provided, the au-
thorized terms of supervised release are—
(1) for a Class A or Class B felony, not
more than five years;
(2) for a Class C or Class D felony, not
more than three years; and
(3) for a Class E felony, or for a misde-
meanor (other than a petty offense), not more
than one year.
(c) Factors to be considered in including
a term of supervised release.—The court, in
determining whether to include a term of super-
vised release, and, if a term of supervised re-
lease is to be included, in determining the length
of the term and the conditions of supervised re-
lease, shall consider the factors set forth in sec-
tion 3553(a)(1), (a)(2)(B), (a)(2)(C), (a)(2)(D),
(a)(4), (a)(5), (a)(6), and (a)(7).
(d) Conditions of supervised release.—
The court shall order, as an explicit condition of
supervised release, that the defendant not com-
mit another Federal, State, or local crime during
the term of supervision and that the defendant
not unlawfully possess a controlled substance.
The court shall order as an explicit condition of
supervised release for a defendant convicted for
the first time of a domestic violence crime as de-
fined in section 3561(b) that the defendant at-
tend a public, private, or private nonprofit of-
fender rehabilitation program that has been ap-
proved by the court, in consultation with a State
Coalition Against Domestic Violence or other
appropriate experts, if an approved program is
readily available within a 50-mile radius of the
legal residence of the defendant. The court shall
order, as an explicit condition of supervised re-
lease for a person required to register under the
Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act,
that the person comply with the requirements of
that Act. The court shall order, as an explicit
condition of supervised release, that the defend-
ant cooperate in the collection of a DNA sample
from the defendant, if the collection of such a
sample is authorized pursuant to section 3 of the
DNA Analysis Backlog Elimination Act of 2000.
The court shall also order, as an explicit condi-
tion of supervised release, that the defendant re-
frain from any unlawful use of a controlled sub-
stance and submit to a drug test within 15 days
of release on supervised release and at least 2
periodic drug tests thereafter (as determined by
the court) for use of a controlled substance. The
condition stated in the preceding sentence may
be ameliorated or suspended by the court as pro-
vided in section 3563(a)(4). The results of a drug
test administered in accordance with the preced-
ing subsection shall be subject to confirmation
only if the results are positive, the defendant is
subject to possible imprisonment for such fail-
ure, and either the defendant denies the accu-
racy of such test or there is some other reason to
question the results of the test. A drug test con-
firmation shall be a urine drug test confirmed
using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry
techniques or such test as the Director of the Ad-
ministrative Office of the United States Courts
after consultation with the Secretary of Health
18 U.S.C. § 3583
24 ║ Appendix B (May 1, 2016)
and Human Services may determine to be of
equivalent accuracy. The court shall consider
whether the availability of appropriate sub-
stance abuse treatment programs, or an individ-
ual’s current or past participation in such pro-
grams, warrants an exception in accordance
with United States Sentencing Commission
guidelines from the rule of section 3583(g) when
considering any action against a defendant who
fails a drug test. The court may order, as a fur-
ther condition of supervised release, to the ex-
tent that such condition—
(1) is reasonably related to the factors set
forth in section 3553(a)(1), (a)(2)(B), (a)(2)(C),
and (a)(2)(D);
(2) involves no greater deprivation of lib-
erty than is reasonably necessary for the pur-
poses set forth in section 3553(a)(2)(B),
(a)(2)(C), and (a)(2)(D); and
(3) is consistent with any pertinent policy
statements issued by the Sentencing Com-
mission pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 994(a);
any condition set forth as a discretionary condi-
tion of probation in section 3563(b) and any
other condition it considers to be appropriate,
provided, however that a condition set forth in
subsection 3563(b)(10) shall be imposed only for
a violation of a condition of supervised release in
accordance with section 3583(e)(2) and only
when facilities are available. If an alien defend-
ant is subject to deportation, the court may pro-
vide, as a condition of supervised release, that
he be deported and remain outside the United
States, and may order that he be delivered to a
duly authorized immigration official for such de-
portation. The court may order, as an explicit
condition of supervised release for a person who
is a felon and required to register under the Sex
Offender Registration and Notification Act, that
the person submit his person, and any property,
house, residence, vehicle, papers, computer,
other electronic communications or data storage
devices or media, and effects to search at any
time, with or without a warrant, by any law en-
forcement or probation officer with reasonable
suspicion concerning a violation of a condition of
1 So in original. Probably “defendant released”
should be “defendant”.
supervised release or unlawful conduct by the
person, and by any probation officer in the law-
ful discharge of the officer’s supervision func-
tions.
(e) Modification of conditions or revoca-
tion.—The court may, after considering the fac-
tors set forth in section 3553(a)(1), (a)(2)(B),
(a)(2)(C), (a)(2)(D), (a)(4), (a)(5), (a)(6), and
(a)(7)—
(1) terminate a term of supervised release
and discharge the defendant released1 at any
time after the expiration of one year of super-
vised release, pursuant to the provisions of
the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure re-
lating to the modification of probation, if it is
satisfied that such action is warranted by the
conduct of the defendant released1 and the in-
terest of justice;
(2) extend a term of supervised release if
less than the maximum authorized term was
previously imposed, and may modify, reduce,
or enlarge the conditions of supervised re-
lease, at any time prior to the expiration or
termination of the term of supervised release,
pursuant to the provisions of the Federal
Rules of Criminal Procedure relating to the
modification of probation and the provisions
applicable to the initial setting of the terms
and conditions of post-release supervision;
(3) revoke a term of supervised release,
and require the defendant to serve in prison
all or part of the term of supervised release
authorized by statute for the offense that re-
sulted in such term of supervised release
without credit for time previously served on
postrelease supervision, if the court, pursu-
ant to the Federal Rules of Criminal Proce-
dure applicable to revocation of probation or
supervised release, finds by a preponderance
of the evidence that the defendant violated a
condition of supervised release, except that a
defendant whose term is revoked under this
paragraph may not be required to serve on
any such revocation more than 5 years in
prison if the offense that resulted in the term
of supervised release is a class A felony, more
18 U.S.C. § 3583
Appendix B (May 1, 2016) ║ 25
than 3 years in prison if such offense is a class
B felony, more than 2 years in prison if such
offense is a class C or D felony, or more than
one year in any other case; or
(4) order the defendant to remain at his
place of residence during nonworking hours
and, if the court so directs, to have compli-
ance monitored by telephone or electronic sig-
naling devices, except that an order under
this paragraph may be imposed only as an al-
ternative to incarceration.
(f) Written statement of conditions.—The
court shall direct that the probation officer pro-
vide the defendant with a written statement
that sets forth all the conditions to which the
term of supervised release is subject, and that is
sufficiently clear and specific to serve as a guide
for the defendant’s conduct and for such super-
vision as is required.
(g) Mandatory revocation for possession
of controlled substance or firearm or for
refusal to comply with drug testing.—If the
defendant—
(1) possesses a controlled substance in vi-
olation of the condition set forth in subsection
(d);
(2) possesses a firearm, as such term is de-
fined in section 921 of this title, in violation
of Federal law, or otherwise violates a condi-
tion of supervised release prohibiting the de-
fendant from possessing a firearm;
(3) refuses to comply with drug testing im-
posed as a condition of supervised release; or
(4) as a part of drug testing, tests positive
for illegal controlled substances more than 3
times over the course of 1 year;
the court shall revoke the term of supervised re-
lease and require the defendant to serve a term
of imprisonment not to exceed the maximum
term of imprisonment authorized under subsec-
tion (e)(3).
(h) Supervised release following revoca-
tion.—When a term of supervise release is re-
voked and the defendant is required to serve a
term of imprisonment, the court may include a
requirement that the defendant be placed on a
term of supervised release after imprisonment.
The length of such a term of supervised release
shall not exceed the term of supervised release
authorized by statute for the offense that re-
sulted in the original term of supervised release,
less any term of imprisonment that was imposed
upon revocation of supervised release.
(i) Delayed revocation.—The power of the
court to revoke a term of supervised release for
violation for a condition of supervised release,
and to order the defendant to serve a term of im-
prisonment and, subject to the limitations in
subsection (h), a further term of supervised re-
lease, extends beyond the expiration of the term
of supervised release for any period reasonably
necessary for the adjudication of matters arising
before its expiration if, before its expiration, a
warrant or summons has been issued on the ba-
sis of an allegation of such a violation.
(j) Supervised Release Terms for Terror-
ism Predicates.—Notwithstanding subsection
(b), the authorized term of supervised release for
any offense listed in section 2332b(g)(5)(B), is
any term of years or life.
(k) Notwithstanding subsection (b), the au-
thorized term of supervised release for any of-
fense under section 1201 involving a minor vic-
tim, and for any offense under section 1591,
1594(c), 2241, 2242, 2243, 2244, 2245, 2250,
2251, 2251A, 2252, 2252A, 2260, 2421, 2422,
2423, or 2425, is any term of years not less than
5, or life. If a defendant required to register un-
der the Sex Offender Registration and Notifica-
tion Act commits any criminal offense under
chapter 109A, 110, or 117, or section 1201 or
1591, for which imprisonment for a term longer
than 1 year can be imposed, the court shall re-
voke the term of supervised release and require
the defendant to serve a term of imprisonment
under subsection (e)(3) without regard to the ex-
ception contained therein. Such term shall be
not less than 5 years.

§ 3584. Multiple sentences of imprisonment
(a) Imposition of concurrent or consecu-
tive terms.—If multiple terms of imprisonment
are imposed on a defendant at the same time, or
if a term of imprisonment is imposed on a de-
fendant who is already subject to an undis-
charged term of imprisonment, the terms may
run concurrently or consecutively, except that
the terms may not run consecutively for an at-
tempt and for another offense that was the sole
objective of the attempt. Multiple terms of im-
prisonment imposed at the same time run con-
currently unless the court orders or the statute
mandates that the terms are to run consecu-
tively. Multiple terms of imprisonment imposed
at different times run consecutively unless the
court orders that the terms are to run concur-
rently.
(b) Factors to be considered in imposing
concurrent or consecutive terms.—The
court, in determining whether the terms im-
posed are to be ordered to run concurrently or
consecutively, shall consider, as to each offense
for which a term of imprisonment is being im-
posed, the factors set forth in section 3553(a).
(c) Treatment of multiple sentence as an
aggregate.—Multiple terms of imprisonment
ordered to run consecutively or concurrently
shall be treated for administrative purposes as
a single, aggregate term of imprisonment.

§ 3585. Calculation of a term of imprison-
ment
(a) Commencement of sentence.—A sen-
tence to a term of imprisonment commences on
the date the defendant is received in custody
awaiting transportation to, or arrives voluntar-
ily to commence service of sentence at, the offi-
cial detention facility at which the sentence is to
be served.
(b) Credit for prior custody.—A defendant
shall be given credit toward the service of a term
of imprisonment for any time he has spent in of-
ficial detention prior to the date the sentence
commences—
(1) as a result of the offense for which the
sentence was imposed; or
(2) as a result of any other charge for
which the defendant was arrested after the
commission of the offense for which the sen-
tence was imposed;
that has not been credited against another sen-
tence.

§ 3621. Imprisonment of a convicted person
(a) Commitment to custody of Bureau of
Prisons.—A person who has been sentenced to
a term of imprisonment pursuant to the provi-
sions of subchapter D of chapter 227 shall be
committed to the custody of the Bureau of Pris-
ons until the expiration of the term imposed, or
until earlier released for satisfactory behavior
pursuant to the provisions of section 3624.
(b) Place of imprisonment.—The Bureau
of Prisons shall designate the place of the pris-
oner’s imprisonment. The Bureau may desig-
nate any available penal or correctional facility
that meets minimum standards of health and
habitability established by the Bureau, whether
maintained by the Federal Government or oth-
erwise and whether within or without the judi-
cial district in which the person was convicted,
that the Bureau determines to be appropriate
and suitable, considering—
(1) the resources of the facility contem-
plated;
(2) the nature and circumstances of the of-
fense;
(3) the history and characteristics of the
prisoner;
(4) any statement by the court that im-
posed the sentence—
(A) concerning the purposes for which
the sentence to imprisonment was deter-
mined to be warranted; or
(B) recommending a type of penal or
correctional facility as appropriate; and
(5) any pertinent policy statement issued
by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to
section 994(a)(2) of title 28.
In designating the place of imprisonment or
making transfers under this subsection, there
shall be no favoritism given to prisoners of high
social or economic status. The Bureau may at
any time, having regard for the same matters,
direct the transfer of a prisoner from one penal
or correctional facility to another. The Bureau
shall make available appropriate substance
abuse treatment for each prisoner the Bureau
determines has a treatable condition of sub-
stance addiction or abuse. Any order, recom-
mendation, or request by a sentencing court that
a convicted person serve a term of imprisonment
in a community corrections facility shall have no
binding effect on the authority of the Bureau un-
der this section to determine or change the place
of imprisonment of that person.
(c) Delivery of order of commitment.—
When a prisoner, pursuant to a court order, is
placed in the custody of a person in charge of a
penal or correctional facility, a copy of the order
shall be delivered to such person as evidence of
this authority to hold the prisoner, and the orig-
inal order, with the return endorsed thereon,
shall be returned to the court that issued it.
(d) Delivery of prisoner for court ap-
pearances.—The United States marshal shall,
without charge, bring a prisoner into court or re-
turn him to a prison facility on order of a court
of the United States or on written request of an
attorney for the Government.
(e) Substance abuse treatment.—
(1) Phase-in.—In order to carry out the
requirement of the last sentence of subsection
(b) of this section, that every prisoner with a
substance abuse problem have the oppor-
tunity to participate in appropriate sub-
stance abuse treatment, the Bureau of Pris-
ons shall, subject to the availability of appro-
priations, provide residential substance
18 U.S.C. § 3621
28 ║ Appendix B (May 1, 2016)
abuse treatment (and make arrangements
for appropriate aftercare)—
(A) for not less than 50 percent of eligi-
ble prisoners by the end of fiscal year 1995,
with priority for such treatment accorded
based on an eligible prisoner’s proximity to
release date;
(B) for not less than 75 percent of eligi-
ble prisoners by the end of fiscal year 1996,
with priority for such treatment accorded
based on an eligible prisoner’s proximity to
release date; and
(C) for all eligible prisoners by the end
of fiscal year 1997 and thereafter, with pri-
ority for such treatment accorded based on
an eligible prisoner’s proximity to release
date.
(2) Incentive for prisoners’ successful
completion of treatment program.—
(A) Generally.—Any prisoner who, in
the judgment of the Director of the Bureau
of Prisons, has successfully completed a
program of residential substance abuse
treatment provided under paragraph (1) of
this subsection, shall remain in the cus-
tody of the Bureau under such conditions
as the Bureau deems appropriate. If the
conditions of confinement are different
from those the prisoner would have expe-
rienced absent the successful completion
of the treatment, the Bureau shall period-
ically test the prisoner for substance abuse
and discontinue such conditions on deter-
mining that substance abuse has recurred.
(B) Period of custody.—The period a
prisoner convicted of a nonviolent offense
remains in custody after successfully com-
pleting a treatment program may be re-
duced by the Bureau of Prisons, but such
reduction may not be more than one year
from the term the prisoner must otherwise
serve.
(3) Report.—The Bureau of Prisons shall
transmit to the Committees on the Judiciary
of the Senate and the House of Representa-
tives on January 1, 1995, and on January 1 of
each year thereafter, a report. Such report
shall contain—
(A) a detailed quantitative and qualita-
tive description of each substance abuse
treatment program, residential or not, op-
erated by the Bureau;
(B) a full explanation of how eligibility
for such programs is determined, with
complete information on what proportion
of prisoners with substance abuse prob-
lems are eligible; and
(C) a complete statement of to what ex-
tent the Bureau has achieved compliance
with the requirements of this title.
(4) Authorization of Appropria-
tions.—There are authorized to carry out
this subsection such sums as may be neces-
sary for each of fiscal years 2007 through
2011.
(5) Definitions.—As used in this subsec-
tion—
(A) the term “residential substance
abuse treatment” means a course of indi-
vidual and group activities and treatment,

§ 3623. Transfer of a prisoner to State au-
thority
The Director of the Bureau of Prisons shall
order that a prisoner who has been charged in
an indictment or information with, or convicted
of, a State felony, be transferred to an official de-
tention facility within such State prior to his re-
lease from a Federal prison facility if—

State;
(2) the State has presented to the Director
a certified copy of the indictment, infor-
mation, or judgment of conviction; and
(3) the Director finds that the transfer

State requesting the transfer.
(Added Pub.L. 98–473, Title II, § 212(a)(2), Oct. 12,
1984, 98 Stat. 2008.)
§ 3624. Release of a prisoner
(a) Date of release.—A prisoner shall be re-
leased by the Bureau of Prisons on the date of
the expiration of the prisoner’s term of impris-
onment, less any time credited toward the ser-
vice of the prisoner’s sentence as provided in
subsection (b). If the date for a prisoner’s release
falls on a Saturday, a Sunday, or a legal holiday
at the place of confinement, the prisoner may be
released by the Bureau on the last preceding
weekday.
(b) Credit toward service of sentence for
satisfactory behavior.—(1) Subject to para-
graph (2), a prisoner who is serving a term of im-
prisonment of more than 1 year, other than a
term of imprisonment for the duration of the
prisoner’s life, may receive credit toward the ser-
vice of the prisoner’s sentence, beyond the time
served, of up to 54 days at the end of each year
of the prisoner’s term of imprisonment, begin-
ning at the end of the first year of the term, sub-
ject to determination by the Bureau of Prisons
that, during that year, the prisoner has dis-
played exemplary compliance with institutional
disciplinary regulations. Subject to paragraph
(2), if the Bureau determines that, during that
year, the prisoner has not satisfactorily com-
plied with such institutional regulations, the
prisoner shall receive no such credit toward ser-
vice of the prisoner’s sentence or shall receive
such lesser credit as the Bureau determines to
be appropriate. In awarding credit under this
section, the Bureau shall consider whether the
prisoner, during the relevant period, has
earned, or is making satisfactory progress to-
ward earning, a high school diploma or an equiv-
alent degree. Credit that has not been earned
may not later be granted. Subject to paragraph
(2), credit for the last year or portion of a year of
the term of imprisonment shall be prorated and
credited within the last six weeks of the sen-
tence.
(2) Notwithstanding any other law, credit
awarded under this subsection after the date of
enactment of the Prison Litigation Reform Act
shall vest on the date the prisoner is released
from custody.
(3) The Attorney General shall ensure that
the Bureau of Prisons has in effect an optional
General Educational Development program for
inmates who have not earned a high school di-
ploma or its equivalent.
(4) Exemptions to the General Educational
Development requirement may be made as
18 U.S.C. § 3624
Appendix B (May 1, 2016) ║ 31
deemed appropriate by the Director of the Fed-
eral Bureau of Prisons.
(c) Pre-release custody.—(1) In gen-
eral.—The Director of the Bureau of Prisons
shall, to the extent practicable, ensure that a
prisoner serving a term of imprisonment spends
a portion of the final months of that term (not to
exceed 12 months), under conditions that will af-
ford that prisoner a reasonable opportunity to
adjust to and prepare for the reentry of that
prisoner into the community. Such conditions
may include a community correctional facility.
(2) Home confinement authority.—The
authority under this subsection may be used to
place a prisoner in home confinement for the
shorter of 10 percent of the term of imprison-
ment of that prisoner or 6 months.
(3) Assistance.—The United States Proba-
tion System shall, to the extent practicable, offer
assistance to a prisoner during prerelease cus-
tody under this subsection.
(4) No limitations.—Nothing in this subsec-
tion shall be construed to limit or restrict the au-
thority of the Director of the Bureau of Prisons
under section 3621.
(5) Reporting.—Not later than 1 year after
the date of the enactment of the Second Chance
Act of 2007 (and every year thereafter), the Di-
rector of the Bureau of Prisons shall transmit to
the Committee on the Judiciary of the Senate
and the Committee on the Judiciary of the
House of Representatives a report describing
the Bureau’s utilization of community correc-
tions facilities. Each report under this para-
graph shall set forth the number and percentage
of Federal prisoners placed in community cor-
rections facilities during the preceding year, the
average length of such placements, trends in
such utilization, the reasons some prisoners are
not placed in community corrections facilities,
and any other information that may be useful to
the committees in determining if the Bureau is
utilizing community corrections facilities in an
effective manner.
(6) Issuance of regulations.—The Director
of the Bureau of Prisons shall issue regulations
pursuant to this subsection not later than 90
days after the date of the enactment of the Sec-
ond Chance Act of 2007, which shall ensure that
placement in a community correctional facility
by the Bureau of Prisons is—
(A) conducted in a manner consistent with
section 3621(b) of this title;
(B) determined on an individual basis;
and
(C) of sufficient duration to provide the
greatest likelihood of successful reintegration
into the community.
(d) Allotment of clothing, funds, and
transportation.—Upon the release of a pris-
oner on the expiration of the prisoner’s term of
imprisonment, the Bureau of Prisons shall fur-
nish the prisoner with—
(1) suitable clothing;
(2) an amount of money, not more than
$500, determined by the Director to be con-
sistent with the needs of the offender and the
public interest, unless the Director deter-
mines that the financial position of the of-
fender is such that no sum should be fur-
nished; and
(3) transportation to the place of the pris-
oner’s conviction, to the prisoner’s bona fide
residence within the United States, or to such
other place within the United States as may
be authorized by the Director.
(e) Supervision after release.—A prisoner
whose sentence includes a term of supervised re-
lease after imprisonment shall be released by
the Bureau of Prisons to the supervision of a pro-
bation officer who shall, during the term im-
posed, supervise the person released to the de-
gree warranted by the conditions specified by
the sentencing court. The term of supervised re-
lease commences on the day the person is re-
leased from imprisonment and runs concur-
rently with any Federal, State, or local term of
probation or supervised release or parole for an-
other offense to which the person is subject or
becomes subject during the term of supervised
release. A term of supervised release does not
run during any period in which the person is im-
prisoned in connection with a conviction for a
Federal, State, or local crime unless the impris-
onment is for a period of less than 30 consecutive
days. Upon the release of a prisoner by the Bu-
reau of Prisons to supervised release, the Bu-
18 U.S.C. § 3661
32 ║ Appendix B (May 1, 2016)
reau of Prisons shall notify such prisoner, ver-
bally and in writing, of the requirement that the
prisoner adhere to an installment schedule, not
to exceed 2 years except in special circum-
stances, to pay for any fine imposed for the of-
fense committed by such prisoner, and of the
consequences of failure to pay such fines under
sections 3611 through 3614 of this title.
(f) Mandatory functional literacy re-
quirement.—
(1) The Attorney General shall direct the
Bureau of Prisons to have in effect a manda-
tory functional literacy program for all men-
tally capable inmates who are not function-
ally literate in each Federal correctional in-
stitution within 6 months from the date of the
enactment of this Act.
(2) Each mandatory functional literacy
program shall include a requirement that
each inmate participate in such program for
a mandatory period sufficient to provide the
inmate with an adequate opportunity to
achieve functional literacy, and appropriate
incentives which lead to successful comple-
tion of such programs shall be developed and
implemented.
(3) As used in this section, the term “func-
tional literacy” means–
(A) an eighth grade equivalence in
reading and mathematics on a nationally
recognized standardized test;
(B) functional competency or literacy
on a nationally recognized criterion–refer-
enced test; or
(C) a combination of subparagraphs (A)
and (B).
(4) Non-English speaking inmates shall be
required to participate in an English-As-A-
Second-Language program until they func-
tion at the equivalence of the eighth grade on
a nationally recognized educational achieve-
ment test.
(5) The Chief Executive Officer of each in-
stitution shall have authority to grant waiv-
ers for good cause as determined and docu-
mented on an individual basis.

§ 3663. Order of restitution
(a)(1)(A) The court, when sentencing a de-
fendant convicted of an offense under this title,
section 401, 408(a), 409, 416, 420, or 422(a) of
the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 841,
848(a), 849, 856, 861, 863) (but in no case shall
a participant in an offense under such sections
be considered a victim of such offense under this
section), or section 5124, 46312, 46502, or 46504
of title 49, other than an offense described in sec-
tion 3663A(c), may order, in addition to or, in the
case of a misdemeanor, in lieu of any other pen-
alty authorized by law, that the defendant make
restitution to any victim of such offense, or if the
victim is deceased, to the victim’s estate. The
court may also order, if agreed to by the parties
in a plea agreement, restitution to persons other
than the victim of the offense.
(B)(i) The court, in determining whether to
order restitution under this section, shall con-
sider—
(I) the amount of the loss sustained by
each victim as a result of the offense; and
(II) the financial resources of the defend-
ant, the financial needs and earning ability of
the defendant and the defendant’s depend-
ents, and such other factors as the court
deems appropriate.
(ii) To the extent that the court determines
that the complication and prolongation of the
sentencing process resulting from the fashion-
ing of an order of restitution under this section
outweighs the need to provide restitution to any
victims, the court may decline to make such an
order.
(2) For the purposes of this section, the term
“victim” means a person directly and proxi-
mately harmed as a result of the commission of
an offense for which restitution may be ordered
including, in the case of an offense that involves
as an element a scheme, conspiracy, or pattern
of criminal activity, any person directly harmed
by the defendant’s criminal conduct in the
course of the scheme, conspiracy, or pattern. In
the case of a victim who is under 18 years of age,
incompetent, incapacitated, or deceased, the le-
gal guardian of the victim or representative of
the victim’s estate, another family member, or
any other person appointed as suitable by the
court, may assume the victim’s rights under this
section, but in no event shall the defendant be
named as such representative or guardian.
(3) The court may also order restitution in
any criminal case to the extent agreed to by the
parties in a plea agreement.
(b) The order may require that such defend-
ant—
(1) in the case of an offense resulting in
damage to or loss or destruction of property
of a victim of the offense—
(A) return the property to the owner of
the property or someone designated by the
owner; or
(B) if return of the property under sub-
paragraph (A) is impossible, impractical,
or inadequate, pay an amount equal to the
greater of—
(i) the value of the property on the
date of the damage, loss, or destruction,
or
(ii) the value of the property on the
date of sentencing,
less the value (as of the date the property
is returned) of any part of the property
that is returned;
(2) in the case of an offense resulting in
bodily injury to a victim including an offense
under chapter 109A or chapter 110—
(A) pay an amount equal to the cost of
necessary medical and related profes-
sional services and devices relating to
physical, psychiatric, and psychological
care, including nonmedical care and treat-
ment rendered in accordance with a
method of healing recognized by the law of
the place of treatment;
(B) pay an amount equal to the cost of
necessary physical and occupational ther-
apy and rehabilitation; and
(C) reimburse the victim for income lost
by such victim as a result of such offense;
(3) in the case of an offense resulting in
bodily injury also results in the death of a vic-
tim, pay an amount equal to the cost of nec-
essary funeral and related services;
18 U.S.C. § 3663A
34 ║ Appendix B (May 1, 2016)
(4) in any case, reimburse the victim for
lost income and necessary child care, trans-
portation, and other expenses related to par-
ticipation in the investigation or prosecution
of the offense or attendance at proceedings
related to the offense;
(5) in any case, if the victim (or if the vic-
tim is deceased, the victim’s estate) consents,
make restitution in services in lieu of money,
or make restitution to a person or organiza-
tion designated by the victim or the estate;
and
(6) in the case of an offense under sections
1028(a)(7) or 1028A(a) of this title, pay an
amount equal to the value of the time reason-
ably spent by the victim in an attempt to re-
mediate the intended or actual harm in-
curred by the victim from the offense.
(c)(1) Notwithstanding any other provision
of law (but subject to the provisions of subsec-
tions (a)(1)(B) (i)(II) and (ii), when sentencing a
defendant convicted of an offense described in
section 401, 408(a), 409, 416, 420, or 422(a) of
the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 841,
848(a), 849, 856, 861, 863), in which there is no
identifiable victim, the court may order that the
defendant make restitution in accordance with
this subsection.
(2)(A) An order of restitution under this sub-
section shall be based on the amount of public
harm caused by the offense, as determined by
the court in accordance with guidelines promul-
gated by the United States Sentencing Commis-
sion.
(B) In no case shall the amount of restitution
ordered under this subsection exceed the
amount of the fine which may be ordered for the
offense charged in the case.
(3) Restitution under this subsection shall be
distributed as follows:
(A) 65 percent of the total amount of resti-
tution shall be paid to the State entity desig-
nated to administer crime victim assistance
in the State in which the crime occurred.
(B) 35 percent of the total amount of resti-
tution shall be paid to the State entity desig-
nated to receive Federal substance abuse
block grant funds.
(4) The court shall not make an award under
this subsection if it appears likely that such
award would interfere with a forfeiture under
chapter 46 or chapter 96 of this title or under the
Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 801 et
seq.).
(5) Notwithstanding section 3612(c) or any
other provision of law, a penalty assessment un-
der section 3013 or a fine under subchapter C of
chapter 227 shall take precedence over an order
of restitution under this subsection.
(6) Requests for community restitution under
this subsection may be considered in all plea
agreements negotiated by the United States.
(7)(A) The United States Sentencing Com-
mission shall promulgate guidelines to assist
courts in determining the amount of restitution
that may be ordered under this subsection.
(B) No restitution shall be ordered under this
subsection until such time as the Sentencing
Commission promulgates guidelines pursuant
to this paragraph.
(d) An order of restitution made pursuant to
this section shall be issued and enforced in ac-
cordance with section 3664.

§ 3663A. Mandatory restitution to victims
of certain crimes
(a)(1) Notwithstanding any other provision
of law, when sentencing a defendant convicted
of an offense described in subsection (c), the
18 U.S.C. § 3663A
Appendix B (May 1, 2016) ║ 35
court shall order, in addition to, or in the case of
a misdemeanor, in addition to or in lieu of, any
other penalty authorized by law, that the de-
fendant make restitution to the victim of the of-
fense or, if the victim is deceased, to the victim’s
estate.
(2) For the purposes of this section, the term
“victim” means a person directly and proxi-
mately harmed as a result of the commission of
an offense for which restitution may be ordered
including, in the case of an offense that involves
as an element a scheme, conspiracy, or pattern
of criminal activity, any person directly harmed
by the defendant’s criminal conduct in the
course of the scheme, conspiracy, or pattern. In
the case of a victim who is under 18 years of age,
incompetent, incapacitated, or deceased, the le-
gal guardian of the victim or representative of
the victim’s estate, another family member, or
any other person appointed as suitable by the
court, may assume the victim’s rights under this
section, but in no event shall the defendant be
named as such representative or guardian.
(3) The court shall also order, if agreed to by
the parties in a plea agreement, restitution to
persons other than the victim of the offense.
(b) The order of restitution shall require that
such defendant—
(1) in the case of an offense resulting in
damage to or loss or destruction of property
of a victim of the offense—
(A) return the property to the owner of
the property or someone designated by the
owner; or
(B) if return of the property under sub-
paragraph (A) is impossible, impractica-
ble, or inadequate, pay an amount equal
to—
(i) the greater of—
(I) the value of the property on
the date of the damage, loss, or de-
struction; or
(II) the value of the property on
the date of sentencing, less
(ii) the value (as of the date the prop-
erty is returned) of any part of the prop-
erty that is returned;
(2) in the case of an offense resulting in
bodily injury to a victim—
(A) pay an amount equal to the cost of
necessary medical and related profes-
sional services and devices relating to
physical, psychiatric, and psychological
care, including nonmedical care and treat-
ment rendered in accordance with a
method of healing recognized by the law of
the place of treatment;
(B) pay an amount equal to the cost of
necessary physical and occupational ther-
apy and rehabilitation; and
(C) reimburse the victim for income lost
by such victim as a result of such offense;
(3) in the case of an offense resulting in
bodily injury that results in the death of the
victim, pay an amount equal to the cost of
necessary funeral and related services; and
(4) in any case, reimburse the victim for
lost income and necessary child care, trans-
portation, and other expenses incurred dur-
ing participation in the investigation or pros-
ecution of the offense or attendance at pro-
ceedings related to the offense.
(c)(1) This section shall apply in all sentenc-
ing proceedings for convictions of, or plea agree-
ments relating to charges for, any offense—
(A) that is—
(i) a crime of violence, as defined in sec-
tion 16;
(ii) an offense against property under
this title, or under section 416(a) of the
Controlled Substance Act (21 U.S.C.
856(a)), including any offense committed
by fraud or deceit;
(iii) an offense described in section
1365 (relating to tampering with con-
sumer products); or
(iv) an offense under section 670 (relat-
ing to theft of medical products); and
(B) in which an identifiable victim or vic-
tims has suffered a physical injury or pe-
cuniary loss.
(2) In the case of a plea agreement that does
not result in a conviction for an offense described
in paragraph (1), this section shall apply only if
the plea specifically states that an offense listed
under such paragraph gave rise to the plea
agreement.
18 U.S.C. § 3664
36 ║ Appendix B (May 1, 2016)
(3) This section shall not apply in the case of
an offense described in paragraph (1)(A)(ii) if the
court finds, from facts on the record, that—
(A) the number of identifiable victims is so
large as to make restitution impracticable;
or
(B) determining complex issues of fact re-
lated to the cause or amount of the victim’s
losses would complicate or prolong the sen-
tencing process to a degree that the need to
provide restitution to any victim is out-
weighed by the burden on the sentencing pro-
cess.
(d) An order of restitution under this section
shall be issued and enforced in accordance with
section 3664.
(Added Pub.L. 104–132, Title II, § 204(a), Apr. 24, 1996,

§ 3664. Procedure for issuance and en-
forcement of order of restitution
(a) For orders of restitution under this title,
the court shall order the probation officer to ob-
tain and include in its presentence report, or in
a separate report, as the court may direct, infor-
mation sufficient for the court to exercise its dis-
cretion in fashioning a restitution order. The re-
port shall include, to the extent practicable, a
complete accounting of the losses to each victim,
any restitution owed pursuant to a plea agree-
ment, and information relating to the economic
circumstances of each defendant. If the number
or identity of victims cannot be reasonably as-
certained, or other circumstances exist that
make this requirement clearly impracticable,
the probation officer shall so inform the court.
(b) The court shall disclose to both the de-
fendant and the attorney for the Government all
portions of the presentence or other report per-
taining to the matters described in subsection
(a) of this section.
(c) The provisions of this chapter, chapter
227, and Rule 32(c) of the Federal Rules of Crim-
inal Procedure shall be the only rules applicable
to proceedings under this section.
(d)(1) Upon the request of the probation of-
ficer, but not later than 60 days prior to the date
initially set for sentencing, the attorney for the
Government, after consulting, to the extent
practicable, with all identified victims, shall
promptly provide the probation officer with a
listing of the amounts subject to restitution.
(2) The probation officer shall, prior to sub-
mitting the presentence report under subsection
(a), to the extent practicable—
(A) provide notice to all identified victims
of—
(i) the offense or offenses of which the
defendant was convicted;
(ii) the amounts subject to restitution
submitted to the probation officer;
(iii) the opportunity of the victim to
submit information to the probation officer
concerning the amount of the victim’s
losses;
(iv) the scheduled date, time, and place
of the sentencing hearing;
(v) the availability of a lien in favor of
the victim pursuant to subsection
(m)(1)(B); and
(vi) the opportunity of the victim to file
with the probation officer a separate affi-
davit relating to the amount of the victim’s
losses subject to restitution; and
(B) provide the victim with an affidavit
form to submit pursuant to subparagraph
(A)(vi).
(3) Each defendant shall prepare and file
with the probation officer an affidavit fully de-
scribing the financial resources of the defend-
ant, including a complete listing of all assets
owned or controlled by the defendant as of the
date on which the defendant was arrested, the
financial needs and earning ability of the de-
fendant and the defendant’s dependents, and
such other information that the court requires
relating to such other factors as the court deems
appropriate.
(4) After reviewing the report of the proba-
tion officer, the court may require additional
documentation or hear testimony. The privacy of
any records filed, or testimony heard, pursuant
18 U.S.C. § 3664
Appendix B (May 1, 2016) ║ 37
to this section shall be maintained to the great-
est extent possible, and such records may be
filed or testimony heard in camera.
(5) If the victim’s losses are not ascertainable
by the date that is 10 days prior to sentencing,
the attorney for the Government or the proba-
tion officer shall so inform the court, and the
court shall set a date for the final determination
of the victim’s losses, not to exceed 90 days after
sentencing. If the victim subsequently discovers
further losses, the victim shall have 60 days af-
ter discovery of those losses in which to petition
the court for an amended restitution order. Such
order may be granted only upon a showing of
good cause for the failure to include such losses
in the initial claim for restitutionary relief.
(6) The court may refer any issue arising in
connection with a proposed order of restitution
to a magistrate judge or special master for pro-
posed findings of fact and recommendations as
to disposition, subject to a de novo determina-
tion of the issue by the court.
(e) Any dispute as to the proper amount or
type of restitution shall be resolved by the court
by the preponderance of the evidence. The bur-
den of demonstrating the amount of the loss sus-
tained by a victim as a result of the offense shall
be on the attorney for the Government. The bur-
den of demonstrating the financial resources of
the defendant and the financial needs of the de-
fendant’s dependents, shall be on the defendant.
The burden of demonstrating such other mat-
ters as the court deems appropriate shall be
upon the party designated by the court as justice
requires.
(f)(1)(A) In each order of restitution, the
court shall order restitution to each victim in the
full amount of each victim’s losses as deter-
mined by the court and without consideration of
the economic circumstances of the defendant.
(B) In no case shall the fact that a victim has
received or is entitled to receive compensation
with respect to a loss from insurance or any
other source be considered in determining the
amount of restitution.
(2) Upon determination of the amount of res-
titution owed to each victim, the court shall,
pursuant to section 3572, specify in the restitu-
tion order the manner in which, and the sched-
ule according to which, the restitution is to be
paid, in consideration of—
(A) the financial resources and other as-
sets of the defendant, including whether any
of these assets are jointly controlled;
(B) projected earnings and other income of
the defendant; and
(C) any financial obligations of the defend-
ant; including obligations to dependents.
(3)(A) A restitution order may direct the de-
fendant to make a single, lump-sum payment,
partial payments at specified intervals, in-kind
payments, or a combination of payments at spec-
ified intervals and in-kind payments.
(B) A restitution order may direct the defend-
ant to make nominal periodic payments if the
court finds from facts on the record that the eco-
nomic circumstances of the defendant do not al-
low the payment of any amount of a restitution
order, and do not allow for the payment of the
full amount of a restitution order in the foresee-
able future under any reasonable schedule of
payments.
(4) An in-kind payment described in para-
graph (3) may be in the form of—
(A) return of property;
(B) replacement of property; or
(C) if the victim agrees, services rendered
to the victim or a person or organization other
than the victim.
(g)(1) No victim shall be required to partici-
pate in any phase of a restitution order.
(2) A victim may at any time assign the vic-
tim’s interest in restitution payments to the
Crime Victims Fund in the Treasury without in
any way impairing the obligation of the defend-
ant to make such payments.
(h) If the court finds that more than 1 defend-
ant has contributed to the loss of a victim, the
court may make each defendant liable for pay-
ment of the full amount of restitution or may ap-
portion liability among the defendants to reflect
the level of contribution to the victim’s loss and
economic circumstances of each defendant.
(i) If the court finds that more than 1 victim
has sustained a loss requiring restitution by a
defendant, the court may provide for a different
payment schedule for each victim based on the
18 U.S.C. § 3664
38 ║ Appendix B (May 1, 2016)
type and amount of each victim’s loss and ac-
counting for the economic circumstances of each
victim. In any case in which the United States is
a victim, the court shall ensure that all other vic-
tims receive full restitution before the United
States receives any restitution.
(j)(1) If a victim has received compensation
from insurance or any other source with respect
to a loss, the court shall order that restitution be
paid to the person who provided or is obligated
to provide the compensation, but the restitution
order shall provide that all restitution of victims
required by the order be paid to the victims be-
fore any restitution is paid to such a provider of
compensation.
(2) Any amount paid to a victim under an or-
der of restitution shall be reduced by any
amount later recovered as compensatory dam-
ages for the same loss by the victim in—
(A) any Federal civil proceeding; and
(B) any State civil proceeding, to the ex-
tent provided by the law of the State.
(k) A restitution order shall provide that the
defendant shall notify the court and the Attor-
ney General of any material change in the de-
fendant’s economic circumstances that might af-
fect the defendant’s ability to pay restitution.
The court may also accept notification of a ma-
terial change in the defendant’s economic cir-
cumstances from the United States or from the
victim. The Attorney General shall certify to the
court that the victim or victims owed restitution
by the defendant have been notified of the
change in circumstances. Upon receipt of the no-
tification, the court may, on its own motion, or
the motion of any party, including the victim,
adjust the payment schedule, or require imme-
diate payment in full, as the interests of justice
require.
(l) A conviction of a defendant for an offense
involving the act giving rise to an order of resti-
tution shall estop the defendant from denying
the essential allegations of that offense in any
subsequent Federal civil proceeding or State
civil proceeding, to the extent consistent with
State law, brought by the victim.
(m)(1)(A)(i) An order of restitution may be
enforced by the United States in the manner
provided for in subchapter C of chapter 227 and
subchapter B of chapter 229 of this title; or
(ii) by all other available and reasonable
means.
(B) At the request of a victim named in a res-
titution order, the clerk of the court shall issue
an abstract of judgment certifying that a judg-
ment has been entered in favor of such victim in
the amount specified in the restitution order.
Upon registering, recording, docketing, or index-
ing such abstract in accordance with the rules
and requirements relating to judgments of the
court of the State where the district court is lo-
cated, the abstract of judgment shall be a lien on
the property of the defendant located in such
State in the same manner and to the same ex-
tent and under the same conditions as a judg-
ment of a court of general jurisdiction in that
State.
(2) An order of in-kind restitution in the form
of services shall be enforced by the probation of-
ficer.
(n) If a person obligated to provide restitu-
tion, or pay a fine, receives substantial resources
from any source, including inheritance, settle-
ment, or other judgment, during a period of in-
carceration, such person shall be required to ap-
ply the value of such resources to any restitution
or fine still owed.
(o) A sentence that imposes an order of resti-
tution is a final judgment notwithstanding the
fact that—
(1) such a sentence can subsequently be—
(A) corrected under Rule 35 of the Fed-
eral Rules of Criminal Procedure and sec-
tion 3742 of chapter 235 of this title;
(B) appealed and modified under sec-
tion 3742;
(C) amended under subsection (d)(5); or
(D) adjusted under section 3664(k),
3572, or 3613A; or
(2) the defendant may be resentenced un-
der section 3565 or 3614.
(p) Nothing in this section or sections 2248,
2259, 2264, 2327, 3663, and 3663A and arising
out of the application of such sections, shall be
construed to create a cause of action not other-
wise authorized in favor of any person against
18 U.S.C. § 3742

the United States or any officer or employee of

CHAPTER 235─APPEAL
* * *
§ 3742. Review of a sentence
(a) Appeal by a defendant.—A defendant
may file a notice of appeal in the district court
for review of an otherwise final sentence if the
sentence—
(1) was imposed in violation of law;
(2) was imposed as a result of an incorrect
application of the sentencing guidelines; or
(3) is greater than the sentence specified
in the applicable guideline range to the ex-
tent that the sentence includes a greater fine
or term of imprisonment, probation, or super-
vised release than the maximum established
in the guideline range, or includes a more
limiting condition of probation or supervised
release under section 3563(b)(6) or (b)(11)
than the maximum established in the guide-
line range; or
(4) was imposed for an offense for which
there is no sentencing guideline and is
plainly unreasonable.
(b) Appeal by the Government.—The Gov-
ernment may file a notice of appeal in the dis-
trict court for review of an otherwise final sen-
tence if the sentence—
(1) was imposed in violation of law;
(2) was imposed as a result of an incorrect
application of the sentencing guidelines;
(3) is less than the sentence specified in
the applicable guideline range to the extent
that the sentence includes a lesser fine or
term of imprisonment, probation, or super-
vised release than the minimum established
in the guideline range, or includes a less lim-
iting condition of probation or supervised re-
lease under section 3563(b)(6) or (b)(11) than
the minimum established in the guideline
range; or
(4) was imposed for an offense for which
there is no sentencing guideline and is
plainly unreasonable.
The Government may not further prosecute
such appeal without the personal approval of
the Attorney General, the Solicitor General, or a
deputy solicitor general designated by the Solic-
itor General.
(c) Plea agreements.—In the case of a plea
agreement that includes a specific sentence un-
der rule 11(e)(1)(C) of the Federal Rules of Crim-
inal Procedure—
(1) a defendant may not file a notice of ap-
peal under paragraph (3) or (4) of subsection
(a) unless the sentence imposed is greater
than the sentence set forth in such agree-
ment; and
(2) the Government may not file a notice
of appeal under paragraph (3) or (4) of sub-
section (b) unless the sentence imposed is less
than the sentence set forth in such agree-
ment.
(d) Record on review.—If a notice of appeal
is filed in the district court pursuant to subsec-
tion (a) or (b), the clerk shall certify to the court
of appeals—
(1) that portion of the record in the case
that is designated as pertinent by either of
the parties;
(2) the presentence report; and
(3) the information submitted during the
sentencing proceeding.
(e) Consideration.—Upon review of the rec-
ord, the court of appeals shall determine
whether the sentence—
(1) was imposed in violation of law;
(2) was imposed as a result of an incorrect
application of the sentencing guidelines;
(3) is outside the applicable guideline
range, and
18 U.S.C. § 3742
40 ║ Appendix B (May 1, 2016)
(A) the district court failed to provide
the written statement of reasons required
by section 3553(c);
(B) the sentence departs from the ap-
plicable guideline range based on a factor
that—
(i) does not advance the objectives
set forth in section 3553(a)(2); or
(ii) is not authorized under section
3553(b); or
(iii) is not justified by the facts of the
case; or
(C) the sentence departs to an unrea-
sonable degree from the applicable guide-
lines range, having regard for the factors
to be considered in imposing a sentence, as
set forth in section 3553(a) of this title and
the reasons for the imposition of the par-
ticular sentence, as stated by the district
court pursuant to the provisions of section
3553(c); or
(4) was imposed for an offense for which
there is no applicable sentencing guideline
and is plainly unreasonable.
The court of appeals shall give due regard to the
opportunity of the district court to judge the
credibility of the witnesses, and shall accept the
findings of fact of the district court unless they
are clearly erroneous and, except with respect to
determinations under subsection (3)(A) or
(3)(B), shall give due deference to the district
court’s application of the guidelines to the facts.
With respect to determinations under subsec-
tion (3)(A) or (3)(B), the court of appeals shall
review de novo the district court’s application of
the guidelines to the facts.
(f) Decision and disposition.—If the court
of appeals determines that—
(1) the sentence was imposed in violation
of law or imposed as a result of an incorrect
application of the sentencing guidelines, the
court shall remand the case for further sen-
tencing proceedings with such instructions as
the court considers appropriate;
(2) the sentence is outside the applicable
guideline range and the district court failed
to provide the required statement of reasons
in the order of judgment and commitment, or
the departure is based on an impermissible
factor, or is to an unreasonable degree, or the
sentence was imposed for an offense for
which there is no applicable sentencing
guideline and is plainly unreasonable, it shall
state specific reasons for its conclusions
and—
(A) if it determines that the sentence is
too high and the appeal has been filed un-
der subsection (a), it shall set aside the
sentence and remand the case for further
sentencing proceedings with such instruc-
tions as the court considers appropriate,
subject to subsection (g);
(B) if it determines that the sentence is
too low and the appeal has been filed un-
der subsection (b), it shall set aside the
sentence and remand the case for further
sentencing proceedings with such instruc-
tions as the court considers appropriate,
subject to subsection (g);
(3) the sentence is not described in para-
graph (1) or (2), it shall affirm the sentence.
(g) Sentencing upon remand.—A district
court to which a case is remanded pursuant to
subsection (f)(1) or (f)(2) shall resentence a de-
fendant in accordance with section 3553 and
with such instructions as may have been given
by the court of appeals, except that—
(1) In determining the range referred to in
subsection 3553(a)(4), the court shall apply
the guidelines issued by the Sentencing Com-
mission pursuant to section 994(a)(1) of title
28, United States Code, and that were in ef-
fect on the date of the previous sentencing of
the defendant prior to the appeal, together
with any amendments thereto by any act of
Congress that was in effect on such date; and
(2) The court shall not impose a sentence
outside the applicable guidelines range ex-
cept upon a ground that—
(A) was specifically and affirmatively
included in the written statement of rea-
sons required by section 3553(c) in connec-
tion with the previous sentencing of the
defendant prior to the appeal; and
(B) was held by the court of appeals, in
remanding the case, to be a permissible
ground of departure.

(h) Application to a sentence by a magis-
trate.—An appeal of an otherwise final sen-
tence imposed by a United States magistrate
may be taken to a judge of the district court, and
this section shall apply (except for the require-
ment of approval by the Attorney General or the
Solicitor General in the case of a Government
appeal) as though the appeal were to a court of
appeals from a sentence imposed by a district
court.
(i) Guideline not expressed as a range.—
For the purpose of this section, the term “guide-
line range” includes a guideline range having
the same upper and lower limits.
(j) Definitions.—For purposes of this sec-
tion—
(1) a factor is a “permissible” ground of de-
parture if it—
(A) advances the objectives set forth in
section 3553(a)(2); and
(B) is authorized under section 3553(b);
and
(C) is justified by the facts of the case;
and
(2) a factor is an “impermissible” ground
of departure if it is not a permissible factor
within the meaning of subsection (j)(1).

§ 991. United States Sentencing Commis-
sion; establishment and purposes
(a) There is established as an independent
commission in the judicial branch of the United
States a United States Sentencing Commission
which shall consist of seven voting members and
one nonvoting member. The President, after
consultation with representatives of judges,
prosecuting attorneys, defense attorneys, law
enforcement officials, senior citizens, victims of
crime, and others interested in the criminal jus-
tice process, shall appoint the voting members
of the Commission, by and with the advice and
consent of the Senate, one of whom shall be ap-
pointed, by and with the advice and consent of
the Senate, as the Chair and three of whom shall
be designated by the President as Vice Chairs.
At least 3 of the members shall be Federal
judges selected after considering a list of six
judges recommended to the President by the Ju-
dicial Conference of the United States. Not more
than four of the members of the Commission
shall be members of the same political party,
and of the three Vice Chairs, no more than two
shall be members of the same political party.
The Attorney General, or the Attorney General’s
designee, shall be an ex officio, nonvoting mem-
ber of the Commission. The Chair, Vice Chairs,
and members of the Commission shall be subject
to removal from the Commission by the Presi-
dent only for neglect of duty or malfeasance in
office or for other good cause shown.
(b) The purposes of the United States Sen-
tencing Commission are to—
(1) establish sentencing policies and prac-
tices for the Federal criminal justice system
that—
(A) assure the meeting of the purposes
of sentencing as set forth in section
3553(a)(2) of title 18, United States Code;
(B) provide certainty and fairness in
meeting the purposes of sentencing, avoid-
ing unwarranted sentencing disparities
among defendants with similar records
who have been found guilty of similar
criminal conduct while maintaining suffi-
cient flexibility to permit individualized
sentences when warranted by mitigating
or aggravating factors not taken into ac-
count in the establishment of general sen-
tencing practices; and
(C) reflect, to the extent practicable, ad-
vancement in knowledge of human behav-
ior as it relates to the criminal justice pro-
cess; and
(2) develop means of measuring the degree
to which the sentencing, penal, and correc-
tional practices are effective in meeting the
purposes of sentencing as set forth in section
3553(a)(2) of title 18, United States Code.

with all pertinent provisions of any Federal stat-

the sentence to be imposed in a criminal case,
including—

cluding the appropriate use of—
(A) the sanctions set forth in sections
3554, 3555, and 3556 of title 18;
(B) the conditions of probation and su-
pervised release set forth in sections

sions for revocation of probation set forth in
section 3565 of title 18, and the provisions for
modification of the term or conditions of su-
pervised release and revocation of supervised
release set forth in section 3583(e) of title 18.
(b)(1) The Commission, in the guidelines
promulgated pursuant to subsection (a)(1),
shall, for each category of offense involving each
category of defendant, establish a sentencing
range that is consistent with all pertinent provi-
sions of title 18, United States Code.
(2) If a sentence specified by the guidelines
includes a term of imprisonment, the maximum
of the range established for such a term shall not
exceed the minimum of that range by more than
the greater of 25 percent or 6 months, except
that, if the minimum term of the range is 30
years or more, the maximum may be life impris-
onment.
(c) The Commission, in establishing catego-
ries of offenses for use in the guidelines and pol-
icy statements governing the imposition of sen-
tences of probation, a fine, or imprisonment,
governing the imposition of other authorized
sanctions, governing the size of a fine or the
length of a term of probation, imprisonment, or
supervised release, and governing the condi-
tions of probation, supervised release, or impris-
onment, shall consider whether the following
matters, among others, have any relevance to
the nature, extent, place of service, or other in-
cidents of an appropriate sentence, and shall
take them into account only to the extent that
they do have relevance—
(1) the grade of the offense;
(2) the circumstances under which the of-
fense was committed which mitigate or ag-
gravate the seriousness of the offense;
(3) the nature and degree of the harm
caused by the offense, including whether it
involved property, irreplaceable property, a
person, a number of persons, or a breach of
public trust;
28 U.S.C. § 994
Appendix B (May 1, 2016) ║ 45
(4) the community view of the gravity of
the offense;
(5) the public concern generated by the of-
fense;
(6) the deterrent effect a particular sen-
tence may have on the commission of the of-
fense by others; and
(7) the current incidence of the offense in
the community and in the Nation as a whole.
(d) The Commission in establishing catego-
ries of defendants for use in the guidelines and
policy statements governing the imposition of
sentences of probation, a fine, or imprisonment,
governing the imposition of other authorized
sanctions, governing the size of a fine or the
length of a term of probation, imprisonment, or
supervised release, and governing the condi-
tions of probation, supervised release, or impris-
onment, shall consider whether the following
matters, among others with respect to a defend-
ant, have any relevance to the nature, extent,
place of service, or other incidents of an appro-
priate sentence, and shall take them into ac-
count only to the extent that they do have rele-
vance—
(1) age;
(2) education;
(3) vocational skills;
(4) mental and emotional condition to the
extent that such condition mitigates the de-
fendant’s culpability or to the extent that
such condition is otherwise plainly relevant;
(5) physical condition, including drug de-
pendence;
(6) previous employment record;
(7) family ties and responsibilities;
(8) community ties;
(9) role in the offense;
(10) criminal history; and
(11) degree of dependence upon criminal
activity for a livelihood.
The Commission shall assure that the guide-
lines and policy statements are entirely neutral
as to the race, sex, national origin, creed, and so-
cioeconomic status of offenders.
(e) The Commission shall assure that the
guidelines and policy statements, in recom-
mending a term of imprisonment or length of a
term of imprisonment, reflect the general inap-
propriateness of considering the education, vo-
cational skills, employment record, family ties
and responsibilities, and community ties of the
defendant.
(f) The Commission, in promulgating guide-
lines pursuant to subsection (a)(1), shall pro-
mote the purposes set forth in section 991(b)(1),
with particular attention to the requirements of
subsection 991(b)(1)(B) for providing certainty
and fairness in sentencing and reducing unwar-
ranted sentence disparities.
(g) The Commission, in promulgating guide-
lines pursuant to subsection (a)(1) to meet the
purposes of sentencing as set forth in section
3553(a)(2) of title 18, United States Code, shall
take into account the nature and capacity of the
penal, correctional, and other facilities and ser-
vices available, and shall make recommenda-
tions concerning any change or expansion in the
nature or capacity of such facilities and services
that might become necessary as a result of the
guidelines promulgated pursuant to the provi-
sions of this chapter. The sentencing guidelines
prescribed under this chapter shall be formu-
lated to minimize the likelihood that the Federal
prison population will exceed the capacity of the
Federal prisons, as determined by the Commis-
sion.
(h) The Commission shall assure that the
guidelines specify a sentence to a term of impris-
onment at or near the maximum term author-
ized for categories of defendants in which the de-
fendant is eighteen years old or older and—
(1) has been convicted of a felony that is—
(A) a crime of violence; or
(B) an offense described in section 401
of the Controlled Substances Act (21
U.S.C. 841), sections 1002(a), 1005, and
1009 of the Controlled Substances Import
and Export Act (21 U.S.C. 952(a), 955, and
959), and chapter 705 of title 46; and
(2) has previously been convicted of two or
more prior felonies, each of which is—
(A) a crime of violence; or
(B) an offense described in section 401
of the Controlled Substances Act (21
U.S.C. 841), sections 1002(a), 1005, and
1009 of the Controlled Substances Import
28 U.S.C. § 994
46 ║ Appendix B (May 1, 2016)
and Export Act (21 U.S.C. 952(a), 955, and
959), and chapter 705 of title 46.
(i) The Commission shall assure that the
guidelines specify a sentence to a substantial
term of imprisonment for categories of defend-
ants in which the defendant—
(1) has a history of two or more prior Fed-
eral, State, or local felony convictions for of-
fenses committed on different occasions;
(2) committed the offense as part of a pat-
tern of criminal conduct from which the de-
fendant derived a substantial portion of the
defendant’s income;
(3) committed the offense in furtherance of
a conspiracy with three or more persons en-
gaging in a pattern of racketeering activity in
which the defendant participated in a mana-
gerial or supervisory capacity;
(4) committed a crime of violence that con-
stitutes a felony while on release pending
trial, sentence, or appeal from a Federal,
State, or local felony for which he was ulti-
mately convicted; or
(5) committed a felony that is set forth in
section 401 or 1010 of the Comprehensive
Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of
1970 (21 U.S.C. 841 and 960), and that in-
volved trafficking in a substantial quantity of
a controlled substance.
(j) The Commission shall insure that the
guidelines reflect the general appropriateness of
imposing a sentence other than imprisonment in
cases in which the defendant is a first offender
who has not been convicted of a crime of violence
or an otherwise serious offense, and the general
appropriateness of imposing a term of imprison-
ment on a person convicted of a crime of violence
that results in serious bodily injury.
(k) The Commission shall insure that the
guidelines reflect the inappropriateness of im-
posing a sentence to a term of imprisonment for
the purpose of rehabilitating the defendant or
providing the defendant with needed educa-
tional or vocational training, medical care, or
other correctional treatment.
(l) The Commission shall insure that the
guidelines promulgated pursuant to subsection
(a)(1) reflect—
(1) the appropriateness of imposing an in-
cremental penalty for each offense in a case
in which a defendant is convicted of—
(A) multiple offenses committed in the
same course of conduct that result in the
exercise of ancillary jurisdiction over one
or more of the offenses; and
(B) multiple offenses committed at dif-
ferent times, including those cases in
which the subsequent offense is a violation
of section 3146 (penalty for failure to ap-
pear) or is committed while the person is
released pursuant to the provisions of sec-
tion 3147 (penalty for an offense commit-
ted while on release) of title 18; and
(2) the general inappropriateness of im-
posing consecutive terms of imprisonment for
an offense of conspiring to commit an offense
or soliciting commission of an offense and for
an offense that was the sole object of the con-
spiracy or solicitation.
(m) The Commission shall insure that the
guidelines reflect the fact that, in many cases,
current sentences do not accurately reflect the
seriousness of the offense. This will require that,
as a starting point in its development of the ini-
tial sets of guidelines for particular categories of
cases, the Commission ascertain the average
sentences imposed in such categories of cases
prior to the creation of the Commission, and in
cases involving sentences to terms of imprison-
ment, the length of such terms actually served.
The Commission shall not be bound by such av-
erage sentences, and shall independently de-
velop a sentencing range that is consistent with
the purposes of sentencing described in section
3553(a)(2) of Title 18, United States Code.
(n) The Commission shall assure that the
guidelines reflect the general appropriateness of
imposing a lower sentence than would otherwise
be imposed, including a sentence that is lower
than that established by statute as a minimum
sentence, to take into account a defendant’s sub-
stantial assistance in the investigation or prose-
cution of another person who has committed an
offense.
(o) The Commission periodically shall review
and revise, in consideration of comments and
data coming to its attention, the guidelines
28 U.S.C. § 994
Appendix B (May 1, 2016) ║ 47
promulgated pursuant to the provisions of this
section. In fulfilling its duties and in exercising
its powers, the Commission shall consult with
authorities on, and individual and institutional
representatives of, various aspects of the Fed-
eral criminal justice system. The United States
Probation System, the Bureau of Prisons, the
Judicial Conference of the United States, the
Criminal Division of the United States Depart-
ment of Justice, and a representative of the Fed-
eral Public Defenders shall submit to the Com-
mission any observations, comments, or ques-
tions pertinent to the work of the Commission
whenever they believe such communication
would be useful, and shall, at least annually,
submit to the Commission a written report com-
menting on the operation of the Commission’s
guidelines, suggesting changes in the guidelines
that appear to be warranted, and otherwise as-
sessing the Commission’s work.
(p) The Commission, at or after the begin-
ning of a regular session of Congress, but not
later than the first day of May, may promulgate
under subsection (a) of this section and submit
to Congress amendments to the guidelines and
modifications to previously submitted amend-
ments that have not taken effect, including mod-
ifications to the effective dates of such amend-
ments. Such an amendment or modification
shall be accompanied by a statement of the rea-
sons therefor and shall take effect on a date
specified by the Commission, which shall be no
earlier than 180 days after being so submitted
and no later than the first day of November of
the calendar year in which the amendment or
modification is submitted, except to the extent
that the effective date is revised or the amend-
ment is otherwise modified or disapproved by
Act of Congress.
(q) The Commission and the Bureau of Pris-
ons shall submit to Congress an analysis and
recommendations concerning maximum utiliza-
tion of resources to deal effectively with the Fed-
eral prison population. Such report shall be
based upon consideration of a variety of alterna-
tives, including—
(1) modernization of existing facilities;
(2) inmate classification and periodic re-
view of such classification for use in placing
inmates in the least restrictive facility neces-
sary to ensure adequate security; and
(3) use of existing Federal facilities, such
as those currently within military jurisdic-
tion.
(r) The Commission, not later than two years
after the initial set of sentencing guidelines
promulgated under subsection (a) goes into ef-
fect, and thereafter whenever it finds it advisa-
ble, shall recommend to the Congress that it
raise or lower the grades, or otherwise modify
the maximum penalties, of those offenses for
which such an adjustment appears appropriate.
(s) The Commission shall give due considera-
tion to any petition filed by a defendant request-
ing modification of the guidelines utilized in the
sentencing of such defendant, on the basis of
changed circumstances unrelated to the defend-
ant, including changes in—
(1) the community view of the gravity of
the offense;
(2) the public concern generated by the of-
fense; and
(3) the deterrent effect particular sen-
tences may have on the commission of the of-
fense by others.
(t) The Commission, in promulgating general
policy statements regarding the sentencing
modification provisions in section 3582(c)(1)(A)
of title 18, shall describe what should be consid-
ered extraordinary and compelling reasons for
sentence reduction, including the criteria to be
applied and a list of specific examples. Rehabili-
tation of the defendant alone shall not be consid-
ered an extraordinary and compelling reason.
(u) If the Commission reduces the term of im-
prisonment recommended in the guidelines ap-
plicable to a particular offense or category of of-
fenses, it shall specify in what circumstances
and by what amount the sentences of prisoners
serving terms of imprisonment for the offense
may be reduced.
(v) The Commission shall ensure that the
general policy statements promulgated pursu-
ant to subsection (a)(2) include a policy limiting
consecutive terms of imprisonment for an of-
fense involving a violation of a general prohibi-
tion and for an offense involving a violation of a
28 U.S.C. § 994
48 ║ Appendix B (May 1, 2016)
specific prohibition encompassed within the
general prohibition.
(w)(1) The Chief Judge of each district court
shall ensure that, within 30 days following entry
of judgment in every criminal case, the sentenc-
ing court submits to the Commission, in a for-
mat approved and required by the Commission,
a written report of the sentence, the offense for
which it is imposed, the age, race, sex of the of-
fender, and information regarding factors made
relevant by the guidelines. The report shall also
include—
(A) the judgment and commitment order;
(B) the written statement of reasons for
the sentence imposed (which shall include
the reason for any departure from the other-
wise applicable guideline range and which
shall be stated on the written statement of
reasons form issued by the Judicial Confer-
ence and approved by the United States Sen-
tencing Commission);
(C) any plea agreement;
(D) the indictment or other charging doc-
ument;
(E) the presentence report; and
(F) any other information as the Commis-
sion finds appropriate.
The information referred to in subparagraphs
(A) through (F) shall be submitted by the sen-
tencing court in a format approved and required
by the Commission.
(2) The Commission shall, upon request,
make available to the House and Senate Com-
mittees on the Judiciary, the written reports
and all underlying records accompanying those
reports described in this section, as well as other
records received from courts.
(3) The Commission shall submit to Congress
at least annually an analysis of these docu-
ments, any recommendations for legislation
that the Commission concludes is warranted by
that analysis, and an accounting of those dis-
tricts that the Commission believes have not
submitted the appropriate information and doc-
uments required by this section.
(4) The Commission shall make available to
the Attorney General, upon request, such data
files as the Commission itself may assemble or
maintain in electronic form as a result of the in-
formation submitted under paragraph (1). Such
data files shall be made available in electronic
form and shall include all data fields requested,
including the identity of the sentencing judge.
(x) The provisions of section 553 of title 5, re-
lating to publication in the Federal Register and
public hearing procedure, shall apply to the
promulgation of guidelines pursuant to this sec-
tion.
(y) The Commission, in promulgating guide-
lines pursuant to subsection (a)(1), may include,
as a component of a fine, the expected costs to
the Government of any imprisonment, super-
vised release, or probation sentence that is or-
dered.

mission shall promulgate guidelines or amend
existing guidelines to provide that a defendant
21 years of age or older who has been convicted
of an offense shall receive an appropriate sen-
tence enhancement if the defendant involved a
minor in the commission of the offense.
(2) The Commission shall provide that the
guidelines enhancement promulgated pursuant
to paragraph (1) shall apply for any offense in
relation to which the defendant has solicited,
procured, recruited, counseled, encouraged,
trained, directed, commanded, intimidated, or
otherwise used or attempted to use any person
less than 18 years of age with the intent that the
minor would commit a Federal offense.
(b) Relevant Considerations.—In imple-
menting the directive in subsection (a), the Sen-
tencing Commission shall consider—

fendant intended the minor to commit;
(2) the number of minors that the defend-
ant used or attempted to use in relation to the
offense;

crime of violence is frequently of even greater
seriousness than involving a minor in a drug
trafficking offense, for which the guidelines
already provide a two-level enhancement;
and

in age between the offender and the minor(s)
involved in the offense.”

recommendations (and an explanation there-

sentencing guidelines governing sentences
for unlawful manufacturing, importing, ex-
porting, and trafficking of cocaine, and like
offenses, including unlawful possession, pos-
session with intent to commit any of the for-
going offenses, and attempt and conspiracy to
commit any of the forgoing offenses. The rec-
ommendations shall reflect the following con-
siderations—
(A) the sentence imposed for trafficking
in a quantity of crack cocaine should gen-
erally exceed the sentence imposed for
trafficking in a like quantity of powder co-
caine;
(B) high-level wholesale cocaine traf-
fickers, organizers, and leaders of criminal
activities should generally receive longer
sentences than low-level retail cocaine
traffickers and those who played a minor
or minimal role in such criminal activity;
(C) if the Government establishes that
a defendant who traffics in powder cocaine
has knowledge that such cocaine will be
converted into crack cocaine prior to its
distribution to individual users, the de-
fendant should be treated at sentencing as
though the defendant had trafficked in
crack cocaine; and
(D) an enhanced sentence should gen-
erally be imposed on a defendant who, in
the course of an offense described in this
subsection—
(i) murders or causes serious bodily
injury to an individual;
(ii) uses a dangerous weapon;
(iii) uses or possesses a firearm;

is involving an unusually vulnerable
person;

(2) Ratio.—The recommendations de-
scribed in the preceding subsection shall pro-
pose revision of the drug quantity ratio of
crack cocaine to powder cocaine under the rel-
evant statutes and guidelines in a manner
consistent with the ratios set for other drugs
and consistent with the objectives set forth in
section 3553(a) of title 28 United States Code.
(b) Study.—No later than May 1, 1996, the
Department of Justice shall submit to the Judi-
ciary Committees of the Senate and House of
Representatives a report on the charging and
plea practices of Federal prosecutors with re-
spect to the offense of money laundering. Such

comparable to penalties for other drugs of
abuse; and
Pub. L. 106–386

(2) based on the fact that importation of
Ecstasy has surged in the past few years, the
traffickers are targeting the Nation’s youth,
and the use of Ecstasy among youth in the
United States is increasing even as other
drug use among this population appears to be
leveling off, the base offense levels for import-

described in subsection (a) should be in-
creased.
