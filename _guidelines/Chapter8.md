### SENTENCING OF ORGANIZATIONS

##### Introductory Commentary

The guidelines and policy statements in this chapter apply when the convicted defendantis an organization. Organizations can act only through agents and, under federal criminal law, generally are vicariously liable for offenses committed by their agents. At the same time, individual agents are responsible for their own criminal conduct. Federal prosecutions of organizations therefore frequently involve individual and organizational co-defendants. Convictedindividual agents of organizations are sentenced in accordance with the guidelines and policystatements in the preceding chapters. This chapter is designed so that the sanctions imposedupon organizations and their agents, taken together, will provide just punishment, adequatedeterrence, and incentives for organizations to maintain internal mechanisms for preventing, detecting, and reporting criminal conduct.

This chapter reflects the following general principles:First, the court must, whenever practicable, order the organization to remedy any harmcaused by the offense. The resources expended to remedy the harm should not be viewed aspunishment, but rather as a means of making victims whole for the harm caused.

Second, if the organization operated primarily for a criminal purpose or primarily bycriminal means, the fine should be set sufficiently high to divest the organization of all itsassets.

Third, the fine range for any other organization should be based on the seriousness ofthe offense and the culpability of the organization. The seriousness of the offense generallywill be reflected by the greatest of the pecuniary gain, the pecuniary loss, or the amount in a guideline offense level fine table. Culpability generally will be determined by six factors thatthe sentencing court must consider. The four factors that increase the ultimate punishment ofan organization are: (i) the involvement in or tolerance of criminal activity; (ii) the prior historyof the organization; (iii) the violation of an order; and (iv) the obstruction of justice. The twofactors that mitigate the ultimate punishment of an organization are: (i) the existence of aneffective compliance and ethics program; and (ii) self-reporting, cooperation, or acceptance ofresponsibility.

Fourth, probation is an appropriate sentence for an organizational defendant whenneeded to ensure that another sanction will be fully implemented, or to ensure that steps willbe taken within the organization to reduce the likelihood of future criminal conduct.

These guidelines offer incentives to organizations to reduce and ultimately eliminatecriminal conduct by providing a structural foundation from which an organization may selfpolice its own conduct through an effective compliance and ethics program. The preventionand detection of criminal conduct, as facilitated by an effective compliance and ethics program, will assist an organization in encouraging ethical conduct and in complying fully with all applicable laws.

§8A1.1PART A ― GENERAL APPLICATION PRINCIPLES§8A1.1. Applicability of Chapter EightThis chapter applies to the sentencing of all organizations for felony andClass A misdemeanor offenses.

CommentaryApplication Notes:1. “Organization” means “a person other than an individual.” 18 U.S.C. § 18. The termincludes corporations, partnerships, associations, joint-stock companies, unions, trusts, pension funds, unincorporated organizations, governments and political subdivisionsthereof, and non-profit organizations.

2. The fine guidelines in §§8C2.2 through 8C2.9 apply only to specified types of offenses.

The other provisions of this chapter apply to the sentencing of all organizations for allfelony and Class A misdemeanor offenses. For example, the restitution and probationprovisions in Parts B and D of this chapter apply to the sentencing of an organization, even if the fine guidelines in §§8C2.2 through 8C2.9 do not apply.

§8A1.2CommentaryApplication Notes:1. Determinations under this chapter are to be based upon the facts and information specified in the applicable guideline. Determinations that reference other chapters are to bemade under the standards applicable to determinations under those chapters.

2. The definitions in the Commentary to §1B1.1 (Application Instructions) and the guidelines and commentary in §§1B1.2 through 1B1.8 apply to determinations under this chapter unless otherwise specified. The adjustments in Chapter Three, Parts A (VictimRelated Adjustments), B (Role in the Offense), C (Obstruction and Related Adjustments), and E (Acceptance of Responsibility) do not apply. The provisions of Chapter Six (Sentencing Procedures, Plea Agreements, and Crime Victims’ Rights) apply to proceedingsin which the defendant is an organization. Guidelines and policy statements not referenced in this chapter, directly or indirectly, do not apply when the defendant is an organization; e.g., the policy statements in Chapter Seven (Violations of Probation and Supervised Release) do not apply to organizations.

3. The following are definitions of terms used frequently in this chapter:(A) “Offense” means the offense of conviction and all relevant conduct under §1B1.3(Relevant Conduct) unless a different meaning is specified or is otherwise clear fromthe context. The term “instant” is used in connection with “offense,” “federal offense,” or “offense of conviction,” as the case may be, to distinguish the violation for which the defendant is being sentenced from a prior or subsequent offense, or froman offense before another court (e.g., an offense before a state court involving the same underlying conduct).

(B) “High-level personnel of the organization” means individuals who have substantial control over the organization or who have a substantial role in the makingof policy within the organization. The term includes: a director; an executive officer;an individual in charge of a major business or functional unit of the organization, such as sales, administration, or finance; and an individual with a substantial ownership interest. “High-level personnel of a unit of the organization” is definedin the Commentary to §8C2.5 (Culpability Score).

(C) “Substantial authority personnel” means individuals who within the scope oftheir authority exercise a substantial measure of discretion in acting on behalf ofan organization. The term includes high-level personnel of the organization, individuals who exercise substantial supervisory authority (e.g., a plant manager, a sales manager), and any other individuals who, although not a part of an organization’s management, nevertheless exercise substantial discretion when acting withinthe scope of their authority (e.g., an individual with authority in an organization tonegotiate or set price levels or an individual authorized to negotiate or approve significant contracts). Whether an individual falls within this category must be determined on a case-by-case basis.

(D) “Agent” means any individual, including a director, an officer, an employee, or anindependent contractor, authorized to act on behalf of the organization.

(E) An individual “condoned” an offense if the individual knew of the offense and didnot take reasonable steps to prevent or terminate the offense.

§8A1.2(F) “Similar misconduct” means prior conduct that is similar in nature to the conductunderlying the instant offense, without regard to whether or not such conduct violated the same statutory provision. For example, prior Medicare fraud would bemisconduct similar to an instant offense involving another type of fraud.

(G) “Prior criminal adjudication” means conviction by trial, plea of guilty (includingan Alford plea), or plea of nolo contendere.

(H) “Pecuniary gain” is derived from 18 U.S.C. § 3571(d) and means the additionalbefore-tax profit to the defendant resulting from the relevant conduct of the offense.

Gain can result from either additional revenue or cost savings. For example, anoffense involving odometer tampering can produce additional revenue. In such a case, the pecuniary gain is the additional revenue received because the automobilesappeared to have less mileage, i.e., the difference between the price received or expected for the automobiles with the apparent mileage and the fair market value ofthe automobiles with the actual mileage. An offense involving defense procurementfraud related to defective product testing can produce pecuniary gain resulting fromcost savings. In such a case, the pecuniary gain is the amount saved because the product was not tested in the required manner.

(I) “Pecuniary loss” is derived from 18 U.S.C. § 3571(d) and is equivalent to the term“loss” as used in Chapter Two (Offense Conduct). See Commentary to §2B1.1 (Theft, Property Destruction, and Fraud), and definitions of “tax loss” in Chapter Two, Part T (Offenses Involving Taxation).

(J) An individual was “willfully ignorant of the offense” if the individual did not investigate the possible occurrence of unlawful conduct despite knowledge of circumstances that would lead a reasonable person to investigate whether unlawfulconduct had occurred.

1. REMEDYING HARM FROM CRIMINAL CONDUCT###### Historical Note 
 
 Effective November 1, 2004 (amendment 673).

Introductory CommentaryAs a general principle, the court should require that the organization take all appropriatesteps to provide compensation to victims and otherwise remedy the harm caused or threatenedby the offense. A restitution order or an order of probation requiring restitution can be used tocompensate identifiable victims of the offense. A remedial order or an order of probation requiring community service can be used to reduce or eliminate the harm threatened, or to repairthe harm caused by the offense, when that harm or threatened harm would otherwise not beremedied. An order of notice to victims can be used to notify unidentified victims of the offense.

###### Historical Note 
 
 Effective November 1, 1991 (amendment 422).

§8B1.1. Restitution ― Organizations(a) In the case of an identifiable victim, the court shall—(1) enter a restitution order for the full amount of the victim’s loss, if such order is authorized under 18 U.S.C. § 2248, § 2259, § 2264, § 2327, § 3663, or § 3663A; or(2) impose a term of probation or supervised release with a condition requiring restitution for the full amount of the victim’sloss, if the offense is not an offense for which restitution is authorized under 18 U.S.C. § 3663(a)(1) but otherwise meets the criteria for an order of restitution under that section.

(b) Provided, that the provisions of subsection (a) do not apply—(1) when full restitution has been made; or(2) in the case of a restitution order under § 3663; a restitutionorder under 18 U.S.C. § 3663A that pertains to an offenseagainst property described in 18 U.S.C. § 3663A(c)(1)(A)(ii); or§8B1.1a condition of restitution imposed pursuant to subsection (a)(2)above, to the extent the court finds, from facts on the record, that (A) the number of identifiable victims is so large as tomake restitution impracticable; or (B) determining complex issues of fact related to the cause or amount of the victim’s losseswould complicate or prolong the sentencing process to a degreethat the need to provide restitution to any victim is outweighedby the burden on the sentencing process.

(c) If a defendant is ordered to make restitution to an identifiable victim and to pay a fine, the court shall order that any money paid bythe defendant shall first be applied to satisfy the order of restitution.

(d) A restitution order may direct the defendant to make a single, lumpsum payment, partial payments at specified intervals, in-kind payments, or a combination of payments at specified intervals and inkind payments. See 18 U.S.C. § 3664(f)(3)(A). An in-kind paymentmay be in the form of (1) return of property; (2) replacement of property; or (3) if the victim agrees, services rendered to the victim or toa person or organization other than the victim. See 18 U.S.C.

§ 3664(f)(4).

(e) A restitution order may direct the defendant to make nominal periodic payments if the court finds from facts on the record that the economic circumstances of the defendant do not allow the paymentof any amount of a restitution order, and do not allow for the payment of the full amount of a restitution order in the foreseeable future under any reasonable schedule of payments.

(f) Special Instruction(1) This guideline applies only to a defendant convicted of an offense committed on or after November 1, 1997. Notwithstanding the provisions of §1B1.11 (Use of Guidelines Manual in Effect on Date of Sentencing), use the former §8B1.1 (set forth inAppendix C, amendment 571) in lieu of this guideline in anyother case.

CommentaryBackground: Section 3553(a)(7) of Title 18, United States Code, requires the court, “in determining the particular sentence to be imposed,” to consider “the need to provide restitution toany victims of the offense.” Orders of restitution are authorized under 18 U.S.C. §§ 2248, 2259, 2264, 2327, 3663, and 3663A. For offenses for which an order of restitution is not authorized, restitution may be imposed as a condition of probation.

§8B1.2###### Historical Note 
 
 Effective November 1, 1991 (amendment 422); November 1, 1997 (amendment 571).

§8B1.2. Remedial Orders ― Organizations (Policy Statement)(a) To the extent not addressed under §8B1.1 (Restitution ― Organizations), a remedial order imposed as a condition of probation mayrequire the organization to remedy the harm caused by the offenseand to eliminate or reduce the risk that the instant offense willcause future harm.

(b) If the magnitude of expected future harm can be reasonably estimated, the court may require the organization to create a trust fundsufficient to address that expected harm.

CommentaryBackground: The purposes of a remedial order are to remedy harm that has already occurredand to prevent future harm. A remedial order requiring corrective action by the organizationmay be necessary to prevent future injury from the instant offense, e.g., a product recall for a food and drug violation or a clean-up order for an environmental violation. In some cases inwhich a remedial order potentially may be appropriate, a governmental regulatory agency, e.g., the Environmental Protection Agency or the Food and Drug Administration, may haveauthority to order remedial measures. In such cases, a remedial order by the court may not benecessary. If a remedial order is entered, it should be coordinated with any administrative orcivil actions taken by the appropriate governmental regulatory agency.

###### Historical Note 
 
 Effective November 1, 1991 (amendment 422).

§8B1.3. Community Service ― Organizations (Policy Statement)Community service may be ordered as a condition of probation wheresuch community service is reasonably designed to repair the harmcaused by the offense.

CommentaryBackground: An organization can perform community service only by employing its resourcesor paying its employees or others to do so. Consequently, an order that an organization performcommunity service is essentially an indirect monetary sanction, and therefore generally lessdesirable than a direct monetary sanction. However, where the convicted organization possesses knowledge, facilities, or skills that uniquely qualify it to repair damage caused by the offense, community service directed at repairing damage may provide an efficient means ofremedying harm caused.

§8B2.1In the past, some forms of community service imposed on organizations have not beenrelated to the purposes of sentencing. Requiring a defendant to endow a chair at a universityor to contribute to a local charity would not be consistent with this section unless such community service provided a means for preventive or corrective action directly related to the offense and therefore served one of the purposes of sentencing set forth in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a).

* * * * *2. EFFECTIVE COMPLIANCE AND ETHICS PROGRAM###### Historical Note 
 
 Effective November 1, 2004 (amendment 673).

§8B2.1. Effective Compliance and Ethics Program(a) To have an effective compliance and ethics program, for purposes ofsubsection (f) of §8C2.5 (Culpability Score) and subsection (b)(1) of§8D1.4 (Recommended Conditions of Probation ― Organizations), an organization shall—(1) exercise due diligence to prevent and detect criminal conduct;and(2) otherwise promote an organizational culture that encouragesethical conduct and a commitment to compliance with the law.

Such compliance and ethics program shall be reasonably designed, implemented, and enforced so that the program is generally effective in preventing and detecting criminal conduct. The failure toprevent or detect the instant offense does not necessarily mean thatthe program is not generally effective in preventing and detectingcriminal conduct.

§8B2.1(b) Due diligence and the promotion of an organizational culture thatencourages ethical conduct and a commitment to compliance with the law within the meaning of subsection (a) minimally require the following:(1) The organization shall establish standards and procedures toprevent and detect criminal conduct.

(2) (A) The organization’s governing authority shall be knowledgeable about the content and operation of the compliance and ethics program and shall exercise reasonableoversight with respect to the implementation and effectiveness of the compliance and ethics program.

(B) High-level personnel of the organization shall ensure thatthe organization has an effective compliance and ethicsprogram, as described in this guideline. Specific individual(s) within high-level personnel shall be assigned overall responsibility for the compliance and ethics program.

(C) Specific individual(s) within the organization shall be delegated day-to-day operational responsibility for the compliance and ethics program. Individual(s) with operationalresponsibility shall report periodically to high-level personnel and, as appropriate, to the governing authority, oran appropriate subgroup of the governing authority, onthe effectiveness of the compliance and ethics program. Tocarry out such operational responsibility, such individual(s) shall be given adequate resources, appropriate authority, and direct access to the governing authority or anappropriate subgroup of the governing authority.

(3) The organization shall use reasonable efforts not to includewithin the substantial authority personnel of the organizationany individual whom the organization knew, or should haveknown through the exercise of due diligence, has engaged inillegal activities or other conduct inconsistent with an effectivecompliance and ethics program.

(4) (A) The organization shall take reasonable steps to communicate periodically and in a practical manner its standardsand procedures, and other aspects of the compliance andethics program, to the individuals referred to in subparagraph (B) by conducting effective training programs andotherwise disseminating information appropriate to suchindividuals’ respective roles and responsibilities.

§8B2.1(B) The individuals referred to in subparagraph (A) are the members of the governing authority, high-level personnel, substantial authority personnel, the organization’s employees, and, as appropriate, the organization’s agents.

(5) The organization shall take reasonable steps—(A) to ensure that the organization’s compliance and ethicsprogram is followed, including monitoring and auditing todetect criminal conduct;(B) to evaluate periodically the effectiveness of the organization’s compliance and ethics program; and(C) to have and publicize a system, which may include mechanisms that allow for anonymity or confidentiality, whereby the organization’s employees and agents may report or seek guidance regarding potential or actual criminal conduct without fear of retaliation.

(6) The organization’s compliance and ethics program shall be promoted and enforced consistently throughout the organizationthrough (A) appropriate incentives to perform in accordancewith the compliance and ethics program; and (B) appropriatedisciplinary measures for engaging in criminal conduct and for failing to take reasonable steps to prevent or detect criminal conduct.

(7) After criminal conduct has been detected, the organizationshall take reasonable steps to respond appropriately to the criminal conduct and to prevent further similar criminal conduct, including making any necessary modifications to the organization’s compliance and ethics program.

(c) In implementing subsection (b), the organization shall periodicallyassess the risk of criminal conduct and shall take appropriate stepsto design, implement, or modify each requirement set forth in subsection (b) to reduce the risk of criminal conduct identified throughthis process.

CommentaryApplication Notes:1. Definitions.—For purposes of this guideline:“Compliance and ethics program” means a program designed to prevent and detectcriminal conduct.

§8B2.1“Governing authority” means the (A) the Board of Directors; or (B) if the organizationdoes not have a Board of Directors, the highest-level governing body of the organization.

“High-level personnel of the organization” and “substantial authority personnel”have the meaning given those terms in the Commentary to §8A1.2 (Application Instructions ― Organizations).

“Standards and procedures” means standards of conduct and internal controls thatare reasonably capable of reducing the likelihood of criminal conduct.

2. Factors to Consider in Meeting Requirements of this Guideline.—(A) In General.—Each of the requirements set forth in this guideline shall be met byan organization; however, in determining what specific actions are necessary tomeet those requirements, factors that shall be considered include: (i) applicable industry practice or the standards called for by any applicable governmental regulation; (ii) the size of the organization; and (iii) similar misconduct.

(B) Applicable Governmental Regulation and Industry Practice.—An organization’s failure to incorporate and follow applicable industry practice or the standardscalled for by any applicable governmental regulation weighs against a finding of aneffective compliance and ethics program.

(C) The Size of the Organization.—(i) In General.—The formality and scope of actions that an organization shalltake to meet the requirements of this guideline, including the necessary features of the organization’s standards and procedures, depend on the size ofthe organization.

(ii) Large Organizations.—A large organization generally shall devote moreformal operations and greater resources in meeting the requirements of this guideline than shall a small organization. As appropriate, a large organizationshould encourage small organizations (especially those that have, or seek tohave, a business relationship with the large organization) to implement effective compliance and ethics programs.

(iii) Small Organizations.—In meeting the requirements of this guideline, smallorganizations shall demonstrate the same degree of commitment to ethicalconduct and compliance with the law as large organizations. However, a smallorganization may meet the requirements of this guideline with less formalityand fewer resources than would be expected of large organizations. In appropriate circumstances, reliance on existing resources and simple systems candemonstrate a degree of commitment that, for a large organization, would onlybe demonstrated through more formally planned and implemented systems.

Examples of the informality and use of fewer resources with which a smallorganization may meet the requirements of this guideline include the following: (I) the governing authority’s discharge of its responsibility for oversightof the compliance and ethics program by directly managing the organization’scompliance and ethics efforts; (II) training employees through informal staffmeetings, and monitoring through regular “walk-arounds” or continuous observation while managing the organization; (III) using available personnel, rather than employing separate staff, to carry out the compliance and ethics§8B2.1program; and (IV) modeling its own compliance and ethics program on existing, well-regarded compliance and ethics programs and best practices of othersimilar organizations.

(D) Recurrence of Similar Misconduct.—Recurrence of similar misconduct createsdoubt regarding whether the organization took reasonable steps to meet the requirements of this guideline. For purposes of this subparagraph, “similar misconduct” has the meaning given that term in the Commentary to §8A1.2 (ApplicationInstructions ― Organizations).

3. Application of Subsection (b)(2).—High-level personnel and substantial authoritypersonnel of the organization shall be knowledgeable about the content and operation ofthe compliance and ethics program, shall perform their assigned duties consistent with the exercise of due diligence, and shall promote an organizational culture that encourages ethical conduct and a commitment to compliance with the law.

If the specific individual(s) assigned overall responsibility for the compliance and ethicsprogram does not have day-to-day operational responsibility for the program, then the individual(s) with day-to-day operational responsibility for the program typically should, no less than annually, give the governing authority or an appropriate subgroup thereofinformation on the implementation and effectiveness of the compliance and ethics program.

4. Application of Subsection (b)(3).—(A) Consistency with Other Law.—Nothing in subsection (b)(3) is intended to require conduct inconsistent with any Federal, State, or local law, including any lawgoverning employment or hiring practices.

(B) Implementation.—In implementing subsection (b)(3), the organization shall hireand promote individuals so as to ensure that all individuals within the high-levelpersonnel and substantial authority personnel of the organization will performtheir assigned duties in a manner consistent with the exercise of due diligence andthe promotion of an organizational culture that encourages ethical conduct and a commitment to compliance with the law under subsection (a). With respect to the hiring or promotion of such individuals, an organization shall consider the relatedness of the individual’s illegal activities and other misconduct (i.e., other conductinconsistent with an effective compliance and ethics program) to the specific responsibilities the individual is anticipated to be assigned and other factors such as:(i) the recency of the individual’s illegal activities and other misconduct; and(ii) whether the individual has engaged in other such illegal activities and othersuch misconduct.

5. Application of Subsection (b)(6).—Adequate discipline of individuals responsible for an offense is a necessary component of enforcement; however, the form of discipline thatwill be appropriate will be case specific.

6. Application of Subsection (b)(7).—Subsection (b)(7) has two aspects.

First, the organization should respond appropriately to the criminal conduct. The organization should take reasonable steps, as warranted under the circumstances, to remedythe harm resulting from the criminal conduct. These steps may include, where appropriate, providing restitution to identifiable victims, as well as other forms of remediation.

§8B2.1Other reasonable steps to respond appropriately to the criminal conduct may include selfreporting and cooperation with authorities.

Second, the organization should act appropriately to prevent further similar criminal conduct, including assessing the compliance and ethics program and making modifications necessary to ensure the program is effective. The steps taken should be consistentwith subsections (b)(5) and (c) and may include the use of an outside professional advisorto ensure adequate assessment and implementation of any modifications.

7. Application of Subsection (c).—To meet the requirements of subsection (c), an organization shall:(A) Assess periodically the risk that criminal conduct will occur, including assessingthe following:(i) The nature and seriousness of such criminal conduct.

(ii) The likelihood that certain criminal conduct may occur because of the natureof the organization’s business. If, because of the nature of an organization’sbusiness, there is a substantial risk that certain types of criminal conduct mayoccur, the organization shall take reasonable steps to prevent and detect thattype of criminal conduct. For example, an organization that, due to the natureof its business, employs sales personnel who have flexibility to set prices shallestablish standards and procedures designed to prevent and detect price-fixing. An organization that, due to the nature of its business, employs sales personnel who have flexibility to represent the material characteristics of a product shall establish standards and procedures designed to prevent and detectfraud.

(iii) The prior history of the organization. The prior history of an organization mayindicate types of criminal conduct that it shall take actions to prevent anddetect.

(B) Prioritize periodically, as appropriate, the actions taken pursuant to any requirement set forth in subsection (b), in order to focus on preventing and detecting the criminal conduct identified under subparagraph (A) of this note as most serious, and most likely, to occur.

(C) Modify, as appropriate, the actions taken pursuant to any requirement set forth insubsection (b) to reduce the risk of criminal conduct identified under subparagraph(A) of this note as most serious, and most likely, to occur.

Background: This section sets forth the requirements for an effective compliance and ethicsprogram. This section responds to section 805(a)(5) of the Sarbanes–Oxley Act of 2002, PublicLaw 107–204, which directed the Commission to review and amend, as appropriate, the guidelines and related policy statements to ensure that the guidelines that apply to organizationsin this chapter “are sufficient to deter and punish organizational criminal misconduct.”The requirements set forth in this guideline are intended to achieve reasonable prevention and detection of criminal conduct for which the organization would be vicariously liable.

The prior diligence of an organization in seeking to prevent and detect criminal conduct has a direct bearing on the appropriate penalties and probation terms for the organization if it is convicted and sentenced for a criminal offense.

§8C2.1PART C ― FINES1. DETERMINING THE FINE ― CRIMINAL PURPOSE ORGANIZATIONS§8C1.1. Determining the Fine ― Criminal Purpose OrganizationsIf, upon consideration of the nature and circumstances of the offense andthe history and characteristics of the organization, the court determinesthat the organization operated primarily for a criminal purpose or primarily by criminal means, the fine shall be set at an amount (subject tothe statutory maximum) sufficient to divest the organization of all itsnet assets. When this section applies, Subpart 2 (Determining the Fine― Other Organizations) and §8C3.4 (Fines Paid by Owners of CloselyHeld Organizations) do not apply.

CommentaryApplication Note:1. “Net assets,” as used in this section, means the assets remaining after payment of alllegitimate claims against assets by known innocent bona fide creditors.

Background: This guideline addresses the case in which the court, based upon an examination of the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the organization, determines that the organization was operated primarily for a criminal purpose(e.g., a front for a scheme that was designed to commit fraud; an organization established toparticipate in the illegal manufacture, importation, or distribution of a controlled substance)or operated primarily by criminal means (e.g., a hazardous waste disposal business that hadno legitimate means of disposing of hazardous waste). In such a case, the fine shall be set atan amount sufficient to remove all of the organization’s net assets. If the extent of the assetsof the organization is unknown, the maximum fine authorized by statute should be imposed, absent innocent bona fide creditors.

If the Chapter Two offense guideline for a count is listed in subsection (a) or (b) above, and the applicable guideline results in the determination of the offense level by use ofone of the listed guidelines, apply the provisions of §§8C2.2 through 8C2.9 to that count.

For example, §§8C2.2 through 8C2.9 apply to an offense under §2K2.1 (an offense guideline listed in subsection (a)), unless the cross reference in that guideline requires the offense level to be determined under an offense guideline section not listed in subsection(a).

2. If the Chapter Two offense guideline for a count is not listed in subsection (a) or (b) above, but the applicable guideline results in the determination of the offense level by use of a listed guideline, apply the provisions of §§8C2.2 through 8C2.9 to that count. For example, where the conduct set forth in a count of conviction ordinarily referenced to §2N2.1(an offense guideline not listed in subsection (a)) establishes §2B1.1 (Theft, Property Destruction, and Fraud) as the applicable offense guideline (an offense guideline listed insubsection (a)), §§8C2.2 through 8C2.9 would apply because the actual offense level is determined under §2B1.1 (Theft, Property Destruction, and Fraud).

Background: The fine guidelines of this subpart apply only to offenses covered by the guideline sections set forth in subsection (a) above. For example, the provisions of §§8C2.2 through8C2.9 do not apply to counts for which the applicable guideline offense level is determinedunder Chapter Two, Part Q (Offenses Involving the Environment). For such cases, §8C2.10(Determining the Fine for Other Counts) is applicable.

§8C2.3§8C2.2. Preliminary Determination of Inability to Pay Fine(a) Where it is readily ascertainable that the organization cannot andis not likely to become able (even on an installment schedule) to payrestitution required under §8B1.1 (Restitution ― Organizations), a determination of the guideline fine range is unnecessary because, pursuant to §8C3.3(a), no fine would be imposed.

(b) Where it is readily ascertainable through a preliminary determination of the minimum of the guideline fine range (see §§8C2.3through 8C2.7) that the organization cannot and is not likely to become able (even on an installment schedule) to pay such minimumguideline fine, a further determination of the guideline fine rangeis unnecessary. Instead, the court may use the preliminary determination and impose the fine that would result from the applicationof §8C3.3 (Reduction of Fine Based on Inability to Pay).

CommentaryApplication Notes:1. In a case of a determination under subsection (a), a statement that “the guideline finerange was not determined because it is readily ascertainable that the defendant cannot and is not likely to become able to pay restitution” is recommended.

2. In a case of a determination under subsection (b), a statement that “no precise determination of the guideline fine range is required because it is readily ascertainable that the defendant cannot and is not likely to become able to pay the minimum of the guidelinefine range” is recommended.

Background: Many organizational defendants lack the ability to pay restitution. In addition, many organizational defendants who may be able to pay restitution lack the ability to pay the minimum fine called for by §8C2.7(a). In such cases, a complete determination of the guidelinefine range may be a needless exercise. This section provides for an abbreviated determinationof the guideline fine range that can be applied where it is readily ascertainable that the finewithin the guideline fine range determined under §8C2.7 (Guideline Fine Range ― Organizations) would be reduced under §8C3.3 (Reduction of Fine Based on Inability to Pay).

§8C2.3. Offense Level(a) For each count covered by §8C2.1 (Applicability of Fine Guidelines), use the applicable Chapter Two guideline to determine the base offense level and apply, in the order listed, any appropriate adjustments contained in that guideline.

§8C2.4(b) Where there is more than one such count, apply Chapter Three, Part D (Multiple Counts) to determine the combined offense level.

CommentaryApplication Notes:1. In determining the offense level under this section, “defendant,” as used in ChapterTwo, includes any agent of the organization for whose conduct the organization is criminally responsible.

2. In determining the offense level under this section, apply the provisions of §§1B1.2through 1B1.8. Do not apply the adjustments in Chapter Three, Parts A (Victim-RelatedAdjustments), B (Role in the Offense), C (Obstruction and Related Adjustments), andE (Acceptance of Responsibility).

    (3) the pecuniary loss from the offense caused by the organization, to the extent the loss was caused intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly.

(b) Provided, that if the applicable offense guideline in Chapter Twoincludes a special instruction for organizational fines, that specialinstruction shall be applied, as appropriate.

(c) Provided, further, that to the extent the calculation of either pecuniary gain or pecuniary loss would unduly complicate or prolong the sentencing process, that amount, i.e., gain or loss as appropriate, shall not be used for the determination of the base fine.

(1) For offenses committed prior to November 1, 2015, use the offense level fine table that was set forth in the version of§8C2.4(d) that was in effect on November 1, 2014, rather than the offense level fine table set forth in subsection (d) above.

Commentary

Application Notes:

1. “Pecuniary gain,” “pecuniary loss,” and “offense” are defined in the Commentary to§8A1.2 (Application Instructions ― Organizations). Note that subsections (a)(2) and (a)(3)contain certain limitations as to the use of pecuniary gain and pecuniary loss in determining the base fine. Under subsection (a)(2), the pecuniary gain used to determine the base fine is the pecuniary gain to the organization from the offense. Under subsection(a)(3), the pecuniary loss used to determine the base fine is the pecuniary loss from the offense caused by the organization, to the extent that such loss was caused intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly.

2. Under 18 U.S.C. § 3571(d), the court is not required to calculate pecuniary loss or pecuniary gain to the extent that determination of loss or gain would unduly complicate orprolong the sentencing process. Nevertheless, the court may need to approximate loss inorder to calculate offense levels under Chapter Two. See Commentary to §2B1.1 (Theft, Property Destruction, and Fraud). If loss is approximated for purposes of determiningthe applicable offense level, the court should use that approximation as the starting pointfor calculating pecuniary loss under this section.

3. In a case of an attempted offense or a conspiracy to commit an offense, pecuniary lossand pecuniary gain are to be determined in accordance with the principles stated in§2X1.1 (Attempt, Solicitation, or Conspiracy).

4. In a case involving multiple participants (i.e., multiple organizations, or the organizationand individual(s) unassociated with the organization), the applicable offense level is tobe determined without regard to apportionment of the gain from or loss caused by the offense. See §1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct). However, if the base fine is determined undersubsections (a)(2) or (a)(3), the court may, as appropriate, apportion gain or loss considering the defendant’s relative culpability and other pertinent factors. Note also that under §2R1.1(d)(1), the volume of commerce, which is used in determining a proxy for lossunder §8C2.4(a)(3), is limited to the volume of commerce attributable to the defendant.

5. Special instructions regarding the determination of the base fine are contained in§§2B4.1 (Bribery in Procurement of Bank Loan and Other Commercial Bribery); 2C1.1(Offering, Giving, Soliciting, or Receiving a Bribe; Extortion Under Color of OfficialRight; Fraud Involving the Deprivation of the Intangible Right to Honest Services ofPublic Officials; Conspiracy to Defraud by Interference with Governmental Functions);2C1.2 (Offering, Giving, Soliciting, or Receiving a Gratuity); 2E5.1 (Offering, Accepting, or Soliciting a Bribe or Gratuity Affecting the Operation of an Employee Welfare or Pension Benefit Plan; Prohibited Payments or Lending of Money by Employer or Agent toEmployees, Representatives, or Labor Organizations); and 2R1.1 (Bid-Rigging, Price-Fixing or Market-Allocation Agreements Among Competitors).

Background: Under this section, the base fine is determined in one of three ways: (1) by the amount, based on the offense level, from the table in subsection (d); (2) by the pecuniary gainto the organization from the offense; and (3) by the pecuniary loss caused by the organization, to the extent that such loss was caused intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly. In certain cases, special instructions for determining the loss or offense level amount apply. As a general rule, the base fine measures the seriousness of the offense. The determinants of the base fine areselected so that, in conjunction with the multipliers derived from the culpability score in§8C2.5 (Culpability Score), they will result in guideline fine ranges appropriate to deter organizational criminal conduct and to provide incentives for organizations to maintain internal§8C2.5mechanisms for preventing, detecting, and reporting criminal conduct. In order to deter organizations from seeking to obtain financial reward through criminal conduct, this section provides that, when greatest, pecuniary gain to the organization is used to determine the basefine. In order to ensure that organizations will seek to prevent losses intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly caused by their agents, this section provides that, when greatest, pecuniary lossis used to determine the base fine in such circumstances. Chapter Two provides special instructions for fines that include specific rules for determining the base fine in connection with certain types of offenses in which the calculation of loss or gain is difficult, e.g., price-fixing.

For these offenses, the special instructions tailor the base fine to circumstances that occur inconnection with such offenses and that generally relate to the magnitude of loss or gain resulting from such offenses.

§8C2.5. Culpability Score(a) Start with 5 points and apply subsections (b) through (g) below.

(b) INVOLVEMENT IN OR TOLERANCE OF CRIMINAL ACTIVITYIf more than one applies, use the greatest:(1) If—(A) the organization had 5,000 or more employees and(i) an individual within high-level personnel of the organization participated in, condoned, or was willfullyignorant of the offense; or(ii) tolerance of the offense by substantial authority personnel was pervasive throughout the organization; or(B) the unit of the organization within which the offense wascommitted had 5,000 or more employees and(i) an individual within high-level personnel of the unitparticipated in, condoned, or was willfully ignorant ofthe offense; or(ii) tolerance of the offense by substantial authority personnel was pervasive throughout such unit, add 5 points; or§8C2.5(2) If—(A) the organization had 1,000 or more employees and(i) an individual within high-level personnel of the organization participated in, condoned, or was willfullyignorant of the offense; or(ii) tolerance of the offense by substantial authority personnel was pervasive throughout the organization; or(B) the unit of the organization within which the offense wascommitted had 1,000 or more employees and(i) an individual within high-level personnel of the unitparticipated in, condoned, or was willfully ignorant ofthe offense; or(ii) tolerance of the offense by substantial authority personnel was pervasive throughout such unit, add 4 points; or(3) If—(A) the organization had 200 or more employees and(i) an individual within high-level personnel of the organization participated in, condoned, or was willfullyignorant of the offense; or(ii) tolerance of the offense by substantial authority personnel was pervasive throughout the organization; or(B) the unit of the organization within which the offense wascommitted had 200 or more employees and(i) an individual within high-level personnel of the unitparticipated in, condoned, or was willfully ignorant ofthe offense; or(ii) tolerance of the offense by substantial authority personnel was pervasive throughout such unit, add 3 points; or§8C2.5(4) If the organization had 50 or more employees and an individualwithin substantial authority personnel participated in, condoned, or was willfully ignorant of the offense, add 2 points; or(5) If the organization had 10 or more employees and an individualwithin substantial authority personnel participated in, condoned, or was willfully ignorant of the offense, add 1 point.

(c) PRIOR HISTORYIf more than one applies, use the greater:(1) If the organization (or separately managed line of business)committed any part of the instant offense less than 10 yearsafter (A) a criminal adjudication based on similar misconduct;or (B) civil or administrative adjudication(s) based on two ormore separate instances of similar misconduct, add 1 point; or(2) If the organization (or separately managed line of business)committed any part of the instant offense less than 5 years after (A) a criminal adjudication based on similar misconduct; or(B) civil or administrative adjudication(s) based on two or moreseparate instances of similar misconduct, add 2 points.

(d) VIOLATION OF AN ORDERIf more than one applies, use the greater:(1) (A) If the commission of the instant offense violated a judicialorder or injunction, other than a violation of a condition of probation; or (B) if the organization (or separately managed line ofbusiness) violated a condition of probation by engaging in similar misconduct, i.e., misconduct similar to that for which it wasplaced on probation, add 2 points; or(2) If the commission of the instant offense violated a condition ofprobation, add 1 point.

(e) OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICEIf the organization willfully obstructed or impeded, attempted to obstruct or impede, or aided, abetted, or encouraged obstruction of justice during the investigation, prosecution, or sentencing of the instant offense, or, with knowledge thereof, failed to take reasonablesteps to prevent such obstruction or impedance or attempted obstruction or impedance, add 3 points.

§8C2.5(f) EFFECTIVE COMPLIANCE AND ETHICS PROGRAM(1) If the offense occurred even though the organization had inplace at the time of the offense an effective compliance and ethics program, as provided in §8B2.1 (Effective Compliance andEthics Program), subtract 3 points.

(2) Subsection (f)(1) shall not apply if, after becoming aware of anoffense, the organization unreasonably delayed reporting the offense to appropriate governmental authorities.

(3) (A) Except as provided in subparagraphs (B) and (C), subsection (f)(1) shall not apply if an individual within high-levelpersonnel of the organization, a person within high-levelpersonnel of the unit of the organization within which the offense was committed where the unit had 200 or moreemployees, or an individual described in §8B2.1(b)(2)(B)or (C), participated in, condoned, or was willfully ignorantof the offense.

(B) There is a rebuttable presumption, for purposes of subsection (f)(1), that the organization did not have an effectivecompliance and ethics program if an individual—(i) within high-level personnel of a small organization;or(ii) within substantial authority personnel, but not within high-level personnel, of any organization, participated in, condoned, or was willfully ignorant of, the offense.

(C) Subparagraphs (A) and (B) shall not apply if—(i) the individual or individuals with operational responsibility for the compliance and ethics program (see§8B2.1(b)(2)(C)) have direct reporting obligations tothe governing authority or an appropriate subgroupthereof (e.g., an audit committee of the board of directors);(ii) the compliance and ethics program detected the offense before discovery outside the organization or before such discovery was reasonably likely;§8C2.5(iii) the organization promptly reported the offense to appropriate governmental authorities; and(iv) no individual with operational responsibility for the compliance and ethics program participated in, condoned, or was willfully ignorant of the offense.

(g) SELF-REPORTING, COOPERATION, AND ACCEPTANCE OF RESPONSIBILITYIf more than one applies, use the greatest:(1) If the organization (A) prior to an imminent threat of disclosureor government investigation; and (B) within a reasonablyprompt time after becoming aware of the offense, reported the offense to appropriate governmental authorities, fully cooperated in the investigation, and clearly demonstrated recognitionand affirmative acceptance of responsibility for its criminal conduct, subtract 5 points; or(2) If the organization fully cooperated in the investigation andclearly demonstrated recognition and affirmative acceptance ofresponsibility for its criminal conduct, subtract 2 points; or(3) If the organization clearly demonstrated recognition and affirmative acceptance of responsibility for its criminal conduct, subtract 1 point.

CommentaryApplication Notes:1. Definitions.—For purposes of this guideline, “condoned”, “prior criminal adjudication”, “similar misconduct”, “substantial authority personnel”, and “willfully ignorant of the offense” have the meaning given those terms in Application Note 3 of the Commentary to §8A1.2 (Application Instructions ― Organizations).

“Small Organization”, for purposes of subsection (f)(3), means an organization that, atthe time of the instant offense, had fewer than 200 employees.

2. For purposes of subsection (b), “unit of the organization” means any reasonably distinct operational component of the organization. For example, a large organization mayhave several large units such as divisions or subsidiaries, as well as many smaller unitssuch as specialized manufacturing, marketing, or accounting operations within theselarger units. For purposes of this definition, all of these types of units are encompassedwithin the term “unit of the organization.”3. “High-level personnel of the organization” is defined in the Commentary to §8A1.2(Application Instructions ― Organizations). With respect to a unit with 200 or more employees, “high-level personnel of a unit of the organization” means agents withinthe unit who set the policy for or control that unit. For example, if the managing agent§8C2.5of a unit with 200 employees participated in an offense, three points would be addedunder subsection (b)(3); if that organization had 1,000 employees and the managingagent of the unit with 200 employees were also within high-level personnel of the organization in its entirety, four points (rather than three) would be added under subsection (b)(2).

4. Pervasiveness under subsection (b) will be case specific and depend on the number, anddegree of responsibility, of individuals within substantial authority personnel who participated in, condoned, or were willfully ignorant of the offense. Fewer individuals needto be involved for a finding of pervasiveness if those individuals exercised a relativelyhigh degree of authority. Pervasiveness can occur either within an organization as a whole or within a unit of an organization. For example, if an offense were committed inan organization with 1,000 employees but the tolerance of the offense was pervasive onlywithin a unit of the organization with 200 employees (and no high-level personnel of the organization participated in, condoned, or was willfully ignorant of the offense), threepoints would be added under subsection (b)(3). If, in the same organization, tolerance ofthe offense was pervasive throughout the organization as a whole, or an individual withinhigh-level personnel of the organization participated in the offense, four points (ratherthan three) would be added under subsection (b)(2).

5. A “separately managed line of business,” as used in subsections (c) and (d), is a subpart of a for-profit organization that has its own management, has a high degree of autonomy from higher managerial authority, and maintains its own separate books of account. Corporate subsidiaries and divisions frequently are separately managed lines ofbusiness. Under subsection (c), in determining the prior history of an organization with separately managed lines of business, only the prior conduct or criminal record of the separately managed line of business involved in the instant offense is to be used. Undersubsection (d), in the context of an organization with separately managed lines of business, in making the determination whether a violation of a condition of probation involved engaging in similar misconduct, only the prior misconduct of the separately managed line of business involved in the instant offense is to be considered.

6. Under subsection (c), in determining the prior history of an organization or separatelymanaged line of business, the conduct of the underlying economic entity shall be considered without regard to its legal structure or ownership. For example, if two companiesmerged and became separate divisions and separately managed lines of business withinthe merged company, each division would retain the prior history of its predecessor company. If a company reorganized and became a new legal entity, the new company wouldretain the prior history of the predecessor company. In contrast, if one company purchased the physical assets but not the ongoing business of another company, the priorhistory of the company selling the physical assets would not be transferred to the company purchasing the assets. However, if an organization is acquired by another organization in response to solicitations by appropriate federal government officials, the priorhistory of the acquired organization shall not be attributed to the acquiring organization.

7. Under subsections (c)(1)(B) and (c)(2)(B), the civil or administrative adjudication(s) musthave occurred within the specified period (ten or five years) of the instant offense.

8. Adjust the culpability score for the factors listed in subsection (e) whether or not the offense guideline incorporates that factor, or that factor is inherent in the offense.

9. Subsection (e) applies where the obstruction is committed on behalf of the organization;it does not apply where an individual or individuals have attempted to conceal their misconduct from the organization. The Commentary to §3C1.1 (Obstructing or Impeding the §8C2.5Administration of Justice) provides guidance regarding the types of conduct that constitute obstruction.

10. Subsection (f)(2) contemplates that the organization will be allowed a reasonable periodof time to conduct an internal investigation. In addition, no reporting is required by subsection (f)(2) or (f)(3)(C)(iii) if the organization reasonably concluded, based on the information then available, that no offense had been committed.

11. For purposes of subsection (f)(3)(C)(i), an individual has “direct reporting obligations”to the governing authority or an appropriate subgroup thereof if the individual has express authority to communicate personally to the governing authority or appropriate subgroup thereof (A) promptly on any matter involving criminal conduct or potential criminal conduct, and (B) no less than annually on the implementation and effectiveness ofthe compliance and ethics program.

12. “Appropriate governmental authorities,” as used in subsections (f) and (g)(1), meansthe federal or state law enforcement, regulatory, or program officials having jurisdictionover such matter. To qualify for a reduction under subsection (g)(1), the report to appropriate governmental authorities must be made under the direction of the organization.

13. To qualify for a reduction under subsection (g)(1) or (g)(2), cooperation must be bothtimely and thorough. To be timely, the cooperation must begin essentially at the sametime as the organization is officially notified of a criminal investigation. To be thorough, the cooperation should include the disclosure of all pertinent information known by the organization. A prime test of whether the organization has disclosed all pertinent information is whether the information is sufficient for law enforcement personnel to identifythe nature and extent of the offense and the individual(s) responsible for the criminal conduct. However, the cooperation to be measured is the cooperation of the organizationitself, not the cooperation of individuals within the organization. If, because of the lackof cooperation of particular individual(s), neither the organization nor law enforcementpersonnel are able to identify the culpable individual(s) within the organization despitethe organization’s efforts to cooperate fully, the organization may still be given credit for full cooperation.

14. Entry of a plea of guilty prior to the commencement of trial combined with truthful admission of involvement in the offense and related conduct ordinarily will constitute significant evidence of affirmative acceptance of responsibility under subsection (g), unlessoutweighed by conduct of the organization that is inconsistent with such acceptance ofresponsibility. This adjustment is not intended to apply to an organization that puts the government to its burden of proof at trial by denying the essential factual elements ofguilt, is convicted, and only then admits guilt and expresses remorse. Conviction by trial, however, does not automatically preclude an organization from consideration for such a reduction. In rare situations, an organization may clearly demonstrate an acceptance ofresponsibility for its criminal conduct even though it exercises its constitutional right toa trial. This may occur, for example, where an organization goes to trial to assert andpreserve issues that do not relate to factual guilt (e.g., to make a constitutional challengeto a statute or a challenge to the applicability of a statute to its conduct). In each suchinstance, however, a determination that an organization has accepted responsibility willbe based primarily upon pretrial statements and conduct.

15. In making a determination with respect to subsection (g), the court may determine thatthe chief executive officer or highest ranking employee of an organization should appearat sentencing in order to signify that the organization has clearly demonstrated recognition and affirmative acceptance of responsibility.

§8C2.6Background: The increased culpability scores under subsection (b) are based on three interrelated principles. First, an organization is more culpable when individuals who manage the organization or who have substantial discretion in acting for the organization participate in, condone, or are willfully ignorant of criminal conduct. Second, as organizations become largerand their managements become more professional, participation in, condonation of, or willfulignorance of criminal conduct by such management is increasingly a breach of trust or abuseof position. Third, as organizations increase in size, the risk of criminal conduct beyond thatreflected in the instant offense also increases whenever management’s tolerance of that offenseis pervasive. Because of the continuum of sizes of organizations and professionalization ofmanagement, subsection (b) gradually increases the culpability score based upon the size ofthe organization and the level and extent of the substantial authority personnel involvement.

§8C2.8. Determining the Fine Within the Range (Policy Statement)(a) In determining the amount of the fine within the applicable guideline range, the court should consider:(1) the need for the sentence to reflect the seriousness of the offense, promote respect for the law, provide just punishment, afford adequate deterrence, and protect the public from furthercrimes of the organization;(2) the organization’s role in the offense;(3) any collateral consequences of conviction, including civil obligations arising from the organization’s conduct;(4) any nonpecuniary loss caused or threatened by the offense;(5) whether the offense involved a vulnerable victim;(6) any prior criminal record of an individual within high-levelpersonnel of the organization or high-level personnel of a unitof the organization who participated in, condoned, or was willfully ignorant of the criminal conduct;(7) any prior civil or criminal misconduct by the organization otherthan that counted under §8C2.5(c);(8) any culpability score under §8C2.5 (Culpability Score) higherthan 10 or lower than 0;§8C2.8(9) partial but incomplete satisfaction of the conditions for one ormore of the mitigating or aggravating factors set forth in§8C2.5 (Culpability Score);(10) any factor listed in 18 U.S.C. § 3572(a); and(11) whether the organization failed to have, at the time of the instant offense, an effective compliance and ethics programwithin the meaning of §8B2.1 (Effective Compliance and EthicsProgram).

(b) In addition, the court may consider the relative importance of anyfactor used to determine the range, including the pecuniary losscaused by the offense, the pecuniary gain from the offense, any specific offense characteristic used to determine the offense level, andany aggravating or mitigating factor used to determine the culpability score.

CommentaryApplication Notes:1. Subsection (a)(2) provides that the court, in setting the fine within the guideline finerange, should consider the organization’s role in the offense. This consideration is particularly appropriate if the guideline fine range does not take the organization’s role in the offense into account. For example, the guideline fine range in an antitrust case does not take into consideration whether the organization was an organizer or leader of the conspiracy. A higher fine within the guideline fine range ordinarily will be appropriate for an organization that takes a leading role in such an offense.

2. Subsection (a)(3) provides that the court, in setting the fine within the guideline finerange, should consider any collateral consequences of conviction, including civil obligations arising from the organization’s conduct. As a general rule, collateral consequencesthat merely make victims whole provide no basis for reducing the fine within the guideline range. If criminal and civil sanctions are unlikely to make victims whole, this mayprovide a basis for a higher fine within the guideline fine range. If punitive collateralsanctions have been or will be imposed on the organization, this may provide a basis for a lower fine within the guideline fine range.

3. Subsection (a)(4) provides that the court, in setting the fine within the guideline finerange, should consider any nonpecuniary loss caused or threatened by the offense. To the extent that nonpecuniary loss caused or threatened (e.g., loss of or threat to human life;psychological injury; threat to national security) by the offense is not adequately considered in setting the guideline fine range, this factor provides a basis for a higher finewithin the range. This factor is more likely to be applicable where the guideline fine rangeis determined by pecuniary loss or gain, rather than by offense level, because the ChapterTwo offense levels frequently take actual or threatened nonpecuniary loss into account.

4. Subsection (a)(6) provides that the court, in setting the fine within the guideline finerange, should consider any prior criminal record of an individual within high-level personnel of the organization or within high-level personnel of a unit of the organization.

Since an individual within high-level personnel either exercises substantial control over§8C2.9the organization or a unit of the organization or has a substantial role in the making ofpolicy within the organization or a unit of the organization, any prior criminal misconduct of such an individual may be relevant to the determination of the appropriate finefor the organization.

5. Subsection (a)(7) provides that the court, in setting the fine within the guideline finerange, should consider any prior civil or criminal misconduct by the organization otherthan that counted under §8C2.5(c). The civil and criminal misconduct counted under§8C2.5(c) increases the guideline fine range. Civil or criminal misconduct other than thatcounted under §8C2.5(c) may provide a basis for a higher fine within the range. In a caseinvolving a pattern of illegality, an upward departure may be warranted.

6. Subsection (a)(8) provides that the court, in setting the fine within the guideline finerange, should consider any culpability score higher than ten or lower than zero. As the culpability score increases above ten, this may provide a basis for a higher fine withinthe range. Similarly, as the culpability score decreases below zero, this may provide a basis for a lower fine within the range.

7. Under subsection (b), the court, in determining the fine within the range, may considerany factor that it considered in determining the range. This allows for courts to differentiate between cases that have the same offense level but differ in seriousness (e.g., twofraud cases at offense level 12, one resulting in a loss of $21,000, the other $40,000).

Similarly, this allows for courts to differentiate between two cases that have the sameaggravating factors, but in which those factors vary in their intensity (e.g., two cases with upward adjustments to the culpability score under §8C2.5(c)(2) (prior criminal adjudications within 5 years of the commencement of the instant offense, one involving a singleconviction, the other involving two or more convictions)).

Background: Subsection (a) includes factors that the court is required to consider under18 U.S.C. §§ 3553(a) and 3572(a) as well as additional factors that the Commission has determined may be relevant in a particular case. A number of factors required for considerationunder 18 U.S.C. § 3572(a) (e.g., pecuniary loss, the size of the organization) are used under the fine guidelines in this subpart to determine the fine range, and therefore are not specificallyset out again in subsection (a) of this guideline. In unusual cases, factors listed in this sectionmay provide a basis for departure.

§8C2.9. DisgorgementThe court shall add to the fine determined under §8C2.8 (Determiningthe Fine Within the Range) any gain to the organization from the offensethat has not and will not be paid as restitution or by way of other remedial measures.

§8C2.10CommentaryApplication Note:1. This section is designed to ensure that the amount of any gain that has not and will not be taken from the organization for remedial purposes will be added to the fine. This section typically will apply in cases in which the organization has received gain from anoffense but restitution or remedial efforts will not be required because the offense did not result in harm to identifiable victims, e.g., money laundering, obscenity, and regulatoryreporting offenses. Money spent or to be spent to remedy the adverse effects of the offense, e.g., the cost to retrofit defective products, should be considered as disgorged gain.

If the cost of remedial efforts made or to be made by the organization equals or exceedsthe gain from the offense, this section will not apply.

§8C2.10. Determining the Fine for Other CountsFor any count or counts not covered under §8C2.1 (Applicability of FineGuidelines), the court should determine an appropriate fine by applyingthe provisions of 18 U.S.C. §§ 3553 and 3572. The court should determinethe appropriate fine amount, if any, to be imposed in addition to any finedetermined under §8C2.8 (Determining the Fine Within the Range) and§8C2.9 (Disgorgement).

CommentaryBackground: The Commission has not promulgated guidelines governing the setting of finesfor counts not covered by §8C2.1 (Applicability of Fine Guidelines). For such counts, the courtshould determine the appropriate fine based on the general statutory provisions governingsentencing. In cases that have a count or counts not covered by the guidelines in addition to a count or counts covered by the guidelines, the court shall apply the fine guidelines for the count(s) covered by the guidelines, and add any additional amount to the fine, as appropriate, for the count(s) not covered by the guidelines.

Imposing a Fine(a) Except to the extent restricted by the maximum fine authorized bystatute or any minimum fine required by statute, the fine or fine§8C3.2range shall be that determined under §8C1.1 (Determining the Fine ― Criminal Purpose Organizations); §8C2.7 (Guideline FineRange ― Organizations) and §8C2.9 (Disgorgement); or §8C2.10(Determining the Fine for Other Counts), as appropriate.

(b) Where the minimum guideline fine is greater than the maximumfine authorized by statute, the maximum fine authorized by statuteshall be the guideline fine.

(c) Where the maximum guideline fine is less than a minimum fine required by statute, the minimum fine required by statute shall bethe guideline fine.

CommentaryBackground: This section sets forth the interaction of the fines or fine ranges determinedunder this chapter with the maximum fine authorized by statute and any minimum fine required by statute for the count or counts of conviction. The general statutory provisions governing a sentence of a fine are set forth in 18 U.S.C. § 3571.

When the organization is convicted of multiple counts, the maximum fine authorized bystatute may increase. For example, in the case of an organization convicted of three felonycounts related to a $200,000 fraud, the maximum fine authorized by statute will be $500,000on each count, for an aggregate maximum authorized fine of $1,500,000.

§8C3.2. Payment of the Fine ― Organizations(a) If the defendant operated primarily for a criminal purpose or primarily by criminal means, immediate payment of the fine shall berequired.

(b) In any other case, immediate payment of the fine shall be requiredunless the court finds that the organization is financially unable tomake immediate payment or that such payment would pose an undue burden on the organization. If the court permits other than immediate payment, it shall require full payment at the earliest possible date, either by requiring payment on a date certain or by establishing an installment schedule.

CommentaryApplication Note:1. When the court permits other than immediate payment, the period provided for paymentshall in no event exceed five years. 18 U.S.C. § 3572(d).

 Effective November 1, 1991 (amendment 422).

§8C3.3. Reduction of Fine Based on Inability to Pay(a) The court shall reduce the fine below that otherwise required by§8C1.1 (Determining the Fine ― Criminal Purpose Organizations), or §8C2.7 (Guideline Fine Range ― Organizations) and §8C2.9 (Disgorgement), to the extent that imposition of such fine would impairits ability to make restitution to victims.

(b) The court may impose a fine below that otherwise required by§8C2.7 (Guideline Fine Range ― Organizations) and §8C2.9 (Disgorgement) if the court finds that the organization is not able and, even with the use of a reasonable installment schedule, is not likelyto become able to pay the minimum fine required by §8C2.7 (Guideline Fine Range ― Organizations) and §8C2.9 (Disgorgement).

Provided, that the reduction under this subsection shall not be morethan necessary to avoid substantially jeopardizing the continued viability of the organization.

CommentaryApplication Note:1. For purposes of this section, an organization is not able to pay the minimum fine if, evenwith an installment schedule under §8C3.2 (Payment of the Fine ― Organizations), the payment of that fine would substantially jeopardize the continued existence of the organization.

Background: Subsection (a) carries out the requirement in 18 U.S.C. § 3572(b) that the courtimpose a fine or other monetary penalty only to the extent that such fine or penalty will not impair the ability of the organization to make restitution for the offense; however, this sectiondoes not authorize a criminal purpose organization to remain in business in order to pay restitution.

§8C3.4. Fines Paid by Owners of Closely Held OrganizationsThe court may offset the fine imposed upon a closely held organizationwhen one or more individuals, each of whom owns at least a 5 percent§8C3.4interest in the organization, has been fined in a federal criminal proceeding for the same offense conduct for which the organization is being sentenced. The amount of such offset shall not exceed the amount resultingfrom multiplying the total fines imposed on those individuals by thoseindividuals’ total percentage interest in the organization.

CommentaryApplication Notes:1. For purposes of this section, an organization is closely held, regardless of its size, whenrelatively few individuals own it. In order for an organization to be closely held, ownership and management need not completely overlap.

2. This section does not apply to a fine imposed upon an individual that arises out of offenseconduct different from that for which the organization is being sentenced.

Background: For practical purposes, most closely held organizations are the alter egos oftheir owner-managers. In the case of criminal conduct by a closely held corporation, the organization and the culpable individual(s) both may be convicted. As a general rule in such cases, appropriate punishment may be achieved by offsetting the fine imposed upon the organizationby an amount that reflects the percentage ownership interest of the sentenced individuals andthe magnitude of the fines imposed upon those individuals. For example, an organization is owned by five individuals, each of whom has a twenty percent interest; three of the individualsare convicted; and the combined fines imposed on those three equals $100,000. In this example, the fine imposed upon the organization may be offset by up to 60 percent of their combinedfine amounts, i.e., by $60,000.

* * * * *4. DEPARTURES FROM THE GUIDELINE FINE RANGEIntroductory CommentaryThe statutory provisions governing departures are set forth in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(b). Departure may be warranted if the court finds “that there exists an aggravating or mitigatingcircumstance of a kind, or to a degree, not adequately taken into consideration by the Sentencing Commission in formulating the guidelines that should result in a sentence different fromthat described.” This subpart sets forth certain factors that, in connection with certain offenses, may not have been adequately taken into consideration by the guidelines. In decidingwhether departure is warranted, the court should consider the extent to which that factor is adequately taken into consideration by the guidelines and the relative importance or substantiality of that factor in the particular case.

To the extent that any policy statement from Chapter Five, Part K (Departures) is relevant to the organization, a departure from the applicable guideline fine range may be warranted. Some factors listed in Chapter Five, Part K that are particularly applicable to organi§8C4.1zations are listed in this subpart. Other factors listed in Chapter Five, Part K may be applicable in particular cases. While this subpart lists factors that the Commission believes may constitute grounds for departure, the list is not exhaustive.

Substantial Assistance to Authorities ― Organizations (PolicyStatement)(a) Upon motion of the government stating that the defendant has provided substantial assistance in the investigation or prosecution ofanother organization that has committed an offense, or in the investigation or prosecution of an individual not directly affiliated with the defendant who has committed an offense, the court may departfrom the guidelines.

(b) The appropriate reduction shall be determined by the court for reasons stated on the record that may include, but are not limited to, consideration of the following:(1) the court’s evaluation of the significance and usefulness of the organization’s assistance, taking into consideration the government’s evaluation of the assistance rendered;(2) the nature and extent of the organization’s assistance; and(3) the timeliness of the organization’s assistance.

CommentaryApplication Note:1. Departure under this section is intended for cases in which substantial assistance is provided in the investigation or prosecution of crimes committed by individuals not directlyaffiliated with the organization or by other organizations. It is not intended for assistancein the investigation or prosecution of the agents of the organization responsible for the offense for which the organization is being sentenced.

If the members or beneficiaries of an organization are directvictims of the offense, imposing a fine upon the organization may increase the burden upon the victims of the offense without achieving a deterrent effect.

In such a case, a substantial fine may not be necessary in order to achieveadequate punishment and deterrence. In deciding whether departure is §8C4.11appropriate, the court should consider the level and extent of substantialauthority personnel involvement in the offense and the degree to whichthe loss exceeds the gain. If an individual within high-level personnelwas involved in the offense, a departure would not be appropriate underthis section. The lower the level and the more limited the extent of substantial authority personnel involvement in the offense, and the greaterthe degree to which remedial costs exceeded or will exceed gain, the lesswill be the need for a substantial fine to achieve adequate punishmentand deterrence.

In a case meetingthese criteria, the court may find that the organization had exceptionally§8C4.11low culpability and therefore a fine based on loss, offense level, or a special Chapter Two instruction results in a guideline fine range higherthan necessary to achieve the purposes of sentencing. Nevertheless, suchfine should not be lower than if determined under §8C2.4(a)(2).
