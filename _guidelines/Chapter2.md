### §2A1.1 OFFENSE CONDUCT

### Introductory Commentary

Chapter Two pertains to offense conduct. The chapter is organized by offenses and divided into parts and related sections that may cover one statute or many. Each offense has a corresponding base offense level and may have one or more specific offense characteristics thatadjust the offense level upward or downward. Certain factors relevant to the offense that arenot covered in specific guidelines in Chapter Two are set forth in Chapter Three, Parts A (Victim-Related Adjustments), B (Role in the Offense), and C (Obstruction and Related Adjustments); Chapter Four, Part B (Career Offenders and Criminal Livelihood); and Chapter Five, Part K (Departures).

PART A ― OFFENSES AGAINST THE PERSON1. HOMICIDE§2A1.1. First Degree Murder(a) Base Offense Level: 43CommentaryStatutory Provisions: 18 U.S.C. §§ 1111, 1841(a)(2)(C), 1992(a)(7), 2113(e), 2118(c)(2), 2199, 2282A, 2291, 2332b(a)(1), 2340A; 21 U.S.C. § 848(e). For additional statutory provision(s), see Appendix A (Statutory Index).

Application Notes:1. Applicability of Guideline.—This guideline applies in cases of premeditated killing.

This guideline also applies when death results from the commission of certain felonies.

For example, this guideline may be applied as a result of a cross reference (e.g., a kidnapping in which death occurs, see §2A4.1(c)(1)), or in cases in which the offense level of a guideline is calculated using the underlying crime (e.g., murder in aid of racketeering, see §2E1.3(a)(2)).

2. Imposition of Life Sentence.—(A) Offenses Involving Premeditated Killing.—In the case of premeditated killing, life imprisonment is the appropriate sentence if a sentence of death is not imposed.

A downward departure would not be appropriate in such a case. A downward departure from a mandatory statutory term of life imprisonment is permissible only§2A1.3in cases in which the government files a motion for a downward departure for the defendant’s substantial assistance, as provided in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(e).

(B) Felony Murder.—If the defendant did not cause the death intentionally or knowingly, a downward departure may be warranted. For example, a downward departure may be warranted if in robbing a bank, the defendant merely passed a note tothe teller, as a result of which the teller had a heart attack and died. The extent ofthe departure should be based upon the defendant’s state of mind (e.g., recklessnessor negligence), the degree of risk inherent in the conduct, and the nature of the underlying offense conduct. However, departure below the minimum guideline sentence provided for second degree murder in §2A1.2 (Second Degree Murder) is not likely to be appropriate. Also, because death obviously is an aggravating factor, itnecessarily would be inappropriate to impose a sentence at a level below that whichthe guideline for the underlying offense requires in the absence of death.

3. Applicability of Guideline When Death Sentence Not Imposed.—If the defendantis sentenced pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3591 et seq. or 21 U.S.C. § 848(e), a sentence of deathmay be imposed under the specific provisions contained in that statute. This guidelineapplies when a sentence of death is not imposed under those specific provisions.

Application Note:1. Definitions.—For purposes of this guideline:“Criminally negligent” means conduct that involves a gross deviation from the standard of care that a reasonable person would exercise under the circumstances, but whichis not reckless. Offenses with this characteristic usually will be encountered as assimilative crimes.

“Means of transportation” includes a motor vehicle (including an automobile or a boat)and a mass transportation vehicle. “Mass transportation” has the meaning given thatterm in 18 U.S.C. § 1992(d)(7).

“Reckless” means a situation in which the defendant was aware of the risk created byhis conduct and the risk was of such a nature and degree that to disregard that risk§2A1.5constituted a gross deviation from the standard of care that a reasonable person wouldexercise in such a situation. “Reckless” includes all, or nearly all, convictions for involuntary manslaughter under 18 U.S.C. § 1112. A homicide resulting from driving a meansof transportation, or similarly dangerous actions, while under the influence of alcohol ordrugs ordinarily should be treated as reckless.

(7) If the defendant was convicted under 18 U.S.C. § 111(b) or§ 115, increase by 2 levels.

CommentaryStatutory Provisions: 18 U.S.C. §§ 111, 112, 113(a)(2), (3), (6), (8), 114, 115(a), (b)(1), 351(e), 1751(e), 1841(a)(2)(C), 1992(a)(7), 2199, 2291, 2332b(a)(1), 2340A. For additional statutoryprovision(s), see Appendix A (Statutory Index).

Application Notes:1. Definitions.—For purposes of this guideline:“Aggravated assault” means a felonious assault that involved (A) a dangerous weaponwith intent to cause bodily injury (i.e., not merely to frighten) with that weapon; (B) serious bodily injury; (C) strangling, suffocating, or attempting to strangle or suffocate; or(D) an intent to commit another felony.

“Brandished,” “bodily injury,” “firearm,” “otherwise used,” “permanent or lifethreatening bodily injury,” and “serious bodily injury,” have the meaning giventhose terms in §1B1.1 (Application Instructions), Application Note 1.

“Dangerous weapon” has the meaning given that term in §1B1.1, Application Note 1, and includes any instrument that is not ordinarily used as a weapon (e.g., a car, a chair, or an ice pick) if such an instrument is involved in the offense with the intent to commitbodily injury.

“Strangling” and “suffocating” have the meaning given those terms in 18 U.S.C. § 113.

“Spouse,” “intimate partner,” and “dating partner” have the meaning given thoseterms in 18 U.S.C. § 2266.

2. Application of Subsection (b)(1).—For purposes of subsection (b)(1), “more than minimal planning” means more planning than is typical for commission of the offensein a simple form. “More than minimal planning” also exists if significant affirmative stepswere taken to conceal the offense, other than conduct to which §3C1.1 (Obstructing orImpeding the Administration of Justice) applies. For example, waiting to commit the offense when no witnesses were present would not alone constitute more than minimalplanning. By contrast, luring the victim to a specific location or wearing a ski mask toprevent identification would constitute more than minimal planning.

3. Application of Subsection (b)(2).—In a case involving a dangerous weapon with intent to cause bodily injury, the court shall apply both the base offense level and subsection (b)(2).

4. Application of Official Victim Adjustment.—If subsection (b)(7) applies, §3A1.2 (Official Victim) also shall apply.

§2A2.3Background: This guideline covers felonious assaults that are more serious than other assaults because of the presence of an aggravating factor, i.e., serious bodily injury; the involvement of a dangerous weapon with intent to cause bodily injury; strangling, suffocating, or attempting to strangle or suffocate; or the intent to commit another felony. Such offenses occasionally may involve planning or be committed for hire. Consequently, the structure follows§2A2.1 (Assault with Intent to Commit Murder; Attempted Murder). This guideline also coversattempted manslaughter and assault with intent to commit manslaughter. Assault with intentto commit murder is covered by §2A2.1. Assault with intent to commit rape is covered by§2A3.1 (Criminal Sexual Abuse; Attempt to Commit Criminal Sexual Abuse).

An assault that involves the presence of a dangerous weapon is aggravated in form whenthe presence of the dangerous weapon is coupled with the intent to cause bodily injury. In sucha case, the base offense level and the weapon enhancement in subsection (b)(2) take into account different aspects of the offense, even if application of the base offense level and the weapon enhancement is based on the same conduct.

Subsection (b)(7) implements the directive to the Commission in subsection 11008(e) ofthe 21st Century Department of Justice Appropriations Act (the “Act”), Public Law 107–273.

The enhancement in subsection (b)(7) is cumulative to the adjustment in §3A1.2 (Official Victim) in order to address adequately the directive in section 11008(e)(2)(D) of the Act, whichprovides that the Commission shall consider “the extent to which sentencing enhancementswithin the Federal guidelines and the authority of the court to impose a sentence in excess ofthe applicable guideline range are adequate to ensure punishment at or near the maximumpenalty for the most egregious conduct covered by” 18 U.S.C. §§ 111 and 115.

Application Notes:1. Definitions.—For purposes of this guideline, “bodily injury”, “dangerous weapon”, and “firearm” have the meaning given those terms in Application Note 1 of the Commentary to §1B1.1 (Application Instructions).

2. Application of Certain Chapter Three Adjustments.—The base offense level incorporates the fact that the victim was a governmental officer performing official duties.

Therefore, do not apply §3A1.2 (Official Victim) unless, pursuant to subsection (c), the offense level is determined under §2A2.2 (Aggravated Assault). Conversely, the base offense level does not incorporate the possibility that the defendant may create a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury to another person in the course of fleeing froma law enforcement official (although an offense under 18 U.S.C. § 758 for fleeing or evading a law enforcement checkpoint at high speed will often, but not always, involve the creation of that risk). If the defendant creates that risk and no higher guideline adjustment is applicable for the conduct creating the risk, apply §3C1.2 (Reckless Endangerment During Flight).

3. Upward Departure Provision.—The base offense level does not assume any significant disruption of governmental functions. In situations involving such disruption, anupward departure may be warranted. See §5K2.7 (Disruption of Governmental Function).

CommentaryStatutory Provisions: 18 U.S.C. §§ 2241, 2242. For additional statutory provision(s), see Appendix A (Statutory Index).

Application Notes:1. Definitions.—For purposes of this guideline:“Abducted”, “permanent or life-threatening bodily injury”, and “serious bodily injury” have the meaning given those terms in Application Note 1 of the Commentary to§1B1.1 (Application Instructions). However, for purposes of this guideline, “serious bodily injury” means conduct other than criminal sexual abuse, which already is taken intoaccount in the base offense level under subsection (a).

“Custody or control” and “prison official” have the meaning given those terms in Application Note 4 of the Commentary to §3A1.2 (Official Victim).

“Child pornography” has the meaning given that term in 18 U.S.C. § 2256(8).

“Computer” has the meaning given that term in 18 U.S.C. § 1030(e)(1).

“Distribution” means any act, including possession with intent to distribute, production, transportation, and advertisement, related to the transfer of material involving the sexual exploitation of a minor. Accordingly, distribution includes posting material involving§2A3.1the sexual exploitation of a minor on a website for public viewing, but does not includethe mere solicitation of such material by a defendant.

“Interactive computer service” has the meaning given that term in section 230(e)(2) ofthe Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. § 230(f)(2)).

“Victim” includes an undercover law enforcement officer.

2. Application of Subsection (b)(1).—(A) Definitions.—For purposes of subsection (b)(1), “conduct described in 18 U.S.C.

§ 2241(a) or (b)” is engaging in, or causing another person to engage in, a sexualact with another person by: (A) using force against the victim; (B) threatening orplacing the victim in fear that any person will be subject to death, serious bodilyinjury, or kidnapping; (C) rendering the victim unconscious; or (D) administeringby force or threat of force, or without the knowledge or permission of the victim, a drug, intoxicant, or other similar substance and thereby substantially impairingthe ability of the victim to appraise or control conduct. This provision would apply, for example, if any dangerous weapon was used or brandished, or in a case in whichthe ability of the victim to appraise or control conduct was substantially impairedby drugs or alcohol.

(B) Application in Cases Involving a Conviction under 18 U.S.C. § 2241(c).—Ifthe conduct that forms the basis for a conviction under 18 U.S.C. § 2241(c) is thatthe defendant engaged in conduct described in 18 U.S.C. § 2241(a) or (b), do not apply subsection (b)(1).

3. Application of Subsection (b)(3).—(A) Care, Custody, or Supervisory Control.—Subsection (b)(3) is to be construedbroadly and includes offenses involving a victim less than 18 years of age entrustedto the defendant, whether temporarily or permanently. For example, teachers, daycare providers, baby-sitters, or other temporary caretakers are among those whowould be subject to this enhancement. In determining whether to apply this enhancement, the court should look to the actual relationship that existed betweenthe defendant and the minor and not simply to the legal status of the defendantminor relationship.

(B) Inapplicability of Chapter Three Adjustment.—If the enhancement in subsection (b)(3) applies, do not apply §3B1.3 (Abuse of Position of Trust or Use of SpecialSkill).

§2A3.14. Application of Subsection (b)(6).—(A) Misrepresentation of Participant’s Identity.—The enhancement in subsection(b)(6)(A) applies in cases involving the misrepresentation of a participant’s identityto (A) persuade, induce, entice, or coerce a minor to engage in prohibited sexualconduct; or (B) facilitate transportation or travel, by a minor or a participant, toengage in prohibited sexual conduct. Subsection (b)(6)(A) is intended to apply onlyto misrepresentations made directly to a minor or to a person who exercises custody, care, or supervisory control of the minor. Accordingly, the enhancement in subsection (b)(6)(A) would not apply to a misrepresentation made by a participant to anairline representative in the course of making travel arrangements for the minor.

The misrepresentation to which the enhancement in subsection (b)(6)(A) may applyincludes misrepresentation of a participant’s name, age, occupation, gender, or status, as long as the misrepresentation was made with the intent to (A) persuade, induce, entice, or coerce a minor to engage in prohibited sexual conduct; or (B) facilitate transportation or travel, by a minor or a participant, to engage in prohibitedsexual conduct. Accordingly, use of a computer screen name, without such intent, would not be a sufficient basis for application of the enhancement.

(B) Use of a Computer or Interactive Computer Service.—Subsection (b)(6)(B)provides an enhancement if a computer or an interactive computer service was usedto (i) persuade, induce, entice, or coerce a minor to engage in prohibited sexual conduct; or (ii) facilitate transportation or travel, by a minor or a participant, to engagein prohibited sexual conduct. Subsection (b)(6)(B) is intended to apply only to the use of a computer or an interactive computer service to communicate directly with a minor or with a person who exercises custody, care, or supervisory control of the minor.

If the victim had not attainedthe age of 12 years, §2A3.1 shall apply, regardless of the “consent” of the victim.

CommentaryStatutory Provision: 18 U.S.C. § 2243(a). For additional statutory provision(s), see Appendix A (Statutory Index).

Application Notes:1. Definitions.—For purposes of this guideline:“Computer” has the meaning given that term in 18 U.S.C. § 1030(e)(1).

“Interactive computer service” has the meaning given that term in section 230(e)(2) ofthe Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. § 230(f)(2)).

“Minor” means (A) an individual who had not attained the age of 16 years; (B) an individual, whether fictitious or not, who a law enforcement officer represented to a participant (i) had not attained the age of 16 years, and (ii) could be provided for the purposesof engaging in sexually explicit conduct; or (C) an undercover law enforcement officer whorepresented to a participant that the officer had not attained the age of 16 years.

§2A3.2“Participant” has the meaning given that term in Application Note 1 of §3B1.1 (Aggravating Role).

“Prohibited sexual conduct” has the meaning given that term in Application Note 1 of§2A3.1 (Criminal Sexual Abuse; Attempt to Commit Criminal Sexual Abuse).

2. Custody, Care, or Supervisory Control Enhancement.—(A) In General.—Subsection (b)(1) is intended to have broad application and is to beapplied whenever the minor is entrusted to the defendant, whether temporarily orpermanently. For example, teachers, day care providers, baby-sitters, or other temporary caretakers are among those who would be subject to this enhancement. In determining whether to apply this enhancement, the court should look to the actualrelationship that existed between the defendant and the minor and not simply tothe legal status of the defendant-minor relationship.

(B) Inapplicability of Chapter Three Adjustment.—If the enhancement in subsection (b)(1) applies, do not apply subsection (b)(2) or §3B1.3 (Abuse of Position ofTrust or Use of Special Skill).

3. Application of Subsection (b)(2).—(A) Misrepresentation of Identity.—The enhancement in subsection (b)(2)(B)(i) applies in cases involving the misrepresentation of a participant’s identity to persuade, induce, entice, or coerce the minor to engage in prohibited sexual conduct.

Subsection (b)(2)(B)(i) is intended to apply only to misrepresentations made directlyto the minor or to a person who exercises custody, care, or supervisory control of the minor. Accordingly, the enhancement in subsection (b)(2)(B)(i) would not apply to a misrepresentation made by a participant to an airline representative in the courseof making travel arrangements for the minor.

The misrepresentation to which the enhancement in subsection (b)(2)(B)(i) may apply includes misrepresentation of a participant’s name, age, occupation, gender, orstatus, as long as the misrepresentation was made with the intent to persuade, induce, entice, or coerce the minor to engage in prohibited sexual conduct. Accordingly, use of a computer screen name, without such intent, would not be a sufficientbasis for application of the enhancement.

(B) Undue Influence.—In determining whether subsection (b)(2)(B)(ii) applies, the court should closely consider the facts of the case to determine whether a participant’s influence over the minor compromised the voluntariness of the minor’s behavior. The voluntariness of the minor’s behavior may be compromised without prohibited sexual conduct occurring.

However, subsection (b)(2)(B)(ii) does not apply in a case in which the only “minor”(as defined in Application Note 1) involved in the offense is an undercover law enforcement officer.

In a case in which a participant is at least 10 years older than the minor, there shallbe a rebuttable presumption that subsection (b)(2)(B)(ii) applies. In such a case, some degree of undue influence can be presumed because of the substantial difference in age between the participant and the minor.

§2A3.34. Application of Subsection (b)(3).—Subsection (b)(3) provides an enhancement if a computer or an interactive computer service was used to persuade, induce, entice, or coerce the minor to engage in prohibited sexual conduct. Subsection (b)(3) is intended toapply only to the use of a computer or an interactive computer service to communicatedirectly with the minor or with a person who exercises custody, care, or supervisory control of the minor.

5. Cross Reference.—Subsection (c)(1) provides a cross reference to §2A3.1 (Criminal Sexual Abuse; Attempt to Commit Criminal Sexual Abuse) if the offense involved criminal sexual abuse or attempt to commit criminal sexual abuse, as defined in 18 U.S.C. § 2241or § 2242. For example, the cross reference to §2A3.1 shall apply if (A) the victim had not attained the age of 12 years (see 18 U.S.C. § 2241(c)); (B) the victim had attained the ageof 12 years but not attained the age of 16 years, and was placed in fear of death, seriousbodily injury, or kidnapping (see 18 U.S.C. § 2241(a),(c)); or (C) the victim was threatenedor placed in fear other than fear of death, serious bodily injury, or kidnapping(see 18 U.S.C. § 2242(1)).

6. Upward Departure Consideration.—There may be cases in which the offense leveldetermined under this guideline substantially understates the seriousness of the offense.

In such cases, an upward departure may be warranted. For example, an upward departure may be warranted if the defendant committed the criminal sexual act in furtheranceof a commercial scheme such as pandering, transporting persons for the purpose of prostitution, or the production of pornography.

Background: This section applies to offenses involving the criminal sexual abuse of an individual who had not attained the age of 16 years. While this section applies to consensual sexualacts prosecuted under 18 U.S.C. § 2243(a) that would be lawful but for the age of the minor, italso applies to cases, prosecuted under 18 U.S.C. § 2243(a), in which a participant took activemeasure(s) to unduly influence the minor to engage in prohibited sexual conduct and, thus, the voluntariness of the minor’s behavior was compromised. A four-level enhancement is provided in subsection (b)(2) for such cases. It is assumed that at least a four-year age differenceexists between the minor and the defendant, as specified in 18 U.S.C. § 2243(a). A four-levelenhancement is provided in subsection (b)(1) for a defendant who victimizes a minor under his supervision or care. However, if the minor had not attained the age of 12 years, §2A3.1 (Criminal Sexual Abuse; Attempt to Commit Criminal Sexual Abuse) will apply, regardless of the “consent” of the minor.

Chapters Three (Adjustments) and Four (Criminal History and CriminalLivelihood) shall not apply to any count of conviction covered by this guideline.

CommentaryStatutory Provisions: 18 U.S.C. §§ 2250(c), 2260A.

Application Notes:1. In General.—Section 2250(c) of title 18, United States Code, provides a mandatory minimum term of five years’ imprisonment and a statutory maximum term of 30 years’ imprisonment. The statute also requires a sentence to be imposed consecutively to any sentence imposed for a conviction under 18 U.S.C. § 2250(a). Section 2260A of title 18, §2A4.1United States Code, provides a term of imprisonment of 10 years that is required to beimposed consecutively to any sentence imposed for an offense enumerated under thatsection.

2. Inapplicability of Chapters Three and Four.—Do not apply Chapters Three (Adjustments) and Four (Criminal History and Criminal Livelihood) to any offense sentencedunder this guideline. Such offenses are excluded from application of those chapters because the guideline sentence for each offense is determined only by the relevant statute.

See §§3D1.1 (Procedure for Determining Offense Level on Multiple Counts) and 5G1.2(Sentencing on Multiple Counts of Conviction).

3. Inapplicability of Chapter Two Enhancement.—If a sentence under this guidelineis imposed in conjunction with a sentence for an underlying offense, do not apply anyspecific offense characteristic that is based on the same conduct as the conduct comprising the conviction under 18 U.S.C. § 2250(c) or § 2260A.

(c) Cross Reference(1) If the victim was killed under circumstances that would constitute murder under 18 U.S.C. § 1111 had such killing takenplace within the territorial or maritime jurisdiction of the United States, apply §2A1.1 (First Degree Murder).

CommentaryStatutory Provisions: 18 U.S.C. §§ 115(b)(2), 351(b), (d), 1201, 1203, 1751(b), 2340A. Foradditional statutory provision(s), see Appendix A (Statutory Index).

Application Notes:1. For purposes of this guideline—Definitions of “serious bodily injury” and “permanent or life-threatening bodily injury” are found in the Commentary to §1B1.1 (Application Instructions). However, for §2A4.1purposes of this guideline, “serious bodily injury” means conduct other than criminal sexual abuse, which is taken into account in the specific offense characteristic under subsection (b)(5).

2. “A dangerous weapon was used” means that a firearm was discharged, or a “firearm”or “dangerous weapon” was “otherwise used” (as defined in the Commentary to §1B1.1(Application Instructions)).

3. “Sexually exploited” includes offenses set forth in 18 U.S.C. §§ 2241–2244, 2251, and2421–2423.

4. In the case of a conspiracy, attempt, or solicitation to kidnap, §2X1.1 (Attempt, Solicitation, or Conspiracy) requires that the court apply any adjustment that can be determinedwith reasonable certainty. Therefore, for example, if an offense involved conspiracy tokidnap for the purpose of committing murder, subsection (b)(7) would reference first degree murder (resulting in an offense level of 43, subject to a possible 3-level reductionunder §2X1.1(b)).

Similarly, for example, if an offense involved a kidnapping during which a participantattempted to murder the victim under circumstances that would have constituted firstdegree murder had death occurred, the offense referenced under subsection (b)(7) wouldbe the offense of first degree murder.

Background: Federal kidnapping cases generally encompass three categories of conduct: limited duration kidnapping where the victim is released unharmed; kidnapping that occurs aspart of or to facilitate the commission of another offense (often, sexual assault); and kidnappingfor ransom or political demand.

The guideline contains an adjustment for the length of time that the victim was detained.

The adjustment recognizes the increased suffering involved in lengthy kidnappings and provides an incentive to release the victim.

An enhancement is provided when the offense is committed for ransom (subsection (b)(1))or involves another federal, state, or local offense that results in a greater offense level (subsections (b)(7) and (c)(1)).

Section 401 of Public Law 101–647 amended 18 U.S.C. § 1201 to require that courts takeinto account certain specific offense characteristics in cases involving a victim under eighteenyears of age and directed the Commission to include those specific offense characteristicswithin the guidelines. Where the guidelines did not already take into account the conductidentified by the Act, additional specific offense characteristics have been provided.

Subsections (a) and (b)(5), and the deletion of subsection (b)(4)(C), effective May 30, 2003, implement the directive to the Commission in section 104 of Public Law 108–21.

Application Notes:1. Scope of Conduct to Be Considered.—In determining whether subsections (b)(1), (b)(2), and (b)(3) apply, the court shall consider both conduct that occurred prior to the offense and conduct that occurred during the offense; however, conduct that occurredprior to the offense must be substantially and directly connected to the offense, under the facts of the case taken as a whole. For example, if the defendant engaged in several actsof mailing threatening letters to the same victim over a period of years (including actsthat occurred prior to the offense), then for purposes of determining whether subsections(b)(1), (b)(2), and (b)(3) apply, the court shall consider only those prior acts of threateningthe victim that have a substantial and direct connection to the offense.

2. Applicability of Chapter Three Adjustments.—If the defendant is convicted under18 U.S.C. § 1521, apply §3A1.2 (Official Victim).

3. Grouping.—For purposes of Chapter Three, Part D (Multiple Counts), multiple countsinvolving making a threatening or harassing communication to the same victim aregrouped together under §3D1.2 (Groups of Closely Related Counts). Multiple counts involving different victims are not to be grouped under §3D1.2.

§2A6.24. Departure Provisions.—(A) In General.—The Commission recognizes that offenses covered by this guidelinemay include a particularly wide range of conduct and that it is not possible to include all of the potentially relevant circumstances in the offense level. Factors not incorporated in the guideline may be considered by the court in determiningwhether a departure from the guidelines is warranted. See Chapter Five, Part K(Departures).

(B) Multiple Threats, False Liens or Encumbrances, or Victims; PecuniaryHarm.—If the offense involved (i) substantially more than two threatening communications to the same victim, (ii) a prolonged period of making harassing communications to the same victim, (iii) substantially more than two false liens or encumbrances against the real or personal property of the same victim, (iv) multiplevictims, or (v) substantial pecuniary harm to a victim, an upward departure maybe warranted.

Background: These statutes cover a wide range of conduct, the seriousness of which dependsupon the defendant’s intent and the likelihood that the defendant would carry out the threat.

The specific offense characteristics are intended to distinguish such cases.

Subsection (b)(5) implements, in a broader form, the directive to the Commission in section 209 of the Court Security Improvement Act of 2007, Public Law 110–177.

§2A6.2. Stalking or Domestic Violence(a) Base Offense Level: 18(b) Specific Offense Characteristic(1) If the offense involved one of the following aggravating factors:(A) the violation of a court protection order; (B) bodily injury;(C) strangling, suffocating, or attempting to strangle or suffocate; (D) possession, or threatened use, of a dangerous weapon;or (E) a pattern of activity involving stalking, threatening, harassing, or assaulting the same victim, increase by 2 levels. Ifthe offense involved more than one of subdivisions (A), (B), (C), (D), or (E), increase by 4 levels.

(c) Cross Reference(1) If the offense involved the commission of another criminal offense, apply the offense guideline from Chapter Two, Part A(Offenses Against the Person) most applicable to that other§2A6.2criminal offense, if the resulting offense level is greater than that determined above.

CommentaryStatutory Provisions: 18 U.S.C. §§ 2261–2262.

Application Notes:1. For purposes of this guideline:“Bodily injury” and “dangerous weapon” are defined in the Commentary to §1B1.1(Application Instructions).

“Pattern of activity involving stalking, threatening, harassing, or assaulting the same victim” means any combination of two or more separate instances of stalking, threatening, harassing, or assaulting the same victim, whether or not such conduct resulted in a conviction. For example, a single instance of stalking accompanied by a separate instance of threatening, harassing, or assaulting the same victim constitutes a pattern of activity for purposes of this guideline.

“Stalking” means conduct described in 18 U.S.C. § 2261A.

“Strangling” and “suffocating” have the meaning given those terms in 18 U.S.C. § 113.

2. Subsection (b)(1) provides for a two-level or four-level enhancement based on the degreeto which the offense involved aggravating factors listed in that subsection. If the offenseinvolved aggravating factors more serious than the factors listed in subsection (b)(1), the cross reference in subsection (c) most likely will apply, if the resulting offense level is greater, because the more serious conduct will be covered by another offense guidelinefrom Chapter Two, Part A. For example, §2A2.2 (Aggravated Assault) most likely wouldapply pursuant to subsection (c) if the offense involved assaultive conduct in which injurymore serious than bodily injury occurred or if a dangerous weapon was used rather than merely possessed.

3. In determining whether subsection (b)(1)(E) applies, the court shall consider, under the totality of the circumstances, any conduct that occurred prior to or during the offense;however, conduct that occurred prior to the offense must be substantially and directlyconnected to the offense. For example, if a defendant engaged in several acts of stalkingthe same victim over a period of years (including acts that occurred prior to the offense), then for purposes of determining whether subsection (b)(1)(E) applies, the court shalllook to the totality of the circumstances, considering only those prior acts of stalking the victim that have a substantial and direct connection to the offense.

Prior convictions taken into account under subsection (b)(1)(E) are also counted for purposes of determining criminal history points pursuant to Chapter Four, Part A (CriminalHistory).

4. For purposes of Chapter Three, Part D (Multiple Counts), multiple counts involvingstalking, threatening, or harassing the same victim are grouped together (and with counts of other offenses involving the same victim that are covered by this guideline)under §3D1.2 (Groups of Closely Related Counts). For example, if the defendant is convicted of two counts of stalking the defendant’s ex-spouse under 18 U.S.C. § 2261A and§2A6.2one count of interstate domestic violence involving an assault of the ex-spouse under18 U.S.C. § 2261, the stalking counts would be grouped together with the interstate domestic violence count. This grouping procedure avoids unwarranted “double counting”with the enhancement in subsection (b)(1)(E) (for multiple acts of stalking, threatening, harassing, or assaulting the same victim) and recognizes that the stalking and interstatedomestic violence counts are sufficiently related to warrant grouping.

Multiple counts that are cross referenced to another offense guideline pursuant to subsection (c) are to be grouped together if §3D1.2 (Groups of Closely Related Counts) wouldrequire grouping of those counts under that offense guideline. Similarly, multiple countscross referenced pursuant to subsection (c) are not to be grouped together if §3D1.2 wouldpreclude grouping of the counts under that offense guideline. For example, if the defendant is convicted of multiple counts of threatening an ex-spouse in violation of a courtprotection order under 18 U.S.C. § 2262 and the counts are cross referenced to §2A6.1(Threatening or Harassing Communications), the counts would group together becauseApplication Note 3 of §2A6.1 specifically requires grouping. In contrast, if the defendantis convicted of multiple counts of assaulting the ex-spouse in violation of a court protection order under 18 U.S.C. § 2262 and the counts are cross referenced to §2A2.2 (Aggravated Assault), the counts probably would not group together inasmuch as §3D1.2(d) specifically precludes grouping of counts covered by §2A2.2 and no other provision of §3D1.2would likely apply to require grouping.

Multiple counts involving different victims are not to be grouped under §3D1.2 (Groupsof Closely Related Counts).

5. If the defendant received an enhancement under subsection (b)(1) but that enhancementdoes not adequately reflect the extent or seriousness of the conduct involved, an upwarddeparture may be warranted. For example, an upward departure may be warranted ifthe defendant stalked the victim on many occasions over a prolonged period of time.

3. Loss Under Subsection (b)(1).—This application note applies to the determination ofloss under subsection (b)(1).

(A) General Rule.—Subject to the exclusions in subdivision (D), loss is the greater ofactual loss or intended loss.

    (i) Actual Loss.—“Actual loss” means the reasonably foreseeable pecuniaryharm that resulted from the offense.

    (ii) Intended Loss.—“Intended loss” (I) means the pecuniary harm that the defendant purposely sought to inflict; and (II) includes intended pecuniary harmthat would have been impossible or unlikely to occur (e.g., as in a governmentsting operation, or an insurance fraud in which the claim exceeded the insuredvalue).

    §2B1.1(iii) Pecuniary Harm.—“Pecuniary harm” means harm that is monetary orthat otherwise is readily measurable in money. Accordingly, pecuniary harmdoes not include emotional distress, harm to reputation, or other non-economic harm.

    (iv) Reasonably Foreseeable Pecuniary Harm.—For purposes of this guideline, “reasonably foreseeable pecuniary harm” means pecuniary harmthat the defendant knew or, under the circumstances, reasonably should haveknown, was a potential result of the offense.

    (v) Rules of Construction in Certain Cases.—In the cases described in subdivisions (I) through (III), reasonably foreseeable pecuniary harm shall be considered to include the pecuniary harm specified for those cases as follows:
    
        (I) Product Substitution Cases.—In the case of a product substitutionoffense, the reasonably foreseeable pecuniary harm includes the reasonably foreseeable costs of making substitute transactions and handling ordisposing of the product delivered, or of retrofitting the product so thatit can be used for its intended purpose, and the reasonably foreseeablecosts of rectifying the actual or potential disruption to the victim’s business operations caused by the product substitution.

        (II) Procurement Fraud Cases.—In the case of a procurement fraud, suchas a fraud affecting a defense contract award, reasonably foreseeable pecuniary harm includes the reasonably foreseeable administrative coststo the government and other participants of repeating or correcting the procurement action affected, plus any increased costs to procure the product or service involved that was reasonably foreseeable.

        (III) Offenses Under 18 U.S.C. § 1030.—In the case of an offense under18 U.S.C. § 1030, actual loss includes the following pecuniary harm, regardless of whether such pecuniary harm was reasonably foreseeable:any reasonable cost to any victim, including the cost of responding to anoffense, conducting a damage assessment, and restoring the data, program, system, or information to its condition prior to the offense, andany revenue lost, cost incurred, or other damages incurred because ofinterruption of service.

(B) Gain.—The court shall use the gain that resulted from the offense as an alternativemeasure of loss only if there is a loss but it reasonably cannot be determined.

(C) Estimation of Loss.—The court need only make a reasonable estimate of the loss. The sentencing judge is in a unique position to assess the evidence and estimatethe loss based upon that evidence. For this reason, the court’s loss determination is entitled to appropriate deference. See 18 U.S.C. § 3742(e) and (f).

The estimate of the loss shall be based on available information, taking into account, as appropriate and practicable under the circumstances, factors such as the following:

(i) The fair market value of the property unlawfully taken, copied, or destroyed;or, if the fair market value is impracticable to determine or inadequatelymeasures the harm, the cost to the victim of replacing that property.

(ii) In the case of proprietary information (e.g., trade secrets), the cost of developing that information or the reduction in the value of that information thatresulted from the offense.

(iii) The cost of repairs to damaged property.

(iv) The approximate number of victims multiplied by the average loss to eachvictim.

(v) The reduction that resulted from the offense in the value of equity securitiesor other corporate assets.

(vi) More general factors, such as the scope and duration of the offense and revenues generated by similar operations.

(D) Exclusions from Loss.—Loss shall not include the following:(i) Interest of any kind, finance charges, late fees, penalties, amounts based onan agreed-upon return or rate of return, or other similar costs.

(ii) Costs to the government of, and costs incurred by victims primarily to aid the government in, the prosecution and criminal investigation of an offense.

(E) Credits Against Loss.—Loss shall be reduced by the following:(i) The money returned, and the fair market value of the property returned andthe services rendered, by the defendant or other persons acting jointly with the defendant, to the victim before the offense was detected. The time of detection of the offense is the earlier of (I) the time the offense was discoveredby a victim or government agency; or (II) the time the defendant knew or reasonably should have known that the offense was detected or about to be detected by a victim or government agency.

(ii) In a case involving collateral pledged or otherwise provided by the defendant, the amount the victim has recovered at the time of sentencing from dispositionof the collateral, or if the collateral has not been disposed of by that time, the fair market value of the collateral at the time of sentencing.

(iii) Notwithstanding clause (ii), in the case of a fraud involving a mortgage loan, if the collateral has not been disposed of by the time of sentencing, use the fairmarket value of the collateral as of the date on which the guilt of the defendanthas been established, whether by guilty plea, trial, or plea of nolo contendere.

In such a case, there shall be a rebuttable presumption that the most recenttax assessment value of the collateral is a reasonable estimate of the fair market value. In determining whether the most recent tax assessment value is a reasonable estimate of the fair market value, the court may consider, amongother factors, the recency of the tax assessment and the extent to which the jurisdiction’s tax assessment practices reflect factors not relevant to fair market value.

(F) Special Rules.—Notwithstanding subdivision (A), the following special rules shallbe used to assist in determining loss in the cases indicated:§2B1.1(i) Stolen or Counterfeit Credit Cards and Access Devices; PurloinedNumbers and Codes.—In a case involving any counterfeit access device orunauthorized access device, loss includes any unauthorized charges madewith the counterfeit access device or unauthorized access device and shall benot less than $500 per access device. However, if the unauthorized access device is a means of telecommunications access that identifies a specific telecommunications instrument or telecommunications account (including an electronic serial number/mobile identification number (ESN/MIN) pair), and thatmeans was only possessed, and not used, during the commission of the offense, loss shall be not less than $100 per unused means. For purposes of this subdivision, “counterfeit access device” and “unauthorized access device”have the meaning given those terms in Application Note 10(A).

(ii) Government Benefits.—In a case involving government benefits (e.g., grants, loans, entitlement program payments), loss shall be considered to benot less than the value of the benefits obtained by unintended recipients ordiverted to unintended uses, as the case may be. For example, if the defendantwas the intended recipient of food stamps having a value of $100 but fraudulently received food stamps having a value of $150, loss is $50.

(iii) Davis–Bacon Act Violations.—In a case involving a Davis–Bacon Act violation (i.e., a violation of 40 U.S.C. § 3142, criminally prosecuted under18 U.S.C. § 1001), the value of the benefits shall be considered to be not lessthan the difference between the legally required wages and actual wages paid.

(iv) Ponzi and Other Fraudulent Investment Schemes.—In a case involvinga fraudulent investment scheme, such as a Ponzi scheme, loss shall not bereduced by the money or the value of the property transferred to any individual investor in the scheme in excess of that investor’s principal investment(i.e., the gain to an individual investor in the scheme shall not be used to offsetthe loss to another individual investor in the scheme).

(v) Certain Other Unlawful Misrepresentation Schemes.—In a case involving a scheme in which (I) services were fraudulently rendered to the victim bypersons falsely posing as licensed professionals; (II) goods were falsely represented as approved by a governmental regulatory agency; or (III) goods for which regulatory approval by a government agency was required but not obtained, or was obtained by fraud, loss shall include the amount paid for the property, services or goods transferred, rendered, or misrepresented, with nocredit provided for the value of those items or services.

(vi) Value of Controlled Substances.—In a case involving controlled substances, loss is the estimated street value of the controlled substances.

(vii) Value of Cultural Heritage Resources or Paleontological Resources.—In a case involving a cultural heritage resource or paleontological resource, loss attributable to that resource shall be determined in accordance with the rules for determining the “value of the resource” set forth in ApplicationNote 2 of the Commentary to §2B1.5.

(viii) Federal Health Care Offenses Involving Government Health CarePrograms.—In a case in which the defendant is convicted of a Federal healthcare offense involving a Government health care program, the aggregate dol§2B1.1lar amount of fraudulent bills submitted to the Government health care program shall constitute prima facie evidence of the amount of the intended loss, i.e., is evidence sufficient to establish the amount of the intended loss, if not rebutted.

(ix) Fraudulent Inflation or Deflation in Value of Securities or Commodities.—In a case involving the fraudulent inflation or deflation in the value ofa publicly traded security or commodity, the court in determining loss mayuse any method that is appropriate and practicable under the circumstances.

One such method the court may consider is a method under which the actualloss attributable to the change in value of the security or commodity is the amount determined by—(I) calculating the difference between the average price of the security orcommodity during the period that the fraud occurred and the averageprice of the security or commodity during the 90-day period after the fraud was disclosed to the market, and(II) multiplying the difference in average price by the number of shares outstanding.

In determining whether the amount so determined is a reasonable estimateof the actual loss attributable to the change in value of the security or commodity, the court may consider, among other factors, the extent to which the amount so determined includes significant changes in value not resulting fromthe offense (e.g., changes caused by external market forces, such as changedeconomic circumstances, changed investor expectations, and new industryspecific or firm-specific facts, conditions, or events).

Application of Subsection (b)(19).—(A) Definitions.—For purposes of subsection (b)(19):“Commodities law” means (i) the Commodity Exchange Act (7 U.S.C. § 1 et seq.)and 18 U.S.C. § 1348; and (ii) includes the rules, regulations, and orders issued bythe Commodity Futures Trading Commission.

“Commodity pool operator” has the meaning given that term in section 1a(11) ofthe Commodity Exchange Act (7 U.S.C. § 1a(11)).

“Commodity trading advisor” has the meaning given that term in section 1a(12)of the Commodity Exchange Act (7 U.S.C. § 1a(12)).

“Futures commission merchant” has the meaning given that term in section 1a(28) of the Commodity Exchange Act (7 U.S.C. § 1a(28)).

“Introducing broker” has the meaning given that term in section 1a(31) of the Commodity Exchange Act (7 U.S.C. § 1a(31)).

“Investment adviser” has the meaning given that term in section 202(a)(11) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. § 80b-2(a)(11)).

“Person associated with a broker or dealer” has the meaning given that termin section 3(a)(18) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. § 78c(a)(18)).

“Person associated with an investment adviser” has the meaning given thatterm in section 202(a)(17) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C.

§ 80b-2(a)(17)).

“Registered broker or dealer” has the meaning given that term in section 3(a)(48)of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. § 78c(a)(48)).

“Securities law” (i) means 18 U.S.C. §§ 1348, 1350, and the provisions of law referred to in section 3(a)(47) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C.

§ 78c(a)(47)); and (ii) includes the rules, regulations, and orders issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to the provisions of law referred to insuch section.

(B) In General.—A conviction under a securities law or commodities law is not required in order for subsection (b)(19) to apply. This subsection would apply in the case of a defendant convicted under a general fraud statute if the defendant’s conduct violated a securities law or commodities law. For example, this subsectionwould apply if an officer of a publicly traded company violated regulations issuedby the Securities and Exchange Commission by fraudulently influencing an independent audit of the company’s financial statements for the purposes of renderingsuch financial statements materially misleading, even if the officer is convicted onlyof wire fraud.

(C) Nonapplicability of §3B1.3 (Abuse of Position of Trust or Use of SpecialSkill).—If subsection (b)(19) applies, do not apply §3B1.3.

16. Cross Reference in Subsection (c)(3).—Subsection (c)(3) provides a cross reference toanother guideline in Chapter Two (Offense Conduct) in cases in which the defendant is §2B1.1convicted of a general fraud statute, and the count of conviction establishes an offenseinvolving fraudulent conduct that is more aptly covered by another guideline. Sometimes, offenses involving fraudulent statements are prosecuted under 18 U.S.C. § 1001, or a similarly general statute, although the offense involves fraudulent conduct that is alsocovered by a more specific statute. Examples include false entries regarding currencytransactions, for which §2S1.3 (Structuring Transactions to Evade Reporting Requirements) likely would be more apt, and false statements to a customs officer, for which§2T3.1 (Evading Import Duties or Restrictions (Smuggling); Receiving or Trafficking inSmuggled Property) likely would be more apt. In certain other cases, the mail or wirefraud statutes, or other relatively broad statutes, are used primarily as jurisdictionalbases for the prosecution of other offenses. For example, a state employee who improperlyinfluenced the award of a contract and used the mails to commit the offense may be prosecuted under 18 U.S.C. § 1341 for fraud involving the deprivation of the intangible rightof honest services. Such a case would be more aptly sentenced pursuant to §2C1.1 (Offering, Giving, Soliciting, or Receiving a Bribe; Extortion Under Color of Official Right;Fraud involving the Deprivation of the Intangible Right to Honest Services of Public Officials; Conspiracy to Defraud by Interference with Governmental Functions).

17. Continuing Financial Crimes Enterprise.—If the defendant is convicted under18 U.S.C. § 225 (relating to a continuing financial crimes enterprise), the offense level is that applicable to the underlying series of offenses comprising the “continuing financialcrimes enterprise”.

18. Partially Completed Offenses.—In the case of a partially completed offense (e.g., anoffense involving a completed theft or fraud that is part of a larger, attempted theft orfraud), the offense level is to be determined in accordance with the provisions of §2X1.1(Attempt, Solicitation, or Conspiracy) whether the conviction is for the substantive offense, the inchoate offense (attempt, solicitation, or conspiracy), or both. See ApplicationNote 4 of the Commentary to §2X1.1.

19. Multiple-Count Indictments.—Some fraudulent schemes may result in multiplecount indictments, depending on the technical elements of the offense. The cumulativeloss produced by a common scheme or course of conduct should be used in determiningthe offense level, regardless of the number of counts of conviction. See Chapter Three, Part D (Multiple Counts).

20. Departure Considerations.—(A) Upward Departure Considerations.—There may be cases in which the offenselevel determined under this guideline substantially understates the seriousness ofthe offense. In such cases, an upward departure may be warranted. The followingis a non-exhaustive list of factors that the court may consider in determiningwhether an upward departure is warranted:(i) A primary objective of the offense was an aggravating, non-monetary objective. For example, a primary objective of the offense was to inflict emotionalharm.

(ii) The offense caused or risked substantial non-monetary harm. For example, the offense caused physical harm, psychological harm, or severe emotionaltrauma, or resulted in a substantial invasion of a privacy interest (through, for example, the theft of personal information such as medical, educational, or financial records). An upward departure would be warranted, for example, in an 18 U.S.C. § 1030 offense involving damage to a protected computer, if, §2B1.1as a result of that offense, death resulted. An upward departure also would bewarranted, for example, in a case involving animal enterprise terrorism under18 U.S.C. § 43, if, in the course of the offense, serious bodily injury or deathresulted, or substantial scientific research or information were destroyed.

Similarly, an upward departure would be warranted in a case involving conduct described in 18 U.S.C. § 670 if the offense resulted in serious bodily injuryor death, including serious bodily injury or death resulting from the use of the pre-retail medical product.

(iii) The offense involved a substantial amount of interest of any kind, financecharges, late fees, penalties, amounts based on an agreed-upon return or rateof return, or other similar costs, not included in the determination of loss for purposes of subsection (b)(1).

(iv) The offense created a risk of substantial loss beyond the loss determined for purposes of subsection (b)(1), such as a risk of a significant disruption of a national financial market.

(v) In a case involving stolen information from a “protected computer”, as definedin 18 U.S.C. § 1030(e)(2), the defendant sought the stolen information to further a broader criminal purpose.

(vi) In a case involving access devices or unlawfully produced or unlawfully obtained means of identification:(I) The offense caused substantial harm to the victim’s reputation, or the victim suffered a substantial inconvenience related to repairing the victim’s reputation.

(II) An individual whose means of identification the defendant used to obtain unlawful means of identification is erroneously arrested or denieda job because an arrest record has been made in that individual’s name.

(III) The defendant produced or obtained numerous means of identificationwith respect to one individual and essentially assumed that individual’sidentity.

(B) Upward Departure for Debilitating Impact on a Critical Infrastructure.—An upward departure would be warranted in a case in which subsection(b)(18)(A)(iii) applies and the disruption to the critical infrastructure(s) is so substantial as to have a debilitating impact on national security, national economicsecurity, national public health or safety, or any combination of those matters.

(C) Downward Departure Consideration.—There may be cases in which the offense level determined under this guideline substantially overstates the seriousness of the offense. In such cases, a downward departure may be warranted.

For example, a securities fraud involving a fraudulent statement made publicly tothe market may produce an aggregate loss amount that is substantial but diffuse, with relatively small loss amounts suffered by a relatively large number of victims.

In such a case, the loss table in subsection (b)(1) and the victims table in subsection(b)(2) may combine to produce an offense level that substantially overstates the seriousness of the offense. If so, a downward departure may be warranted.

§2B1.1(D) Downward Departure for Major Disaster or Emergency Victims.—If (i) the minimum offense level of level 12 in subsection (b)(12) applies; (ii) the defendantsustained damage, loss, hardship, or suffering caused by a major disaster or anemergency as those terms are defined in 42 U.S.C. § 5122; and (iii) the benefitsreceived illegally were only an extension or overpayment of benefits received legitimately, a downward departure may be warranted.

Background: This guideline covers offenses involving theft, stolen property, property damageor destruction, fraud, forgery, and counterfeiting (other than offenses involving altered orcounterfeit bearer obligations of the United States).

Because federal fraud statutes often are broadly written, a single pattern of offense conduct usually can be prosecuted under several code sections, as a result of which the offense ofconviction may be somewhat arbitrary. Furthermore, most fraud statutes cover a broad rangeof conduct with extreme variation in severity. The specific offense characteristics and crossreferences contained in this guideline are designed with these considerations in mind.

The Commission has determined that, ordinarily, the sentences of defendants convictedof federal offenses should reflect the nature and magnitude of the loss caused or intended bytheir crimes. Accordingly, along with other relevant factors under the guidelines, loss servesas a measure of the seriousness of the offense and the defendant’s relative culpability and is a principal factor in determining the offense level under this guideline.

Theft from the person of another, such as pickpocketing or non-forcible purse-snatching, receives an enhanced sentence because of the increased risk of physical injury. This guidelinedoes not include an enhancement for thefts from the person by means of force or fear; suchcrimes are robberies and are covered under §2B3.1 (Robbery).

A minimum offense level of level 14 is provided for offenses involving an organizedscheme to steal vehicles or vehicle parts. Typically, the scope of such activity is substantial, but the value of the property may be particularly difficult to ascertain in individual cases because the stolen property is rapidly resold or otherwise disposed of in the course of the offense.

Therefore, the specific offense characteristic of “organized scheme” is used as an alternative to“loss” in setting a minimum offense level.

Use of false pretenses involving charitable causes and government agencies enhances the sentences of defendants who take advantage of victims’ trust in government or law enforcement agencies or the generosity and charitable motives of victims. Taking advantage of a victim’s self-interest does not mitigate the seriousness of fraudulent conduct; rather, defendantswho exploit victims’ charitable impulses or trust in government create particular social harm.

In a similar vein, a defendant who has been subject to civil or administrative proceedings for the same or similar fraudulent conduct demonstrates aggravated criminal intent and is deserving of additional punishment for not conforming with the requirements of judicial processor orders issued by federal, state, or local administrative agencies.

Offenses that involve the use of financial transactions or financial accounts outside the United States in an effort to conceal illicit profits and criminal conduct involve a particularlyhigh level of sophistication and complexity. These offenses are difficult to detect and requirecostly investigations and prosecutions. Diplomatic processes often must be used to secure testimony and evidence beyond the jurisdiction of United States courts. Consequently, a minimum offense level of level 12 is provided for these offenses.

Subsection (b)(11)(C) implements the directive to the Commission in section 4 of the Identity Theft and Assumption Deterrence Act of 1998, Public Law 105–318. This subsection focuses principally on an aggravated form of identity theft known as “affirmative identity theft”or “breeding”, in which a defendant uses another individual’s name, social security number, orsome other form of identification (the “means of identification”) to “breed” (i.e., produce or obtain) new or additional forms of identification. Because 18 U.S.C. § 1028(d) broadly defines“means of identification”, the new or additional forms of identification can include items suchas a driver’s license, a credit card, or a bank loan. This subsection provides a minimum offenselevel of level 12, in part because of the seriousness of the offense. The minimum offense levelaccounts for the fact that the means of identification that were “bred” (i.e., produced or obtained) often are within the defendant’s exclusive control, making it difficult for the individualvictim to detect that the victim’s identity has been “stolen.” Generally, the victim does not become aware of the offense until certain harms have already occurred (e.g., a damaged creditrating or an inability to obtain a loan). The minimum offense level also accounts for the nonmonetary harm associated with these types of offenses, much of which may be difficult or impossible to quantify (e.g., harm to the individual’s reputation or credit rating, inconvenience, and other difficulties resulting from the offense). The legislative history of the Identity Theftand Assumption Deterrence Act of 1998 indicates that Congress was especially concerned with providing increased punishment for this type of harm.

§2B1.4CommentaryStatutory Provisions: 15 U.S.C. § 78j and 17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5. For additional statutoryprovision(s), see Appendix A (Statutory Index).

Application Notes:1. Application of Subsection (b)(2).—For purposes of subsection (b)(2), an “organizedscheme to engage in insider trading” means a scheme to engage in insider tradingthat involves considered, calculated, systematic, or repeated efforts to obtain and tradeon inside information, as distinguished from fortuitous or opportunistic instances of insider trading.

The following is a non-exhaustive list of factors that the court may consider in determining whether the offense involved an organized scheme to engage in insider trading:(A) the number of transactions;(B) the dollar value of the transactions;(C) the number of securities involved;(D) the duration of the offense;(E) the number of participants in the scheme (although such a scheme may exist evenin the absence of more than one participant);(F) the efforts undertaken to obtain material, nonpublic information;(G) the number of instances in which material, nonpublic information was obtained;and(H) the efforts undertaken to conceal the offense.

2. Application of §3B1.3.—Section 3B1.3 (Abuse of Position of Trust or Use of SpecialSkill) should be applied if the defendant occupied and abused a position of special trust.

Examples might include a corporate president or an attorney who misused informationregarding a planned but unannounced takeover attempt. It typically would not apply toan ordinary “tippee”.

Furthermore, §3B1.3 should be applied if the defendant’s employment in a position thatinvolved regular participation or professional assistance in creating, issuing, buying, selling, or trading securities or commodities was used to facilitate significantly the commission or concealment of the offense. It would apply, for example, to a hedge fund professional who regularly participates in securities transactions or to a lawyer who regularlyprovides professional assistance in securities transactions, if the defendant’s employmentin such a position was used to facilitate significantly the commission or concealment ofthe offense. It ordinarily would not apply to a position such as a clerical worker in aninvestment firm, because such a position ordinarily does not involve special skill.

See §3B1.3, comment. (n.4).

Background: This guideline applies to certain violations of Rule 10b-5 that are commonlyreferred to as “insider trading”. Insider trading is treated essentially as a sophisticated fraud.

Because the victims and their losses are difficult if not impossible to identify, the gain, i.e., the §2B1.5total increase in value realized through trading in securities by the defendant and personsacting in concert with the defendant or to whom the defendant provided inside information, is employed instead of the victims’ losses.

Certain other offenses, e.g., 7 U.S.C. § 13(e), that involve misuse of inside information for personal gain also appropriately may be covered by this guideline.

Subsection (b)(2) implements the directive to the Commission in section 1079A(a)(1)(A)of Public Law 111–203.

(E) “Human remains” (i) means the physical remains of the body of a human; and (ii)does not include remains that reasonably may be determined to have been freelydisposed of or naturally shed by the human from whose body the remains were obtained, such as hair made into ropes or nets.

(F) “Pre-Columbian monumental or architectural sculpture or mural” has the meaning given that term in 19 U.S.C. § 2095(3).

(G) “Sacred object” has the meaning given that term in 25 U.S.C. § 3001(3)(C)(see also 43 C.F.R. § 10.2(d)(3)).

5. Pecuniary Gain and Commercial Purpose Enhancement Under Subsection(b)(4).—(A) “For Pecuniary Gain”.—For purposes of subsection (b)(4), “for pecuniary gain”means for receipt of, or in anticipation of receipt of, anything of value, whethermonetary or in goods or services. Therefore, offenses committed for pecuniary gaininclude both monetary and barter transactions, as well as activities designed toincrease gross revenue.

(B) Commercial Purpose.—The acquisition of resources for display to the public, whether for a fee or donation and whether by an individual or an organization, including a governmental entity, a private non-profit organization, or a private forprofit organization, shall be considered to involve a “commercial purpose” for purposes of subsection (b)(4).

§2B1.66. Pattern of Misconduct Enhancement Under Subsection (b)(5).—(A) Definition.—For purposes of subsection (b)(5), “pattern of misconduct involving cultural heritage resources or paleontological resources” means two ormore separate instances of offense conduct involving a resource that did not occurduring the course of the offense (i.e., that did not occur during the course of the instant offense of conviction and all relevant conduct under §1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct)). Offense conduct involving a resource may be considered for purposes of subsection (b)(5) regardless of whether the defendant was convicted of that conduct.

(B) Computation of Criminal History Points.—A conviction taken into account under subsection (b)(5) is not excluded from consideration of whether that convictionreceives criminal history points pursuant to Chapter Four, Part A (Criminal History).

7. Dangerous Weapons Enhancement Under Subsection (b)(6).—For purposes ofsubsection (b)(6), “brandished” and “dangerous weapon” have the meaning giventhose terms in Application Note 1 of the Commentary to §1B1.1 (Application Instructions).

8. Multiple Counts.—For purposes of Chapter Three, Part D (Multiple Counts), multiplecounts involving offenses covered by this guideline are grouped together under subsection(d) of §3D1.2 (Groups of Closely Related Counts). Multiple counts involving offenses covered by this guideline and offenses covered by other guidelines are not to be groupedunder §3D1.2(d).

9. Upward Departure Provision.—There may be cases in which the offense level determined under this guideline substantially understates the seriousness of the offense. In such cases, an upward departure may be warranted. For example, an upward departuremay be warranted if (A) in addition to cultural heritage resources or paleontological resources, the offense involved theft of, damage to, or destruction of, items that are not cultural heritage resources (such as an offense involving the theft from a national cemetery of lawnmowers and other administrative property in addition to historic gravemarkers or other cultural heritage resources) or paleontological resources; or (B) the offenseinvolved a cultural heritage resource that has profound significance to cultural identity(e.g., the Statue of Liberty or the Liberty Bell).

§2B1.6. Aggravated Identity Theft(a) If the defendant was convicted of violating 18 U.S.C. § 1028A, the guideline sentence is the term of imprisonment required by statute.

Chapters Three (Adjustments) and Four (Criminal History andCriminal Livelihood) shall not apply to that count of conviction.

§2B2.1CommentaryStatutory Provision: 18 U.S.C. § 1028A. For additional statutory provision(s), see Appendix A (Statutory Index).

Application Notes:1. Imposition of Sentence.—(A) In General.—Section 1028A of title 18, United State Code, provides a mandatoryterm of imprisonment. Accordingly, the guideline sentence for a defendant convicted under 18 U.S.C. § 1028A is the term required by that statute. Except as provided in subdivision (B), 18 U.S.C. § 1028A also requires a term of imprisonmentimposed under this section to run consecutively to any other term of imprisonment.

(B) Multiple Convictions Under Section 1028A.—Section 1028A(b)(4) of title 18, United State Code, provides that in the case of multiple convictions under 18 U.S.C.

§ 1028A, the terms of imprisonment imposed on such counts may, in the discretionof the court, run concurrently, in whole or in part, with each other. See the Commentary to §5G1.2 (Sentencing on Multiple Counts of Conviction) for guidance regarding imposition of sentence on multiple counts of 18 U.S.C. § 1028A.

2. Inapplicability of Chapter Two Enhancement.—If a sentence under this guidelineis imposed in conjunction with a sentence for an underlying offense, do not apply anyspecific offense characteristic for the transfer, possession, or use of a means of identification when determining the sentence for the underlying offense. A sentence under this guideline accounts for this factor for the underlying offense of conviction, including anysuch enhancement that would apply based on conduct for which the defendant is accountable under §1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct). “Means of identification” has the meaninggiven that term in 18 U.S.C. § 1028(d)(7).

3. Inapplicability of Chapters Three and Four.—Do not apply Chapters Three (Adjustments) and Four (Criminal History and Criminal Livelihood) to any offense sentencedunder this guideline. Such offenses are excluded from application of those chapters because the guideline sentence for each offense is determined only by the relevant statute.

See §§3D1.1 (Procedure for Determining Offense Level on Multiple Counts) and 5G1.2.

CommentaryStatutory Provisions: 18 U.S.C. §§ 2113(a), 2115, 2117, 2118(b). For additional statutoryprovision(s), see Appendix A (Statutory Index).

Application Notes:1. “Firearm,” “destructive device,” and “dangerous weapon” are defined in the Commentary to §1B1.1 (Application Instructions).

2. “Loss” means the value of the property taken, damaged, or destroyed.

3. Subsection (b)(4) does not apply to possession of a dangerous weapon (including a firearm) that was stolen during the course of the offense.

4. More than Minimal Planning.—“More than minimal planning” means more planning than is typical for commission of the offense in a simple form. “More than minimalplanning” also exists if significant affirmative steps were taken to conceal the offense, other than conduct to which §3C1.1 (Obstructing or Impeding the Administration of Justice) applies. “More than minimal planning” shall be considered to be present in any caseinvolving repeated acts over a period of time, unless it is clear that each instance waspurely opportune. For example, checking the area to make sure no witnesses were present would not alone constitute more than minimal planning. By contrast, obtaining§2B2.3building plans to plot a particular course of entry, or disabling an alarm system, wouldconstitute more than minimal planning.

Background: The base offense level for residential burglary is higher than for other forms ofburglary because of the increased risk of physical and psychological injury. Weapon possession, but not use, is a specific offense characteristic because use of a weapon (including to threaten)ordinarily would make the offense robbery. Weapon use would be a ground for upward departure.

(c) Cross Reference(1) If a victim was killed under circumstances that would constitute murder under 18 U.S.C. § 1111 had such killing takenplace within the territorial or maritime jurisdiction of the United States, apply §2A1.1 (First Degree Murder).

CommentaryStatutory Provisions: 18 U.S.C. §§ 1951, 2113, 2114, 2118(a), 2119. For additional statutoryprovision(s), see Appendix A (Statutory Index).

Application Notes:1. “Firearm,” “destructive device,” “dangerous weapon,” “otherwise used,” “brandished,” “bodily injury,” “serious bodily injury,” “permanent or life-threateningbodily injury,” “abducted,” and “physically restrained” are defined in the Commentary to §1B1.1 (Application Instructions).

“Carjacking” means the taking or attempted taking of a motor vehicle from the personor presence of another by force and violence or by intimidation.

§2B3.12. Consistent with Application Note 1(D)(ii) of §1B1.1 (Application Instructions), an objectshall be considered to be a dangerous weapon for purposes of subsection (b)(2)(E) if(A) the object closely resembles an instrument capable of inflicting death or serious bodilyinjury; or (B) the defendant used the object in a manner that created the impression thatthe object was an instrument capable of inflicting death or serious bodily injury (e.g., a defendant wrapped a hand in a towel during a bank robbery to create the appearance ofa gun).

3. “Loss” means the value of the property taken, damaged, or destroyed.

4. The combined adjustments for weapon involvement and injury are limited to a maximumenhancement of 11 levels.

5. If the defendant intended to murder the victim, an upward departure may be warranted;see §2A2.1 (Assault with Intent to Commit Murder; Attempted Murder).

6. “A threat of death,” as used in subsection (b)(2)(F), may be in the form of an oral or written statement, act, gesture, or combination thereof. Accordingly, the defendant does not have to state expressly his intent to kill the victim in order for the enhancement to apply.

For example, an oral or written demand using words such as “Give me the money or Iwill kill you”, “Give me the money or I will pull the pin on the grenade I have in mypocket”, “Give me the money or I will shoot you”, “Give me your money or else (where the defendant draws his hand across his throat in a slashing motion)”, or “Give me the moneyor you are dead” would constitute a threat of death. The court should consider that the intent of this provision is to provide an increased offense level for cases in which the offender(s) engaged in conduct that would instill in a reasonable person, who is a victimof the offense, a fear of death.

Background: Possession or use of a weapon, physical injury, and unlawful restraint sometimes occur during a robbery. The guideline provides for a range of enhancements where thesefactors are present.

Although in pre-guidelines practice the amount of money taken in robbery cases affectedsentence length, its importance was small compared to that of the other harm involved. Moreover, because of the relatively high base offense level for robbery, an increase of 1 or 2 levelsbrings about a considerable increase in sentence length in absolute terms. Accordingly, the gradations for property loss increase more slowly than for simple property offenses.

The guideline provides an enhancement for robberies where a victim was forced to accompany the defendant to another location, or was physically restrained by being tied, bound, or locked up.

CommentaryStatutory Provisions: 18 U.S.C. §§ 875(b), 876, 877, 1030(a)(7), 1951. For additional statutory provision(s), see Appendix A (Statutory Index).

Application Notes:1. Definitions.—For purposes of this guideline:“Abducted,” “bodily injury,” “brandished,” “dangerous weapon,” “firearm,” “otherwise used,” “permanent or life-threatening bodily injury,” “physically restrained,” and “serious bodily injury” have the meaning given those terms in Application Note 1 of the Commentary to §1B1.1 (Application Instructions).

“Critical infrastructure” means systems and assets vital to national defense, nationalsecurity, economic security, public health or safety, or any combination of those matters.

A critical infrastructure may be publicly or privately owned. Examples of critical infrastructures include gas and oil production, storage, and delivery systems, water supplysystems, telecommunications networks, electrical power delivery systems, financing andbanking systems, emergency services (including medical, police, fire, and rescue services), transportation systems and services (including highways, mass transit, airlines, and airports), and government operations that provide essential services to the public.

“Government entity” has the meaning given that term in 18 U.S.C. § 1030(e)(9).

2. This guideline applies if there was any threat, express or implied, that reasonably couldbe interpreted as one to injure a person or physically damage property, or any comparablyserious threat, such as to drive an enterprise out of business. Even if the threat does not in itself imply violence, the possibility of violence or serious adverse consequences maybe inferred from the circumstances of the threat or the reputation of the person makingit. An ambiguous threat, such as “pay up or else,” or a threat to cause labor problems, ordinarily should be treated under this section.

§2B3.33. Guidelines for bribery involving public officials are found in Part C, Offenses InvolvingPublic Officials. “Extortion under color of official right,” which usually is solicitation of a bribe by a public official, is covered under §2C1.1 unless there is use of force or a threatthat qualifies for treatment under this section. Certain other extortion offenses are covered under the provisions of Part E, Offenses Involving Criminal Enterprises and Racketeering.

4. The combined adjustments for weapon involvement and injury are limited to a maximumenhancement of 11 levels.

5. “Loss to the victim,” as used in subsection (b)(2), means any demand paid plus anyadditional consequential loss from the offense (e.g., the cost of defensive measures takenin direct response to the offense).

6. In certain cases, an extortionate demand may be accompanied by conduct that does not qualify as a display of a dangerous weapon under subsection (b)(3)(A)(v) but is nonetheless similar in seriousness, demonstrating the defendant’s preparation or ability to carryout the threatened harm (e.g., an extortionate demand containing a threat to tamper with a consumer product accompanied by a workable plan showing how the product’s tamperresistant seals could be defeated, or a threat to kidnap a person accompanied by information showing study of that person’s daily routine). Subsection (b)(3)(B) addresses suchcases.

7. If the offense involved the threat of death or serious bodily injury to numerous victims(e.g., in the case of a plan to derail a passenger train or poison consumer products), anupward departure may be warranted.

8. If the offense involved organized criminal activity, or a threat to a family member of the victim, an upward departure may be warranted.

Background: The Hobbs Act, 18 U.S.C. § 1951, prohibits extortion, attempted extortion, andconspiracy to extort. It provides for a maximum term of imprisonment of twenty years.

18 U.S.C. §§ 875–877 prohibit communication of extortionate demands through variousmeans. The maximum penalty under these statutes varies from two to twenty years. Violationsof 18 U.S.C. § 875 involve threats or demands transmitted by interstate commerce. Violationsof 18 U.S.C. § 876 involve the use of the United States mails to communicate threats, whileviolations of 18 U.S.C. § 877 involve mailing threatening communications from foreign countries. This guideline also applies to offenses under 18 U.S.C. § 1030(a)(7) involving a threat toimpair the operation of a “protected computer.”###### Historical Note

Application Note:1. This section applies only to blackmail and similar forms of extortion where there clearlyis no threat of violence to person or property. “Blackmail” (18 U.S.C. § 873) is definedas a threat to disclose a violation of United States law unless money or some other itemof value is given.

Background: Under 18 U.S.C. § 873, the maximum term of imprisonment authorized for blackmail is one year. Extortionate threats to injure a reputation, or other threats that areless serious than those covered by §2B3.2, may also be prosecuted under 18 U.S.C. §§ 875–877, which carry higher maximum sentences.

Application Notes:1. This guideline covers commercial bribery offenses and kickbacks that do not involve officials of federal, state, or local government, foreign governments, or public internationalorganizations. See Part C, Offenses Involving Public Officials, if any such officials areinvolved.

§2B4.12. The “value of the improper benefit to be conferred” refers to the value of the actionto be taken or effected in return for the bribe. See Commentary to §2C1.1 (Offering, Giving, Soliciting, or Receiving a Bribe; Extortion Under Color of Official Right; Fraud Involving the Deprivation of the Intangible Right to Honest Services of Public Officials;Conspiracy to Defraud by Interference with Governmental Functions).

3. “Financial institution,” as used in this guideline, is defined to include any institutiondescribed in 18 U.S.C. §§ 20, 656, 657, 1005–1007, and 1014; any state or foreign bank, trust company, credit union, insurance company, investment company, mutual fund, savings (building and loan) association, union or employee pension fund; any health, medicalor hospital insurance association; brokers and dealers registered, or required to be registered, with the Securities and Exchange Commission; futures commodity merchants andcommodity pool operators registered, or required to be registered, with the CommodityFutures Trading Commission; and any similar entity, whether or not insured by the federal government. “Union or employee pension fund” and “any health, medical, or hospitalinsurance association,” as used above, primarily include large pension funds that servemany individuals (e.g., pension funds of large national and international organizations, unions, and corporations doing substantial interstate business), and associations thatundertake to provide pension, disability, or other benefits (e.g., medical or hospitalizationinsurance) to large numbers of persons.

4. Gross Receipts Enhancement under Subsection (b)(2)(A).—(A) In General.—For purposes of subsection (b)(2)(A), the defendant shall be considered to have derived more than $1,000,000 in gross receipts if the gross receipts tothe defendant individually, rather than to all participants, exceeded $1,000,000.

(B) Definition.—“Gross receipts from the offense” includes all property, real or personal, tangible or intangible, which is obtained directly or indirectly as a result ofsuch offense. See 18 U.S.C. § 982(a)(4).

5. Enhancement for Substantially Jeopardizing the Safety and Soundness of a Financial Institution under Subsection (b)(2)(B).—For purposes of subsection(b)(2)(B), an offense shall be considered to have substantially jeopardized the safety andsoundness of a financial institution if, as a consequence of the offense, the institution(A) became insolvent; (B) substantially reduced benefits to pensioners or insureds;(C) was unable on demand to refund fully any deposit, payment, or investment; (D) wasso depleted of its assets as to be forced to merge with another institution in order tocontinue active operations; or (E) was placed in substantial jeopardy of any of subdivisions (A) through (D) of this note.

6. If the defendant is convicted under 18 U.S.C. § 225 (relating to a continuing financialcrimes enterprise), the offense level is that applicable to the underlying series of offensescomprising the “continuing financial crimes enterprise.”Background: This guideline applies to violations of various federal bribery statutes that donot involve governmental officials. The base offense level is to be enhanced based upon the value of the unlawful payment or the value of the action to be taken or effected in return for the unlawful payment, whichever is greater.

One of the more commonly prosecuted offenses to which this guideline applies is offeringor accepting a fee in connection with procurement of a loan from a financial institution inviolation of 18 U.S.C. § 215.

§2B5.1As with non-commercial bribery, this guideline considers not only the amount of the bribebut also the value of the action received in return. Thus, for example, if a bank officer agreedto the offer of a $25,000 bribe to approve a $250,000 loan under terms for which the applicantwould not otherwise qualify, the court, in increasing the offense level, would use the greater ofthe $25,000 bribe, and the savings in interest over the life of the loan compared with alternative loan terms. If a gambler paid a player $5,000 to shave points in a nationally televisedbasketball game, the value of the action to the gambler would be the amount that he and his confederates won or stood to gain. If that amount could not be estimated, the amount of the bribe would be used to determine the appropriate increase in offense level.

This guideline also applies to making prohibited payments to induce the award of subcontracts on federal projects for which the maximum term of imprisonment authorized is tenyears. 41 U.S.C. §§ 8702, 8707. Violations of 42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7b involve the offer or acceptance of a payment to refer an individual for services or items paid for under a federal health care program (e.g., the Medicare and Medicaid programs).

This guideline also applies to violations of law involving bribes and kickbacks in expensesincurred for a presidential nominating convention or presidential election campaign. These offenses are prohibited under 26 U.S.C. §§ 9012(e) and 9042(d), which apply to candidates for President and Vice President whose campaigns are eligible for federal matching funds.

This guideline also applies to violations of 18 U.S.C. § 224, sports bribery, as well ascertain violations of the Interstate Commerce Act.

CommentaryStatutory Provisions: 18 U.S.C. §§ 470–474A, 476, 477, 500, 501, 1003. For additional statutory provision(s), see Appendix A (Statutory Index).

Application Notes:1. Definitions.—For purposes of this guideline:“Counterfeit” refers to an instrument that has been falsely made, manufactured, or altered. For example, an instrument that has been falsely made or manufactured in itsentirety is “counterfeit”, as is a genuine instrument that has been falsely altered (suchas a genuine $5 bill that has been altered to appear to be a genuine $100 bill).

“Distinctive counterfeit deterrent” and “distinctive paper” have the meaning giventhose terms in 18 U.S.C. § 474A(c)(2) and (1), respectively.

“United States” means each of the fifty states, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the United States Virgin Islands, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, and American Samoa.

§2B5.32. Applicability to Counterfeit Bearer Obligations of the United States.—This guideline applies to counterfeiting of United States currency and coins, food stamps, postage stamps, treasury bills, bearer bonds and other items that generally could be describedas bearer obligations of the United States, i.e., that are not made out to a specific payee.

3. Inapplicability to Certain Obviously Counterfeit Items.—Subsection (b)(2)(A) doesnot apply to persons who produce items that are so obviously counterfeit that they areunlikely to be accepted even if subjected to only minimal scrutiny.

Background: Possession of counterfeiting devices to copy obligations (including securities) ofthe United States is treated as an aggravated form of counterfeiting because of the sophistication and planning involved in manufacturing counterfeit obligations and the public policy interest in protecting the integrity of government obligations. Similarly, an enhancement is provided for a defendant who produces, rather than merely passes, the counterfeit items.

Subsection (b)(4) implements, in a broader form, the instruction to the Commission insection 110512 of Public Law 103–322.

CommentaryStatutory Provisions: 17 U.S.C. §§ 506(a), 1201, 1204; 18 U.S.C. §§ 2318–2320, 2511. Foradditional statutory provision(s), see Appendix A (Statutory Index).

Application Notes:1. Definitions.—For purposes of this guideline:“Circumvention devices” are devices used to perform the activity described in 17 U.S.C.

§§ 1201(a)(3)(A) and 1201(b)(2)(A).

“Commercial advantage or private financial gain” means the receipt, or expectation of receipt, of anything of value, including other protected works.

“Counterfeit drug” has the meaning given that term in 18 U.S.C. § 2320(f)(6).

“Counterfeit military good or service” has the meaning given that term in 18 U.S.C.

§ 2320(f)(4).

“Infringed item” means the copyrighted or trademarked item with respect to which the crime against intellectual property was committed.

“Infringing item” means the item that violates the copyright or trademark laws.

§2B5.3“Uploading” means making an infringing item available on the Internet or a similarelectronic bulletin board with the intent to enable other persons to (A) download or otherwise copy the infringing item; or (B) have access to the infringing item, including bystoring the infringing item as an openly shared file. “Uploading” does not include merelydownloading or installing an infringing item on a hard drive on a defendant’s personalcomputer unless the infringing item is an openly shared file.

“Work being prepared for commercial distribution” has the meaning given thatterm in 17 U.S.C. § 506(a)(3).

2. Determination of Infringement Amount.—This note applies to the determination ofthe infringement amount for purposes of subsection (b)(1).

(A) Use of Retail Value of Infringed Item.—The infringement amount is the retailvalue of the infringed item, multiplied by the number of infringing items, in a caseinvolving any of the following:(i) The infringing item (I) is, or appears to a reasonably informed purchaser tobe, identical or substantially equivalent to the infringed item; or (II) is a digital or electronic reproduction of the infringed item.

(ii) The retail price of the infringing item is not less than 75% of the retail priceof the infringed item.

(iii) The retail value of the infringing item is difficult or impossible to determinewithout unduly complicating or prolonging the sentencing proceeding.

(iv) The offense involves the illegal interception of a satellite cable transmissionin violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2511. (In a case involving such an offense, the “retailvalue of the infringed item” is the price the user of the transmission wouldhave paid to lawfully receive that transmission, and the “infringed item” is the satellite transmission rather than the intercepting device.)(v) The retail value of the infringed item provides a more accurate assessment ofthe pecuniary harm to the copyright or trademark owner than does the retailvalue of the infringing item.

(vi) The offense involves the display, performance, publication, reproduction, ordistribution of a work being prepared for commercial distribution. In a caseinvolving such an offense, the “retail value of the infringed item” is the valueof that item upon its initial commercial distribution.

(vii) A case under 18 U.S.C. § 2318 or § 2320 that involves a counterfeit label, patch, sticker, wrapper, badge, emblem, medallion, charm, box, container, can, case, hangtag, documentation, or packaging of any type or nature (I) thathas not been affixed to, or does not enclose or accompany a good or service;and (II) which, had it been so used, would appear to a reasonably informedpurchaser to be affixed to, enclosing or accompanying an identifiable, genuinegood or service. In such a case, the “infringed item” is the identifiable, genuinegood or service.

(viii) A case under 17 U.S.C. §§ 1201 and 1204 in which the defendant used a circumvention device. In such an offense, the “retail value of the infringed item”§2B5.3is the price the user would have paid to access lawfully the copyrighted work, and the “infringed item” is the accessed work.

(B) Use of Retail Value of Infringing Item.—The infringement amount is the retailvalue of the infringing item, multiplied by the number of infringing items, in anycase not covered by subdivision (A) of this Application Note, including a case involving the unlawful recording of a musical performance in violation of 18 U.S.C.

§ 2319A.

(C) Retail Value Defined.—For purposes of this Application Note, the “retail value”of an infringed item or an infringing item is the retail price of that item in the market in which it is sold.

(D) Determination of Infringement Amount in Cases Involving a Variety of Infringing Items.—In a case involving a variety of infringing items, the infringement amount is the sum of all calculations made for those items under subdivisions(A) and (B) of this Application Note. For example, if the defendant sold both counterfeit videotapes that are identical in quality to the infringed videotapes and obviously inferior counterfeit handbags, the infringement amount, for purposes of subsection (b)(1), is the sum of the infringement amount calculated with respect to the counterfeit videotapes under subdivision (A)(i) (i.e., the quantity of the infringingvideotapes multiplied by the retail value of the infringed videotapes) and the infringement amount calculated with respect to the counterfeit handbags under subdivision (B) (i.e., the quantity of the infringing handbags multiplied by the retailvalue of the infringing handbags).

(E) Indeterminate Number of Infringing Items.—In a case in which the court cannot determine the number of infringing items, the court need only make a reasonable estimate of the infringement amount using any relevant information, includingfinancial records.

3. Application of Subsection (b)(7).—In subsection (b)(7), “other significant harm toa member of the Armed Forces” means significant harm other than serious bodily injury or death. In a case in which the offense involved a counterfeit military good or servicethe use, malfunction, or failure of which is likely to cause serious bodily injury or death, subsection (b)(6)(A) (conscious or reckless risk of serious bodily injury or death) wouldapply.

4. Application of §3B1.3.—If the defendant de-encrypted or otherwise circumvented a technological security measure to gain initial access to an infringed item, an adjustmentunder §3B1.3 (Abuse of Position of Trust or Use of Special Skill) may apply.

5. Departure Considerations.—If the offense level determined under this guideline substantially understates or overstates the seriousness of the offense, a departure may bewarranted. The following is a non-exhaustive list of factors that the court may considerin determining whether a departure may be warranted:(A) The offense involved substantial harm to the reputation of the copyright or trademark owner.

(B) The offense was committed in connection with, or in furtherance of, the criminal activities of a national, or international, organized criminal enterprise.

§2B5.4(C) The method used to calculate the infringement amount is based upon a formula orextrapolation that results in an estimated amount that may substantially exceedthe actual pecuniary harm to the copyright or trademark owner.

(D) The offense resulted in death or serious bodily injury.

Background: This guideline treats copyright and trademark violations much like theft andfraud. Similar to the sentences for theft and fraud offenses, the sentences for defendants convicted of intellectual property offenses should reflect the nature and magnitude of the pecuniary harm caused by their crimes. Accordingly, similar to the loss enhancement in the theft andfraud guideline, the infringement amount in subsection (b)(1) serves as a principal factor indetermining the offense level for intellectual property offenses.

Subsection (b)(1) implements section 2(g) of the No Electronic Theft (NET) Act of 1997, Pub. L. 105–147, by using the retail value of the infringed item, multiplied by the number ofinfringing items, to determine the pecuniary harm for cases in which use of the retail value ofthe infringed item is a reasonable estimate of that harm. For cases referred to in ApplicationNote 2(B), the Commission determined that use of the retail value of the infringed item wouldoverstate the pecuniary harm or otherwise be inappropriate. In these types of cases, use of the retail value of the infringing item, multiplied by the number of those items, is a more reasonable estimate of the resulting pecuniary harm.

Subsection (b)(5) implements the directive to the Commission in section 717 of PublicLaw 112–144.

Section 2511 of title 18, United States Code, as amended by the Electronic Communications Act of 1986, prohibits the interception of satellite transmission for purposes of direct orindirect commercial advantage or private financial gain. Such violations are similar to copyright offenses and are therefore covered by this guideline.

2. More than One Bribe or Extortion.—Subsection (b)(1) provides an adjustment for offenses involving more than one incident of either bribery or extortion. Related payments that, in essence, constitute a single incident of bribery or extortion (e.g., a numberof installment payments for a single action) are to be treated as a single bribe or extortion, even if charged in separate counts.

In a case involving more than one incident of bribery or extortion, the applicable amountsunder subsection (b)(2) (i.e., the greatest of the value of the payment, the benefit receivedor to be received, the value of anything obtained or to be obtained by a public official orothers acting with a public official, or the loss to the government) are determined separately for each incident and then added together.

3. Application of Subsection (b)(2).—“Loss”, for purposes of subsection (b)(2), shall bedetermined in accordance with Application Note 3 of the Commentary to §2B1.1 (Theft, Property Destruction, and Fraud). The value of “the benefit received or to be received”means the net value of such benefit. Examples: (A) A government employee, in returnfor a $500 bribe, reduces the price of a piece of surplus property offered for sale by the government from $10,000 to $2,000; the value of the benefit received is $8,000. (B) A$150,000 contract on which $20,000 profit was made was awarded in return for a bribe;the value of the benefit received is $20,000. Do not deduct the value of the bribe itself incomputing the value of the benefit received or to be received. In the preceding examples, therefore, the value of the benefit received would be the same regardless of the value ofthe bribe.

4. Application of Subsection (b)(3).—(A) Definition.—“High-level decision-making or sensitive position” means a position characterized by a direct authority to make decisions for, or on behalf of, a government department, agency, or other government entity, or by a substantialinfluence over the decision-making process.

§2C1.1(B) Examples.—Examples of a public official in a high-level decision-making positioninclude a prosecuting attorney, a judge, an agency administrator, and any otherpublic official with a similar level of authority. Examples of a public official whoholds a sensitive position include a juror, a law enforcement officer, an election official, and any other similarly situated individual.

5. Application of Subsection (c).—For the purposes of determining whether to apply the cross references in this section, the “resulting offense level” means the final offenselevel (i.e., the offense level determined by taking into account both the Chapter Two offense level and any applicable adjustments from Chapter Three, Parts A–D).

See §1B1.5(d); Application Note 2 of the Commentary to §1B1.5 (Interpretation of References to Other Offense Guidelines).

6. Inapplicability of §3B1.3.—Do not apply §3B1.3 (Abuse of Position of Trust or Use ofSpecial Skill).

7. Upward Departure Provisions.—In some cases the monetary value of the unlawfulpayment may not be known or may not adequately reflect the seriousness of the offense.

For example, a small payment may be made in exchange for the falsification of inspectionrecords for a shipment of defective parachutes or the destruction of evidence in a majornarcotics case. In part, this issue is addressed by the enhancements in §2C1.1(b)(2) and(c)(1), (2), and (3). However, in cases in which the seriousness of the offense is still not adequately reflected, an upward departure is warranted. See Chapter Five, Part K (Departures).

In a case in which the court finds that the defendant’s conduct was part of a systematicor pervasive corruption of a governmental function, process, or office that may cause lossof public confidence in government, an upward departure may be warranted. See §5K2.7(Disruption of Governmental Function).

Background: This section applies to a person who offers or gives a bribe for a corrupt purpose, such as inducing a public official to participate in a fraud or to influence such individual’sofficial actions, or to a public official who solicits or accepts such a bribe.

The object and nature of a bribe may vary widely from case to case. In some cases, the object may be commercial advantage (e.g., preferential treatment in the award of a governmentcontract). In others, the object may be issuance of a license to which the recipient is not entitled. In still others, the object may be the obstruction of justice. Consequently, a guideline for the offense must be designed to cover diverse situations.

In determining the net value of the benefit received or to be received, the value of the bribe is not deducted from the gross value of such benefit; the harm is the same regardless ofvalue of the bribe paid to receive the benefit. In a case in which the value of the bribe exceedsthe value of the benefit, or in which the value of the benefit cannot be determined, the valueof the bribe is used because it is likely that the payer of such a bribe expected something inreturn that would be worth more than the value of the bribe. Moreover, for deterrence purposes, the punishment should be commensurate with the gain to the payer or the recipient ofthe bribe, whichever is greater.

Under §2C1.1(b)(3), if the payment was for the purpose of influencing an official act bycertain officials, the offense level is increased by 4 levels.

Under §2C1.1(c)(1), if the payment was to facilitate the commission of another criminal offense, the guideline applicable to a conspiracy to commit that other offense will apply if the §2C1.2result is greater than that determined above. For example, if a bribe was given to a law enforcement officer to allow the smuggling of a quantity of cocaine, the guideline for conspiracyto import cocaine would be applied if it resulted in a greater offense level.

Under §2C1.1(c)(2), if the payment was to conceal another criminal offense or obstructjustice in respect to another criminal offense, the guideline from §2X3.1 (Accessory After the Fact) or §2J1.2 (Obstruction of Justice), as appropriate, will apply if the result is greater than that determined above. For example, if a bribe was given for the purpose of concealing the offense of espionage, the guideline for accessory after the fact to espionage would be applied.

Under §2C1.1(c)(3), if the offense involved forcible extortion, the guideline from §2B3.2(Extortion by Force or Threat of Injury or Serious Damage) will apply if the result is greaterthan that determined above.

Section 2C1.1 also applies to offenses under 15 U.S.C. §§ 78dd-1, 78dd-2, and 78dd-3.

Such offenses generally involve a payment to a foreign public official, candidate for public office, or agent or intermediary, with the intent to influence an official act or decision of a foreigngovernment or political party. Typically, a case prosecuted under these provisions will involvean intent to influence governmental action.

Section 2C1.1 also applies to fraud involving the deprivation of the intangible right tohonest services of government officials under 18 U.S.C. §§ 1341–1343 and conspiracy to defraud by interference with governmental functions under 18 U.S.C. § 371. Such fraud offensestypically involve an improper use of government influence that harms the operation of government in a manner similar to bribery offenses.

Offenses involving attempted bribery are frequently not completed because the offenseis reported to authorities or an individual involved in the offense is acting in an undercovercapacity. Failure to complete the offense does not lessen the defendant’s culpability in attempting to use public position for personal gain. Therefore, solicitations and attempts are treatedas equivalent to the underlying offense.

*Notes to Drug Quantity Table:(A) Unless otherwise specified, the weight of a controlled substance set forth inthe table refers to the entire weight of any mixture or substance containing a detectable amount of the controlled substance. If a mixture or substance contains more than one controlled substance, the weight of the entire mixture orsubstance is assigned to the controlled substance that results in the greateroffense level.

(B) The terms “PCP (actual)”, “Amphetamine (actual)”, and “Methamphetamine (actual)” refer to the weight of the controlled substance, itself, contained in the mixture or substance. For example, a mixture weighing10 grams containing PCP at 50% purity contains 5 grams of PCP (actual). In the case of a mixture or substance containing PCP, amphetamine, or methamphetamine, use the offense level determined by the entire weight of the mixture or substance, or the offense level determined by the weight of the PCP (actual), amphetamine (actual), or methamphetamine (actual), whichever is greater.

The terms “Hydrocodone (actual)” and “Oxycodone (actual)” refer to the weight of the controlled substance, itself, contained in the pill, capsule, ormixture.

(C) “Ice,” for the purposes of this guideline, means a mixture or substance containing d-methamphetamine hydrochloride of at least 80% purity.

(D) “Cocaine base,” for the purposes of this guideline, means “crack.” “Crack”is the street name for a form of cocaine base, usually prepared by processingcocaine hydrochloride and sodium bicarbonate, and usually appearing in a lumpy, rocklike form.

(E) In the case of an offense involving marihuana plants, treat each plant, regardless of sex, as equivalent to 100 grams of marihuana. Provided, however, that if the actual weight of the marihuana is greater, use the actual weightof the marihuana.

§2D1.1(F) In the case of Schedule I or II Depressants (except gamma-hydroxybutyricacid), Schedule III substances, Schedule IV substances, and Schedule V substances, one “unit” means one pill, capsule, or tablet. If the substance (exceptgamma-hydroxybutyric acid) is in liquid form, one “unit” means 0.5 milliliters. For an anabolic steroid that is not in a pill, capsule, tablet, or liquid form(e.g., patch, topical cream, aerosol), the court shall determine the base offenselevel using a reasonable estimate of the quantity of anabolic steroid involvedin the offense. In making a reasonable estimate, the court shall consider thateach 25 milligrams of an anabolic steroid is one “unit”.

(G) In the case of LSD on a carrier medium (e.g., a sheet of blotter paper), do not use the weight of the LSD/carrier medium. Instead, treat each dose of LSDon the carrier medium as equal to 0.4 milligrams of LSD for the purposes ofthe Drug Quantity Table.

(H) Hashish, for the purposes of this guideline, means a resinous substance ofcannabis that includes (i) one or more of the tetrahydrocannabinols (as listedin 21 C.F.R. § 1308.11(d)(31)), (ii) at least two of the following: cannabinol, cannabidiol, or cannabichromene, and (iii) fragments of plant material (suchas cystolith fibers).

(I) Hashish oil, for the purposes of this guideline, means a preparation of the soluble cannabinoids derived from cannabis that includes (i) one or more ofthe tetrahydrocannabinols (as listed in 21 C.F.R. § 1308.11(d)(31)), (ii) atleast two of the following: cannabinol, cannabidiol, or cannabichromene, and(iii) is essentially free of plant material (e.g., plant fragments). Typically, hashish oil is a viscous, dark colored oil, but it can vary from a dry resin to a colorless liquid.

CommentaryStatutory Provisions: 21 U.S.C. §§ 841(a), (b)(1)–(3), (7), (g), 860a, 865, 960(a), (b); 49 U.S.C.

§ 46317(b). For additional statutory provision(s), see Appendix A (Statutory Index).

Application Notes:1. “Mixture or Substance”.—“Mixture or substance” as used in this guideline has the same meaning as in 21 U.S.C. § 841, except as expressly provided. Mixture or substancedoes not include materials that must be separated from the controlled substance beforethe controlled substance can be used. Examples of such materials include the fiberglassin a cocaine/ fiberglass bonded suitcase, beeswax in a cocaine/beeswax statue, and wastewater from an illicit laboratory used to manufacture a controlled substance. If such material cannot readily be separated from the mixture or substance that appropriately is counted in the Drug Quantity Table, the court may use any reasonable method to approximate the weight of the mixture or substance to be counted.

An upward departure nonetheless may be warranted when the mixture or substancecounted in the Drug Quantity Table is combined with other, non-countable material inan unusually sophisticated manner in order to avoid detection.

§2D1.1Similarly, in the case of marihuana having a moisture content that renders the marihuana unsuitable for consumption without drying (this might occur, for example, with a bale of rain-soaked marihuana or freshly harvested marihuana that had not been dried), an approximation of the weight of the marihuana without such excess moisture contentis to be used.

2. “Plant”.—For purposes of the guidelines, a “plant” is an organism having leaves and a readily observable root formation (e.g., a marihuana cutting having roots, a rootball, orroot hairs is a marihuana plant).

3. Classification of Controlled Substances.—Certain pharmaceutical preparations areclassified as Schedule III, IV, or V controlled substances by the Drug Enforcement Administration under 21 C.F.R. § 1308.13–15 even though they contain a small amount ofa Schedule I or II controlled substance. For example, Tylenol 3 is classified as a ScheduleIII controlled substance even though it contains a small amount of codeine, a Schedule IIopiate. For the purposes of the guidelines, the classification of the controlled substanceunder 21 C.F.R. § 1308.13–15 is the appropriate classification.

4. Applicability to “Counterfeit” Substances.—The statute and guideline also apply to“counterfeit” substances, which are defined in 21 U.S.C. § 802 to mean controlled substances that are falsely labeled so as to appear to have been legitimately manufacturedor distributed.

5. Determining Drug Types and Drug Quantities.—Types and quantities of drugs not specified in the count of conviction may be considered in determining the offense level.

See §1B1.3(a)(2) (Relevant Conduct). Where there is no drug seizure or the amount seizeddoes not reflect the scale of the offense, the court shall approximate the quantity of the controlled substance. In making this determination, the court may consider, for example, the price generally obtained for the controlled substance, financial or other records, similar transactions in controlled substances by the defendant, and the size or capability ofany laboratory involved.

If the offense involved both a substantive drug offense and an attempt or conspiracy(e.g., sale of five grams of heroin and an attempt to sell an additional ten grams of heroin), the total quantity involved shall be aggregated to determine the scale of the offense.

In an offense involving an agreement to sell a controlled substance, the agreed-uponquantity of the controlled substance shall be used to determine the offense level unlessthe sale is completed and the amount delivered more accurately reflects the scale of the offense. For example, a defendant agrees to sell 500 grams of cocaine, the transaction is completed by the delivery of the controlled substance — actually 480 grams of cocaine, and no further delivery is scheduled. In this example, the amount delivered more accurately reflects the scale of the offense. In contrast, in a reverse sting, the agreed-uponquantity of the controlled substance would more accurately reflect the scale of the offensebecause the amount actually delivered is controlled by the government, not by the defendant. If, however, the defendant establishes that the defendant did not intend to provide or purchase, or was not reasonably capable of providing or purchasing, the agreedupon quantity of the controlled substance, the court shall exclude from the offense leveldetermination the amount of controlled substance that the defendant establishes thatthe defendant did not intend to provide or purchase or was not reasonably capable ofproviding or purchasing.

§2D1.16. Analogues and Controlled Substances Not Referenced in this Guideline.—Anyreference to a particular controlled substance in these guidelines includes all salts, isomers, all salts of isomers, and, except as otherwise provided, any analogue of that controlled substance. Any reference to cocaine includes ecgonine and coca leaves, except extracts of coca leaves from which cocaine and ecgonine have been removed. For purposesof this guideline “analogue” has the meaning given the term “controlled substance analogue” in 21 U.S.C. § 802(32). In determining the appropriate sentence, the court alsomay consider whether the same quantity of analogue produces a greater effect on the central nervous system than the controlled substance for which it is an analogue.

In the case of a controlled substance that is not specifically referenced in this guideline, determine the base offense level using the marihuana equivalency of the most closelyrelated controlled substance referenced in this guideline. In determining the most closelyrelated controlled substance, the court shall, to the extent practicable, consider the following:(A) Whether the controlled substance not referenced in this guideline has a chemicalstructure that is substantially similar to a controlled substance referenced in this guideline.

(B) Whether the controlled substance not referenced in this guideline has a stimulant, depressant, or hallucinogenic effect on the central nervous system that is substantially similar to the stimulant, depressant, or hallucinogenic effect on the centralnervous system of a controlled substance referenced in this guideline.

(C) Whether a lesser or greater quantity of the controlled substance not referenced inthis guideline is needed to produce a substantially similar effect on the central nervous system as a controlled substance referenced in this guideline.

7. Multiple Transactions or Multiple Drug Types.—Where there are multiple transactions or multiple drug types, the quantities of drugs are to be added. Tables for makingthe necessary conversions are provided below.

8. Use of Drug Equivalency Tables.—(A) Controlled Substances Not Referenced in Drug Quantity Table.—The Commission has used the sentences provided in, and equivalences derived from, the statute (21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)), as the primary basis for the guideline sentences. Thestatute, however, provides direction only for the more common controlled substances, i.e., heroin, cocaine, PCP, methamphetamine, fentanyl, LSD and marihuana. In the case of a controlled substance that is not specifically referenced in the Drug Quantity Table, determine the base offense level as follows:(i) Use the Drug Equivalency Tables to convert the quantity of the controlledsubstance involved in the offense to its equivalent quantity of marihuana.

(ii) Find the equivalent quantity of marihuana in the Drug Quantity Table.

(iii) Use the offense level that corresponds to the equivalent quantity of marihuana as the base offense level for the controlled substance involved in the offense.

(See also Application Note 6.) For example, in the Drug Equivalency Tables set forthin this Note, 1 gram of a substance containing oxymorphone, a Schedule I opiate, §2D1.1converts to an equivalent quantity of 5 kilograms of marihuana. In a case involving100 grams of oxymorphone, the equivalent quantity of marihuana would be 500 kilograms, which corresponds to a base offense level of 26 in the Drug Quantity Table.

(B) Combining Differing Controlled Substances.—The Drug Equivalency Tablesalso provide a means for combining differing controlled substances to obtain a singleoffense level. In each case, convert each of the drugs to its marihuana equivalent, add the quantities, and look up the total in the Drug Quantity Table to obtain the combined offense level.

For certain types of controlled substances, the marihuana equivalencies in the DrugEquivalency Tables are “capped” at specified amounts (e.g., the combined equivalent weight of all Schedule V controlled substances shall not exceed 2.49 kilogramsof marihuana). Where there are controlled substances from more than one schedule(e.g., a quantity of a Schedule IV substance and a quantity of a Schedule V substance), determine the marihuana equivalency for each schedule separately (subjectto the cap, if any, applicable to that schedule). Then add the marihuana equivalencies to determine the combined marihuana equivalency (subject to the cap, if any, applicable to the combined amounts).

Note: Because of the statutory equivalences, the ratios in the Drug EquivalencyTables do not necessarily reflect dosages based on pharmacological equivalents.

(C) Examples for Combining Differing Controlled Substances.—(i) The defendant is convicted of selling 70 grams of a substance containing PCP(Level 20) and 250 milligrams of a substance containing LSD (Level 16). ThePCP converts to 70 kilograms of marihuana; the LSD converts to 25 kilogramsof marihuana. The total is therefore equivalent to 95 kilograms of marihuana, for which the Drug Quantity Table provides an offense level of 22.

(ii) The defendant is convicted of selling 500 grams of marihuana (Level 6) and10,000 units of diazepam (Level 6). The diazepam, a Schedule IV drug, is equivalent to 625 grams of marihuana. The total, 1.125 kilograms of marihuana, has an offense level of 8 in the Drug Quantity Table.

(iii) The defendant is convicted of selling 80 grams of cocaine (Level 14) and2 grams of cocaine base (Level 12). The cocaine is equivalent to 16 kilogramsof marihuana, and the cocaine base is equivalent to 7.142 kilograms of marihuana. The total is therefore equivalent to 23.142 kilograms of marihuana, which has an offense level of 16 in the Drug Quantity Table.

(iv) The defendant is convicted of selling 76,000 units of a Schedule III substance, 200,000 units of a Schedule IV substance, and 600,000 units of a Schedule Vsubstance. The marihuana equivalency for the Schedule III substance is 76 kilograms of marihuana (below the cap of 79.99 kilograms of marihuana set forth as the maximum equivalent weight for Schedule III substances). Themarihuana equivalency for the Schedule IV substance is subject to a cap of9.99 kilograms of marihuana set forth as the maximum equivalent weight for Schedule IV substances (without the cap it would have been 12.5 kilograms).

The marihuana equivalency for the Schedule V substance is subject to the capof 2.49 kilograms of marihuana set forth as the maximum equivalent weightfor Schedule V substances (without the cap it would have been 3.75 kilograms). The combined equivalent weight, determined by adding together the §2D1.1above amounts, is subject to the cap of 79.99 kilograms of marihuana set forthas the maximum combined equivalent weight for Schedule III, IV, and V substances. Without the cap, the combined equivalent weight would have been88.48 (76 + 9.99 + 2.49) kilograms.

§2D1.19. Determining Quantity Based on Doses, Pills, or Capsules.—If the number of doses, pills, or capsules but not the weight of the controlled substance is known, multiply the number of doses, pills, or capsules by the typical weight per dose in the table below toestimate the total weight of the controlled substance (e.g., 100 doses of Mescaline at500 milligrams per dose = 50 grams of mescaline). The Typical Weight Per Unit Table, prepared from information provided by the Drug Enforcement Administration, displaysthe typical weight per dose, pill, or capsule for certain controlled substances. Do not usethis table if any more reliable estimate of the total weight is available from case-specificinformation.

Therefore, use of this table provides a very conservative estimate of the total weight.

10. Determining Quantity of LSD.—LSD on a blotter paper carrier medium typically is marked so that the number of doses (“hits”) per sheet readily can be determined. Whenthis is not the case, it is to be presumed that each 1/4 inch by 1/4 inch section of the blotter paper is equal to one dose.

In the case of liquid LSD (LSD that has not been placed onto a carrier medium), usingthe weight of the LSD alone to calculate the offense level may not adequately reflect the seriousness of the offense. In such a case, an upward departure may be warranted.

11. Application of Subsections (b)(1) and (b)(2).—(A) Application of Subsection (b)(1).—Definitions of “firearm” and “dangerousweapon” are found in the Commentary to §1B1.1 (Application Instructions). Theenhancement for weapon possession in subsection (b)(1) reflects the increased danger of violence when drug traffickers possess weapons. The enhancement should be§2D1.1applied if the weapon was present, unless it is clearly improbable that the weaponwas connected with the offense. For example, the enhancement would not be applied if the defendant, arrested at the defendant’s residence, had an unloaded hunting rifle in the closet. The enhancement also applies to offenses that are referencedto §2D1.1; see §§2D1.2(a)(1) and (2), 2D1.5(a)(1), 2D1.6, 2D1.7(b)(1), 2D1.8, 2D1.11(c)(1), and 2D1.12(c)(1).

(B) Interaction of Subsections (b)(1) and (b)(2).—The enhancements in subsections (b)(1) and (b)(2) may be applied cumulatively (added together), as is generallythe case when two or more specific offense characteristics each apply. See §1B1.1(Application Instructions), Application Note 4(A). However, in a case in which the defendant merely possessed a dangerous weapon but did not use violence, make a credible threat to use violence, or direct the use of violence, subsection (b)(2) wouldnot apply.

12. Application of Subsection (b)(5).—If the offense involved importation of amphetamine or methamphetamine, and an adjustment from subsection (b)(3) applies, do not apply subsection (b)(5).

13. Application of Subsection (b)(7).—For purposes of subsection (b)(7), “mass-marketing by means of an interactive computer service” means the solicitation, by meansof an interactive computer service, of a large number of persons to induce those personsto purchase a controlled substance. For example, subsection (b)(7) would apply to a defendant who operated a web site to promote the sale of Gamma-hydroxybutyric Acid(GHB) but would not apply to coconspirators who use an interactive computer serviceonly to communicate with one another in furtherance of the offense. “Interactive computer service”, for purposes of subsection (b)(7) and this note, has the meaning giventhat term in section 230(e)(2) of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. § 230(f)(2)).

14. Application of Subsection (b)(8).—For purposes of subsection (b)(8), “maskingagent” means a substance that, when taken before, after, or in conjunction with an anabolic steroid, prevents the detection of the anabolic steroid in an individual’s body.

15. Application of Subsection (b)(9).—For purposes of subsection (b)(9), “athlete” meansan individual who participates in an athletic activity conducted by (A) an intercollegiateathletic association or interscholastic athletic association; (B) a professional athletic association; or (C) an amateur athletic organization.

16. Application of Subsection (b)(11).—Subsection (b)(11) does not apply if the purposeof the bribery was to obstruct or impede the investigation, prosecution, or sentencing ofthe defendant. Such conduct is covered by §3C1.1 (Obstructing or Impeding the Administration of Justice) and, if applicable, §2D1.1(b)(15)(D).

17. Application of Subsection (b)(12).—Subsection (b)(12) applies to a defendant whoknowingly maintains a premises (i.e., a building, room, or enclosure) for the purpose ofmanufacturing or distributing a controlled substance, including storage of a controlledsubstance for the purpose of distribution.

Among the factors the court should consider in determining whether the defendant“maintained” the premises are (A) whether the defendant held a possessory interest in(e.g., owned or rented) the premises and (B) the extent to which the defendant controlledaccess to, or activities at, the premises.

§2D1.1Manufacturing or distributing a controlled substance need not be the sole purpose for which the premises was maintained, but must be one of the defendant’s primary or principal uses for the premises, rather than one of the defendant’s incidental or collateraluses for the premises. In making this determination, the court should consider how frequently the premises was used by the defendant for manufacturing or distributing a controlled substance and how frequently the premises was used by the defendant for lawfulpurposes.

18. Application of Subsection (b)(13).—(A) Hazardous or Toxic Substances (Subsection (b)(13)(A)).—Subsection(b)(13)(A) applies if the conduct for which the defendant is accountable under§1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct) involved any discharge, emission, release, transportation, treatment, storage, or disposal violation covered by the Resource Conservationand Recovery Act, 42 U.S.C. § 6928(d); the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, 33 U.S.C. § 1319(c); the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, 42 U.S.C. § 9603(b); or 49 U.S.C. § 5124 (relating to violations oflaws and regulations enforced by the Department of Transportation with respect tothe transportation of hazardous material). In some cases, the enhancement undersubsection (b)(13)(A) may not account adequately for the seriousness of the environmental harm or other threat to public health or safety (including the health orsafety of law enforcement and cleanup personnel). In such cases, an upward departure may be warranted. Additionally, in determining the amount of restitution under §5E1.1 (Restitution) and in fashioning appropriate conditions of probation andsupervision under §§5B1.3 (Conditions of Probation) and 5D1.3 (Conditions of Supervised Release), respectively, any costs of environmental cleanup and harm toindividuals or property shall be considered by the court in cases involving the manufacture of amphetamine or methamphetamine and should be considered by the court in cases involving the manufacture of a controlled substance other than amphetamine or methamphetamine. See 21 U.S.C. § 853(q) (mandatory restitution for cleanup costs relating to the manufacture of amphetamine and methamphetamine).

(B) Substantial Risk of Harm Associated with the Manufacture of Amphetamine and Methamphetamine (Subsection (b)(13)(C)–(D)).—(i) Factors to Consider.—In determining, for purposes of subsection(b)(13)(C)(ii) or (D), whether the offense created a substantial risk of harm tohuman life or the environment, the court shall include consideration of the following factors:(I) The quantity of any chemicals or hazardous or toxic substances found atthe laboratory, and the manner in which the chemicals or substanceswere stored.

(II) The manner in which hazardous or toxic substances were disposed, andthe likelihood of release into the environment of hazardous or toxic substances.

(III) The duration of the offense, and the extent of the manufacturing operation.

(IV) The location of the laboratory (e.g., whether the laboratory is located ina residential neighborhood or a remote area), and the number of humanlives placed at substantial risk of harm.

§2D1.1(ii) Definitions.—For purposes of subsection (b)(13)(D):“Incompetent” means an individual who is incapable of taking care of the individual’s self or property because of a mental or physical illness or disability, mental retardation, or senility.

“Minor” has the meaning given that term in Application Note 1 of the Commentary to §2A3.1 (Criminal Sexual Abuse).

19. Application of Subsection (b)(14).—Subsection (b)(14) applies to offenses that involvethe cultivation of marihuana on state or federal land or while trespassing on tribal orprivate land. Such offenses interfere with the ability of others to safely access and usethe area and also pose or risk a range of other harms, such as harms to the environment.

The enhancements in subsection (b)(13)(A) and (b)(14) may be applied cumulatively(added together), as is generally the case when two or more specific offense characteristics each apply. See §1B1.1 (Application Instructions), Application Note 4(A).

20. Application of Subsection (b)(15).—(A) Distributing to a Specified Individual or Involving Such an Individual inthe Offense (Subsection (b)(15)(B)).—If the defendant distributes a controlledsubstance to an individual or involves an individual in the offense, as specified insubsection (b)(15)(B), the individual is not a “vulnerable victim” for purposes of§3A1.1(b).

(B) Directly Involved in the Importation of a Controlled Substance (Subsection (b)(15)(C)).—Subsection (b)(15)(C) applies if the defendant is accountable for the importation of a controlled substance under subsection (a)(1)(A) of §1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct (Factors that Determine the Guideline Range)), i.e., the defendantcommitted, aided, abetted, counseled, commanded, induced, procured, or willfullycaused the importation of a controlled substance.

If subsection (b)(3) or (b)(5) applies, do not apply subsection (b)(15)(C).

(C) Pattern of Criminal Conduct Engaged in as a Livelihood (Subsection(b)(15)(E)).—For purposes of subsection (b)(15)(E), “pattern of criminal conduct” and “engaged in as a livelihood” have the meaning given such terms in§4B1.3 (Criminal Livelihood).

21. Applicability of Subsection (b)(17).—The applicability of subsection (b)(17) shall bedetermined without regard to whether the defendant was convicted of an offense thatsubjects the defendant to a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment. Section§5C1.2(b), which provides a minimum offense level of level 17, is not pertinent to the determination of whether subsection (b)(17) applies.

22. Application of Subsection (e)(1).—(A) Definition.—For purposes of this guideline, “sexual offense” means a “sexual act”or “sexual contact” as those terms are defined in 18 U.S.C. § 2246(2) and (3), respectively.

§2D1.1(B) Upward Departure Provision.—If the defendant committed a sexual offenseagainst more than one individual, an upward departure would be warranted.

23. Interaction with §3B1.3.—A defendant who used special skills in the commission ofthe offense may be subject to an adjustment under §3B1.3 (Abuse of Position of Trust orUse of Special Skill). Certain professionals often occupy essential positions in drug trafficking schemes. These professionals include doctors, pilots, boat captains, financiers, bankers, attorneys, chemists, accountants, and others whose special skill, trade, profession, or position may be used to significantly facilitate the commission of a drug offense.

Additionally, an enhancement under §3B1.3 ordinarily would apply in a case in whichthe defendant used his or her position as a coach to influence an athlete to use an anabolicsteroid. Likewise, an adjustment under §3B1.3 ordinarily would apply in a case in whichthe defendant is convicted of a drug offense resulting from the authorization of the defendant to receive scheduled substances from an ultimate user or long-term care facility.

See 21 U.S.C. § 822(g).

Note, however, that if an adjustment from subsection (b)(3)(C) applies, do not apply§3B1.3 (Abuse of Position of Trust or Use of Special Skill).

24. Cases Involving Mandatory Minimum Penalties.—Where a mandatory (statutory)minimum sentence applies, this mandatory minimum sentence may be “waived” and a lower sentence imposed (including a downward departure), as provided in 28 U.S.C.

§ 994(n), by reason of a defendant’s “substantial assistance in the investigation or prosecution of another person who has committed an offense.” See §5K1.1 (Substantial Assistance to Authorities). In addition, 18 U.S.C. § 3553(f) provides an exception to the applicability of mandatory minimum sentences in certain cases. See §5C1.2 (Limitation onApplicability of Statutory Minimum Sentences in Certain Cases).

25. Imposition of Consecutive Sentence for 21 U.S.C. § 860a or § 865.—Sections 860a and 865 of title 21, United States Code, require the imposition of a mandatory consecutive term of imprisonment of not more than 20 years and 15 years, respectively. In orderto comply with the relevant statute, the court should determine the appropriate “totalpunishment” and divide the sentence on the judgment form between the sentence attributable to the underlying drug offense and the sentence attributable to 21 U.S.C.

§ 860a or § 865, specifying the number of months to be served consecutively for the conviction under 21 U.S.C. § 860a or § 865. For example, if the applicable adjusted guidelinerange is 151–188 months and the court determines a “total punishment” of 151 monthsis appropriate, a sentence of 130 months for the underlying offense plus 21 months for the conduct covered by 21 U.S.C. § 860a or § 865 would achieve the “total punishment”in a manner that satisfies the statutory requirement of a consecutive sentence.

26. Cases Involving “Small Amount of Marihuana for No Remuneration”.—Distribution of “a small amount of marihuana for no remuneration”, 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(4), is treated as simple possession, to which §2D2.1 applies.

27. Departure Considerations.—(A) Downward Departure Based on Drug Quantity in Certain Reverse StingOperations.—If, in a reverse sting (an operation in which a government agent sellsor negotiates to sell a controlled substance to a defendant), the court finds that the government agent set a price for the controlled substance that was substantiallybelow the market value of the controlled substance, thereby leading to the defendant’s purchase of a significantly greater quantity of the controlled substance than §2D1.1his available resources would have allowed him to purchase except for the artificially low price set by the government agent, a downward departure may be warranted.

(B) Upward Departure Based on Drug Quantity.—In an extraordinary case, anupward departure above offense level 38 on the basis of drug quantity may be warranted. For example, an upward departure may be warranted where the quantityis at least ten times the minimum quantity required for level 38. Similarly, in the case of a controlled substance for which the maximum offense level is less than level 38, an upward departure may be warranted if the drug quantity substantiallyexceeds the quantity for the highest offense level established for that particularcontrolled substance.

(C) Upward Departure Based on Unusually High Purity.—Trafficking in controlled substances, compounds, or mixtures of unusually high purity may warrantan upward departure, except in the case of PCP, amphetamine, methamphetamine, hydrocodone, or oxycodone for which the guideline itself provides for the consideration of purity (see the footnote to the Drug Quantity Table). The purity of the controlled substance, particularly in the case of heroin, may be relevant in the sentencing process because it is probative of the defendant’s role or position in the chain ofdistribution. Since controlled substances are often diluted and combined with othersubstances as they pass down the chain of distribution, the fact that a defendant is in possession of unusually pure narcotics may indicate a prominent role in the criminal enterprise and proximity to the source of the drugs. As large quantities arenormally associated with high purities, this factor is particularly relevant wheresmaller quantities are involved.

Background: Offenses under 21 U.S.C. §§ 841 and 960 receive identical punishment basedupon the quantity of the controlled substance involved, the defendant’s criminal history, andwhether death or serious bodily injury resulted from the offense.

The base offense levels in §2D1.1 are either provided directly by the Anti-Drug Abuse Actof 1986 or are proportional to the levels established by statute, and apply to all unlawful trafficking. Levels 30 and 24 in the Drug Quantity Table are the distinctions provided by the AntiDrug Abuse Act; however, further refinement of drug amounts is essential to provide a logicalsentencing structure for drug offenses. To determine these finer distinctions, the Commissionconsulted numerous experts and practitioners, including authorities at the Drug EnforcementAdministration, chemists, attorneys, probation officers, and members of the Organized CrimeDrug Enforcement Task Forces, who also advocate the necessity of these distinctions. Wherenecessary, this scheme has been modified in response to specific congressional directives to the Commission.

The base offense levels at levels 24 and 30 establish guideline ranges such that the statutory minimum falls within the range; e.g., level 30 ranges from 97 to 121 months, where the statutory minimum term is ten years or 120 months.

For marihuana plants, the Commission has adopted an equivalency of 100 grams perplant, or the actual weight of the usable marihuana, whichever is greater. The decision to treateach plant as equal to 100 grams is premised on the fact that the average yield from a maturemarihuana plant equals 100 grams of marihuana. In controlled substance offenses, an attemptis assigned the same offense level as the object of the attempt. Consequently, the Commissionadopted the policy that each plant is to be treated as the equivalent of an attempt to produce100 grams of marihuana, except where the actual weight of the usable marihuana is greater.

§2D1.1Because the weights of LSD carrier media vary widely and typically far exceed the weightof the controlled substance itself, the Commission has determined that basing offense levelson the entire weight of the LSD and carrier medium would produce unwarranted disparityamong offenses involving the same quantity of actual LSD (but different carrier weights), aswell as sentences disproportionate to those for other, more dangerous controlled substances, such as PCP. Consequently, in cases involving LSD contained in a carrier medium, the Commission has established a weight per dose of 0.4 milligram for purposes of determining the base offense level.

The dosage weight of LSD selected exceeds the Drug Enforcement Administration’sstandard dosage unit for LSD of 0.05 milligram (i.e., the quantity of actual LSD per dose) inorder to assign some weight to the carrier medium. Because LSD typically is marketed andconsumed orally on a carrier medium, the inclusion of some weight attributable to the carriermedium recognizes (A) that offense levels for most other controlled substances are based uponthe weight of the mixture containing the controlled substance without regard to purity, and(B) the decision in Chapman v. United States, 500 U.S. 453 (1991) (holding that the term “mixture or substance” in 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1) includes the carrier medium in which LSD is absorbed). At the same time, the weight per dose selected is less than the weight per dose thatwould equate the offense level for LSD on a carrier medium with that for the same number ofdoses of PCP, a controlled substance that comparative assessments indicate is more likely toinduce violent acts and ancillary crime than is LSD. (Treating LSD on a carrier medium asweighing 0.5 milligram per dose would produce offense levels equivalent to those for PCP.)Thus, the approach decided upon by the Commission will harmonize offense levels for LSDoffenses with those for other controlled substances and avoid an undue influence of variedcarrier weight on the applicable offense level. Nonetheless, this approach does not override the applicability of “mixture or substance” for the purpose of applying any mandatory minimumsentence (see Chapman; §5G1.1(b)).

Frequently, a term of supervised release to follow imprisonment is required by statutefor offenses covered by this guideline. Guidelines for the imposition, duration, and conditionsof supervised release are set forth in Chapter Five, Part D (Supervised Release).

The last sentence of subsection (a)(5) implements the directive to the Commission in section 7(1) of Public Law 111–220.

CommentaryStatutory Provisions: 21 U.S.C. §§ 859 (formerly 21 U.S.C. § 845), 860 (formerly 21 U.S.C.

§ 845a), 861 (formerly 21 U.S.C. § 845b).

Application Note:1. This guideline applies only in a case in which the defendant is convicted of a statutoryviolation of drug trafficking in a protected location or involving an underage or pregnantindividual (including an attempt or conspiracy to commit such a violation) or in a case inwhich the defendant stipulated to such a statutory violation. See §1B1.2(a). In a caseinvolving such a conviction but in which only part of the relevant offense conduct directlyinvolved a protected location or an underage or pregnant individual, subsections (a)(1)and (a)(2) may result in different offense levels. For example, if the defendant, as part ofthe same course of conduct or common scheme or plan, sold 5 grams of heroin near a protected location and 10 grams of heroin elsewhere, the offense level from subsection§2D1.5(a)(1) would be level 14 (2 plus the offense level for the sale of 5 grams of heroin, the amount sold near the protected location); the offense level from subsection (a)(2) wouldbe level 15 (1 plus the offense level for the sale of 15 grams of heroin, the total amount ofheroin involved in the offense).

CommentaryStatutory Provision: 21 U.S.C. § 848.

Application Notes:1. Do not apply any adjustment from Chapter Three, Part B (Role in the Offense).

2. If as part of the enterprise the defendant sanctioned the use of violence, or if the numberof persons managed by the defendant was extremely large, an upward departure may bewarranted.

§2D1.63. Under 21 U.S.C. § 848, certain conduct for which the defendant has previously been sentenced may be charged as part of the instant offense to establish a “continuing series ofviolations.” A sentence resulting from a conviction sustained prior to the last overt act ofthe instant offense is to be considered a prior sentence under §4A1.2(a)(1) and not partof the instant offense.

4. Violations of 21 U.S.C. § 848 will be grouped with other drug offenses for the purpose ofapplying Chapter Three, Part D (Multiple Counts).

Background: Because a conviction under 21 U.S.C. § 848 establishes that a defendant controlled and exercised authority over one of the most serious types of ongoing criminal activity, this guideline provides a minimum base offense level of 38. An adjustment from ChapterThree, Part B is not authorized because the offense level of this guideline already reflects anadjustment for role in the offense.

Title 21 U.S.C. § 848 provides a 20-year minimum mandatory penalty for the first conviction, a 30-year minimum mandatory penalty for a second conviction, and a mandatory lifesentence for principal administrators of extremely large enterprises. If the application of the guidelines results in a sentence below the minimum sentence required by statute, the statutory minimum shall be the guideline sentence. See §5G1.1(b).

*Notes:(A) Except as provided in Note (B), to calculate the base offense level in an offensethat involves two or more chemicals, use the quantity of the single chemicalthat results in the greatest offense level, regardless of whether the chemicalsare set forth in different tables or in different categories (i.e., list I or list II)under subsection (d) or (e) of this guideline, as appropriate.

§2D1.11(B) To calculate the base offense level in an offense that involves two or morechemicals each of which is set forth in the Ephedrine, Pseudoephedrine, andPhenylpropanolamine Quantity Table, (i) aggregate the quantities of all suchchemicals, and (ii) determine the base offense level corresponding to the aggregate quantity.

(C) In a case involving ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, or phenylpropanolaminetablets, use the weight of the ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, or phenylpropanolamine contained in the tablets, not the weight of the entire tablets, in calculating the base offense level.

CommentaryStatutory Provisions: 21 U.S.C. §§ 841(c)(1), (2), (f)(1), 865, 960(d)(1), (2), (3), (4).

Application Notes:1. Cases Involving Multiple Chemicals.—(A) Determining the Base Offense Level for Two or More Chemicals.—Exceptas provided in subdivision (B), if the offense involves two or more chemicals, use the quantity of the single chemical that results in the greatest offense level, regardlessof whether the chemicals are set forth in different tables or in different categories(i.e., list I or list II) under this guideline.

Example: The defendant was in possession of five kilograms of ephedrine and300 grams of hydriodic acid. Ephedrine and hydriodic acid typically are used together in the same manufacturing process to manufacture methamphetamine. Thebase offense level for each chemical is calculated separately and the chemical with the higher base offense level is used. Five kilograms of ephedrine result in a baseoffense level of level 36; 300 grams of hydriodic acid result in a base offense level oflevel 24. In this case, the base offense level would be level 36.

(B) Determining the Base Offense Level for Offenses involving Ephedrine, Pseudoephedrine, or Phenylpropanolamine.—If the offense involves two ormore chemicals each of which is set forth in the Ephedrine, Pseudoephedrine, andPhenylpropanolamine Quantity Table, (i) aggregate the quantities of all such chemicals, and (ii) determine the base offense level corresponding to the aggregate quantity.

Example: The defendant was in possession of 80 grams of ephedrine and 50 gramsof phenylpropanolamine, an aggregate quantity of 130 grams of such chemicals.

The base offense level corresponding to that aggregate quantity is level 30.

(C) Upward Departure.—In a case involving two or more chemicals used to manufacture different controlled substances, or to manufacture one controlled substance bydifferent manufacturing processes, an upward departure may be warranted if the offense level does not adequately address the seriousness of the offense.

2. Application of Subsection (b)(1).—“Firearm” and “dangerous weapon” are definedin the Commentary to §1B1.1 (Application Instructions). The adjustment in subsection§2D1.11(b)(1) should be applied if the weapon was present, unless it is improbable that the weapon was connected with the offense.

3. Application of Subsection (b)(2).—Convictions under 21 U.S.C. §§ 841(c)(2) and (f)(1), and 960(d)(2), (d)(3), and (d)(4) do not require that the defendant have knowledge or anactual belief that the listed chemical was to be used to manufacture a controlled substance unlawfully. In a case in which the defendant possessed or distributed the listedchemical without such knowledge or belief, a 3-level reduction is provided to reflect thatthe defendant is less culpable than one who possessed or distributed listed chemicalsknowing or believing that they would be used to manufacture a controlled substance unlawfully.

4. Application of Subsection (b)(3).—Subsection (b)(3) applies if the conduct for whichthe defendant is accountable under §1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct) involved any discharge, emission, release, transportation, treatment, storage, or disposal violation covered by the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, 42 U.S.C. § 6928(d), the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, 33 U.S.C. § 1319(c), the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, 42 U.S.C. § 9603(b), and 49 U.S.C. § 5124 (relating to violations of laws and regulations enforced by the Department of Transportation with respectto the transportation of hazardous material). In some cases, the enhancement under subsection (b)(3) may not adequately account for the seriousness of the environmental harmor other threat to public health or safety (including the health or safety of law enforcement and cleanup personnel). In such cases, an upward departure may be warranted.

Additionally, any costs of environmental cleanup and harm to persons or property shouldbe considered by the court in determining the amount of restitution under §5E1.1 (Restitution) and in fashioning appropriate conditions of supervision under §§5B1.3 (Conditions of Probation) and 5D1.3 (Conditions of Supervised Release).

5. Application of Subsection (b)(4).—For purposes of subsection (b)(4), “mass-marketing by means of an interactive computer service” means the solicitation, by meansof an interactive computer service, of a large number of persons to induce those personsto purchase a controlled substance. For example, subsection (b)(4) would apply to a defendant who operated a web site to promote the sale of Gamma-butyrolactone (GBL) butwould not apply to coconspirators who use an interactive computer service only to communicate with one another in furtherance of the offense. “Interactive computer service”, for purposes of subsection (b)(4) and this note, has the meaning given that term insection 230(e)(2) of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. § 230(f)(2)).

6. Imposition of Consecutive Sentence for 21 U.S.C. § 865.—Section 865 of title 21, United States Code, requires the imposition of a mandatory consecutive term of imprisonment of not more than 15 years. In order to comply with the relevant statute, the courtshould determine the appropriate “total punishment” and, on the judgment form, dividethe sentence between the sentence attributable to the underlying drug offense and the sentence attributable to 21 U.S.C. § 865, specifying the number of months to be servedconsecutively for the conviction under 21 U.S.C. § 865. For example, if the applicableadjusted guideline range is 151–188 months and the court determines a “total punishment” of 151 months is appropriate, a sentence of 130 months for the underlying offenseplus 21 months for the conduct covered by 21 U.S.C. § 865 would achieve the “total punishment” in a manner that satisfies the statutory requirement of a consecutive sentence.

7. Applicability of Subsection (b)(6).—The applicability of subsection (b)(6) shall be determined without regard to the offense of conviction. If subsection (b)(6) applies, §5C1.2(b) does not apply. See §5C1.2(b)(2)(requiring a minimum offense level of level 17if the “statutorily required minimum sentence is at least five years”).

§2D1.128. Application of Subsection (c)(1).—“Offense involved unlawfully manufacturinga controlled substance or attempting to manufacture a controlled substance unlawfully,” as used in subsection (c)(1), means that the defendant, or a person for whoseconduct the defendant is accountable under §1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct), completed the actions sufficient to constitute the offense of unlawfully manufacturing a controlled substance or attempting to manufacture a controlled substance unlawfully.

9. Offenses Involving Immediate Precursors or Other Controlled Substances Covered Under §2D1.1.—In certain cases, the defendant will be convicted of an offense involving a listed chemical covered under this guideline, and a related offense involving animmediate precursor or other controlled substance covered under §2D1.1 (UnlawfullyManufacturing, Importing, Exporting, or Trafficking). For example, P2P (an immediateprecursor) and methylamine (a listed chemical) are used together to produce methamphetamine. Determine the offense level under each guideline separately. The offenselevel for methylamine is determined by using §2D1.11. The offense level for P2P is determined by using §2D1.1 (P2P is listed in the Drug Equivalency Table under Cocaine andOther Schedule I and II Stimulants (and their immediate precursors)). Under the grouping rules of §3D1.2(b), the counts will be grouped together. Note that in determining the scale of the offense under §2D1.1, the quantity of both the controlled substance and listedchemical should be considered (see Application Note 5 in the Commentary to §2D1.1).

Background: Offenses covered by this guideline involve list I chemicals (including ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, and phenylpropanolamine) and list II chemicals. List I chemicals are important to the manufacture of a controlled substance and usually become part of the final product. For example, ephedrine reacts with other chemicals to form methamphetamine. Theamount of ephedrine directly affects the amount of methamphetamine produced. List II chemicals are generally used as solvents, catalysts, and reagents.

CommentaryStatutory Provisions: 21 U.S.C. §§ 843(a)(6), (7), 864.

Application Notes:1. If the offense involved the large-scale manufacture, distribution, transportation, exportation, or importation of prohibited flasks, equipment, chemicals, products, or material, an upward departure may be warranted.

2. “Offense involved unlawfully manufacturing a controlled substance or attempting to manufacture a controlled substance unlawfully,” as used in subsection (c)(1), means that the defendant, or a person for whose conduct the defendant is accountable§2D1.13under §1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct), completed the actions sufficient to constitute the offense of unlawfully manufacturing a controlled substance or attempting to manufacturea controlled substance unlawfully.

3. Subsection (b)(2) applies if the conduct for which the defendant is accountable under§1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct) involved any discharge, emission, release, transportation, treatment, storage, or disposal violation covered by the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, 42 U.S.C. § 6928(d), the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, 33 U.S.C.

§ 1319(c), the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and LiabilityAct, 42 U.S.C. § 9603(b), and 49 U.S.C. § 5124 (relating to violations of laws and regulations enforced by the Department of Transportation with respect to the transportation ofhazardous material). In some cases, the enhancement under subsection (b)(2) may not adequately account for the seriousness of the environmental harm or other threat to public health or safety (including the health or safety of law enforcement and cleanup personnel). In such cases, an upward departure may be warranted. Additionally, any costsof environmental cleanup and harm to persons or property should be considered by the court in determining the amount of restitution under §5E1.1 (Restitution) and in fashioning appropriate conditions of supervision under §§5B1.3 (Conditions of Probation) and5D1.3 (Conditions of Supervised Release).

4. Application of Subsection (b)(3).—For purposes of subsection (b)(3), “mass-marketing by means of an interactive computer service” means the solicitation, by meansof an interactive computer service, of a large number of persons to induce those personsto purchase a controlled substance. For example, subsection (b)(3) would apply to a defendant who operated a web site to promote the sale of prohibited flasks but would not apply to coconspirators who use an interactive computer service only to communicatewith one another in furtherance of the offense. “Interactive computer service”, for purposes of subsection (b)(3) and this note, has the meaning given that term in section230(e)(2) of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. § 230(f)(2)).

The offense level usually will be determined by the offense level ofthe underlying conduct.

###### Historical Note 
 
 Effective November 1, 1987.

§2E1.1. Unlawful Conduct Relating to Racketeer Influenced and CorruptOrganizations(a) Base Offense Level (Apply the greater):(1) 19; or(2) the offense level applicable to the underlying racketeering activity.

CommentaryStatutory Provisions: 18 U.S.C. §§ 1962, 1963.

Application Notes:1. Where there is more than one underlying offense, treat each underlying offense as if contained in a separate count of conviction for the purposes of subsection (a)(2). To determinewhether subsection (a)(1) or (a)(2) results in the greater offense level, apply ChapterThree, Parts A, B, C, and D to both (a)(1) and (a)(2). Use whichever subsection results inthe greater offense level.

2. If the underlying conduct violates state law, the offense level corresponding to the mostanalogous federal offense is to be used.

3. If the offense level for the underlying racketeering activity is less than the alternativeminimum level specified (i.e., 19), the alternative minimum base offense level is to beused.

4. Certain conduct may be charged in the count of conviction as part of a “pattern of racketeering activity” even though the defendant has previously been sentenced for that conduct. Where such previously imposed sentence resulted from a conviction prior to the lastovert act of the instant offense, treat as a prior sentence under §4A1.2(a)(1) and not aspart of the instant offense. This treatment is designed to produce a result consistent with §2E1.3the distinction between the instant offense and criminal history found throughout the guidelines. If this treatment produces an anomalous result in a particular case, a guideline departure may be warranted.

CommentaryStatutory Provisions: 18 U.S.C. §§ 892–894.

Application Notes:1. Definitions of “firearm,” “dangerous weapon,” “otherwise used,” “brandished,”“bodily injury,” “serious bodily injury,” “permanent or life-threatening bodily injury,” “abducted,” and “physically restrained” are found in the Commentary to §1B1.1(Application Instructions).

2. See also Commentary to §2B3.2 (Extortion by Force or Threat of Injury or Serious Damage) regarding the interpretation of the specific offense characteristics.

Background: This section refers to offenses involving the making or financing of extortionateextensions of credit, or the collection of loans by extortionate means. These “loan-sharking”offenses typically involve threats of violence and provide economic support for organized crime.

The base offense level for these offenses is higher than the offense level for extortion becauseloan sharking is in most cases a continuing activity. In addition, the guideline does not includethe amount of money involved because the amount of money in such cases is often difficult todetermine. Other enhancements parallel those in §2B3.2 (Extortion by Force or Threat of Injury or Serious Damage).

Application Notes:1. Definition.—For purposes of this guideline, “animal fighting venture” has the meaning given that term in 7 U.S.C. § 2156(g).

2. Upward Departure Provision.—The base offense levels provided for animal fightingventures in subsection (a)(1) and (a)(3) reflect that an animal fighting venture involvesone or more violent fights between animals and that a defeated animal often is severelyinjured in the fight, dies as a result of the fight, or is killed afterward. Nonetheless, theremay be cases in which the offense level determined under this guideline substantiallyunderstates the seriousness of the offense. In such a case, an upward departure may bewarranted. For example, an upward departure may be warranted if (A) the offense involved extraordinary cruelty to an animal beyond the violence inherent in such a venture(such as by killing an animal in a way that prolongs the suffering of the animal); or(B) the offense involved animal fighting on an exceptional scale (such as an offense involving an unusually large number of animals).

LABOR RACKETEERINGIntroductory CommentaryThe statutes included in this subpart protect the rights of employees under the Taft–Hartley Act, members of labor organizations under the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959, and participants of employee pension and welfare benefit plans coveredunder the Employee Retirement Income Security Act.

The base offense levels for many of the offenses in this subpart have been determined byreference to analogous sections of the guidelines. Thus, the base offense levels for bribery, theft, and fraud in this subpart generally correspond to similar conduct under other parts ofthe guidelines. The base offense levels for bribery and graft have been set higher than the levelfor commercial bribery due to the particular vulnerability to exploitation of the organizationscovered by this subpart.

CommentaryStatutory Provisions: 18 U.S.C. § 1954; 29 U.S.C. § 186.

Application Notes:1. “Bribe” refers to the offer or acceptance of an unlawful payment with the specific understanding that it will corruptly affect an official action of the recipient.

2. “Gratuity” refers to the offer or acceptance of an unlawful payment other than a bribe.

3. “Fiduciary of the benefit plan” is defined in 29 U.S.C. § 1002(21)(A) to mean a personwho exercises any discretionary authority or control in respect to the management ofsuch plan or exercises authority or control in respect to management or disposition of itsassets, or who renders investment advice for a fee or other direct or indirect compensationwith respect to any moneys or other property of such plan, or has any authority or responsibility to do so, or who has any discretionary authority or responsibility in the administration of such plan.

4. “Value of the improper benefit to the payer” is explained in the Commentary to§2C1.1 (Offering, Giving, Soliciting, or Receiving a Bribe; Extortion Under Color of Official Right; Fraud Involving the Deprivation of the Intangible Right to Honest Services ofPublic Officials; Conspiracy to Defraud by Interference with Governmental Functions).

5. If the adjustment for a fiduciary at §2E5.1(b)(1) applies, do not apply the adjustment at§3B1.3 (Abuse of Position of Trust or Use of Special Skill).

Background: This section covers the giving or receipt of bribes and other unlawful gratuitiesinvolving employee welfare or pension benefit plans, or labor organizations. The seriousnessof the offense is determined by several factors, including the value of the bribe or gratuity andthe magnitude of the loss resulting from the transaction.

(d) Special Instruction(1) If the offense involved more than one victim, Chapter Three, Part D (Multiple Counts) shall be applied as if the promotingof a commercial sex act or prohibited sexual conduct in respectto each victim had been contained in a separate count of conviction.

CommentaryStatutory Provisions: 8 U.S.C. § 1328 (only if the offense involved a victim other than a minor); 18 U.S.C. §§ 1591 (only if the offense involved a victim other than a minor), 2421 (onlyif the offense involved a victim other than a minor), 2422(a) (only if the offense involved a victim other than a minor).

§2G1.1Application Notes:1. Definitions.—For purposes of this guideline:“Commercial sex act” has the meaning given that term in 18 U.S.C. § 1591(e)(3).

“Prohibited sexual conduct” has the meaning given that term in Application Note 1 of§2A3.1 (Criminal Sexual Abuse; Attempt to Commit Criminal Sexual Abuse).

“Promoting a commercial sex act” means persuading, inducing, enticing, or coercinga person to engage in a commercial sex act, or to travel to engage in, a commercial sexact.

“Victim” means a person transported, persuaded, induced, enticed, or coerced to engagein, or travel for the purpose of engaging in, a commercial sex act or prohibited sexualconduct, whether or not the person consented to the commercial sex act or prohibitedsexual conduct. Accordingly, “victim” may include an undercover law enforcement officer.

2. Application of Subsection (b)(1).—Subsection (b)(1) provides an enhancement for fraud or coercion that occurs as part of the offense and anticipates no bodily injury. Ifbodily injury results, an upward departure may be warranted. See Chapter Five, Part K(Departures). For purposes of subsection (b)(1), “coercion” includes any form of conductthat negates the voluntariness of the victim. This enhancement would apply, for example, in a case in which the ability of the victim to appraise or control conduct was substantiallyimpaired by drugs or alcohol. This characteristic generally will not apply if the drug oralcohol was voluntarily taken.

3. Application of Chapter Three Adjustment.—For the purposes of §3B1.1 (Aggravating Role), a victim, as defined in this guideline, is considered a participant only if thatvictim assisted in the promoting of a commercial sex act or prohibited sexual conduct inrespect to another victim.

4. Application of Subsection (c)(1).—(A) Conduct Described in 18 U.S.C. § 2241(a) or (b).—For purposes of subsection(c)(1), conduct described in 18 U.S.C. § 2241(a) or (b) is engaging in, or causing another person to engage in, a sexual act with another person by: (i) using forceagainst the victim; (ii) threatening or placing the victim in fear that any person willbe subject to death, serious bodily injury, or kidnapping; (iii) rendering the victimunconscious; or (iv) administering by force or threat of force, or without the knowledge or permission of the victim, a drug, intoxicant, or other similar substanceand thereby substantially impairing the ability of the victim to appraise or controlconduct. This provision would apply, for example, if any dangerous weapon wasused or brandished, or in a case in which the ability of the victim to appraise orcontrol conduct was substantially impaired by drugs or alcohol.

(B) Conduct Described in 18 U.S.C. § 2242.—For purposes of subsection (c)(1), conduct described in 18 U.S.C. § 2242 is: (i) engaging in, or causing another person toengage in, a sexual act with another person by threatening or placing the victim infear (other than by threatening or placing the victim in fear that any person will besubject to death, serious bodily injury, or kidnapping); or (ii) engaging in, or causing2G1.3another person to engage in, a sexual act with a victim who is incapable of appraising the nature of the conduct or who is physically incapable of declining participation in, or communicating unwillingness to engage in, the sexual act.

5. Special Instruction at Subsection (d)(1).—For the purposes of Chapter Three, PartD (Multiple Counts), each person transported, persuaded, induced, enticed, or coerced toengage in, or travel to engage in, a commercial sex act or prohibited sexual conduct is tobe treated as a separate victim. Consequently, multiple counts involving more than onevictim are not to be grouped together under §3D1.2 (Groups of Closely Related Counts).

In addition, subsection (d)(1) directs that if the relevant conduct of an offense of conviction includes the promoting of a commercial sex act or prohibited sexual conduct in respect to more than one victim, whether specifically cited in the count of conviction, eachsuch victim shall be treated as if contained in a separate count of conviction.

2. Application of Subsection (b)(1).—(A) Custody, Care, or Supervisory Control.—Subsection (b)(1) is intended to havebroad application and includes offenses involving a victim less than 18 years of ageentrusted to the defendant, whether temporarily or permanently. For example, teachers, day care providers, baby-sitters, or other temporary caretakers are amongthose who would be subject to this enhancement. In determining whether to applythis enhancement, the court should look to the actual relationship that existed between the defendant and the minor and not simply to the legal status of the defendant-minor relationship.

(B) Inapplicability of Chapter Three Adjustment.—If the enhancement undersubsection (b)(1) applies, do not apply §3B1.3 (Abuse of Position of Trust or Use ofSpecial Skill).

3. Application of Subsection (b)(2).—(A) Misrepresentation of Participant’s Identity.—The enhancement in subsection(b)(2)(A) applies in cases involving the misrepresentation of a participant’s identityto persuade, induce, entice, coerce, or facilitate the travel of, a minor to engage inprohibited sexual conduct. Subsection (b)(2)(A) is intended to apply only to misrepresentations made directly to a minor or to a person who exercises custody, care, orsupervisory control of the minor. Accordingly, the enhancement in subsection(b)(2)(A) would not apply to a misrepresentation made by a participant to an airlinerepresentative in the course of making travel arrangements for the minor.

The misrepresentation to which the enhancement in subsection (b)(2)(A) may applyincludes misrepresentation of a participant’s name, age, occupation, gender, or status, as long as the misrepresentation was made with the intent to persuade, induce, entice, coerce, or facilitate the travel of, a minor to engage in prohibited sexual conduct. Accordingly, use of a computer screen name, without such intent, would not be a sufficient basis for application of the enhancement.

(B) Undue Influence.—In determining whether subsection (b)(2)(B) applies, the courtshould closely consider the facts of the case to determine whether a participant’sinfluence over the minor compromised the voluntariness of the minor’s behavior.

The voluntariness of the minor’s behavior may be compromised without prohibitedsexual conduct occurring.

However, subsection (b)(2)(B) does not apply in a case in which the only “minor” (asdefined in Application Note 1) involved in the offense is an undercover law enforcement officer.

In a case in which a participant is at least 10 years older than the minor, there shallbe a rebuttable presumption that subsection (b)(2)(B) applies. In such a case, somedegree of undue influence can be presumed because of the substantial difference inage between the participant and the minor.

4. Application of Subsection (b)(3).—Subsection (b)(3) is intended to apply only to the use of a computer or an interactive computer service to communicate directly with a minor or with a person who exercises custody, care, or supervisory control of the minor.

2G1.3Accordingly, the enhancement in subsection (b)(3) would not apply to the use of a computer or an interactive computer service to obtain airline tickets for the minor from anairline’s Internet site.

5. Application of Subsection (c).—(A) Application of Subsection (c)(1).—The cross reference in subsection (c)(1) is tobe construed broadly and includes all instances in which the offense involved employing, using, persuading, inducing, enticing, coercing, transporting, permitting, or offering or seeking by notice, advertisement or other method, a minor to engagein sexually explicit conduct for the purpose of producing any visual depiction of suchconduct. For purposes of subsection (c)(1), “sexually explicit conduct” has the meaning given that term in 18 U.S.C. § 2256(2).

(B) Application of Subsection (c)(3).—For purposes of subsection (c)(3), conduct described in 18 U.S.C. § 2241 means conduct described in 18 U.S.C. § 2241(a), (b), or (c). Accordingly, for purposes of subsection (c)(3):(i) Conduct described in 18 U.S.C. § 2241(a) or (b) is engaging in, or causing another person to engage in, a sexual act with another person: (I) using forceagainst the minor; (II) threatening or placing the minor in fear that any person will be subject to death, serious bodily injury, or kidnapping; (III) rendering the minor unconscious; or (IV) administering by force or threat of force, orwithout the knowledge or permission of the minor, a drug, intoxicant, or othersimilar substance and thereby substantially impairing the ability of the minorto appraise or control conduct. This provision would apply, for example, if anydangerous weapon was used or brandished, or in a case in which the ability ofthe minor to appraise or control conduct was substantially impaired by drugsor alcohol.

(ii) Conduct described in 18 U.S.C. § 2241(c) is: (I) interstate travel with intent toengage in a sexual act with a minor who has not attained the age of 12 years;(II) knowingly engaging in a sexual act with a minor who has not attained the age of 12 years; or (III) knowingly engaging in a sexual act under the circumstances described in 18 U.S.C. § 2241(a) and (b) with a minor who has attainedthe age of 12 years but has not attained the age of 16 years (and is at least4 years younger than the person so engaging).

(iii) Conduct described in 18 U.S.C. § 2242 is: (I) engaging in, or causing anotherperson to engage in, a sexual act with another person by threatening or placing the minor in fear (other than by threatening or placing the minor in fearthat any person will be subject to death, serious bodily injury, or kidnapping);or (II) engaging in, or causing another person to engage in, a sexual act with a minor who is incapable of appraising the nature of the conduct or who is physically incapable of declining participation in, or communicating unwillingness to engage in, the sexual act.

6. Application of Subsection (d)(1).—For the purposes of Chapter Three, Part D (Multiple Counts), each minor transported, persuaded, induced, enticed, or coerced to engagein, or travel to engage in, a commercial sex act or prohibited sexual conduct is to betreated as a separate minor. Consequently, multiple counts involving more than one minor are not to be grouped together under §3D1.2 (Groups of Closely Related Counts). In addition, subsection (d)(1) directs that if the relevant conduct of an offense of convictionincludes travel or transportation to engage in a commercial sex act or prohibited sexual§2G2.1conduct in respect to more than one minor, whether specifically cited in the count of conviction, each such minor shall be treated as if contained in a separate count of conviction.

7. Upward Departure Provision.—If the offense involved more than ten minors, an upward departure may be warranted.

5. Application of Subsection (b)(5).—(A) In General.—Subsection (b)(5) is intended to have broad application and includesoffenses involving a minor entrusted to the defendant, whether temporarily or permanently. For example, teachers, day care providers, baby-sitters, or other temporary caretakers are among those who would be subject to this enhancement.

§ 3631.

Application Notes:1. “Offense guideline applicable to any underlying offense” means the offense guideline applicable to any conduct established by the offense of conviction that constitutes anoffense under federal, state, or local law (other than an offense that is itself covered underChapter Two, Part H, Subpart 1).

In certain cases, conduct set forth in the count of conviction may constitute more than one underlying offense (e.g., two instances of assault, or one instance of assault and oneinstance of arson). In such cases, use the following comparative procedure to determinethe applicable base offense level: (i) determine the underlying offenses encompassedwithin the count of conviction as if the defendant had been charged with a conspiracy tocommit multiple offenses. See Application Note 4 of §1B1.2 (Applicable Guidelines);§2H1.3(ii) determine the Chapter Two offense level (i.e., the base offense level, specific offensecharacteristics, cross references, and special instructions) for each such underlying offense; and (iii) compare each of the Chapter Two offense levels determined above with the alternative base offense level under subsection (a)(2), (3), or (4). The determinationof the applicable alternative base offense level is to be based on the entire conduct underlying the count of conviction (i.e., the conduct taken as a whole). Use the alternativebase offense level only if it is greater than each of the Chapter Two offense levels determined above. Otherwise, use the Chapter Two offense levels for each of the underlyingoffenses (with each underlying offense treated as if contained in a separate count of conviction). Then apply subsection (b) to the alternative base offense level, or to the ChapterTwo offense levels for each of the underlying offenses, as appropriate.

3. The burning or defacement of a religious symbol with an intent to intimidate shall bedeemed to involve the threat of force against a person for the purposes of subsection (a)(3)(A).

4. If the finder of fact at trial or, in the case of a plea of guilty or nolo contendere, the courtat sentencing determines beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant intentionallyselected any victim or any property as the object of the offense because of the actual orperceived race, color, religion, national origin, ethnicity, gender, gender identity, disability, or sexual orientation of any person, an additional 3-level enhancement from§3A1.1(a) will apply. An adjustment from §3A1.1(a) will not apply, however, if a 6-leveladjustment from §2H1.1(b) applies. See §3A1.1(c).

Application Notes:1. Satellite Cable Transmissions.—If the offense involved interception of satellite cabletransmissions for purposes of commercial advantage or private financial gain (includingavoiding payment of fees), apply §2B5.3 (Criminal Infringement of Copyright) ratherthan this guideline.

2. Imposition of Sentence for 18 U.S.C. § 1039(d) and (e).—Subsections 1039(d) and (e)of title 18, United States Code, require a term of imprisonment of not more than 5 yearsto be imposed in addition to any sentence imposed for a conviction under 18 U.S.C.

§ 1039(a), (b), or (c). In order to comply with the statute, the court should determine the appropriate “total punishment” and divide the sentence on the judgment form betweenthe sentence attributable to the conviction under 18 U.S.C. § 1039(d) or (e) and the sentence attributable to the conviction under 18 U.S.C. § 1039(a), (b), or (c), specifying the number of months to be served for the conviction under 18 U.S.C. § 1039(d) or (e). Forexample, if the applicable adjusted guideline range is 15–21 months and the court determines a “total punishment” of 21 months is appropriate, a sentence of 9 months for conduct under 18 U.S.C. § 1039(a) plus 12 months for 18 U.S.C. § 1039(d) conduct wouldachieve the “total punishment” in a manner that satisfies the statutory requirement.

3. Inapplicability of Chapter Three (Adjustments).—If the enhancement under subsection (b)(2) applies, do not apply §3A1.2 (Official Victim).

4. Definitions.—For purposes of this guideline:“Computer” has the meaning given that term in 18 U.S.C. § 1030(e)(1).

“Covered person” has the meaning given that term in 18 U.S.C. § 119(b).

“Interactive computer service” has the meaning given that term in section 230(e)(2) ofthe Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. § 230(f)(2)).

“Means of identification” has the meaning given that term in 18 U.S.C. § 1028(d)(7), except that such means of identification shall be of an actual (i.e., not fictitious) individual, other than the defendant or a person for whose conduct the defendant is accountableunder §1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct).

“Personal information” means sensitive or private information involving an identifiable individual (including such information in the possession of a third party), including(A) medical records; (B) wills; (C) diaries; (D) private correspondence, including e-mail;(E) financial records; (F) photographs of a sensitive or private nature; or (G) similar information.

5. Upward Departure.—There may be cases in which the offense level determined underthis guideline substantially understates the seriousness of the offense. In such a case, anupward departure may be warranted. The following are examples of cases in which anupward departure may be warranted:(A) The offense involved personal information, means of identification, confidentialphone records information, or tax return information of a substantial number ofindividuals.

(B) The offense caused or risked substantial non-monetary harm (e.g. physical harm, psychological harm, or severe emotional trauma, or resulted in a substantial invasion of privacy interest) to individuals whose private or protected information wasobtained.

CommentaryStatutory Provisions: 18 U.S.C. §§ 241, 1581–1590, 1592, 1593A, 2442.

Application Notes:1. For purposes of this guideline—“A dangerous weapon was used” means that a firearm was discharged, or that a firearm or other dangerous weapon was otherwise used. “The use of a dangerous weaponwas threatened” means that the use of a dangerous weapon was threatened regardlessof whether a dangerous weapon was present.

Definitions of “firearm,” “dangerous weapon,” “otherwise used,” “serious bodily injury,” and “permanent or life-threatening bodily injury” are found in the Commentary to §1B1.1 (Application Instructions).

“Peonage or involuntary servitude” includes forced labor, slavery, and recruitment oruse of a child soldier.

2. Under subsection (b)(4), “any other felony offense” means any conduct that constitutesa felony offense under federal, state, or local law (other than an offense that is itselfcovered by this subpart). When there is more than one such other offense, the most serious such offense (or group of closely related offenses in the case of offenses that would begrouped together under §3D1.2(d)) is to be used. See Application Note 3 of §1B1.5 (Interpretation of References to other Offense Guidelines).

3. If the offense involved the holding of more than ten victims in a condition of peonage orinvoluntary servitude, an upward departure may be warranted.

4. In a case in which the defendant was convicted under 18 U.S.C. §§ 1589(b) or 1593A, a downward departure may be warranted if the defendant benefitted from participating ina venture described in those sections without knowing that (i.e., in reckless disregard ofthe fact that) the venture had engaged in the criminal activity described in those sections.

(2) If the defendant committed any part of the instant offense subsequent to sustaining a civil or administrative adjudication for similar misconduct, increase by 2 levels.

CommentaryStatutory Provision: 29 U.S.C. § 1851.

Application Notes:1. Definitions.—For purposes of subsection (b)(1), “bodily injury” and “serious bodilyinjury” have the meaning given those terms in Application Note 1 of the Commentary to§1B1.1 (Application Instructions).

2. Application of Subsection (b)(2).—Section 1851 of title 29, United States Code, coversa wide range of conduct. Accordingly, the enhancement in subsection (b)(2) applies onlyif the instant offense is similar to previous misconduct that resulted in a civil or administrative adjudication under the provisions of the Migrant and Seasonal AgriculturalWorker Protection Act (29 U.S.C. § 1801 et seq.).

PART I ― [NOT USED]§2J1.2PART J ― OFFENSES INVOLVING THE ADMINISTRATION OFJUSTICE§2J1.1. ContemptApply §2X5.1 (Other Offenses).

CommentaryStatutory Provisions: 18 U.S.C. §§ 401, 228. For additional statutory provision(s), see Appendix A (Statutory Index).

Application Notes:1. In General.—Because misconduct constituting contempt varies significantly and the nature of the contemptuous conduct, the circumstances under which the contempt wascommitted, the effect the misconduct had on the administration of justice, and the needto vindicate the authority of the court are highly context-dependent, the Commission hasnot provided a specific guideline for this offense. In certain cases, the offense conduct willbe sufficiently analogous to §2J1.2 (Obstruction of Justice) for that guideline to apply.

2. Willful Failure to Pay Court-Ordered Child Support.—For offenses involving the willful failure to pay court-ordered child support (violations of 18 U.S.C. § 228), the mostanalogous guideline is §2B1.1 (Theft, Property Destruction, and Fraud). The amount ofthe loss is the amount of child support that the defendant willfully failed to pay. In sucha case, do not apply §2B1.1(b)(9)(C) (pertaining to a violation of a prior, specific judicialorder). Note: This guideline applies to second and subsequent offenses under 18 U.S.C.

§ 228(a)(1) and to any offense under 18 U.S.C. § 228(a)(2) and (3). A first offense under18 U.S.C. § 228(a)(1) is not covered by this guideline because it is a Class B misdemeanor.

3. Violation of Judicial Order Enjoining Fraudulent Behavior.—In a case involvinga violation of a judicial order enjoining fraudulent behavior, the most analogous guidelineis §2B1.1. In such a case, §2B1.1(b)(9)(C) (pertaining to a violation of a prior, specificjudicial order) ordinarily would apply.

(2) If the offense resulted in substantial interference with the administration of justice, increase by 3 levels.

(3) If the offense (A) involved the destruction, alteration, or fabrication of a substantial number of records, documents, or tangible objects; (B) involved the selection of any essential or especially probative record, document, or tangible object, to destroyor alter; or (C) was otherwise extensive in scope, planning, orpreparation, increase by 2 levels.

(c) Cross Reference(1) If the offense involved obstructing the investigation or prosecution of a criminal offense, apply §2X3.1 (Accessory After the Fact) in respect to that criminal offense, if the resulting offenselevel is greater than that determined above.

CommentaryStatutory Provisions: 18 U.S.C. §§ 1001 (when the statutory maximum term of eight years’imprisonment applies because the matter relates to international terrorism or domestic terrorism, or to sex offenses under 18 U.S.C. § 1591 or chapters 109A, 109B, 110, or 117 of title18, United States Code), 1503, 1505–1513, 1516, 1519. For additional statutory provision(s), see Appendix A (Statutory Index).

§2J1.2Application Notes:1. Definitions.—For purposes of this guideline:“Domestic terrorism” has the meaning given that term in 18 U.S.C. § 2331(5).

“International terrorism” has the meaning given that term in 18 U.S.C. § 2331(1).

“Records, documents, or tangible objects” includes (A) records, documents, or tangible objects that are stored on, or that are, magnetic, optical, digital, other electronic, orother storage mediums or devices; and (B) wire or electronic communications.

“Substantial interference with the administration of justice” includes a prematureor improper termination of a felony investigation; an indictment, verdict, or any judicialdetermination based upon perjury, false testimony, or other false evidence; or the unnecessary expenditure of substantial governmental or court resources.

2. Chapter Three Adjustments.—(A) Inapplicability of §3C1.1.—For offenses covered under this section, §3C1.1 (Obstructing or Impeding the Administration of Justice) does not apply, unless the defendant obstructed the investigation, prosecution, or sentencing of the obstructionof justice count.

(B) Interaction with Terrorism Adjustment.—If §3A1.4 (Terrorism) applies, do not apply subsection (b)(1)(C).

3. Convictions for the Underlying Offense.—In the event that the defendant is convicted of an offense sentenced under this section as well as for the underlying offense(i.e., the offense that is the object of the obstruction), see the Commentary to ChapterThree, Part C (Obstruction and Related Adjustments), and to §3D1.2(c) (Groups ofClosely Related Counts).

4. Upward Departure Considerations.—If a weapon was used, or bodily injury or significant property damage resulted, an upward departure may be warranted. See ChapterFive, Part K (Departures). In a case involving an act of extreme violence (for example, retaliating against a government witness by throwing acid in the witness’s face) or a particularly serious sex offense, an upward departure would be warranted.

5. Subsection (b)(1)(B).—The inclusion of “property damage” under subsection (b)(1)(B)is designed to address cases in which property damage is caused or threatened as a meansof intimidation or retaliation (e.g., to intimidate a witness from, or retaliate against a witness for, testifying). Subsection (b)(1)(B) is not intended to apply, for example, wherethe offense consisted of destroying a ledger containing an incriminating entry.

Background: This section addresses offenses involving the obstruction of justice generallyprosecuted under the above-referenced statutory provisions. Numerous offenses of varying seriousness may constitute obstruction of justice: using threats or force to intimidate or influencea juror or federal officer; obstructing a civil or administrative proceeding; stealing or alteringcourt records; unlawfully intercepting grand jury deliberations; obstructing a criminal investigation; obstructing a state or local investigation of illegal gambling; using intimidation orforce to influence testimony, alter evidence, evade legal process, or obstruct the communicationof a judge or law enforcement officer; or causing a witness bodily injury or property damage in§2J1.3retaliation for providing testimony, information or evidence in a federal proceeding. The conduct that gives rise to the violation may, therefore, range from a mere threat to an act of extreme violence.

The specific offense characteristics reflect the more serious forms of obstruction. Becausethe conduct covered by this guideline is frequently part of an effort to avoid punishment for anoffense that the defendant has committed or to assist another person to escape punishment for an offense, a cross reference to §2X3.1 (Accessory After the Fact) is provided. Use of this crossreference will provide an enhanced offense level when the obstruction is in respect to a particularly serious offense, whether such offense was committed by the defendant or another person.

2. For offenses covered under this section, §3C1.1 (Obstructing or Impeding the Administration of Justice) does not apply, unless the defendant obstructed the investigation or trialof the perjury count.

3. In the event that the defendant is convicted under this section as well as for the underlying offense (i.e., the offense with respect to which he committed perjury, subornation ofperjury, or witness bribery), see the Commentary to §3C1.1, and to §3D1.2(c) (Groups ofClosely Related Counts).

4. If a weapon was used, or bodily injury or significant property damage resulted, an upward departure may be warranted. See Chapter Five, Part K (Departures).

5. “Separate proceedings,” as used in subsection (d)(1), includes different proceedings inthe same case or matter (e.g., a grand jury proceeding and a trial, or a trial and retrial), and proceedings in separate cases or matters (e.g., separate trials of codefendants), butdoes not include multiple grand jury proceedings in the same case.

Background: This section applies to perjury, subornation of perjury, and witness bribery, generally prosecuted under the referenced statutes. The guidelines provide a higher penaltyfor perjury than the pre-guidelines practice estimate of ten months imprisonment. The Commission believes that perjury should be treated similarly to obstruction of justice. Therefore, the same considerations for enhancing a sentence are applied in the specific offense characteristics, and an alternative reference to the guideline for accessory after the fact is made.

§2J1.6CommentaryStatutory Provision: 18 U.S.C. § 3146(b)(1).

Application Notes:1. “Underlying offense” means the offense in respect to which the defendant failed to appear.

2. For offenses covered under this section, §3C1.1 (Obstructing or Impeding the Administration of Justice) does not apply, unless the defendant obstructed the investigation or trialof the failure to appear count.

3. In the case of a failure to appear for service of sentence, any term of imprisonment imposed on the failure to appear count is to be imposed consecutively to any term of imprisonment imposed for the underlying offense. See §5G1.3(a). The guideline range for the failure to appear count is to be determined independently and the grouping rules of§§3D1.1–3D1.5 do not apply.

However, in the case of a conviction on both the underlying offense and the failure toappear, other than a case of failure to appear for service of sentence, the failure to appearis treated under §3C1.1 (Obstructing or Impeding the Administration of Justice) as anobstruction of the underlying offense, and the failure to appear count and the count orcounts for the underlying offense are grouped together under §3D1.2(c). (Note that18 U.S.C. § 3146(b)(2) does not require a sentence of imprisonment on a failure to appearcount, although if a sentence of imprisonment on the failure to appear count is imposed, the statute requires that the sentence be imposed to run consecutively to any other sentence of imprisonment. Therefore, unlike a count in which the statute mandates both a minimum and a consecutive sentence of imprisonment, the grouping rules of§§3D1.1–3D1.5 apply. See §3D1.1(b)(1), comment. (n.1), and §3D1.2, comment. (n.1).) Thecombined sentence will then be constructed to provide a “total punishment” that satisfiesthe requirements both of §5G1.2 (Sentencing on Multiple Counts of Conviction) and18 U.S.C. § 3146(b)(2). For example, if the combined applicable guideline range for bothcounts is 30–37 months and the court determines that a “total punishment” of 36 monthsis appropriate, a sentence of 30 months for the underlying offense plus a consecutive sixmonths’ sentence for the failure to appear count would satisfy these requirements. (Notethat the combination of this instruction and increasing the offense level for the obstructive, failure to appear conduct has the effect of ensuring an incremental, consecutivepunishment for the failure to appear count, as required by 18 U.S.C. § 3146(b)(2).)4. If a defendant is convicted of both the underlying offense and the failure to appear count, and the defendant committed additional acts of obstructive behavior (e.g., perjury) duringthe investigation, prosecution, or sentencing of the instant offense, an upward departuremay be warranted. The upward departure will ensure an enhanced sentence for obstructive conduct for which no adjustment under §3C1.1 (Obstructing or Impeding the Administration of Justice) is made because of the operation of the rules set out in ApplicationNote 3.

5. In some cases, the defendant may be sentenced on the underlying offense (the offense inrespect to which the defendant failed to appear) before being sentenced on the failure toappear offense. In such cases, criminal history points for the sentence imposed on the underlying offense are to be counted in determining the guideline range on the failure toappear offense only where the offense level is determined under subsection (a)(1)(i.e., where the offense constituted a failure to report for service of sentence).

§2J1.9Background: This section applies to a failure to appear by a defendant who was releasedpending trial, sentencing, appeal, or surrender for service of sentence. Where the base offenselevel is determined under subsection (a)(2), the offense level increases in relation to the statutory maximum of the underlying offense.

Application Notes:1. “Explosive material(s)” include explosives, blasting agents, and detonators. See 18U.S.C. § 841(c). “Explosives” is defined at 18 U.S.C. § 844(j). A destructive device, definedin the Commentary to §1B1.1 (Application Instructions), may contain explosive materials. Where the conduct charged in the count of which the defendant was convicted establishes that the offense involved a destructive device, apply §2K2.1 (Unlawful Receipt, Possession, or Transportation of Firearms or Ammunition; Prohibited Transactions Involving Firearms or Ammunition) if the resulting offense level is greater.

2. For purposes of this guideline:“Controlled substance offense” has the meaning given that term in §4B1.2(b) and Application Note 1 of the Commentary to §4B1.2 (Definitions of Terms Used in Section4B1.1).

“Crime of violence” has the meaning given that term in §4B1.2(a) and ApplicationNote 1 of the Commentary to §4B1.2.

“Felony conviction” means a prior adult federal or state conviction for an offense punishable by death or imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, regardless of whethersuch offense is specifically designated as a felony and regardless of the actual sentenceimposed. A conviction for an offense committed at age eighteen years or older is an adultconviction. A conviction for an offense committed prior to age eighteen years is an adultconviction if it is classified as an adult conviction under the laws of the jurisdiction inwhich the defendant was convicted (e.g., a federal conviction for an offense committedprior to the defendant’s eighteenth birthday is an adult conviction if the defendant wasexpressly proceeded against as an adult).

3. For purposes of subsection (a)(4), “prohibited person” means any person described in18 U.S.C. § 842(i).

4. “Felony offense,” as used in subsection (b)(3), means any offense (federal, state, or local)punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, whether or not a criminal charge was brought, or conviction obtained.

5. For purposes of calculating the weight of explosive materials under subsection (b)(1), include only the weight of the actual explosive material and the weight of packaging material that is necessary for the use or detonation of the explosives. Exclude the weight ofany other shipping or packaging materials. For example, the paper and fuse on a stick ofdynamite would be included; the box that the dynamite was shipped in would not beincluded.

§2K1.36. For purposes of calculating the weight of explosive materials under subsection (b)(1), count only those explosive materials that were unlawfully sought to be obtained, unlawfully possessed, or unlawfully distributed, including any explosive material that a defendant attempted to obtain by making a false statement.

7. If the defendant is convicted under 18 U.S.C. § 842(h) (offense involving stolen explosivematerials), and is convicted of no other offenses subject to this guideline, do not apply the adjustment in subsection (b)(2) because the base offense level itself takes such conductinto account.

8. Under subsection (c)(1), the offense level for the underlying offense (which may be a federal, state, or local offense) is to be determined under §2X1.1 (Attempt, Solicitation, orConspiracy) or, if death results, under the most analogous guideline from Chapter Two, Part A, Subpart 1 (Homicide).

9. For purposes of applying subsection (a)(1) or (2), use only those felony convictions thatreceive criminal history points under §4A1.1(a), (b), or (c). In addition, for purposes ofapplying subsection (a)(1), use only those felony convictions that are counted separatelyunder §4A1.1(a), (b), or (c). See §4A1.2(a)(2).

Prior felony conviction(s) resulting in an increased base offense level under subsection (a)(1), (a)(2), or (a)(4) are also counted for purposes of determining criminal historypoints pursuant to Chapter Four, Part A (Criminal History).

10. An upward departure may be warranted in any of the following circumstances: (A) the quantity of explosive materials significantly exceeded 1000 pounds; (B) the explosive materials were of a nature more volatile or dangerous than dynamite or conventional powderexplosives (e.g., plastic explosives); (C) the defendant knowingly distributed explosivematerials to a person under twenty-one years of age; or (D) the offense posed a substantial risk of death or bodily injury to multiple individuals.

11. As used in subsections (b)(3) and (c)(1), “another felony offense” and “another offense”refer to offenses other than explosives or firearms possession or trafficking offenses. However, where the defendant used or possessed a firearm or explosive to facilitate anotherfirearms or explosives offense (e.g., the defendant used or possessed a firearm to protectthe delivery of an unlawful shipment of explosives), an upward departure under §5K2.6(Weapons and Dangerous Instrumentalities) may be warranted.

In addition, for purposes of subsection (c)(1)(A), “that other offense” means, with respectto an offense under 18 U.S.C. § 842(p)(2), the underlying Federal crime of violence.

6. Application of Subsection (b)(2).—Under subsection (b)(2), “lawful sporting purposesor collection” as determined by the surrounding circumstances, provides for a reductionto an offense level of 6. Relevant surrounding circumstances include the number and typeof firearms, the amount and type of ammunition, the location and circumstances of possession and actual use, the nature of the defendant’s criminal history (e.g., prior convictions for offenses involving firearms), and the extent to which possession was restrictedby local law. Note that where the base offense level is determined under subsections (a)(1)–(a)(5), subsection (b)(2) is not applicable.

7. Destructive Devices.—A defendant whose offense involves a destructive device receives both the base offense level from the subsection applicable to a firearm listed in26 U.S.C. § 5845(a) (e.g., subsection (a)(1), (a)(3), (a)(4)(B), or (a)(5)), and the applicable§2K2.1enhancement under subsection (b)(3). Such devices pose a considerably greater risk tothe public welfare than other National Firearms Act weapons.

Offenses involving such devices cover a wide range of offense conduct and involve different degrees of risk to the public welfare depending on the type of destructive device involved and the location or manner in which that destructive device was possessed ortransported. For example, a pipe bomb in a populated train station creates a substantially greater risk to the public welfare, and a substantially greater risk of death or serious bodily injury, than an incendiary device in an isolated area. In a case in which the cumulative result of the increased base offense level and the enhancement under subsection (b)(3) does not adequately capture the seriousness of the offense because of the typeof destructive device involved, the risk to the public welfare, or the risk of death or seriousbodily injury that the destructive device created, an upward departure may be warranted. See also §§5K2.1 (Death), 5K2.2 (Physical Injury), and 5K2.14 (Public Welfare).

8. Application of Subsection (b)(4).—(A) Interaction with Subsection (a)(7).—If the only offense to which §2K2.1 appliesis 18 U.S.C. § 922(i), (j), or (u), or 18 U.S.C. § 924(l) or (m) (offenses involving a stolen firearm or stolen ammunition) and the base offense level is determined undersubsection (a)(7), do not apply the enhancement in subsection (b)(4)(A). This is because the base offense level takes into account that the firearm or ammunition wasstolen. However, if the offense involved a firearm with an altered or obliteratedserial number, apply subsection (b)(4)(B).

Similarly, if the offense to which §2K2.1 applies is 18 U.S.C. § 922(k) or 26 U.S.C.

§ 5861(g) or (h) (offenses involving an altered or obliterated serial number) and the base offense level is determined under subsection (a)(7), do not apply the enhancement in subsection (b)(4)(B). This is because the base offense level takes into account that the firearm had an altered or obliterated serial number. However, it the offense involved a stolen firearm or stolen ammunition, apply subsection (b)(4)(A).

(B) Knowledge or Reason to Believe.—Subsection (b)(4) applies regardless ofwhether the defendant knew or had reason to believe that the firearm was stolenor had an altered or obliterated serial number.

9. Application of Subsection (b)(7).—Under subsection (b)(7), if a record-keeping offensewas committed to conceal a substantive firearms or ammunition offense, the offense levelis increased to the offense level for the substantive firearms or ammunition offense(e.g., if the defendant falsifies a record to conceal the sale of a firearm to a prohibitedperson, the offense level is increased to the offense level applicable to the sale of a firearmto a prohibited person).

10. Prior Felony Convictions.—For purposes of applying subsection (a)(1), (2), (3), or(4)(A), use only those felony convictions that receive criminal history points under§4A1.1(a), (b), or (c). In addition, for purposes of applying subsection (a)(1) and (a)(2), useonly those felony convictions that are counted separately under §4A1.1(a), (b), or (c).

See §4A1.2(a)(2).

Prior felony conviction(s) resulting in an increased base offense level under subsection(a)(1), (a)(2), (a)(3), (a)(4)(A), (a)(4)(B), or (a)(6) are also counted for purposes of determining criminal history points pursuant to Chapter Four, Part A (Criminal History).

§2K2.111. Upward Departure Provisions.—An upward departure may be warranted in any ofthe following circumstances: (A) the number of firearms substantially exceeded 200;(B) the offense involved multiple National Firearms Act weapons (e.g., machineguns, destructive devices), military type assault rifles, non-detectable (“plastic”) firearms (definedat 18 U.S.C. § 922(p)); (C) the offense involved large quantities of armor-piercing ammunition (defined at 18 U.S.C. § 921(a)(17)(B)); or (D) the offense posed a substantial risk ofdeath or bodily injury to multiple individuals (see Application Note 7).

12. Armed Career Criminal.—A defendant who is subject to an enhanced sentence underthe provisions of 18 U.S.C. § 924(e) is an Armed Career Criminal. See §4B1.4.

13. Application of Subsection (b)(5).—(A) In General.—Subsection (b)(5) applies, regardless of whether anything of valuewas exchanged, if the defendant—(i) transported, transferred, or otherwise disposed of two or more firearms to another individual, or received two or more firearms with the intent to transport, transfer, or otherwise dispose of firearms to another individual; and(ii) knew or had reason to believe that such conduct would result in the transport, transfer, or disposal of a firearm to an individual—(I) whose possession or receipt of the firearm would be unlawful; or(II) who intended to use or dispose of the firearm unlawfully.

(B) Definitions.—For purposes of this subsection:“Individual whose possession or receipt of the firearm would be unlawful”means an individual who (i) has a prior conviction for a crime of violence, a controlled substance offense, or a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence; or (ii) at the time of the offense was under a criminal justice sentence, including probation, parole, supervised release, imprisonment, work release, or escape status. “Crime ofviolence” and “controlled substance offense” have the meaning given those terms in§4B1.2 (Definitions of Terms Used in Section 4B1.1). “Misdemeanor crime of domestic violence” has the meaning given that term in 18 U.S.C. § 921(a)(33)(A).

The term “defendant”, consistent with §1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct), limits the accountability of the defendant to the defendant’s own conduct and conduct that the defendant aided or abetted, counseled, commanded, induced, procured, or willfullycaused.

(C) Upward Departure Provision.—If the defendant trafficked substantially morethan 25 firearms, an upward departure may be warranted.

(D) Interaction with Other Subsections.—In a case in which three or more firearmswere both possessed and trafficked, apply both subsections (b)(1) and (b)(5). If the defendant used or transferred one of such firearms in connection with another felony offense (i.e., an offense other than a firearms possession or trafficking offense)an enhancement under subsection (b)(6)(B) also would apply.

§2K2.114. Application of Subsections (b)(6)(B) and (c)(1).—(A) In General.—Subsections (b)(6)(B) and (c)(1) apply if the firearm or ammunitionfacilitated, or had the potential of facilitating, another felony offense or anotheroffense, respectively. However, subsection (c)(1) contains the additional requirement that the firearm or ammunition be cited in the offense of conviction.

(B) Application When Other Offense is Burglary or Drug Offense.—Subsections (b)(6)(B) and (c)(1) apply (i) in a case in which a defendant who, during the course of a burglary, finds and takes a firearm, even if the defendant did not engagein any other conduct with that firearm during the course of the burglary; and (ii) inthe case of a drug trafficking offense in which a firearm is found in close proximityto drugs, drug-manufacturing materials, or drug paraphernalia. In these cases, application of subsections (b)(6)(B) and, if the firearm was cited in the offense of conviction, (c)(1) is warranted because the presence of the firearm has the potential offacilitating another felony offense or another offense, respectively.

(C) Definitions.—“Another felony offense”, for purposes of subsection (b)(6)(B), means any federal, state, or local offense, other than the explosive or firearms possession or traffickingoffense, punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, regardless ofwhether a criminal charge was brought, or a conviction obtained.

“Another offense”, for purposes of subsection (c)(1), means any federal, state, orlocal offense, other than the explosive or firearms possession or trafficking offense, regardless of whether a criminal charge was brought, or a conviction obtained.

(D) Upward Departure Provision.—In a case in which the defendant used or possessed a firearm or explosive to facilitate another firearms or explosives offense(e.g., the defendant used or possessed a firearm to protect the delivery of an unlawful shipment of explosives), an upward departure under §5K2.6 (Weapons and Dangerous Instrumentalities) may be warranted.

(E) Relationship Between the Instant Offense and the Other Offense.—In determining whether subsections (b)(6)(B) and (c)(1) apply, the court must considerthe relationship between the instant offense and the other offense, consistent with relevant conduct principles. See §1B1.3(a)(1)–(4) and accompanying commentary.

In determining whether subsection (c)(1) applies, the court must also considerwhether the firearm used in the other offense was a firearm cited in the offense ofconviction.

For example:(i) Firearm Cited in the Offense of Conviction. Defendant A’s offense of conviction is for unlawfully possessing a shotgun on October 15. The court determines that, on the preceding February 10, Defendant A used the shotgun inconnection with a robbery. Ordinarily, under these circumstances, subsection(b)(6)(B) applies, and the cross reference in subsection (c)(1) also applies if itresults in a greater offense level.

Ordinarily, the unlawful possession of the shotgun on February 10 will be“part of the same course of conduct or common scheme or plan” as the unlawful§2K2.1possession of the same shotgun on October 15. See §1B1.3(a)(2) and accompanying commentary (including, in particular, the factors discussed in Application Note 5(B) to §1B1.3). The use of the shotgun “in connection with” the robbery is relevant conduct because it is a factor specified in subsections (b)(6)(B)and (c)(1). See §1B1.3(a)(4) (“any other information specified in the applicableguideline”).

(ii) Firearm Not Cited in the Offense of Conviction. Defendant B’s offenseof conviction is for unlawfully possessing a shotgun on October 15. The courtdetermines that, on the preceding February 10, Defendant B unlawfully possessed a handgun (not cited in the offense of conviction) and used the handgunin connection with a robbery.

Subsection (b)(6)(B). In determining whether subsection (b)(6)(B) applies, the threshold question for the court is whether the two unlawful possessionoffenses (the shotgun on October 15 and the handgun on February 10) were“part of the same course of conduct or common scheme or plan”.

See §1B1.3(a)(2) and accompanying commentary (including, in particular, the factors discussed in Application Note 5(B) to §1B1.3).

If they were, then the handgun possession offense is relevant conduct to the shotgun possession offense, and the use of the handgun “in connection with”the robbery is relevant conduct because it is a factor specified in subsection (b)(6)(B). See §1B1.3(a)(4) (“any other information specified in the applicable guideline”). Accordingly, subsection (b)(6)(B) applies.

On the other hand, if the court determines that the two unlawful possessionoffenses were not “part of the same course of conduct or common scheme orplan,” then the handgun possession offense is not relevant conduct to the shotgun possession offense and subsection (b)(6)(B) does not apply.

Subsection (c)(1). Under these circumstances, the cross reference in subsection (c)(1) does not apply, because the handgun was not cited in the offense ofconviction.

15. Certain Convictions Under 18 U.S.C. §§ 922(a)(6), 922(d), and 924(a)(1)(A).—In a case in which the defendant is convicted under 18 U.S.C. §§ 922(a)(6), 922(d), or924(a)(1)(A), a downward departure may be warranted if (A) none of the enhancementsin subsection (b) apply, (B) the defendant was motivated by an intimate or familial relationship or by threats or fear to commit the offense and was otherwise unlikely to commitsuch an offense, and (C) the defendant received no monetary compensation from the offense.

CommentaryStatutory Provisions: 18 U.S.C. §§ 844(h), 924(c), 929(a).

Application Notes:1. Application of Subsection (a).—Section 844(h) of title 18, United State Code, providesa mandatory term of imprisonment of 10 years (or 20 years for the second or subsequentoffense). Accordingly, the guideline sentence for a defendant convicted under 18 U.S.C.

§ 844(h) is the term required by that statute. Section 844(h) of title 18, United State Code, also requires a term of imprisonment imposed under this section to run consecutively toany other term of imprisonment.

2. Application of Subsection (b).—(A) In General.—Sections 924(c) and 929(a) of title 18, United States Code, providemandatory minimum terms of imprisonment (e.g., not less than five years). Exceptas provided in subsection (c), in a case in which the defendant is convicted under18 U.S.C. § 924(c) or § 929(a), the guideline sentence is the minimum term requiredby the relevant statute. Each of 18 U.S.C. §§ 924(c) and 929(a) also requires that a term of imprisonment imposed under that section shall run consecutively to anyother term of imprisonment.

(B) Upward Departure Provision.—In a case in which the guideline sentence is determined under subsection (b), a sentence above the minimum term required by18 U.S.C. § 924(c) or § 929(a) is an upward departure from the guideline sentence.

A departure may be warranted, for example, to reflect the seriousness of the defendant’s criminal history in a case in which the defendant is convicted of an18 U.S.C. § 924(c) or § 929(a) offense but is not determined to be a career offenderunder §4B1.1.

3. Application of Subsection (c).—In a case in which the defendant (A) was convicted ofviolating 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) or 18 U.S.C. § 929(a); and (B) as a result of that conviction(alone or in addition to another offense of conviction), is determined to be a career offender under §4B1.1 (Career Offender), the guideline sentence shall be determined under§4B1.1(c). In a case involving multiple counts, the sentence shall be imposed accordingto the rules in subsection (e) of §5G1.2 (Sentencing on Multiple Counts of Conviction)4. Weapon Enhancement.—If a sentence under this guideline is imposed in conjunctionwith a sentence for an underlying offense, do not apply any specific offense characteristicfor possession, brandishing, use, or discharge of an explosive or firearm when determining the sentence for the underlying offense. A sentence under this guideline accounts for any explosive or weapon enhancement for the underlying offense of conviction, includingany such enhancement that would apply based on conduct for which the defendant is accountable under §1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct). Do not apply any weapon enhancement inthe guideline for the underlying offense, for example, if (A) a co-defendant, as part of the jointly undertaken criminal activity, possessed a firearm different from the one for which§2K2.4the defendant was convicted under 18 U.S.C. § 924(c); or (B) in an ongoing drug trafficking offense, the defendant possessed a firearm other than the one for which the defendantwas convicted under 18 U.S.C. § 924(c). However, if a defendant is convicted of two armedbank robberies, but is convicted under 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) in connection with only one ofthe robberies, a weapon enhancement would apply to the bank robbery which was not the basis for the 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) conviction.

A sentence under this guideline also accounts for conduct that would subject the defendant to an enhancement under §2D1.1(b)(2) (pertaining to use of violence, credible threatto use violence, or directing the use of violence). Do not apply that enhancement whendetermining the sentence for the underlying offense.

If the explosive or weapon that was possessed, brandished, used, or discharged in the course of the underlying offense also results in a conviction that would subject the defendant to an enhancement under §2K1.3(b)(3) (pertaining to possession of explosive material in connection with another felony offense) or §2K2.1(b)(6)(B) (pertaining to possession of any firearm or ammunition in connection with another felony offense), do not apply that enhancement. A sentence under this guideline accounts for the conduct covered by these enhancements because of the relatedness of that conduct to the conductthat forms the basis for the conviction under 18 U.S.C. § 844(h), § 924(c) or § 929(a). Forexample, if in addition to a conviction for an underlying offense of armed bank robbery, the defendant was convicted of being a felon in possession under 18 U.S.C. § 922(g), the enhancement under §2K2.1(b)(6)(B) would not apply.

In a few cases in which the defendant is determined not to be a career offender, the offense level for the underlying offense determined under the preceding paragraphs mayresult in a guideline range that, when combined with the mandatory consecutive sentence under 18 U.S.C. § 844(h), § 924(c), or § 929(a), produces a total maximum penaltythat is less than the maximum of the guideline range that would have resulted had therenot been a count of conviction under 18 U.S.C. § 844(h), § 924(c), or § 929(a) (i.e., the guideline range that would have resulted if the enhancements for possession, use, or discharge of a firearm had been applied). In such a case, an upward departure may be warranted so that the conviction under 18 U.S.C. § 844(h), § 924(c), or § 929(a) does not resultin a decrease in the total punishment. An upward departure under this paragraph shallnot exceed the maximum of the guideline range that would have resulted had there not been a count of conviction under 18 U.S.C. § 844(h), § 924(c), or § 929(a).

5. Chapters Three and Four.—Except for those cases covered by subsection (c), do not apply Chapter Three (Adjustments) and Chapter Four (Criminal History and CriminalLivelihood) to any offense sentenced under this guideline. Such offenses are excludedfrom application of those chapters because the guideline sentence for each offense is determined only by the relevant statute. See §§3D1.1 (Procedure for Determining OffenseLevel on Multiple Counts) and 5G1.2. In determining the guideline sentence for thosecases covered by subsection (c): (A) the adjustment in §3E1.1 (Acceptance of Responsibility) may apply, as provided in §4B1.1(c); and (B) no other adjustments in Chapter Threeand no provisions of Chapter Four, other than §§4B1.1 and 4B1.2, shall apply.

6. Terms of Supervised Release.—Imposition of a term of supervised release is governedby the provisions of §5D1.1 (Imposition of a Term of Supervised Release).

7. Fines.—Subsection (d) sets forth special provisions concerning the imposition of fines.

Where there is also a conviction for the underlying offense, a consolidated fine guidelineis determined by the offense level that would have applied to the underlying offense absent a conviction under 18 U.S.C. § 844(h), § 924(c), or § 929(a). This is required because§2K2.5the offense level for the underlying offense may be reduced when there is also a convictionunder 18 U.S.C. § 844(h), § 924(c), or § 929(a) in that any specific offense characteristicfor possession, brandishing, use, or discharge of a firearm is not applied (see ApplicationNote 4). The Commission has not established a fine guideline range for the unusual casein which there is no conviction for the underlying offense, although a fine is authorizedunder 18 U.S.C. § 3571.

Background: Section 844(h) of title 18, United States Code, provides a mandatory term ofimprisonment. Sections 924(c) and 929(a) of title 18, United States Code, provide mandatoryminimum terms of imprisonment. A sentence imposed pursuant to any of these statutes mustbe imposed to run consecutively to any other term of imprisonment. To avoid double counting, when a sentence under this section is imposed in conjunction with a sentence for an underlyingoffense, any specific offense characteristic for explosive or firearm discharge, use, brandishing, or possession is not applied in respect to such underlying offense.

Possession of Firearm or Dangerous Weapon in Federal Facility;Possession or Discharge of Firearm in School Zone(a) Base Offense Level: 6(b) Specific Offense Characteristic(1) If—(A) the defendant unlawfully possessed or caused any firearmor dangerous weapon to be present in a federal court facility; or(B) the defendant unlawfully possessed or caused any firearmto be present in a school zone, increase by 2 levels.

(c) Cross Reference(1) If the defendant used or possessed any firearm or dangerousweapon in connection with the commission or attempted commission of another offense, or possessed or transferred a firearm or dangerous weapon with knowledge or intent that itwould be used or possessed in connection with another offense, apply—§2K2.6(A) §2X1.1 (Attempt, Solicitation, or Conspiracy) in respect tothat other offense if the resulting offense level is greaterthan that determined above; or(B) if death resulted, the most analogous offense guidelinefrom Chapter Two, Part A, Subpart 1 (Homicide), if the resulting offense level is greater than that determinedabove.

CommentaryStatutory Provisions: 18 U.S.C. §§ 922(q), 930; 40 U.S.C. § 5104(e)(1).

Application Notes:1. “Dangerous weapon” and “firearm” are defined in the Commentary to §1B1.1 (Application Instructions).

2. “Federal court facility” includes the courtroom; judges’ chambers; witness rooms; jurydeliberation rooms; attorney conference rooms; prisoner holding cells; offices and parkingfacilities of the court clerks, the United States attorney, and the United States marshal;probation and parole offices; and adjoining corridors and parking facilities of any courtof the United States. See 18 U.S.C. § 930(g)(3).

3. “School zone” is defined at 18 U.S.C. § 922(q). A sentence of imprisonment under18 U.S.C. § 922(q) must run consecutively to any sentence of imprisonment imposed for any other offense. See 18 U.S.C. § 924(a)(4). In order to comply with the statute, whenthe guideline range is based on the underlying offense, and the defendant is convictedboth of the underlying offense and 18 U.S.C. § 922(q), the court should apportion the sentence between the count for the underlying offense and the count under 18 U.S.C.

§ 922(q). For example, if the guideline range is 30–37 months and the court determines“total punishment” of 36 months is appropriate, a sentence of 30 months for the underlying offense, plus 6 months under 18 U.S.C. § 922(q) would satisfy this requirement.

4. Where the firearm was brandished, discharged, or otherwise used, in a federal facility, federal court facility, or school zone, and the cross reference from subsection (c)(1) doesnot apply, an upward departure may be warranted.

§2K3.1CommentaryStatutory Provision: 18 U.S.C. § 931.

Application Notes:1. Application of Subsection (b)(1).—(A) Meaning of “Defendant”.—Consistent with §1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct), the term“defendant”, for purposes of subsection (b)(1), limits the accountability of the defendant to the defendant’s own conduct and conduct that the defendant aided orabetted, counseled, commanded, induced, procured, or willfully caused.

(B) Meaning of “Felony Offense”.—For purposes of subsection (b)(1), “felony offense” means any offense (federal, state, or local) punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, regardless of whether a criminal charge was brought, ora conviction obtained.

(C) Meaning of “Used”.—For purposes of subsection (b)(1), “used” means the bodyarmor was (i) actively employed in a manner to protect the person from gunfire; or(ii) used as a means of bartering. Subsection (b)(1) does not apply if the body armorwas merely possessed. For example, subsection (b)(1) would not apply if the bodyarmor was found in the trunk of a car but was not being actively used as protection.

2. Inapplicability of §3B1.5.—If subsection (b)(1) applies, do not apply the adjustment in§3B1.5 (Use of Body Armor in Drug Trafficking Crimes and Crimes of Violence).

3. Grouping of Multiple Counts.—If subsection (b)(1) applies (because the defendantused the body armor in connection with another felony offense) and the instant offenseof conviction includes a count of conviction for that other felony offense, the counts ofconviction for the 18 U.S.C. § 931 offense and that other felony offense shall be groupedpursuant to subsection (c) of §3D1.2 (Groups of Closely Related Counts).

“Aggravated felony” has the meaning given that term in section 101(a)(43) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43)), without regard to the date of conviction for the aggravated felony.

“Child” has the meaning set forth in section 101(b)(1) of the Immigration and NationalityAct (8 U.S.C. § 1101(b)(1)).

“Spouse” has the meaning set forth in 101(a)(35) of the Immigration and Nationality Act(8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(35)).

For additional statutory provision(s), see Appendix A (Statutory Index).

Application Notes:1. In General.—(A) “Ordered Deported or Ordered Removed from the United States for the First Time”.—For purposes of this guideline, a defendant shall be considered “ordered deported or ordered removed from the United States” if the defendant wasordered deported or ordered removed from the United States based on a final orderof exclusion, deportation, or removal, regardless of whether the order was in response to a conviction. “For the first time” refers to the first time the defendant wasever the subject of such an order.

(B) Offenses Committed Prior to Age Eighteen.—Subsections (b)(1), (b)(2), and(b)(3) do not apply to a conviction for an offense committed before the defendantwas eighteen years of age unless such conviction is classified as an adult convictionunder the laws of the jurisdiction in which the defendant was convicted.

2. Definitions.—For purposes of this guideline:“Crime of violence” means any of the following offenses under federal, state, or locallaw: murder, voluntary manslaughter, kidnapping, aggravated assault, a forcible sex offense, robbery, arson, extortion, the use or unlawful possession of a firearm described in26 U.S.C. § 5845(a) or explosive material as defined in 18 U.S.C. § 841(c), or any otheroffense under federal, state, or local law that has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another. “Forcible sex offense”includes where consent to the conduct is not given or is not legally valid, such as whereconsent to the conduct is involuntary, incompetent, or coerced. The offenses of sexualabuse of a minor and statutory rape are included only if the sexual abuse of a minor orstatutory rape was (A) an offense described in 18 U.S.C. § 2241(c) or (B) an offense understate law that would have been an offense under section 2241(c) if the offense had oc§2L1.2curred within the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States. “Extortion” is obtaining something of value from another by the wrongful use of (A) force, (B) fear of physical injury, or (C) threat of physical injury.

“Drug trafficking offense” means an offense under federal, state, or local law that prohibits the manufacture, import, export, distribution, or dispensing of, or offer to sell a controlled substance (or a counterfeit substance) or the possession of a controlled substance (or a counterfeit substance) with intent to manufacture, import, export, distribute, or dispense.

“Felony” means any federal, state, or local offense punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year.

“Illegal reentry offense” means (A) an offense under 8 U.S.C. § 1253 or § 1326, or (B) a second or subsequent offense under 8 U.S.C. § 1325(a).

“Misdemeanor” means any federal, state, or local offense punishable by a term of imprisonment of one year or less.

“Sentence imposed” has the meaning given the term “sentence of imprisonment” in Application Note 2 and subsection (b) of §4A1.2 (Definitions and Instructions for ComputingCriminal History). The length of the sentence imposed includes any term of imprisonment given upon revocation of probation, parole, or supervised release.

3. Criminal History Points.—For purposes of applying subsections (b)(1), (b)(2), and(b)(3), use only those convictions that receive criminal history points under §4A1.1(a), (b), or (c). In addition, for purposes of subsections (b)(1)(B), (b)(2)(E), and (b)(3)(E), use onlythose convictions that are counted separately under §4A1.2(a)(2).

A conviction taken into account under subsection (b)(1), (b)(2), or (b)(3) is not excludedfrom consideration of whether that conviction receives criminal history points pursuantto Chapter Four, Part A (Criminal History).

4. Cases in Which Sentences for An Illegal Reentry Offense and Another FelonyOffense were Imposed at the Same Time.—There may be cases in which the sentences for an illegal reentry offense and another felony offense were imposed at the sametime and treated as a single sentence for purposes of calculating the criminal historyscore under §4A1.1(a), (b), and (c). In such a case, use the illegal reentry offense in determining the appropriate enhancement under subsection (b)(1), if it independently wouldhave received criminal history points. In addition, use the prior sentence for the otherfelony offense in determining the appropriate enhancement under subsection (b)(3), if itindependently would have received criminal history points.

5. Departure Based on Seriousness of a Prior Offense.—There may be cases in whichthe offense level provided by an enhancement in subsection (b)(2) or (b)(3) substantiallyunderstates or overstates the seriousness of the conduct underlying the prior offense, because (A) the length of the sentence imposed does not reflect the seriousness of the prior offense; (B) the prior conviction is too remote to receive criminal history points(see §4A1.2(e)); or (C) the time actually served was substantially less than the length ofthe sentence imposed for the prior offense. In such a case, a departure may be warranted.

6. Departure Based on Time Served in State Custody.—In a case in which the defendant is located by immigration authorities while the defendant is serving time in statecustody, whether pre- or post-conviction, for a state offense, the time served is not covered§2L1.3by an adjustment under §5G1.3(b) and, accordingly, is not covered by a departure under§5K2.23 (Discharged Terms of Imprisonment). See §5G1.3(a). In such a case, the courtmay consider whether a departure is appropriate to reflect all or part of the time servedin state custody, from the time immigration authorities locate the defendant until the service of the federal sentence commences, that the court determines will not be creditedto the federal sentence by the Bureau of Prisons. Any such departure should be fashionedto achieve a reasonable punishment for the instant offense.

Such a departure should be considered only in cases where the departure is not likely toincrease the risk to the public from further crimes of the defendant. In determiningwhether such a departure is appropriate, the court should consider, among other things, (A) whether the defendant engaged in additional criminal activity after illegally reentering the United States; (B) the seriousness of any such additional criminal activity, including (1) whether the defendant used violence or credible threats of violence or possessed a firearm or other dangerous weapon (or induced another person to do so) in connection with the criminal activity, (2) whether the criminal activity resulted in death orserious bodily injury to any person, and (3) whether the defendant was an organizer, leader, manager, or supervisor of others in the criminal activity; and (C) the seriousnessof the defendant’s other criminal history.

7. Departure Based on Cultural Assimilation.—There may be cases in which a downward departure may be appropriate on the basis of cultural assimilation. Such a departure should be considered only in cases where (A) the defendant formed cultural ties primarily with the United States from having resided continuously in the United Statesfrom childhood, (B) those cultural ties provided the primary motivation for the defendant’s illegal reentry or continued presence in the United States, and (C) such a departureis not likely to increase the risk to the public from further crimes of the defendant.

In determining whether such a departure is appropriate, the court should consider, among other things, (1) the age in childhood at which the defendant began residing continuously in the United States, (2) whether and for how long the defendant attendedschool in the United States, (3) the duration of the defendant’s continued residence in the United States, (4) the duration of the defendant’s presence outside the United States, (5) the nature and extent of the defendant’s familial and cultural ties inside the UnitedStates, and the nature and extent of such ties outside the United States, (6) the seriousness of the defendant’s criminal history, and (7) whether the defendant engaged in additional criminal activity after illegally reentering the United States.

§2P1.2Application Notes:1. “Non-secure custody” means custody with no significant physical restraint (e.g., wherea defendant walked away from a work detail outside the security perimeter of an institution; where a defendant failed to return to any institution from a pass or unescortedfurlough; or where a defendant escaped from an institution with no physical perimeterbarrier).

2. “Returned voluntarily” includes voluntarily returning to the institution or turningone’s self in to a law enforcement authority as an escapee (not in connection with anarrest or other charges).

3. If the adjustment in subsection (b)(4) applies, no adjustment is to be made under §3B1.3(Abuse of Position of Trust or Use of Special Skill).

(b) Specific Offense Characteristic(1) If the defendant was a law enforcement or correctional officeror employee, or an employee of the Department of Justice, atthe time of the offense, increase by 2 levels.

(c) Cross Reference(1) If the object of the offense was the distribution of a controlledsubstance, apply the offense level from §2D1.1 (Unlawful Manufacturing, Importing, Exporting, or Trafficking; Attempt orConspiracy). Provided, that if the defendant is convicted under18 U.S.C. § 1791(a)(1) and is punishable under 18 U.S.C.

§ 1791(b)(1), and the resulting offense level is less than level 26, increase to level 26.

CommentaryStatutory Provision: 18 U.S.C. § 1791.

Application Notes:1. In this guideline, the term “mobile phone or similar device” means a phone or otherdevice as described in 18 U.S.C. § 1791(d)(1)(F).

2. If the adjustment in §2P1.2(b)(1) applies, no adjustment is to be made under §3B1.3(Abuse of Position of Trust or Use of Special Skill).

3. In a case in which the defendant is convicted of the underlying offense and an offenseinvolving providing or possessing a controlled substance in prison, group the offensestogether under §3D1.2(c). (Note that 18 U.S.C. § 1791(b) does not require a sentence ofimprisonment, although if a sentence of imprisonment is imposed on a count involvingproviding or possessing a controlled substance in prison, section 1791(c) requires that the sentence be imposed to run consecutively to any other sentence of imprisonment for the controlled substance. Therefore, unlike a count in which the statute mandates both a minimum and a consecutive sentence of imprisonment, the grouping rules of§§3D1.1–3D1.5 apply. See §3D1.1(b)(1), comment. (n.1), and §3D1.2, comment. (n.1).) Thecombined sentence will then be constructed to provide a “total punishment” that satisfiesthe requirements both of §5G1.2 (Sentencing on Multiple Counts of Conviction) and18 U.S.C. § 1791(c). For example, if the combined applicable guideline range for bothcounts is 30–37 months and the court determines a “total punishment” of 36 months is appropriate, a sentence of 30 months for the underlying offense plus a consecutive sixmonths’ sentence for the providing or possessing a controlled substance in prison countwould satisfy these requirements.

§2P1.4Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 1791(c), a sentence imposed upon an inmate for a violation of18 U.S.C. § 1791 shall be consecutive to the sentence being served by the inmate at the time of the violation.

Application Notes:1. “Recordkeeping offense” includes both recordkeeping and reporting offenses. The termis to be broadly construed as including failure to report discharges, releases, or emissionswhere required; the giving of false information; failure to file other required reports orprovide necessary information; and failure to prepare, maintain, or provide records asprescribed.

2. “Simple recordkeeping or reporting violation” means a recordkeeping or reportingoffense in a situation where the defendant neither knew nor had reason to believe thatthe recordkeeping offense would significantly increase the likelihood of any substantiveenvironmental harm.

3. This section applies to offenses involving pesticides or substances designated toxic orhazardous at the time of the offense by statute or regulation. A listing of hazardous andtoxic substances in the guidelines would be impractical. Several federal statutes (or regulations promulgated thereunder) list toxics, hazardous wastes and substances, and pesticides. These lists, such as those of toxic pollutants for which effluent standards arepublished under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (e.g., 33 U.S.C. § 1317) as wellas the designation of hazardous substances under the Comprehensive EnvironmentalResponse, Compensation and Liability Act (e.g., 42 U.S.C. § 9601(14)), are revised fromtime to time. “Toxic” and “hazardous” are defined differently in various statutes, but the common dictionary meanings of the words are not significantly different.

§2Q1.24. Except when the adjustment in subsection (b)(6) for simple recordkeeping offenses applies, this section assumes knowing conduct. In cases involving negligent conduct, a downward departure may be warranted.

5. Subsection (b)(1) assumes a discharge or emission into the environment resulting in actual environmental contamination. A wide range of conduct, involving the handling ofdifferent quantities of materials with widely differing propensities, potentially is covered.

Depending upon the harm resulting from the emission, release or discharge, the quantityand nature of the substance or pollutant, the duration of the offense and the risk associated with the violation, a departure of up to two levels in either direction from the offenselevels prescribed in these specific offense characteristics may be appropriate.

6. Subsection (b)(2) applies to offenses where the public health is seriously endangered. Depending upon the nature of the risk created and the number of people placed at risk, a departure of up to three levels upward or downward may be warranted. If death or serious bodily injury results, a departure would be called for. See Chapter Five, Part K (Departures).

7. Subsection (b)(3) provides an enhancement where a public disruption, evacuation orcleanup at substantial expense has been required. Depending upon the nature of the contamination involved, a departure of up to two levels either upward or downward couldbe warranted.

8. Subsection (b)(4) applies where the offense involved violation of a permit, or where therewas a failure to obtain a permit when one was required. Depending upon the nature andquantity of the substance involved and the risk associated with the offense, a departureof up to two levels either upward or downward may be warranted.

9. Other Upward Departure Provisions.—(A) Civil Adjudications and Failure to Comply with Administrative Order.—In a case in which the defendant has previously engaged in similar misconduct established by a civil adjudication or has failed to comply with an administrative order, an upward departure may be warranted. See §4A1.3 (Departures Based on Inadequacy of Criminal History Category).

(B) Extreme Psychological Injury.—If the offense caused extreme psychological injury, an upward departure may be warranted. See §5K2.3 (Extreme PsychologicalInjury).

(C) Terrorism.—If the offense was calculated to influence or affect the conduct of government by intimidation or coercion, or to retaliate against government conduct, anupward departure would be warranted. See Application Note 4 of the Commentaryto §3A1.4 (Terrorism).

Background: This section applies both to substantive violations of the statute governing the handling of pesticides and toxic and hazardous substances and to recordkeeping offenses. Thefirst four specific offense characteristics provide enhancements when the offense involved a substantive violation. The fifth and sixth specific offense characteristics apply to recordkeeping offenses. Although other sections of the guidelines generally prescribe a base offense levelof 6 for regulatory violations, §2Q1.2 prescribes a base offense level of 8 because of the inherently dangerous nature of hazardous and toxic substances and pesticides. A decrease of 2 levelsis provided, however, for “simple recordkeeping or reporting violations” under §2Q1.2(b)(6).

§2Q2.2Application Notes:1. “For pecuniary gain” means for receipt of, or in anticipation of receipt of, anything ofvalue, whether monetary or in goods or services. Thus, offenses committed for pecuniarygain include both monetary and barter transactions. Similarly, activities designed to increase gross revenue are considered to be committed for pecuniary gain.

2. The acquisition of fish, wildlife, or plants for display to the public, whether for a fee ordonation and whether by an individual or an organization, including a governmental entity, a private non-profit organization, or a private for-profit organization, shall be considered to involve a “commercial purpose.”3. For purposes of subsection (b)(2), the quarantine requirements include those set forth in9 C.F.R. Part 92, and 7 C.F.R., Subtitle B, Chapter III. State quarantine laws are included as well.

4. When information is reasonably available, “market value” under subsection (b)(3)(A)shall be based on the fair-market retail price. Where the fair-market retail price is difficult to ascertain, the court may make a reasonable estimate using any reliable information, such as the reasonable replacement or restitution cost or the acquisition andpreservation (e.g., taxidermy) cost. Market value, however, shall not be based on measurement of aesthetic loss (so called “contingent valuation” methods).

5. If the offense involved the destruction of a substantial quantity of fish, wildlife, or plants, and the seriousness of the offense is not adequately measured by the market value, anupward departure may be warranted.

§2R1.1PART R ― ANTITRUST OFFENSES§2R1.1. Bid-Rigging, Price-Fixing or Market-Allocation Agreements AmongCompetitors(a) Base Offense Level: 12(b) Specific Offense Characteristics(1) If the conduct involved participation in an agreement to submitnon-competitive bids, increase by 1 level.

(2) If the volume of commerce attributable to the defendant wasmore than $1,000,000, adjust the offense level as follows:VOLUME OF ADJUSTMENT TOCOMMERCE (APPLY THE GREATEST) OFFENSE LEVEL(A) More than $1,000,000 add 2(B) More than $10,000,000 add 4(C) More than $50,000,000 add 6(D) More than $100,000,000 add 8(E) More than $300,000,000 add 10(F) More than $600,000,000 add 12(G) More than $1,200,000,000 add 14(H) More than $1,850,000,000 add 16.

For purposes of this guideline, the volume of commerce attributable to an individual participant in a conspiracy is the volume of commerce done by him or his principal in goods orservices that were affected by the violation. When multiplecounts or conspiracies are involved, the volume of commerceshould be treated cumulatively to determine a single, combinedoffense level.

(c) Special Instruction for Fines(1) For an individual, the guideline fine range shall be from one tofive percent of the volume of commerce, but not less than $20,000.

(d) Special Instructions for Fines ― Organizations(1) In lieu of the pecuniary loss under subsection (a)(3) of §8C2.4(Base Fine), use 20 percent of the volume of affected commerce.

§2R1.1(2) When applying §8C2.6 (Minimum and Maximum Multipliers), neither the minimum nor maximum multiplier shall be lessthan 0.75.

(3) In a bid-rigging case in which the organization submitted oneor more complementary bids, use as the organization’s volumeof commerce the greater of (A) the volume of commerce done bythe organization in the goods or services that were affected bythe violation, or (B) the largest contract on which the organization submitted a complementary bid in connection with the bidrigging conspiracy.

CommentaryStatutory Provisions: 15 U.S.C. §§ 1, 3(b). For additional statutory provision(s), see Appendix A (Statutory Index).

Application Notes:1. Application of Chapter Three (Adjustments).—Sections 3B1.1 (Aggravating Role), 3B1.2 (Mitigating Role), 3B1.3 (Abuse of Position of Trust or Use of Special Skill), and3C1.1 (Obstructing or Impeding the Administration of Justice) may be relevant in determining the seriousness of the defendant’s offense. For example, if a sales manager organizes or leads the price-fixing activity of five or more participants, the 4-level increase at§3B1.1(a) should be applied to reflect the defendant’s aggravated role in the offense. Forpurposes of applying §3B1.2, an individual defendant should be considered for a mitigating role adjustment only if he were responsible in some minor way for his firm’s participation in the conspiracy.

2. Considerations in Setting Fine for Individuals.—In setting the fine for individuals, the court should consider the extent of the defendant’s participation in the offense, the defendant’s role, and the degree to which the defendant personally profited from the offense (including salary, bonuses, and career enhancement). If the court concludes thatthe defendant lacks the ability to pay the guideline fine, it should impose communityservice in lieu of a portion of the fine. The community service should be equally as burdensome as a fine.

3. The fine for an organization is determined by applying Chapter Eight (Sentencing of Organizations). In selecting a fine for an organization within the guideline fine range, the court should consider both the gain to the organization from the offense and the losscaused by the organization. It is estimated that the average gain from price-fixing is 10 percent of the selling price. The loss from price-fixing exceeds the gain because, amongother things, injury is inflicted upon consumers who are unable or for other reasons donot buy the product at the higher prices. Because the loss from price-fixing exceeds the gain, subsection (d)(1) provides that 20 percent of the volume of affected commerce is tobe used in lieu of the pecuniary loss under §8C2.4(a)(3). The purpose for specifying a percent of the volume of commerce is to avoid the time and expense that would be required for the court to determine the actual gain or loss. In cases in which the actualmonopoly overcharge appears to be either substantially more or substantially less than 10 percent, this factor should be considered in setting the fine within the guideline finerange.

§2R1.14. Another consideration in setting the fine is that the average level of mark-up due to pricefixing may tend to decline with the volume of commerce involved.

5. It is the intent of the Commission that alternatives such as community confinement not be used to avoid imprisonment of antitrust offenders.

6. Understatement of seriousness is especially likely in cases involving complementarybids. If, for example, the defendant participated in an agreement not to submit a bid, orto submit an unreasonably high bid, on one occasion, in exchange for his being allowedto win a subsequent bid that he did not in fact win, his volume of commerce would bezero, although he would have contributed to harm that possibly was quite substantial.

The court should consider sentences near the top of the guideline range in such cases.

7. In the case of a defendant with previous antitrust convictions, a sentence at the maximum of the applicable guideline range, or an upward departure, may be warranted.

See §4A1.3 (Adequacy of Criminal History Category).

Background: These guidelines apply to violations of the antitrust laws. Although they arenot unlawful in all countries, there is near universal agreement that restrictive agreementsamong competitors, such as horizontal price-fixing (including bid-rigging) and horizontal market-allocation, can cause serious economic harm. There is no consensus, however, about the harmfulness of other types of antitrust offenses, which furthermore are rarely prosecuted andmay involve unsettled issues of law. Consequently, only one guideline, which deals with horizontal agreements in restraint of trade, has been promulgated.

The agreements among competitors covered by this section are almost invariably covertconspiracies that are intended to, and serve no purpose other than to, restrict output and raiseprices, and that are so plainly anticompetitive that they have been recognized as illegal per se, i.e., without any inquiry in individual cases as to their actual competitive effect.

Under the guidelines, prison terms for these offenders should be much more common, and usually somewhat longer, than typical under pre-guidelines practice. Absent adjustments, the guidelines require some period of confinement in the great majority of cases that are prosecuted, including all bid-rigging cases. The court will have the discretion to impose considerably longer sentences within the guideline ranges. Adjustments from Chapter Three, Part E(Acceptance of Responsibility) and, in rare instances, Chapter Three, Part B (Role in the Offense), may decrease these minimum sentences; nonetheless, in very few cases will the guidelines not require that some confinement be imposed. Adjustments will not affect the level offines.

Tying the offense level to the scale or scope of the offense is important in order to ensurethat the sanction is in fact punitive and that there is an incentive to desist from a violationonce it has begun. The offense levels are not based directly on the damage caused or profitmade by the defendant because damages are difficult and time consuming to establish. Thevolume of commerce is an acceptable and more readily measurable substitute. The limitedempirical data available as to pre-guidelines practice showed that fines increased with the volume of commerce and the term of imprisonment probably did as well.

The Commission believes that the volume of commerce is liable to be an understatedmeasure of seriousness in some bid-rigging cases. For this reason, and consistent with preguidelines practice, the Commission has specified a 1-level increase for bid-rigging.

Substantial fines are an essential part of the sentence. For an individual, the guidelinefine range is from one to five percent of the volume of commerce, but not less than $20,000.

§2R1.1For an organization, the guideline fine range is determined under Chapter Eight (Sentencingof Organizations), but pursuant to subsection (d)(2), the minimum multiplier is at least 0.75.

This multiplier, which requires a minimum fine of 15 percent of the volume of commerce for the least serious case, was selected to provide an effective deterrent to antitrust offenses. Atthe same time, this minimum multiplier maintains incentives for desired organizational behavior. Because the Department of Justice has a well-established amnesty program for organizations that self-report antitrust offenses, no lower minimum multiplier is needed as an incentive for self-reporting. A minimum multiplier of at least 0.75 ensures that fines imposed inantitrust cases will exceed the average monopoly overcharge.

The Commission believes that most antitrust defendants have the resources and earningcapacity to pay the fines called for by this guideline, at least over time on an installment basis.

2. Application of Subsection (a)(1).—(A) Multiple Underlying Offenses.—In cases in which subsection (a)(1) applies andthere is more than one underlying offense, the offense level for the underlying offense is to be determined under the procedures set forth in Application Note 3 ofthe Commentary to §1B1.5 (Interpretation of References to Other Offense Guidelines).

(B) Defendants Accountable for Underlying Offense.—In order for subsection(a)(1) to apply, the defendant must have committed the underlying offense or beaccountable for the underlying offense under §1B1.3(a)(1)(A). The fact that the defendant was involved in laundering criminally derived funds after the commissionof the underlying offense, without additional involvement in the underlying offense, does not establish that the defendant committed, aided, abetted, counseled, commanded, induced, procured, or willfully caused the underlying offense.

§2S1.1(C) Application of Chapter Three Adjustments.—Notwithstanding §1B1.5(c), incases in which subsection (a)(1) applies, application of any Chapter Three adjustment shall be determined based on the offense covered by this guideline (i.e., the laundering of criminally derived funds) and not on the underlying offense fromwhich the laundered funds were derived.

(B) Commingled Funds.—In a case in which a transaction, financial transaction, monetary transaction, transportation, transfer, or transmission results in the commingling of legitimately derived funds with criminally derived funds, the value ofthe laundered funds, for purposes of subsection (a)(2), is the amount of the criminally derived funds, not the total amount of the commingled funds, if the defendantprovides sufficient information to determine the amount of criminally derived fundswithout unduly complicating or prolonging the sentencing process. If the amount ofthe criminally derived funds is difficult or impracticable to determine, the value ofthe laundered funds, for purposes of subsection (a)(2), is the total amount of the commingled funds.

(C) Non-Applicability of Enhancement.—Subsection (b)(2)(B) shall not apply if the defendant was convicted of a conspiracy under 18 U.S.C. § 1956(h) and the sole object of that conspiracy was to commit an offense set forth in 18 U.S.C. § 1957.

4. Enhancement for Business of Laundering Funds.—(A) In General.—The court shall consider the totality of the circumstances to determine whether a defendant who did not commit the underlying offense was in the business of laundering funds, for purposes of subsection (b)(2)(C).

(B) Factors to Consider.—The following is a non-exhaustive list of factors that mayindicate the defendant was in the business of laundering funds for purposes of subsection (b)(2)(C):(i) The defendant regularly engaged in laundering funds.

(ii) The defendant engaged in laundering funds during an extended period oftime.

(iii) The defendant engaged in laundering funds from multiple sources.

(iv) The defendant generated a substantial amount of revenue in return for laundering funds.

(v) At the time the defendant committed the instant offense, the defendant hadone or more prior convictions for an offense under 18 U.S.C. § 1956 or § 1957, or under 31 U.S.C. § 5313, § 5314, § 5316, § 5324 or § 5326, or any similaroffense under state law, or an attempt or conspiracy to commit any such fed§2S1.2eral or state offense. A conviction taken into account under subsection (b)(2)(C) is not excluded from consideration of whether that convictionreceives criminal history points pursuant to Chapter Four, Part A (CriminalHistory).

(vi) During the course of an undercover government investigation, the defendantmade statements that the defendant engaged in any of the conduct describedin subdivisions (i) through (iv).

5. (A) Sophisticated Laundering under Subsection (b)(3).—For purposes of subsection (b)(3), “sophisticated laundering” means complex or intricate offense conduct pertaining to the execution or concealment of the 18 U.S.C. § 1956 offense.

Sophisticated laundering typically involves the use of—(i) fictitious entities;(ii) shell corporations;(iii) two or more levels (i.e., layering) of transactions, transportation, transfers, ortransmissions, involving criminally derived funds that were intended to appear legitimate; or(iv) offshore financial accounts.

(B) Non-Applicability of Enhancement.—If subsection (b)(3) applies, and the conduct that forms the basis for an enhancement under the guideline applicable to the underlying offense is the only conduct that forms the basis for application of subsection (b)(3) of this guideline, do not apply subsection (b)(3) of this guideline.

6. Grouping of Multiple Counts.—In a case in which the defendant is convicted of a count of laundering funds and a count for the underlying offense from which the laundered funds were derived, the counts shall be grouped pursuant to subsection (c) of§3D1.2 (Groups of Closely-Related Counts).

 Effective November 1, 1987. Amended effective November 1, 1993 (amendment 491).

Introductory CommentaryThe criminal tax laws are designed to protect the public interest in preserving the integrity of the nation’s tax system. Criminal tax prosecutions serve to punish the violator andpromote respect for the tax laws. Because of the limited number of criminal tax prosecutionsrelative to the estimated incidence of such violations, deterring others from violating the taxlaws is a primary consideration underlying these guidelines. Recognition that the sentence for a criminal tax case will be commensurate with the gravity of the offense should act as a deterrent to would-be violators.

§2T1.1(c) Special InstructionsFor the purposes of this guideline—(1) If the offense involved tax evasion or a fraudulent or false return, statement, or other document, the tax loss is the totalamount of loss that was the object of the offense (i.e., the lossthat would have resulted had the offense been successfullycompleted).

Notes:(A) If the offense involved filing a tax return in which grossincome was underreported, the tax loss shall be treated asequal to 28% of the unreported gross income (34% if the taxpayer is a corporation) plus 100% of any false creditsclaimed against tax, unless a more accurate determination of the tax loss can be made.

(B) If the offense involved improperly claiming a deduction oran exemption, the tax loss shall be treated as equal to 28%of the amount of the improperly claimed deduction or exemption (34% if the taxpayer is a corporation) plus 100%of any false credits claimed against tax, unless a more accurate determination of the tax loss can be made.

(C) If the offense involved improperly claiming a deduction toprovide a basis for tax evasion in the future, the tax lossshall be treated as equal to 28% of the amount of the improperly claimed deduction (34% if the taxpayer is a corporation) plus 100% of any false credits claimed againsttax, unless a more accurate determination of the tax losscan be made.

(D) If the offense involved (i) conduct described in subdivision (A), B), or (C) of these Notes; and (ii) both individualand corporate tax returns, the tax loss is the aggregate taxloss from the offenses added together.

(2) If the offense involved failure to file a tax return, the tax lossis the amount of tax that the taxpayer owed and did not pay.

Notes:(A) If the offense involved failure to file a tax return, the taxloss shall be treated as equal to 20% of the gross income(25% if the taxpayer is a corporation) less any tax withheld§2T1.1or otherwise paid, unless a more accurate determinationof the tax loss can be made.

(B) If the offense involved (i) conduct described in subdivision (A) of these Notes; and (ii) both individual and corporate tax returns, the tax loss is the aggregate tax loss fromthe offenses added together.

(3) If the offense involved willful failure to pay tax, the tax loss is the amount of tax that the taxpayer owed and did not pay.

(4) If the offense involved improperly claiming a refund to whichthe claimant was not entitled, the tax loss is the amount of the claimed refund to which the claimant was not entitled.

(5) The tax loss is not reduced by any payment of the tax subsequent to the commission of the offense.

CommentaryStatutory Provisions: 26 U.S.C. §§ 7201, 7203 (other than a violation based upon 26 U.S.C.

§ 6050I), 7206 (other than a violation based upon 26 U.S.C. § 6050I or § 7206(2)), and 7207.

For additional statutory provision(s), see Appendix A (Statutory Index).

Application Notes:1. Tax Loss.—“Tax loss” is defined in subsection (c). The tax loss does not include interestor penalties, except in willful evasion of payment cases under 26 U.S.C. § 7201 and willfulfailure to pay cases under 26 U.S.C. § 7203. Although the definition of tax loss corresponds to what is commonly called the “criminal figures,” its amount is to be determinedby the same rules applicable in determining any other sentencing factor. In some instances, such as when indirect methods of proof are used, the amount of the tax loss maybe uncertain; the guidelines contemplate that the court will simply make a reasonableestimate based on the available facts.

Notes under subsections (c)(1) and (c)(2) address certain situations in income tax casesin which the tax loss may not be reasonably ascertainable. In these situations, the “presumptions” set forth are to be used unless the government or defense provides sufficientinformation for a more accurate assessment of the tax loss. In cases involving other typesof taxes, the presumptions in the notes under subsections (c)(1) and (c)(2) do not apply.

Example 1: A defendant files a tax return reporting income of $40,000 when his incomewas actually $90,000. Under Note (A) to subsection (c)(1), the tax loss is treated as$14,000 ($90,000 of actual gross income minus $40,000 of reported gross income =$50,000 x 28%) unless sufficient information is available to make a more accurate assessment of the tax loss.

Example 2: A defendant files a tax return reporting income of $60,000 when his incomewas actually $130,000. In addition, the defendant claims $10,000 in false tax credits.

Under Note (A) to subsection (c)(1), the tax loss is treated as $29,600 ($130,000 of actualgross income minus $60,000 of reported gross income = $70,000 x 28% = $19,600, plus§2T1.1$10,000 of false tax credits) unless sufficient information is available to make a moreaccurate assessment of the tax loss.

Example 3: A defendant fails to file a tax return for a year in which his salary was$24,000, and $2,600 in income tax was withheld by his employer. Under the note to subsection (c)(2), the tax loss is treated as $2,200 ($24,000 of gross income x 20% = $4,800, minus $2,600 of tax withheld) unless sufficient information is available to make a moreaccurate assessment of the tax loss.

In determining the tax loss attributable to the offense, the court should use as manymethods set forth in subsection (c) and this commentary as are necessary given the circumstances of the particular case. If none of the methods of determining the tax loss setforth fit the circumstances of the particular case, the court should use any method ofdetermining the tax loss that appears appropriate to reasonably calculate the loss thatwould have resulted had the offense been successfully completed.

2. Total Tax Loss Attributable to the Offense.—In determining the total tax loss attributable to the offense (see §1B1.3(a)(2)), all conduct violating the tax laws should beconsidered as part of the same course of conduct or common scheme or plan unless the evidence demonstrates that the conduct is clearly unrelated. The following examples areillustrative of conduct that is part of the same course of conduct or common scheme orplan: (A) there is a continuing pattern of violations of the tax laws by the defendant;(B) the defendant uses a consistent method to evade or camouflage income, e.g., backdating documents or using off-shore accounts; (C) the violations involve the same or a relatedseries of transactions; (D) the violation in each instance involves a false or inflated claimof a similar deduction or credit; and (E) the violation in each instance involves a failureto report or an understatement of a specific source of income, e.g., interest from savingsaccounts or income from a particular business activity. These examples are not intendedto be exhaustive.

3. Unclaimed Credits, Deductions, and Exemptions.—In determining the tax loss, the court should account for the standard deduction and personal and dependent exemptionsto which the defendant was entitled. In addition, the court should account for any unclaimed credit, deduction, or exemption that is needed to ensure a reasonable estimateof the tax loss, but only to the extent that (A) the credit, deduction, or exemption wasrelated to the tax offense and could have been claimed at the time the tax offense wascommitted; (B) the credit, deduction, or exemption is reasonably and practicably ascertainable; and (C) the defendant presents information to support the credit, deduction, orexemption sufficiently in advance of sentencing to provide an adequate opportunity toevaluate whether it has sufficient indicia of reliability to support its probable accuracy(see §6A1.3 (Resolution of Disputed Factors) (Policy Statement)).

However, the court shall not account for payments to third parties made in a mannerthat encouraged or facilitated a separate violation of law (e.g., “under the table” paymentsto employees or expenses incurred to obstruct justice).

The burden is on the defendant to establish any such credit, deduction, or exemption bya preponderance of the evidence. See §6A1.3, comment.

4. Application of Subsection (b)(1) (Criminal Activity).—“Criminal activity” meansany conduct constituting a criminal offense under federal, state, local, or foreign law.

§2T1.15. Application of Subsection (b)(2) (Sophisticated Means).—For purposes of subsection (b)(2), “sophisticated means” means especially complex or especially intricate offense conduct pertaining to the execution or concealment of an offense. Conduct such ashiding assets or transactions, or both, through the use of fictitious entities, corporateshells, or offshore financial accounts ordinarily indicates sophisticated means.

6. Other Definitions.—For purposes of this section:A “credit claimed against tax” is an item that reduces the amount of tax directly. In contrast, a “deduction” is an item that reduces the amount of taxable income.

“Gross income” has the same meaning as it has in 26 U.S.C. § 61 and 26 C.F.R. § 1.61.

7. Aggregation of Individual and Corporate Tax Loss.—If the offense involved bothindividual and corporate tax returns, the tax loss is the aggregate tax loss from the individual tax offense and the corporate tax offense added together. Accordingly, in a case inwhich a defendant fails to report income derived from a corporation on both the defendant’s individual tax return and the defendant’s corporate tax return, the tax loss is the sum of (A) the unreported or diverted amount multiplied by (i) 28%; or (ii) the tax ratefor the individual tax offense, if sufficient information is available to make a more accurate assessment of that tax rate; and (B) the unreported or diverted amount multipliedby (i) 34%; or (ii) the tax rate for the corporate tax offense, if sufficient information is available to make a more accurate assessment of that tax rate. For example, the defendant, the sole owner of a Subchapter C corporation, fraudulently understates the corporation’s income in the amount of $100,000 on the corporation’s tax return, diverts the fundsto the defendant’s own use, and does not report these funds on the defendant’s individualtax return. For purposes of this example, assume the use of 34% with respect to the corporate tax loss and the use of 28% with respect to the individual tax loss. The tax lossattributable to the defendant’s corporate tax return is $34,000 ($100,000 multiplied by34%). The tax loss attributable to the defendant’s individual tax return is $28,000($100,000 multiplied by 28%). The tax loss for the offenses are added together to equal$62,000 ($34,000 + $28,000).

Background: This guideline relies most heavily on the amount of loss that was the object ofthe offense. Tax offenses, in and of themselves, are serious offenses; however, a greater taxloss is obviously more harmful to the treasury and more serious than a smaller one with otherwise similar characteristics. Furthermore, as the potential benefit from the offense increases, the sanction necessary to deter also increases.

Under pre-guidelines practice, roughly half of all tax evaders were sentenced to probationwithout imprisonment, while the other half received sentences that required them to serve anaverage prison term of twelve months. This guideline is intended to reduce disparity in sentencing for tax offenses and to somewhat increase average sentence length. As a result, the number of purely probationary sentences will be reduced. The Commission believes that anyadditional costs of imprisonment that may be incurred as a result of the increase in the averageterm of imprisonment for tax offenses are inconsequential in relation to the potential increasein revenue. According to estimates current at the time this guideline was originally developed(1987), income taxes are underpaid by approximately $90 billion annually. Guideline sentencesshould result in small increases in the average length of imprisonment for most tax cases thatinvolve less than $100,000 in tax loss. The increase is expected to be somewhat larger for casesinvolving more taxes.

Failure to report criminally derived income is included as a factor for deterrence purposes. Criminally derived income is generally difficult to establish, so that the tax loss in such§2T1.4cases will tend to be substantially understated. An enhancement for offenders who violate the tax laws as part of a pattern of criminal activity from which they derive a substantial portionof their income also serves to implement the mandate of 28 U.S.C. § 994(i)(2).

Although tax offenses always involve some planning, unusually sophisticated efforts toconceal the offense decrease the likelihood of detection and therefore warrant an additionalsanction for deterrence purposes.

The guideline does not make a distinction for an employee who prepares fraudulent returns on behalf of his employer. The adjustments in Chapter Three, Part B (Role in the Offense) should be used to make appropriate distinctions.

For purposes of this guideline, the “tax loss” is the tax loss, as defined in §2T1.1, resulting from the defendant’s aid, assistance, procurance or advice.

§2T1.4(b) Specific Offense Characteristics(1) If (A) the defendant committed the offense as part of a patternor scheme from which he derived a substantial portion of his income; or (B) the defendant was in the business of preparingor assisting in the preparation of tax returns, increase by 2 levels.

CommentaryStatutory Provision: 26 U.S.C. § 7206(2) (other than a violation based upon 26 U.S.C.

§ 6050I).

Application Notes:1. For the general principles underlying the determination of tax loss, see §2T1.1(c) andApplication Note 1 of the Commentary to §2T1.1 (Tax Evasion; Willful Failure to FileReturn, Supply Information, or Pay Tax; Fraudulent or False Returns, Statements, orOther Documents). In certain instances, such as promotion of a tax shelter scheme, the defendant may advise other persons to violate their tax obligations through filing returnsthat find no support in the tax laws. If this type of conduct can be shown to have resultedin the filing of false returns (regardless of whether the principals were aware of theirfalsity), the misstatements in all such returns will contribute to one aggregate “tax loss.”2. Subsection (b)(1) has two prongs. The first prong applies to persons who derive a substantial portion of their income through the promotion of tax schemes, e.g., through promoting fraudulent tax shelters. The second prong applies to persons who regularly prepare or assist in the preparation of tax returns for profit. If an enhancement from this subsection applies, do not apply §3B1.3 (Abuse of Position of Trust or Use of SpecialSkill).

3. Sophisticated Means.—For purposes of subsection (b)(2), “sophisticated means”means especially complex or especially intricate offense conduct pertaining to the execution or concealment of an offense. Conduct such as hiding assets or transactions, or both, through the use of fictitious entities, corporate shells, or offshore financial accounts ordinarily indicates sophisticated means.

Background: An increased offense level is specified for those in the business of preparing orassisting in the preparation of tax returns and those who make a business of promoting taxfraud because their misconduct poses a greater risk of revenue loss and is more clearly willful.

Other considerations are similar to those in §2T1.1.

Application Note:1. In the event that the employer not only failed to account to the Internal Revenue Serviceand pay over the tax, but also collected the tax from employees and did not account tothem for it, it is both tax evasion and a form of embezzlement. Subsection (b)(1) addressessuch cases.

Background: The failure to collect or truthfully account for the tax must be willful, as mustthe failure to pay. Where no effort is made to defraud the employee, the offense is a form of taxevasion, and is treated as such in the guidelines.

CommentaryStatutory Provisions: 26 U.S.C. §§ 7215, 7512(b).

Application Notes:1. If funds are deposited and withdrawn without being paid to the Internal Revenue Service, they should be treated as never having been deposited.

2. It is recommended that the fine be based on the total amount of funds not deposited.

Background: This offense is a misdemeanor that does not require any intent to evade taxes, nor even that taxes have not been paid. The more serious offense is 26 U.S.C. § 7202(see §2T1.6).

This offense should be relatively easy to detect and fines may be feasible. Accordingly, the offense level has been set considerably lower than for tax evasion, although some efforthas been made to tie the offense level to the level of taxes that were not deposited.

CommentaryStatutory Provision: 18 U.S.C. § 371.

Application Notes:1. This section applies to conspiracies to “defraud the United States by impeding, impairing, obstructing and defeating . . . the collection of revenue.” United States v. Carruth, 699 F.2d 1017, 1021 (9th Cir. 1983), cert. denied, 464 U.S. 1038 (1984). See also UnitedStates v. Browning, 723 F.2d 1544 (11th Cir. 1984); United States v. Klein, 247 F.2d 908, 915 (2d Cir. 1957), cert. denied, 355 U.S. 924 (1958). It does not apply to taxpayers, suchas a husband and wife, who merely evade taxes jointly or file a fraudulent return.

2. The base offense level is the offense level (base offense level plus any applicable specificoffense characteristics) from §2T1.1 or §2T1.4 (whichever guideline most closely addresses the harm that would have resulted had the conspirators succeeded in impeding, impairing, obstructing, or defeating the Internal Revenue Service) if that offense level is greater than 10. Otherwise, the base offense level is 10.

3. Specific offense characteristics from §2T1.9(b) are to be applied to the base offense leveldetermined under §2T1.9(a)(1) or (2).

4. Subsection (b)(2) provides an enhancement where the conduct was intended to encouragepersons, other than the participants directly involved in the offense, to violate the tax§2T2.1laws (e.g., an offense involving a “tax protest” group that encourages persons to violatethe tax laws, or an offense involving the marketing of fraudulent tax shelters or schemes).

Background: This type of conspiracy generally involves substantial sums of money. It alsotypically is complex and may be far-reaching, making it quite difficult to evaluate the extentof the revenue loss caused. Additional specific offense characteristics are included because ofthe potential for these tax conspiracies to subvert the revenue system and the danger to lawenforcement agents and the public.

Application Notes:1. A sentence at or near the minimum of the guideline range typically would be appropriatefor cases involving tourists who bring in items for their own use. Such conduct generallyposes a lesser threat to revenue collection.

2. Particular attention should be given to those items for which entry is prohibited, limited, or restricted. Especially when such items are harmful or protective quotas are in effect, the duties evaded on such items may not adequately reflect the harm to society or protected industries resulting from their importation. In such instances, an upward departure may be warranted. A sentence based upon an alternative measure of the “duty”evaded, such as the increase in market value due to importation, or 25 percent of the items’ fair market value in the United States if the increase in market value due to importation is not readily ascertainable, might be considered.

3. Sophisticated Means.—For purposes of subsection (b)(1), “sophisticated means”means especially complex or especially intricate offense conduct pertaining to the execution or concealment of an offense. Conduct such as hiding assets or transactions, or both, through the use of fictitious entities, corporate shells, or offshore financial accounts ordinarily indicates sophisticated means.

PART U ― [NOT USED]PART V ― [NOT USED]PART W ― [NOT USED]§2X1.1PART X ― OTHER OFFENSES1. CONSPIRACIES, ATTEMPTS, SOLICITATIONS§2X1.1. Attempt, Solicitation, or Conspiracy (Not Covered by a SpecificOffense Guideline)(a) Base Offense Level: The base offense level from the guideline for the substantive offense, plus any adjustments from such guideline for any intended offense conduct that can be established with reasonable certainty.

(b) Specific Offense Characteristics(1) If an attempt, decrease by 3 levels, unless the defendant completed all the acts the defendant believed necessary for successful completion of the substantive offense or the circumstancesdemonstrate that the defendant was about to complete all suchacts but for apprehension or interruption by some similar eventbeyond the defendant’s control.

(2) If a conspiracy, decrease by 3 levels, unless the defendant or a co-conspirator completed all the acts the conspirators believednecessary on their part for the successful completion of the substantive offense or the circumstances demonstrate that the conspirators were about to complete all such acts but for apprehension or interruption by some similar event beyond theircontrol.

(3) (A) If a solicitation, decrease by 3 levels unless the person solicited to commit or aid the substantive offense completedall the acts he believed necessary for successful completionof the substantive offense or the circumstances demonstrate that the person was about to complete all such actsbut for apprehension or interruption by some similarevent beyond such person’s control.

(B) If the statute treats solicitation of the substantive offenseidentically with the substantive offense, do not apply subdivision (A) above; i.e., the offense level for solicitation is the same as that for the substantive offense.

§2X1.1(c) Cross Reference(1) When an attempt, solicitation, or conspiracy is expressly covered by another offense guideline section, apply that guidelinesection.

(d) Special Instruction(1) Subsection (b) shall not apply to:(A) Any of the following offenses, if such offense involved, orwas intended to promote, a federal crime of terrorism asdefined in 18 U.S.C. § 2332b(g)(5):18 U.S.C. § 81;18 U.S.C. § 930(c);18 U.S.C. § 1362;18 U.S.C. § 1363;18 U.S.C. § 1992(a)(1)–(a)(7), (a)(9), (a)(10);18 U.S.C. § 2339A;18 U.S.C. § 2340A;49 U.S.C. § 46504;49 U.S.C. § 46505; and49 U.S.C. § 60123(b).

(B) Any of the following offenses:18 U.S.C. § 32; and18 U.S.C. § 2332a.

CommentaryStatutory Provisions: 18 U.S.C. §§ 371, 372, 2271, 2282A, 2282B. For additional statutoryprovision(s), see Appendix A (Statutory Index).

Application Notes:1. Certain attempts, conspiracies, and solicitations are expressly covered by other offenseguidelines.

Offense guidelines that expressly cover attempts include:§§2A2.1, 2A3.1, 2A3.2, 2A3.3, 2A3.4, 2A4.2, 2A5.1;§§2C1.1, 2C1.2;§§2D1.1, 2D1.2, 2D1.5, 2D1.6, 2D1.7, 2D1.8, 2D1.9, 2D1.10, 2D1.11, 2D1.12, 2D1.13, 2D2.1, 2D2.2, 2D3.1, 2D3.2;§2E5.1;§2M6.1;§2N1.1;§2Q1.4.

§2X1.1Offense guidelines that expressly cover conspiracies include:§2A1.5;§§2D1.1, 2D1.2, 2D1.5, 2D1.6, 2D1.7, 2D1.8, 2D1.9, 2D1.10, 2D1.11, 2D1.12, 2D1.13, 2D2.1, 2D2.2, 2D3.1, 2D3.2;§2H1.1;§2M6.1;§2T1.9.

Offense guidelines that expressly cover solicitations include:§2A1.5;§§2C1.1, 2C1.2;§2E5.1.

2. “Substantive offense,” as used in this guideline, means the offense that the defendantwas convicted of soliciting, attempting, or conspiring to commit. Under §2X1.1(a), the base offense level will be the same as that for the substantive offense. But the only specific offense characteristics from the guideline for the substantive offense that apply arethose that are determined to have been specifically intended or actually occurred. Speculative specific offense characteristics will not be applied. For example, if two defendantsare arrested during the conspiratorial stage of planning an armed bank robbery, the offense level ordinarily would not include aggravating factors regarding possible injury toothers, hostage taking, discharge of a weapon, or obtaining a large sum of money, becausesuch factors would be speculative. The offense level would simply reflect the level applicable to robbery of a financial institution, with the enhancement for possession of a weapon. If it was established that the defendants actually intended to physically restrainthe teller, the specific offense characteristic for physical restraint would be added. In anattempted theft, the value of the items that the defendant attempted to steal would beconsidered.

3. If the substantive offense is not covered by a specific guideline, see §2X5.1 (Other Offenses).

4. In certain cases, the participants may have completed (or have been about to completebut for apprehension or interruption) all of the acts necessary for the successful completion of part, but not all, of the intended offense. In such cases, the offense level for the count (or group of closely related multiple counts) is whichever of the following is greater:the offense level for the intended offense minus 3 levels (under §2X1.1(b)(1), (b)(2), or(b)(3)(A)), or the offense level for the part of the offense for which the necessary acts werecompleted (or about to be completed but for apprehension or interruption). For example, where the intended offense was the theft of $800,000 but the participants completed (orwere about to complete) only the acts necessary to steal $30,000, the offense level is the offense level for the theft of $800,000 minus 3 levels, or the offense level for the theft of$30,000, whichever is greater.

In the case of multiple counts that are not closely related counts, whether the 3-levelreduction under §2X1.1(b)(1), (b)(2), or (b)(3)(A) applies is determined separately for eachcount.

Background: In most prosecutions for conspiracies or attempts, the substantive offense wassubstantially completed or was interrupted or prevented on the verge of completion by the intercession of law enforcement authorities or the victim. In such cases, no reduction of the offense level is warranted. Sometimes, however, the arrest occurs well before the defendant or§2X3.1any co-conspirator has completed the acts necessary for the substantive offense. Under suchcircumstances, a reduction of 3 levels is provided under §2X1.1(b)(1) or (2).

 Effective November 1, 1987. Amended effective November 1, 2006 (amendment 685).

§2X5.1. Other Felony OffensesIf the offense is a felony for which no guideline expressly has been promulgated, apply the most analogous offense guideline. If there is not a sufficiently analogous guideline, the provisions of 18 U.S.C. § 3553 shallcontrol, except that any guidelines and policy statements that can be applied meaningfully in the absence of a Chapter Two offense guidelineshall remain applicable.

If the defendant is convicted under 18 U.S.C. § 1841(a)(1), apply the guideline that covers the conduct the defendant is convicted of havingengaged in, as that conduct is described in 18 U.S.C. § 1841(a)(1) andlisted in 18 U.S.C. § 1841(b).

§2X5.1CommentaryStatutory Provision: 18 U.S.C. § 1841(a)(1).

Application Notes:1. In General.—Guidelines and policy statements that can be applied meaningfully in the absence of a Chapter Two offense guideline include: §5B1.3 (Conditions of Probation);§5D1.1 (Imposition of a Term of Supervised Release); §5D1.2 (Term of Supervised Release); §5D1.3 (Conditions of Supervised Release); §5E1.1 (Restitution); §5E1.3 (SpecialAssessments); §5E1.4 (Forfeiture); Chapter Five, Part F (Sentencing Options); §5G1.3(Imposition of a Sentence on a Defendant Subject to an Undischarged Term of Imprisonment or Anticipated State Term of Imprisonment); Chapter Five, Part H (Specific Offender Characteristics); Chapter Five, Part J (Relief from Disability); Chapter Five, Part K (Departures); Chapter Six, Part A (Sentencing Procedures); Chapter Six, Part B(Plea Agreements).

2. Convictions under 18 U.S.C. § 1841(a)(1).—(A) In General.—If the defendant is convicted under 18 U.S.C. § 1841(a)(1), the Chapter Two offense guideline that applies is the guideline that covers the conduct the defendant is convicted of having engaged in, i.e., the conduct of which the defendantis convicted that violates a specific provision listed in 18 U.S.C. § 1841(b) and thatresults in the death of, or bodily injury to, a child in utero at the time of the offenseof conviction. For example, if the defendant committed aggravated sexual abuseagainst the unborn child’s mother and it caused the death of the child in utero, the applicable Chapter Two guideline would be §2A3.1 (Criminal Sexual Abuse; Attempt to Commit Criminal Sexual Abuse).

(B) Upward Departure Provision.—For offenses under 18 U.S.C. § 1841(a)(1), anupward departure may be warranted if the offense level under the applicable guideline does not adequately account for the death of, or serious bodily injury to, the child in utero.

3. Application of §2X5.2.—This guideline applies only to felony offenses not referenced inAppendix A (Statutory Index). For Class A misdemeanor offenses that have not beenreferenced in Appendix A, apply §2X5.2 (Class A Misdemeanors (Not Covered by AnotherSpecific Offense Guideline)).

Background: Many offenses, especially assimilative crimes, are not listed in the StatutoryIndex or in any of the lists of Statutory Provisions that follow each offense guideline. Nonetheless, the specific guidelines that have been promulgated cover the type of criminal behaviorthat most such offenses proscribe. The court is required to determine if there is a sufficientlyanalogous offense guideline, and, if so, to apply the guideline that is most analogous. In a casein which there is no sufficiently analogous guideline, the provisions of 18 U.S.C. § 3553 control.

The sentencing guidelines apply to convictions under 18 U.S.C. § 13 (Assimilative CrimesAct) and 18 U.S.C. § 1153 (Indian Major Crimes Act); see 18 U.S.C. § 3551(a), as amended bysection 1602 of Public Law 101–647.
