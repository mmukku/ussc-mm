<blockquote>
<p>&quot;, except in determining the combined offense level as specified in Chapter Three, Part D (Multiple Counts). Under §3D1.2(e), a count for obstruction will be grouped with the count for the underlying offense. Ordinarily, the offense level for that Group of Closely Related Counts will be the offense level for the underlying offense, as increased by the 2-level adjustment specified by this section. In some instances, however, the offense level for the obstruction offense may be higher, in which case that will be the offense level for the Group. <em>See</em> §3D1.3(a). In cases in which a significant further obstruction occurred during the investigation or prosecution of an obstruction offense itself (one of the above listed offenses), an upward departure may be warranted (<em>e.g.</em>, where a witness to an obstruction offense is threatened during the course of the prosecution for the obstruction offense).&quot;,</p>
<p>and inserting in lieu thereof:</p>
<p>&quot;to the offense level for that offense except where a significant further obstruction occurred during the investigation or prosecution of the obstruction offense itself (<em>e.g.</em>, where the defendant threatened a witness during the course of the prosecution for the obstruction offense). Where the defendant is convicted both of the obstruction offense and the underlying offense, the count for the obstruction offense will be grouped with the count for the underlying offense under subsection (c) of §3D1.2 (Groups of Closely-Related Counts). The offense level for that Group of Closely-Related Counts will be the offense level for the underlying offense increased by the 2-level adjustment specified by this section, or the offense level for the obstruction offense, whichever is greater.&quot;.</p>

<p><strong>268.</strong> <strong>Amendment:</strong> Section 4B1.2(1) is amended by deleting &quot;as used in this provision is defined under 18 U.S.C. § 16&quot; and inserting in lieu thereof:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;means any offense under federal or state law punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year that --</p>
<p>(i) has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another, or</p>
<p>(ii) is burglary of a dwelling, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another&quot;.</p>
<p>Section 4B1.2(2) is amended by deleting &quot;as used in this provision&quot; immediately before &quot;means&quot;, and by deleting &quot;identified in 21 U.S.C. §§841, 845(b), 856, 952(a), 955, 955(a), 959; and similar offenses&quot; and inserting in lieu thereof:</p>
<p>&quot;under a federal or state law prohibiting the manufacture, import, export, or distribution of a controlled substance (or a counterfeit substance) or the possession of a controlled substance (or a counterfeit substance) with intent to manufacture, import, export, or distribute&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §4B1.2 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended by deleting:</p>
<p>&quot;1. ‘Crime of violence’ is defined in 18 U.S.C. § 16 to mean an offense that has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person or property of another, or any other offense that is a felony and that by its nature involves a substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used in committing the offense. The Commission interprets this as follows: murder, manslaughter, kidnapping, aggravated assault, extortionate extension of credit, forcible sex offenses, arson, or robbery are covered by this provision. Other offenses are covered only if the conduct for which the defendant was specifically convicted meets the above definition. For example, conviction for an escape accomplished by force or threat of injury would be covered; conviction for an escape by stealth would not be covered. Conviction for burglary of a dwelling would be covered; conviction for burglary of other structures would not be covered.</p>
<p>2. ‘Controlled substance offense’ includes any federal or state offense that is substantially similar to any of those listed in subsection (2) of the guideline. These offenses include manufacturing, importing, distributing, dispensing, or possessing with intent to manufacture, import, distribute, or dispense, a controlled substance (or a counterfeit substance). This definition also includes aiding and abetting, conspiring, or attempting to commit such offenses, and other offenses that are substantially equivalent to the offenses listed.&quot;,</p>
<p>and inserting in lieu thereof:</p>
<p>&quot;1. The terms ‘crime of violence’ and ‘controlled substance offense’ include the offenses of aiding and abetting, conspiring, and attempting to commit such offenses.</p>
<p>2. ‘Crime of violence’ includes murder, manslaughter, kidnapping, aggravated assault, forcible sex offenses, robbery, arson, extortion, extortionate extension of credit, and burglary of a dwelling. Other offenses are included where (A) that offense has as an element the use attempted use, or threatened use, of physical force against the person of another, or (B) the conduct set forth in the count of which the defendant was convicted involved use of explosives or, by its nature, presented a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.&quot;.</p>
<p>The caption of §4B1.2 is amended by deleting &quot;<em>Definitions</em>&quot; and inserting in lieu thereof &quot;<em>Definitions of Terms Used in Section 4B1.1</em>&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §4B1.2 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended in Note 4 by deleting &quot;§4A1.2(e) (Applicable Time Period), §4A1.2(h) (Foreign Sentences), and §4A1.2(j) (Expunged Convictions)&quot; and inserting in lieu thereof &quot;§4A1.2 (Definitions and Instructions for Computing Criminal History)&quot;, and by deleting the last sentence as follows: &quot;Also applicable is the Commentary to §4A1.2 pertaining to invalid convictions.&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> The purpose of this amendment is to clarify the definitions of crime of violence and controlled substance offense used in this guideline. The definition of crime of violence used in this amendment is derived from 18 U.S.C. § 924(e). In addition, the amendment clarifies that all pertinent definitions and instructions in §4A1.2 apply to this section.</p>

<p>The Commentary to §4B1.3 captioned &quot;Application Note&quot; is amended by deleting &quot;Note&quot; and inserting in lieu thereof &quot;Notes&quot;, and by inserting the following additional note:</p>
<p>&quot;2. ‘Engaged in as a livelihood’ means that (1) the defendant derived income from the pattern of criminal conduct that in any twelve-month period exceeded 2,000 times the then existing hourly minimum wage under federal law (currently 2,000 times the hourly minimum wage under federal law is $6,700); and (2) the totality of circumstances shows that such criminal conduct was the defendant’s primary occupation in that twelve-month period (<em>e.g.</em>, the defendant engaged in criminal conduct rather than regular, legitimate employment; or the defendant’s legitimate employment was merely a front for his criminal conduct).&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §4B1.3 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended in Note 1 by deleting the last sentence as follows: &quot;This guideline is not intended to apply to minor offenses.&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §4B1.3 captioned &quot;Background&quot; is amended by deleting &quot;proportion&quot; and inserting in lieu thereof &quot;portion&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> The purpose of this amendment is to provide a better definition of the intended scope of this enhancement. Compare, for example, <em>United States v. Kerr</em>, 686 F. Supp. 1174 (W.D. Penn. 1988) with <em>United States v. Rivera</em>, 694 F. Supp. 1105 (S.D.N.Y. 1988). The first prong of the definition in application Note 2 above is derived from former 18 U.S.C. § 3575, the provision from which the statutory instruction underlying this guideline (28 U.S.C. § 994 (i)(2)) was itself derived.</p>

<p><strong>270.</strong> <strong>Amendment:</strong> Chapter Five, Part A, is amended in the Sentencing Table by deleting &quot;0-1, 0-2, 0-3, 0-4, and 0-5&quot; wherever it appears, and inserting in each instance &quot;0-6&quot;.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Chapter Five, Part A, is amended in the Sentencing Table by inserting &quot;(in months of imprisonment)&quot; immediately under the title &quot;Sentencing Table&quot;, by inserting &quot;(Criminal History Points)&quot; immediately following the caption &quot;Criminal History Category&quot;, and by enclosing in parentheses each of the six sets of criminal history points displayed under that caption.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This amendment provides that the maximum of the guideline range is six months wherever the minimum of the guideline range is zero months. The court has discretion to impose a sentence of up to 6 months imprisonment for a Class B misdemeanor (Class B or C misdemeanors and infractions are not covered by the guidelines; <em>see</em> §1B1.9). It appears anomalous that the Commission guidelines allow less discretion for certain felonies and Class A misdemeanors. In fact, in certain cases, a plea to a reduced charge of a Class B misdemeanor could result in a higher potential sentence because the sentence for the felony or Class A misdemeanor might be restricted to less than 6 months by the guidelines. This can happen when the Sentencing Table provides a guideline range of 0-1 month, 0-2 months, 0-3, 0-4, or 0-5 months. These very narrow ranges are not required by statute, which allows a 6 month guideline range in such cases. This anomaly is removed by amending the guideline table to provide that whenever the lower limit of the guideline range is 0 months, the upper limit of the guideline range is six months.</p>
<p>In addition, this amendment makes minor editorial improvements to the title and caption of the Sentencing Table.</p>

<p>&quot;‘Home detention’ means a program of confinement and supervision that restricts the defendant to his place of residence continuously, or during specified hours, enforced by appropriate means of surveillance by the probation office. The judge may also impose other conditions of probation or supervised release appropriate to effectuate home detention. If the confinement is only during specified hours, the defendant shall engage exclusively in gainful employment, community service or treatment during the non-residential hours.&quot;,</p>
<p>and inserting in lieu thereof:</p>
<p>&quot;‘Home detention’ means a program of confinement and supervision that restricts the defendant to his place of residence continuously, except for authorized absences, enforced by appropriate means of surveillance by the probation office. When an order of home detention is imposed, the defendant is required to be in his place of residence at all times except for approved absences for gainful employment, community service, religious services, medical care, educational or training programs, and such other times as may be specifically authorized. Electronic monitoring is an appropriate means of surveillance and ordinarily should be used in connection with home detention. However, alternative means of surveillance may be used so long as they are as effective as electronic monitoring.&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §5F5.2 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended in Note 2 by deleting:</p>
<p>&quot;Home detention generally should not be imposed for a period in excess of six months. However, a longer term may be appropriate for disabled, elderly or extremely ill defendants who would otherwise be imprisoned.&quot;,</p>
<p>and inserting in lieu thereof:</p>
<p>&quot;The court may impose other conditions of probation or supervised release appropriate to effectuate home detention. If the court concludes that the amenities available in the residence of a defendant would cause home detention not to be sufficiently punitive, the court may limit the amenities available.&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §5F5.2 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended by inserting the following additional note:</p>
<p>&quot;3. The defendant’s place of residence, for purposes of home detention, need not be the place where the defendant previously resided. It may be any place of residence, so long as the owner of the residence (and any other person(s) from whom consent is necessary) agrees to any conditions that may be imposed by the court, <em>e.g.</em>, conditions that a monitoring system be installed, that there will be no ‘call forwarding’ or ‘call waiting’ services, or that there will be no cordless telephones or answering machines.&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §5F5.2 is amended by inserting at the end:</p>
<p>&quot;<em>Background</em>: The Commission has concluded that the surveillance necessary for effective use of home detention ordinarily requires electronic monitoring. However, in some cases home detention may effectively be enforced without electronic monitoring, <em>e.g.</em>, when the defendant is physically incapacitated, or where some other effective means of surveillance is available. Accordingly, the Commission has not required that electronic monitoring be a necessary condition for home detention. Nevertheless, before ordering home detention without electronic monitoring, the court should be confident that an alternative form of surveillance will be equally effective.</p>
<p>In the usual case, the Commission assumes that a condition requiring that the defendant seek and maintain gainful employment will be imposed when home detention is ordered.&quot;.</p>

Electronic monitoring may be used as a means of surveillance to ensure compliance with a curfew order.&quot;.</p>
<p>Section 5B1.4 is amended by inserting the following commentary:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&quot;<em>Commentary</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Application Note</em>:</p>
<p>1. Home detention, as defined by §5F5.2, may only be used as a substitute for imprisonment. <em>See</em> §5C2.1 (Imposition of a Term of Imprisonment). Under home detention, the defendant, with specified exceptions, is restricted to his place of residence during all non-working hours. Curfew, which limits the defendant to his place of residence during evening and nighttime hours, is less restrictive than home detention and may be imposed as a condition of probation whether or not imprisonment could have been ordered.&quot;.</p>

Counts one and two, which arise out of the same transaction, are combined into a single Group involving a $5,000 bribe and hence an offense level of 11 (§2C1.1(a)(1), §2F1.1). Each of the two remaining counts represents a distinct Group, at offense level 10. As there are three Count Units, the offense level for the most serious (11) is increased by 3 levels.

<p><strong>304.</strong> <strong>Amendment:</strong> Section 2D2.1 is amended by inserting the following additional subsection:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;(b) Cross Reference</p>
<p>(1) If the defendant is convicted of possession of more than 5 grams of a mixture or substance containing cocaine base, apply §2D1.1 (Unlawful Manufacturing, Importing, Exporting, or Trafficking) as if the defendant had been convicted of possession of that mixture or substance with intent to distribute.&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §2D2.1 captioned &quot;Background&quot; is amended by deleting the entire text as follows:</p>
<p>&quot;<em>Background</em>: Absent a prior drug related conviction, the maximum term of imprisonment authorized by statute is one year. With a single prior drug related conviction, a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment of fifteen days is required by statute and the maximum term of imprisonment authorized is increased to two years. With two or more prior drug related convictions, a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment of ninety days is required by statute and the maximum term of imprisonment authorized is increased to three years.&quot;,</p>
<p>and inserting in lieu thereof:</p>
<p>&quot;<em>Background</em>: Mandatory minimum penalties for several categories of cases, ranging from fifteen days’ to five years’ imprisonment, are set forth in 21 U.S.C. § 844(a). When a mandatory minimum penalty exceeds the guideline range, the mandatory minimum becomes the guideline sentence. §5G1.1(b).</p>
<p>Section 2D2.1(b)(1) provides a cross reference to §2D1.1 for possession of more than five grams of a mixture or substance containing cocaine base, an offense subject to an enhanced penalty under Section 6371 of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988. Other cases for which enhanced penalties are provided under Section 6371 of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 (<em>e.g.</em>, for a person with one prior conviction, possession of more than three grams of a mixture or substance containing cocaine base; for a person with two or more prior convictions, possession of more than one gram of a mixture or substance containing cocaine base) are to be sentenced in accordance with §5G1.1(b).&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> The purpose of this amendment is to reflect revisions in 21 U.S.C. § 844(a) made by Section 6371 of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988.</p>
<p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> <strong>The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1989.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> <strong>The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1989.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>307.</strong> <strong>Amendment:</strong> Chapter One, Part A, is amended by deleting subparts 2-5 in their entirety as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;2. <em>The Statutory Mission</em></p>
<p>The Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984 foresees guidelines that will further the basic purposes of criminal punishment, <em>i.e.</em>, deterring crime, incapacitating the offender, providing just punishment, and rehabilitating the offender. It delegates to the Commission broad authority to review and rationalize the federal sentencing process.</p>
<p>The statute contains many detailed instructions as to how this determination should be made, but the most important of them instructs the Commission to create categories of offense behavior and offender characteristics. An offense behavior category might consist, for example, of ‘bank robbery/committed with a gun/$2500 taken.’ An offender characteristic category might be ‘offender with one prior conviction who was not sentenced to imprisonment.’ The Commission is required to prescribe guideline ranges that specify an appropriate sentence for each class of convicted persons, to be determined by coordinating the offense behavior categories with the offender characteristic categories. The statute contemplates the guidelines will establish a range of sentences for every coordination of categories. Where the guidelines call for imprisonment, the range must be narrow: the maximum imprisonment cannot exceed the minimum by more than the greater of 25 percent or six months. 28 U.S.C. § 994(b)(2).</p>
<p>The sentencing judge must select a sentence from within the guideline range. If, however, a particular case presents atypical features, the Act allows the judge to depart from the guidelines and sentence outside the range. In that case, the judge must specify reasons for departure. 18 U.S.C. § 3553(b). If the court sentences within the guideline range, an appellate court may review the sentence to see if the guideline was correctly</p>
