<p><em>Application Notes</em>:</p>
<p>1. The definition of ‘firearm’ used in this section is that set forth in 18 U.S.C. § 921(a)(3) (if the defendant is convicted under 18 U.S.C. § 922) and 26 U.S.C. § 5845(a) (if the defendant is convicted under 26 U.S.C. § 5861). These definitions are somewhat broader than that used in Application Note 1(e) of the Commentary to §1B1.1 (Application Instructions). Under 18 U.S.C. § 921(a)(3), the term ‘firearm’ means (A) any weapon (including a starter gun) which will or is designed to or may readily be converted to expel a projectile by the action of an explosive; (B) the frame or receiver of any such weapon; (C) any firearm muffler or firearm silencer; or (D) any destructive device. Under 26 U.S.C. § 5845(a), the term ‘firearm’ includes a shotgun, or a weapon made from a shotgun, with a barrel or barrels of less than 18 inches in length; a weapon made from a shotgun or rifle with an overall length of less than 26 inches; a rifle, or weapon made from a rifle, with a barrel or barrels less than 16 inches in length; a machine gun; a muffler or silencer for a firearm; a destructive device; and certain other large bore weapons.</p>
<p>2. Under §2K2.1(b)(1), intended lawful use, as determined by the surrounding circumstances, provides a decrease in the offense level. Relevant circumstances include, among others, the number and type of firearms (sawed-off shotguns, for example, have few legitimate uses) and ammunition, the location and circumstances of possession, the nature of the defendant’s criminal history (<em>e.g.</em>, whether involving firearms), and the extent to which possession was restricted by local law.&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §2K2.1 captioned &quot;Background&quot; is amended in the last paragraph by deleting &quot;§2K2.1(c)&quot; and inserting in lieu thereof &quot;§2K2.1(c)(2)&quot;.</p>
<p>Chapter Two, Part K, Subpart 2 is amended by deleting §§2K2.2 and 2K2.3 in their entirety as follows:</p>
<p>&quot;§2K2.2. <em>Receipt, Possession, or Transportation of Firearms and Other Weapons in Violation of National Firearms Act</em></p>
<p>(a) Base Offense Level: 12</p>
<p>(b) Specific Offense Characteristics</p>
<p>(1) If the firearm was stolen or had an altered or obliterated serial number, increase by 1 level.</p>
<p>(2) If the firearm was a silencer, increase by 4 levels.</p>
<p>(3) If the defendant obtained or possessed the firearm solely for sport, recreation or collection, decrease by 6 levels.</p>

<p><em>Commentary</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Statutory Provisions</em>: 26 U.S.C. §§ 5861(b) through (l).</p>
<p><em>Application Notes</em>:</p>
<p>1. Under §2K2.2(b)(3), intended lawful use, as determined by the surrounding circumstances, provides a decrease in offense level. Relevant circumstances include, among others, the number and type of firearms (sawed-off shotguns, for example, have few legitimate uses) and ammunition, the location and circumstances of possession, the nature of the defendant’s criminal history (<em>e.g.</em>, whether involving firearms), and the extent to which possession is restricted by local law.</p>
<p>2. Subsection (c)(1) refers to any situation in which the defendant possessed a firearm to facilitate another offense that he committed or attempted.</p>
<p><em>Background</em>: 26 U.S.C. § 5861 prohibits the unlicensed receipt, possession, transportation, or manufacture of certain firearms, such as machine guns, silencers, rifles and shotguns with shortened barrels, and destructive devices. As with §2K2.1, there is considerable variation in the conduct included under this statutory provision and some violations may be relatively technical.</p>
<p>§2K2.3. <em>Prohibited Transactions in or Shipment of Firearms and Other Weapons</em></p>
<p>(a) Base Offense Level:</p>
<p>(1) 12, if convicted under 26 U.S.C. § 5861; or</p>
<p>(2) 6, otherwise.</p>
<p>(b) Specific Offense Characteristics</p>
<p>(1) If the number of firearms unlawfully dealt in exceeded 5, increase as follows:</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Number of Firearms</em> <em>Increase in Level</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>(A) 6 ‑ 10 add 1</p>
<p>(B) 11 ‑ 20 add 2</p>
<p>(C) 21 ‑ 50 add 3</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(D) 51 ‑ 100 add 4</p>
<p>(E) 101 ‑ 200 add 5</p>
<p>(F) more than 200 add 6</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(2) If any of the following applies, use the greatest:</p>
<p>(A) If the defendant knew or had reason to believe that a purchaser was a person prohibited by federal law from owning the firearm, increase by 2 levels.</p>
<p>(B) If the defendant knew or had reason to believe that a purchaser resided in another state in which he was prohibited from owning the firearm, increase by 1 level.</p>
<p>(C) If the defendant knew or had reason to believe that a firearm was stolen or had an altered or obliterated serial number, increase by 1 level.</p>
<p>(c) Cross Reference</p>
<p>(1) If the defendant provided the firearm to another for the purpose of committing another offense, or knowing that he planned to use it in committing another offense, apply §2X1.1 (Attempt or Conspiracy) in respect to such other offense, if the resulting offense level is higher.</p>

<p><em>Commentary</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Statutory Provisions</em>: 18 U.S.C. § 922 (a)(1), (a)(5), (b)(2), (b)(3), (d), (i), (j), (k), (l); 26 U.S.C. § 5861(a).</p>
<p><em>Background</em>: This section applies to a variety of offenses involving prohibited transactions in or transportation of firearms and certain other weapons.&quot;.</p>
<p>A replacement guideline with accompanying commentary is inserted as §2K2.2 (Unlawful Trafficking and Other Prohibited Transactions Involving Firearms).</p>
<p>Chapter Two, Part K, Subpart 2 is amended by inserting an additional guideline with accompanying commentary as §2K2.3 (Receiving, Transporting, Shipping or Transferring a Firearm or Ammunition With Intent to Commit Another Offense, or With Knowledge that It Will Be Used in Committing Another Offense).</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This amendment addresses a number of diverse substantive and technical issues, as well as the creation of several new offenses, and increased statutory maximum penalties for certain other offenses. Because there exist a large number of overlapping statutory provisions, the three basic guidelines, §2K2.1 (Possession by a prohibited person), §2K2.2 (Possession of certain types of weapons), and §2K2.3 (Unlawful trafficking) are not closely tied to the actual conduct. The amendment addresses this issue by consolidating the current three guidelines into two guidelines: (1) unlawful possession, receipt, or transportation, and (2) unlawful trafficking; and by more carefully drawing the distinctions between the base offense levels provided. The third guideline in this amendment is a new guideline to address transfer of a weapon with intent or knowledge that it will be used to</p>
<p>commit another offense (formerly covered in a cross reference) and a new offense added by the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 (Section 6211)(Interstate travel to acquire a firearm for a criminal purpose).</p>
<p>The base offense level for conduct covered by the current §2K2.1 is increased in the amendment from 9 to 12. The statutorily authorized maximum sentence for the conduct covered under §2K2.1 was increased from five to ten years by the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 (Section 6462). Note, however, that the most aggravated conduct under §2K2.1 (possession of a weapon during commission of another offense) is handled by the cross-reference at subsection (c) and is based upon the offense level for an attempt to commit the underlying offense. <em>See</em> Background Commentary to current §2K2.1. The offense level for unlawful possession of a machine gun, sawed off shotgun, or destructive device is increased from 12 to 16. In addition, the amendment raises the enhancement for stolen weapons or obliterated serial numbers from 1 to 2 levels to better reflect the seriousness of this conduct. The numbers currently used in the table for the distribution of multiple weapons in §2K2.2 are amended to increase the offense level more rapidly for sale of multiple weapons.</p>

<p><strong>190.</strong> <strong>Amendment:</strong> Section 2K2.4 is amended by deleting &quot;penalties are those&quot; and inserting in lieu thereof &quot;term of imprisonment is that&quot;.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Commentary to §2K2.4 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended by inserting the following additional note:</p>
<p>&quot;3. Imposition of a term of supervised release is governed by the provisions of §5D1.1 (Imposition of a Term of Supervised Release).&quot;.</p>
<p>Section 2K2.4 is amended by inserting &quot;(a)&quot; immediately before &quot;If&quot;, and by inserting the following additional subsection:</p>
<p>&quot;(b) Special Instructions for Fines</p>
<p>(1) Where there is a federal conviction for the underlying offense, the fine guideline shall be the fine guideline that would have been applicable had there only been a conviction for the underlying offense. This guideline shall be used as a consolidated fine guideline for both the underlying offense and the conviction underlying this section.&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §2K2.4 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended by inserting the following additional note:</p>
<p>&quot;4. Subsection (b) sets forth special provisions concerning the imposition of fines. Where there is also a conviction for the underlying offense, a consolidated fine guideline is determined by the offense level that would have applied to the underlying offense absent a conviction under 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) or 929(a). This is because the offense level for the underlying offense may be reduced when there is also a conviction under 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) or 929(a) in that any specific offense characteristic for possession, use, or discharge of a firearm is not applied (<em>see</em> Application Note 2). The Commission has not established a fine guideline range for the unusual case in which there is no conviction for the underlying offense.&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> The purpose of this amendment is to address the imposition of a fine or term of supervised release when this guideline applies.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> The purpose of this amendment is to reflect a new offense enacted by Section 6215 of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988. A base offense level of 6 is provided for the misdemeanor portion of this statute. The felony portion of this statute (possession with intent to commit another offense) is treated as if an attempt to commit that other offense.</p>

</blockquote>
<p><strong>192.</strong> <strong>Amendment:</strong> Section 2L1.1(b) is amended by inserting the following additional subsection:</p>

<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> The purposes of this amendment are to provide an offense level that is no less than that provided under §2L1.2 in the case of a defendant who is a previously deported alien, and to conform Application Note 6 of the Commentary to §2L1.1 to the January 1988 revision of §2L1.1.</p>

<p><strong>193.</strong> <strong>Amendment:</strong> Section 2L1.2 is amended by inserting the following additional subsection:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;(b) Specific Offense Characteristic</p>
<p>(1) If the defendant previously was deported after sustaining a conviction for a felony, other than a felony involving violation of the immigration laws, increase by 4 levels.&quot;,</p>
<p>The Commentary to §2L1.2 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended by inserting the following additional notes:</p>
<p>&quot;3. A 4-level increase is provided under subsection (b)(1) in the case of a defendant who was previously deported after sustaining a conviction for a felony, other than a felony involving a violation of the immigration laws. In the case of a defendant previously deported after sustaining a conviction for an aggravated felony as defined in 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a), or for any other violent felony, an upward departure may be warranted.</p>
<p>4. The adjustment under §2L1.2(b)(1) is in addition to any criminal history points added for such conviction in Chapter 4, Part A (Criminal History).&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> The purpose of this amendment is to add a specific offense characteristic to provide an increase in the case of an alien previously deported after conviction of a felony other than an immigration law violation. This specific offense characteristic is in addition to, and not in lieu of, criminal history points added for the prior sentence. The amendment provides for consideration of an upward departure where the previous deportation was for an &quot;aggravated felony&quot; or for any other violent felony.</p>

Subsection (b)(1) applies if the defendant knew or believed the funds were criminally derived property. Subsection (b)(1) applies in addition to, and not in lieu of, subsection (a)(1)(C). Where subsection (b)(1) applies, subsection (a)(1)(C) also will apply. It is possible that a defendant ‘believed’ or ‘reasonably should have believed’ that the funds were criminally derived property even if, in fact, the funds were not so derived (<em>e.g.</em>, in a ‘sting’ operation where the defendant is told the funds were derived from the unlawful sale of controlled substances).&quot;.</p>

<p>&quot;A base offense level of 13 is provided for those offenses where the defendant either structured the transaction to evade reporting requirements, made false statements to conceal or disguise the activity, or reasonably should have believed that the funds were criminally derived property. A lower alternative base offense level of 5 is provided in all other cases. The Commission anticipates that such cases will involve simple recordkeeping or other more minor technical violations of the regulatory scheme governing certain monetary transactions committed by defendants who reasonably believe that the funds at issue emanated from legitimate sources.</p>
<p>Where the defendant actually knew or believed that the funds were criminally derived property, subsection (b)(1) provides for a 5 level increase in the offense level.&quot;.</p>

In accordance with the ‘relevant conduct’ approach adopted by the guidelines, tax losses resulting from more than one year are to be added whether or not the defendant is convicted of multiple counts.&quot;,</p>
<p>and inserting in lieu thereof:</p>
<p>&quot;In determining the total tax loss attributable to the offense (<em>see</em> §1B1.3(a)(2)), all conduct violating the tax laws should be considered as part of the same course of conduct or common scheme or plan unless the evidence demonstrates that the conduct is clearly unrelated. The following examples are illustrative of conduct that is part of the same course of conduct or common scheme or plan: (a) there is a continuing pattern of violations of the tax laws by the defendant; (b) the defendant uses a consistent method to evade or camouflage income, <em>e.g.</em>, backdating documents or using off-shore accounts; (c) the violations involve the same or a related series of transactions; (d) the violation in each instance involves a false or inflated claim of a similar deduction or credit; and (e) the violation in each instance involves a failure to report or an understatement of a specific source of income, <em>e.g.</em>, interest from savings accounts or income from a particular business activity.

<p>3. The specific offense characteristics are in addition to those specified in §2T1.1 and §2T1.3.</p>

Especially when such items are harmful or protective quotas are in effect, the duties evaded on such items may not adequately reflect the harm to society or protected industries resulting from their importation. In such instances, the court should impose a sentence above the guideline. A sentence based upon an alternative measure of the ‘duty’ evaded, such as the increase in market value due to importation, or 25 percent of the items’ fair market value in the United States if the increase in market value due to importation is not readily ascertainable, might be considered.&quot;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Section 2X1.1(b) is amended by deleting:</p>

<p>&quot;4. In certain cases, the participants may have completed (or have been about to complete but for apprehension or interruption) all of the acts necessary for the successful completion of part, but not all, of the intended offense. In such cases, the offense level for the count (or group of closely-related multiple counts) is whichever of the following is greater: the offense level for the intended offense minus 3 levels (under §2X1.1(b)(1), (b)(2), or (b)(3)(A)), or the offense level for the part of the offense for which the necessary acts were completed (or about to be completed but for apprehension or interruption). For example, where the intended offense was the theft of $800,000 but the participants completed (or were about to complete) only the acts necessary to steal $30,000, the offense level is the offense level for the theft of $800,000 minus 3 levels, or the offense level for the theft of $30,000, whichever is greater.</p>

<p>increase by 3 levels.&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §3A1.2 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended by inserting the following additional notes:</p>
<p>&quot;4. ‘Motivated by such status’ in subdivision (a) means that the offense of conviction was motivated by the fact that the victim was a law enforcement or corrections officer or other person covered under 18 U.S.C. § 1114, or a member of the immediate family thereof. This adjustment would not apply, for example, where both the defendant and victim were employed by the same government agency and the offense was motivated by a personal dispute.</p>
<p>5. Subdivision (b) applies in circumstances tantamount to aggravated assault against a law enforcement or corrections officer, committed in the course of, or in immediate flight following, another offense, such as bank robbery. While this subdivision may apply in connection with a variety of offenses that are not by nature targeted against official victims, its applicability is limited to assaultive conduct against law enforcement or corrections officers that is sufficiently serious to create at least a ‘substantial risk of serious bodily injury’ and that is proximate in time to the commission of the offense.</p>
<p>6. The phrase ‘substantial risk of serious bodily injury’ in subdivision (b) is a threshold level of harm that includes any more serious injury that was risked, as well as actual serious bodily injury (or more serious harm) if it occurs.&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> The purpose of the amendment is to set forth more clearly the categories of cases to which this adjustment is intended to apply.</p>
