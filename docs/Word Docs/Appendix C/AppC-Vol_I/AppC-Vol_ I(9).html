<blockquote>
<p>c. Defendant D pays Defendant E a small amount to forge an endorsement on an $800 stolen government check. Unknown to Defendant E, Defendant D then uses that check as a down payment in a scheme to fraudulently obtain $15,000 worth of merchandise. Defendant E is convicted of forging the $800 check. Defendant E is not accountable for the $15,000 because the fraudulent scheme to obtain $15,000 was beyond the scope of, and not reasonably foreseeable in connection with, the criminal activity he jointly undertook with Defendant D.</p>
<p>d. Defendants F and G, working together, design and execute a scheme to sell fraudulent stocks by telephone. Defendant F fraudulently obtains $20,000. Defendant G fraudulently obtains $35,000. Each is convicted of mail fraud. Each defendant is accountable for the entire amount ($55,000) because each aided and abetted the other in the fraudulent conduct. Alternatively, because Defendants F and G engaged in concerted criminal activity, each is accountable for the entire $55,000 loss because the conduct of each was in furtherance of the jointly undertaken criminal activity and was reasonably foreseeable.</p>
<p>e. Defendants H and I engaged in an ongoing marihuana importation conspiracy in which Defendant J was hired only to help off-load a single shipment. Defendants H, I, and J are included in a single count charging conspiracy to import marihuana. For the purposes of determining the offense level under this guideline, Defendant J is accountable for the entire single shipment of marihuana he conspired to help import and any acts or omissions in furtherance of the importation that were reasonably foreseeable. He is not accountable for prior or subsequent shipments of marihuana imported by Defendants H or I if those acts were beyond the scope of, and not reasonably foreseeable in connection with, the criminal activity he agreed to jointly undertake with Defendants H and I (<em>i.e.</em>, the importation of the single shipment of marihuana).&quot;,</p>
<p>and inserting in lieu thereof:</p>
<p>&quot;1. The principles and limits of sentencing accountability under this guideline are not always the same as the principles and limits of criminal liability. Under subsections (a)(1) and (a)(2), the focus is on the specific acts and omissions for which the defendant is to be held accountable in determining the applicable guideline range, rather than on whether the defendant is criminally liable for an offense as a principal, accomplice, or conspirator.</p>
<p>2. A ‘jointly undertaken criminal activity’ is a criminal plan, scheme, endeavor, or enterprise undertaken by the defendant in concert with others, whether or not charged as a conspiracy.</p>
<p>In the case of a jointly undertaken criminal activity, subsection (a)(1)(B) provides that a defendant is accountable for the conduct (acts and omissions) of others that was both:</p>
<p>(i) in furtherance of the jointly undertaken criminal activity; and</p>
<p>(ii) reasonably foreseeable in connection with that criminal activity.</p>
<p>Because a count may be worded broadly and include the conduct of many participants over a period of time, the scope of the criminal activity jointly undertaken by the defendant (the ‘jointly undertaken criminal activity’) is not necessarily the same as the scope of the entire conspiracy, and hence relevant conduct is not necessarily the same for every participant. In order to determine the defendant’s accountability for the conduct of others under subsection (a)(1)(B), the court must first determine the scope of the criminal activity the particular defendant agreed to jointly undertake (<em>i.e.</em>, the scope of the specific conduct and objectives embraced by the defendant’s agreement). The conduct of others that was both in furtherance of, and reasonably foreseeable in connection with, the criminal activity jointly undertaken by the defendant is relevant conduct under this provision. The conduct of others that was not in furtherance of the criminal activity jointly undertaken by the defendant, or was not reasonably foreseeable in connection with that criminal activity, is not relevant conduct under this provision.</p>
<p>In determining the scope of the criminal activity that the particular defendant agreed to jointly undertake (<em>i.e.</em>, the scope of the specific conduct and objectives embraced by the defendant’s agreement), the court may consider any explicit agreement or implicit agreement fairly inferred from the conduct of the defendant and others.</p>
<p>Note that the criminal activity that the defendant agreed to jointly undertake, and the reasonably foreseeable conduct of others in furtherance of that criminal activity, are not necessarily identical. For example, two defendants agree to commit a robbery and, during the course of that robbery, the first defendant assaults and injures a victim. The second defendant is accountable for the assault and injury to the victim (even if the second defendant had not agreed to the assault and had cautioned the first defendant to be careful not to hurt anyone) because the assaultive conduct was in furtherance of the jointly undertaken criminal activity (the robbery) and was reasonably foreseeable in connection with that criminal activity (given the nature of the offense).</p>
<p>With respect to offenses involving contraband (including controlled substances), the defendant is accountable for all quantities of contraband with which he was directly involved and, in the case of a jointly undertaken criminal activity, all reasonably foreseeable quantities of contraband that were within the scope of the criminal activity that he jointly undertook.</p>
<p>The requirement of reasonable foreseeability applies only in respect to the conduct (<em>i.e.</em>, acts and omissions) of others under subsection (a)(1)(B). It does not apply to conduct that the defendant personally undertakes, aids, abets, counsels, commands, induces, procures, or willfully causes; such conduct is addressed under subsection (a)(1)(A).</p>
<p><em>Illustrations of Conduct for Which the Defendant is Accountable</em></p>
<p>(a) <em>Acts and omissions aided or abetted by the defendant</em></p>
<p>(1) Defendant A is one of ten persons hired by Defendant B to off-load a ship containing marihuana. The off-loading of the ship is interrupted by law enforcement officers and one ton of marihuana is seized (the amount on the ship as well as the amount off-loaded). Defendant A and the other off-loaders are arrested and convicted of importation of marihuana. Regardless of the number of bales he personally unloaded, Defendant A is accountable for the entire one-ton quantity of marihuana. Defendant A aided and abetted the off-loading of the entire shipment of marihuana by directly participating in the off-loading of that shipment (<em>i.e.</em>, the specific objective of the criminal activity he joined was the off-loading of the entire shipment). Therefore, he is accountable for the entire shipment under subsection (a)(1)(A) without regard to the issue of reasonable foreseeability. This is conceptually similar to the case of a defendant who transports a suitcase knowing that it contains a controlled substance and, therefore, is accountable for the controlled substance in the suitcase regardless of his knowledge or lack of knowledge of the actual type or amount of that controlled substance.</p>
<p>In certain cases, a defendant may be accountable for particular conduct under more than one subsection of this guideline. As noted in the preceding paragraph, Defendant A is accountable for the entire one-ton shipment of marihuana under subsection (a)(1)(A). Defendant A also is accountable for the entire one-ton shipment of marihuana on the basis of subsection (a)(1)(B)(applying to a jointly undertaken criminal activity). Defendant A engaged in a jointly undertaken criminal activity (the scope of which was the importation of the shipment of marihuana). A finding that the one-ton quantity of marihuana was reasonably foreseeable is warranted from the nature of the undertaking itself (the importation of marihuana by ship typically involves very large quantities of marihuana). The specific circumstances of the case (the defendant was one of ten persons off-loading the marihuana in bales) also support this finding. In an actual case, of course, if a defendant’s accountability for particular conduct is established under one provision of this guideline, it is not necessary to review alternative provisions under which such accountability might be established.</p>
<p>(b) <em>Acts and omissions aided or abetted by the defendant; requirement that the conduct of others be in furtherance of the jointly undertaken criminal activity and reasonably foreseeable</em></p>
<p>(1) Defendant C is the getaway driver in an armed bank robbery in which $15,000 is taken and a teller is assaulted and injured. Defendant C is accountable for the money taken under subsection (a)(1)(A) because he aided and abetted the act of taking the money (the taking of money was the specific objective of the offense he joined). Defendant C is accountable for the injury to the teller under subsection (a)(1)(B) because the assault on the teller was in furtherance of the jointly undertaken criminal activity (the robbery) and was reasonably foreseeable in connection with that criminal activity (given the nature of the offense).</p>
<p>As noted earlier, a defendant may be accountable for particular conduct under more than one subsection. In this example, Defendant C also is accountable for the money taken on the basis of subsection (a)(1)(B) because the taking of money was in furtherance of the jointly undertaken criminal activity (the robbery) and was reasonably foreseeable (as noted, the taking of money was the specific objective of the jointly undertaken criminal activity).</p>
<p>(c) <em>Requirement that the conduct of others be in furtherance of the jointly undertaken criminal activity and reasonably foreseeable; scope of the criminal activity</em></p>
<p>(1) Defendant D pays Defendant E a small amount to forge an endorsement on an $800 stolen government check. Unknown to Defendant E, Defendant D then uses that check as a down payment in a scheme to fraudulently obtain $15,000 worth of merchandise. Defendant E is convicted of forging the $800 check and is accountable for the forgery of this check under subsection (a)(1)(A). Defendant E is not accountable for the $15,000 because the fraudulent scheme to obtain $15,000 was not in furtherance of the criminal activity he jointly undertook with Defendant D (<em>i.e.</em>, the forgery of the $800 check).</p>
<p>(2) Defendants F and G, working together, design and execute a scheme to sell fraudulent stocks by telephone. Defendant F fraudulently obtains $20,000. Defendant G fraudulently obtains $35,000. Each is convicted of mail fraud. Defendants F and G each are accountable for the entire amount ($55,000). Each defendant is accountable for the amount he personally obtained under subsection (a)(1)(A). Each defendant is accountable for the amount obtained by his accomplice under subsection (a)(1)(B) because the conduct of each was in furtherance of the jointly undertaken criminal activity and was reasonably foreseeable in connection with that criminal activity.</p>
<p>(3) Defendants H and I engaged in an ongoing marihuana importation conspiracy in which Defendant J was hired only to help off-load a single shipment. Defendants H, I, and J are included in a single count charging conspiracy to import marihuana. Defendant J is accountable for the entire single shipment of marihuana he helped import under subsection (a)(1)(A) and any acts and omissions in furtherance of the importation of that shipment that were reasonably foreseeable (<em>see</em> the discussion in example (a)(1) above). He is not accountable for prior or subsequent shipments of marihuana imported by Defendants H or I because those acts were not in furtherance of his jointly undertaken criminal activity (the importation of the single shipment of marihuana).</p>
<p>(4) Defendant K is a wholesale distributor of child pornography. Defendant L is a retail-level dealer who purchases child pornography from Defendant K and resells it, but otherwise operates independently of Defendant K. Similarly, Defendant M is a retail-level dealer who purchases child pornography from Defendant K and resells it, but otherwise operates independently of Defendant K. Defendants L and M are aware of each other’s criminal activity but operate independently. Defendant N is Defendant K’s assistant who recruits customers for Defendant K and frequently supervises the deliveries to Defendant K’s customers. Each defendant is convicted of a count charging conspiracy to distribute child pornography. Defendant K is accountable under subsection (a)(1)(A) for the entire quantity of child pornography sold to Defendants L and M. Defendant N also is accountable for the entire quantity sold to those defendants under subsection (a)(1)(B) because the entire quantity was within the scope of his jointly undertaken criminal activity and reasonably foreseeable. Defendant L is accountable under subsection (a)(1)(A) only for the quantity of child pornography that he purchased from Defendant K because the scope of his jointly undertaken criminal activity is limited to that amount. For the same reason, Defendant M is accountable under subsection (a)(1)(A) only for the quantity of child pornography that he purchased from Defendant K.</p>
<p>(5) Defendant O knows about her boyfriend’s ongoing drug-trafficking activity, but agrees to participate on only one occasion by making a delivery for him at his request when he was ill. Defendant O is accountable under subsection (a)(1)(A) for the drug quantity involved on that one occasion. Defendant O is not accountable for the other drug sales made by her boyfriend because those sales were not in furtherance of her jointly undertaken criminal activity (<em>i.e.</em>, the one delivery).</p>
<p>(6) Defendant P is a street-level drug dealer who knows of other street-level drug dealers in the same geographic area who sell the same type of drug as he sells. Defendant P and the other dealers share a common source of supply, but otherwise operate independently. Defendant P is not accountable for the quantities of drugs sold by the other street-level drug dealers because he is not engaged in a jointly undertaken criminal activity with them. In contrast, Defendant Q, another street-level drug dealer, pools his resources and profits with four other street-level drug dealers. Defendant Q is engaged in a jointly undertaken criminal activity and, therefore, he is accountable under subsection (a)(1)(B) for the quantities of drugs sold by the four other dealers during the course of his joint undertaking with them because those sales were in furtherance of the jointly undertaken criminal activity and reasonably foreseeable in connection with that criminal activity.</p>
<p>(7) Defendant R recruits Defendant S to distribute 500 grams of cocaine. Defendant S knows that Defendant R is the prime figure in a conspiracy involved in importing much larger quantities of cocaine. As long as Defendant S’s agreement and conduct is limited to the distribution of the 500 grams, Defendant S is accountable only for that 500 gram amount (under subsection (a)(1)(A)), rather than the much larger quantity imported by Defendant R.</p>
<p>(8) Defendants T, U, V, and W are hired by a supplier to backpack a quantity of marihuana across the border from Mexico into the United States. Defendants T, U, V, and W receive their individual shipments from the supplier at the same time and coordinate their importation efforts by walking across the border together for mutual assistance and protection. Each defendant is accountable for the aggregate quantity of marihuana transported by the four defendants. The four defendants engaged in a jointly undertaken criminal activity, the object of which was the importation of the four backpacks containing marihuana (subsection (a)(1)(B)), and aided and abetted each other’s actions (subsection (a)(1)(A)) in carrying out the jointly undertaken criminal activity. In contrast, if Defendants T, U, V, and W were hired individually, transported their individual shipments at different times, and otherwise operated independently, each defendant would be accountable only for the quantity of marihuana he personally transported (subsection (a)(1)(A)). As this example illustrates, in cases involving contraband (including controlled substances), the scope of the jointly undertaken criminal activity (and thus the accountability of the defendant for the contraband that was the object of that jointly undertaken activity) may depend upon whether, in the particular circumstances, the nature of the offense is more appropriately viewed as one jointly undertaken criminal activity or as a number of separate criminal activities.&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §1B1.3 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended in Note 3 (formerly Note 2) by deleting the first sentence as follows:</p>
<p>&quot;‘Such acts and omissions that were part of the same course of conduct or common scheme or plan as the offense of conviction,’ as used in subsection (a)(2), refers to acts and omissions committed or aided and abetted by the defendant, or for which the defendant would be otherwise accountable, that were part of the same course of conduct or common scheme or plan as the offense of conviction.&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §1B1.3 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended in Note 6 (formerly Note 5) in the first paragraph by deleting:</p>
<p>&quot;For example, in §2K1.5, subsection (b)(1) applies ‘If the defendant is convicted under 49 U.S.C. § 1472(l)(2).’&quot;,</p>
<p>and inserting in lieu thereof:</p>
<p>&quot;For example, in §2S1.1, subsection (a)(1) applies if the defendant ‘is convicted under 18 U.S.C. § 1956(a)(1)(A), (a)(2)(A), or (a)(3)(A).’&quot;;</p>
<p>and in the second paragraph by deleting:</p>
<p>&quot;For example, §2K1.5(b)(1) (which is applicable only if the defendant is convicted under 49 U.S.C. § 1472(l)(2)) would be applied in determining the offense level under §2X3.1 (Accessory After the Fact) where the defendant was convicted of accessory after the fact to a violation of 49 U.S.C. § 1472(l)(2).&quot;,</p>
<p>and inserting in lieu thereof:</p>
<p>&quot;For example, §2S1.1(a)(1) (which is applicable only if the defendant is convicted under 18 U.S.C. § 1956(a)(1)(A), (a)(2)(A), or (a)(3)(A)) would be applied in determining the offense level under §2X3.1 (Accessory After the Fact) where the defendant was convicted of accessory after the fact to a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1956(a)(1)(A), (a)(2)(A), or (a)(3)(A).&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §1B1.3 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended by inserting the following additional notes:</p>
<p>&quot;9. ‘Common scheme or plan’ and ‘same course of conduct’ are two closely-related concepts.</p>
<p>(A) <em>Common scheme or plan</em>. For two or more offenses to constitute part of a common scheme or plan, they must be substantially connected to each other by at least one common factor, such as common victims, common accomplices, common purpose, or similar <em>modus</em> <em>operandi</em>. For example, the conduct of five defendants who together defrauded a group of investors by computer manipulations that unlawfully transferred funds over an eighteen-month period would qualify as a common scheme or plan on the basis of any of the above listed factors; <em>i.e.</em>, the commonality of victims (the same investors were defrauded on an ongoing basis), commonality of offenders (the conduct constituted an ongoing conspiracy), commonality of purpose (to defraud the group of investors), or similarity of <em>modus</em> <em>operandi</em> (the same or similar computer manipulations were used to execute the scheme).</p>
<p>(B) <em>Same course of conduct</em>. Offenses that do not qualify as part of a common scheme or plan may nonetheless qualify as part of the same course of conduct if they are sufficiently connected or related to each other as to warrant the conclusion that they are part of a single episode, spree, or ongoing series of offenses. Factors that are appropriate to the determination of whether offenses are sufficiently connected or related to each other to be considered as part of the same course of conduct include the degree of similarity of the offenses and the time interval between the offenses. The nature of the offenses may also be a relevant consideration (<em>e.g.</em>, a defendant’s failure to file tax returns in three consecutive years appropriately would be considered as part of the same course of conduct because such returns are only required at yearly intervals).</p>
<p>10. In the case of solicitation, misprision, or accessory after the fact, the conduct for which the defendant is accountable includes all conduct relevant to determining the offense level for the underlying offense that was known, or reasonably should have been known, by the defendant.&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This amendment clarifies and more fully illustrates the operation of this guideline. Material is moved from the commentary to the guideline itself and rephrased for greater clarity, the discussion of the application of this provision in the commentary is expanded, and additional examples are inserted. In addition, this amendment provides definitions of the terms &quot;same course of conduct&quot; and &quot;common scheme or plan.&quot; Finally, this amendment conforms an example in Application Note 6 of the Commentary to a revision of a Chapter Two offense guideline.</p>

<p><strong>440.</strong> <strong>Amendment:</strong> Section 1B1.5 is amended by deleting:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Unless otherwise expressly indicated, a reference to another guideline, or an instruction to apply another guideline, refers to the entire guideline, <em>i.e.</em>, the base offense level plus all applicable specific offense characteristics and cross references.&quot;,</p>
<p>and inserting in lieu thereof:</p>
<p>&quot;(a) A cross reference (an instruction to apply another offense guideline) refers to the entire offense guideline (<em>i.e.</em>, the base offense level, specific offense characteristics, cross references, and special instructions).</p>
<p>(b) (1) An instruction to use the offense level from another offense guideline refers to the offense level from the entire offense guideline (<em>i.e.</em>, the base offense level, specific offense characteristics, cross references, and special instructions), except as provided in subdivision (2) below.</p>
<p>(2) An instruction to use a particular subsection or table from another offense guideline refers only to the particular subsection or table referenced, and not to the entire offense guideline.</p>
<p>(c) If the offense level is determined by a reference to another guideline under subsection (a) or (b)(1) above, the adjustments in Chapter Three (Adjustments) also are determined in respect to the referenced offense guideline, except as otherwise expressly provided.</p>
<p>(d) A reference to another guideline under subsection (a) or (b)(1) above may direct that it be applied only if it results in the greater offense level. In such case, the greater offense level means the greater final offense level (<em>i.e.</em>, the greater offense level taking into account both the Chapter Two offense level and any applicable Chapter Three adjustments).&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §1B1.5 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended in Note 1 by deleting:</p>
<p>&quot;are to be construed to incorporate the specific offense characteristics and cross references&quot;,</p>
<p>and inserting in lieu thereof:</p>
<p>&quot;incorporate the specific offense characteristics, cross references, and special instructions&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §1B1.5 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended by deleting Note 2 as follows:</p>
<p>&quot;2. A reference may require that the offense level be determined under another offense guideline. In such case, the adjustments in Chapter Three, Parts A (Victim-Related Adjustments), B (Role in the Offense), and E (Acceptance of Responsibility) are also to be determined in respect to that other offense guideline. For example, a defendant convicted of possession of a firearm by a felon, to which §2K2.1 (Unlawful Receipt, Possession, or Transportation of Firearms or Ammunition; Prohibited Transactions Involving Firearms or Ammunition) applies, is found to have used that firearm in the commission of a robbery. The cross reference at §2K2.1(c) directs that the robbery offense guideline be used. The adjustments in Chapter Three, Parts A, B and E are to be applied as if the offense of conviction had directly referenced the robbery guideline.&quot;;</p>
<p>and by renumbering Notes 3 and 4 as Notes 2 and 3, respectively.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This amendment clarifies the operation of this guideline and moves an instruction currently contained in the commentary into the guideline itself.</p>

<p><strong>441.</strong> <strong>Amendment:</strong> Section 1B1.8(b) is amended in subdivision (3) by deleting &quot;or&quot; immediately following the semicolon; in subdivision (4) by deleting the period at the end and inserting in lieu thereof &quot;; or&quot;; and by inserting the following additional subdivision:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;(5) in determining whether, or to what extent, a downward departure from the guidelines is warranted pursuant to a government motion under §5K1.1 (Substantial Assistance to Authorities).&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §1B1.8 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended in Note 1 by deleting the third sentence as follows:</p>
<p>&quot;Although this guideline, consistent with the general structure of these guidelines, affects only the determination of the guideline range, the policy of the Commission is that where a defendant as a result of a cooperation agreement with the government to assist in the investigation or prosecution of other offenders reveals information that implicates him in unlawful conduct not already known to the government, such defendant should not be subject to an increased sentence by virtue of that cooperation where the government agreed that the information revealed would not be used for such purpose.&quot;,</p>
<p>and inserting in lieu thereof:</p>
<p>&quot;Although the guideline itself affects only the determination of the guideline range, the policy of the Commission, as a corollary, is that information prohibited from being used to determine the applicable guideline range shall not be used to increase the defendant’s sentence above the applicable guideline range by upward departure. In contrast, subsection (b)(5) provides that consideration of such information is appropriate in determining whether, and to what extent, a downward departure is warranted pursuant to a government motion under §5K1.1 (Substantial Assistance to Authorities); <em>e.g.</em>, a court may refuse to depart below the applicable guideline range on the basis of such information.&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §1B1.8 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended in Note 3 in the second sentence by deleting:</p>
<p>&quot;is governed by the provisions of Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure and Rule 410&quot;,</p>
<p>and inserting in lieu thereof:</p>

<p>The Commentary to §1B1.8 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended in Note 5 in the second sentence by deleting &quot;repeats&quot; and inserting in lieu thereof &quot;provides&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This amendment clarifies the operation of this guideline. Information protected by this guideline may not be used to determine the applicable guideline range. An upward departure on the basis of such information would be contrary to the Commission’s policy (and, consequently, would be appealable under 18 U.S.C. § 3742(a)(2) and (3). <em>See</em> <em>Williams v. United States</em>, 112 S.Ct. 1112 (1992)). In contrast, the use of information covered by this guideline is appropriate in considering whether, and to what extent, a downward departure under §5K1.1 (Substantial Assistance to Authorities) is appropriate. In addition, this amendment makes minor editorial improvements.</p>

<p>The Commentary to §2A3.1 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended by renumbering Note 3 as Note 4; and by inserting the following additional note:</p>
<p>&quot;3. Subsection (b)(3), as it pertains to a victim in the custody, care, or supervisory control of the defendant, is intended to have broad application and is to be applied whenever the victim is entrusted to the defendant, whether temporarily or permanently. For example, teachers, day care providers, baby-sitters, or other temporary caretakers are among those who would be subject to this enhancement. In determining whether to apply this enhancement, the court should look to the actual relationship that existed between the defendant and the victim and not simply to the legal status of the defendant-victim relationship.&quot;.</p>
<p>Section 2A3.2 is amended by inserting the following additional subsection:</p>
<p>&quot;(c) Cross Reference</p>
<p>(1) If the offense involved criminal sexual abuse or attempt to commit criminal sexual abuse (as defined in 18 U.S.C. § 2241 or § 2242), apply §2A3.1 (Criminal Sexual Abuse; Attempt to Commit Criminal Sexual Abuse).&quot;.</p>

<p>&quot;(c) Cross References</p>
<p>(1) If the offense involved criminal sexual abuse or attempt to commit criminal sexual abuse (as defined in 18 U.S.C. § 2241 or § 2242), apply §2A3.1 (Criminal Sexual Abuse; Attempt to Commit Criminal Sexual Abuse).</p>
<p>(2) If the offense involved criminal sexual abuse of a minor or attempt to commit criminal sexual abuse of a minor (as defined in 18 U.S.C. § 2243(a)), apply §2A3.2 (Criminal Sexual Abuse of a Minor or Attempt to Commit Such Acts), if the resulting offense level is greater than that determined above.&quot;.</p>

<p>Section 2G1.2(c)(2) is amended by deleting &quot;or Assault with the Intent&quot; immediately before &quot;to Commit Criminal Sexual Abuse&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §2X1.1 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended in Note 1 in the second paragraph by deleting &quot;or Assault with the Intent&quot; immediately before &quot;to Commit Criminal Sexual Abuse&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This amendment cross references §2A3.2 to §2A3.1, and §2A3.4 to §§2A3.1 and 2A3.2. A review of cases sentenced under these guidelines indicated that a significant proportion of cases sentenced under §2A3.2 and §2A3.4 clearly involved conduct that would more appropriately be covered under an offense guideline applicable to more serious sexual abuse cases. The addition of these cross references is designed to address this issue. In addition, this amendment removes an anomaly between §2A3.1(b)(3) and §3A1.2(a), and adds application notes to clarify the scope of §§2A3.1(b)(3), 2A3.2(b)(1), and 2A3.4(b)(3), using language derived from application notes pertaining to similar specific offense characteristics in Chapter Two, Part G.</p>

<p><strong>445.</strong> <strong>Amendment:</strong> The Commentary to §2A4.1 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended by inserting the following additional note:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;5. In the case of a conspiracy, attempt, or solicitation to kidnap, §2X1.1 (Attempt, Solicitation, or Conspiracy) requires that the court apply any adjustment that can be determined with reasonable certainty. Therefore, for example, if an offense involved conspiracy to kidnap for the purpose of committing murder, subsection (b)(7) would reference first degree murder (resulting in an offense level of 43, subject to a possible 3-level reduction under §2X1.1(b)). Similarly, for example, if an offense involved a kidnapping during which a participant attempted to murder the victim under circumstances that would have constituted first degree murder had death occurred, the offense referenced under subsection (b)(7) would be the offense of first degree murder.&quot;.</p>

Certain pharmaceutical preparations are classified as Schedule III, IV, or V controlled substances by the Drug Enforcement Administration under 21 C.F.R. § 1308.13-15 even though they contain a small amount of a Schedule I or II controlled substance. For example, Tylenol 3 is classified as a Schedule III controlled substance even though it contains a small amount of codeine, a Schedule II opiate. For the purposes of the guidelines, the classification of the controlled substance under 21 C.F.R. § 1308.13-15 is the appropriate classification.&quot;.</p>

<p>1. If the defendant is convicted of a conspiracy that includes transactions in controlled substances in addition to those that are the subject of substantive counts of conviction, each conspiracy transaction shall be included with those of the substantive counts of conviction to determine scale. If the defendant is convicted of an offense involving negotiation to traffic in a controlled substance, the weight under negotiation in an uncompleted distribution shall be used to calculate the applicable amount. However, where the court finds that the defendant did not intend to produce and was not reasonably capable of producing the negotiated amount, the court shall exclude from the guideline calculation the amount that it finds the defendant did not intend to produce and was not reasonably capable of producing. If the defendant is convicted of conspiracy, <em>see</em> Application Note 1 to §1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct).</p>
<p>2. Where there is no drug seizure or the amount seized does not reflect the scale of the offense, the sentencing judge shall approximate the quantity of the controlled substance. In making this determination, the judge may consider, for example, the price generally obtained for the controlled substance, financial or other records, similar transactions in controlled substances by the defendant, and the size or capability of any laboratory involved.</p>

<p>(1) The offense level from §2D1.1 applicable to the underlying controlled substance offense, except as provided below.</p>
<p>(2) If the defendant had no participation in the underlying controlled substance offense other than allowing use of the premises, the offense level shall be 4 levels less than the offense level from §2D1.1 applicable to the underlying controlled substance offense, but not greater than level 16.</p>
<p>(b) Special Instruction</p>
<p>(1) If the offense level is determined under subsection (a)(2), do not apply an adjustment under §3B1.2 (Mitigating Role).&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §2D1.8 captioned &quot;Application Note&quot; is amended by deleting Note 1 as follows:</p>
<p>&quot;1. Definitions of ‘firearm’ and ‘dangerous weapon’ are found in the Commentary to §1B1.1 (Application Instructions).&quot;,</p>
<p>and inserting in lieu thereof:</p>
<p>&quot;1. Subsection (a)(2) does not apply unless the defendant had no participation in the underlying controlled substance offense other than allowing use of the premises. For example, subsection (a)(2) would not apply to a defendant who possessed a dangerous weapon in connection with the offense, a defendant who guarded the cache of controlled substances, a defendant who arranged for the use of the premises for the purpose of facilitating a drug transaction, a defendant who allowed the use of more than one premises, a defendant who made telephone calls to facilitate the underlying controlled substance offense, or a defendant who otherwise assisted in the commission of the underlying controlled substance offense. Furthermore, subsection (a)(2) does not apply unless the defendant initially leased, rented, purchased, or otherwise acquired a possessory interest in the premises for a legitimate purpose. Finally, subsection (a)(2) does not apply if the defendant had previously allowed any premises to be used as a drug establishment without regard to whether such prior misconduct resulted in a conviction.&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This amendment is designed to reduce unwarranted disparity by requiring consideration in the guideline of the scale of the underlying controlled substance offense. The amendment parallels an amendment to §2D1.6 made in 1990 (amendment 320).</p>

<p>3. If the defendant was convicted under 8 U.S.C. § 1328, apply the applicable guideline from Part G (see Statutory Index) rather than this guideline.</p>
<p>4. The adjustment under §2L1.1(b)(2) for a previous conviction is in addition to any points added to the criminal history score for such conviction in Chapter Four, Part A (Criminal History).

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> Prior to this amendment, §2L1.1 provided the same offense level for a defendant who smuggles, transports, or harbors 1, 5, 25, 50, or any number of unlawful aliens. The inclusion of specific offense characteristic (b)(2) in §2L1.1 in the guidelines as initially promulgated in April 1987 was intended to conform the guidelines to the offense level indicated by past practices data for &quot;ongoing criminal conduct.&quot; However, further study has convinced the Commission that the specific offense characteristic &quot;prior conviction for the same or similar offense&quot; is not a good proxy for such conduct. Moreover, the inclusion of a prior criminal record variable in the offense guideline is inconsistent with the general treatment of prior record as a separate dimension in the guidelines.</p>
<p>This amendment addresses these issues by providing an enhancement in the guideline for the number of aliens smuggled, transported, or harbored as a more direct measure of the scope of the offense. Consistent with the Commission’s general approach throughout the guidelines, the offense level increases gradually with the number of aliens. It should be noted that §3B1.1 (Aggravating Role) generally provides an additional increase of 2, 3, or 4 levels for organizers, managers, and supervisors in large-scale cases. The enhancement in this amendment pertaining to the number of aliens is designed to work in conjunction with the operation of the role enhancements from §3B1.1. Sections 2L2.1 and 2L2.3 are amended to follow the same structure.</p>
<p>In addition, this amendment expands the titles of §§2L2.1 and 2L2.2, and the statutory provisions to these sections, to include additional statutes appropriately covered by these guidelines.</p>

<p>(2) If the offense was committed in furtherance of, or to conceal, an offense covered by another offense guideline, apply that other offense guideline if the resulting offense level is greater than that determined above.&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §2N2.1 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended by deleting Note 2 as follows:</p>
<p>&quot;2. If the offense involved theft, fraud, bribery, revealing trade secrets, or destruction of property, apply the guideline applicable to the underlying conduct, rather than this guideline.&quot;,</p>

<p>&quot;<em>Application Notes</em>:</p>
<p>1. ‘For pecuniary gain’ means for receipt of, or in anticipation of receipt of, anything of value, whether monetary or in goods or services. Thus, offenses committed for pecuniary gain include both monetary and barter transactions. Similarly, activities designed to increase gross revenue are considered to be committed for pecuniary gain.</p>

<p>4. When information is reasonably available, ‘market value’ under subsection (b)(3)(A) shall be based on the fair-market retail price. Where the fair-market retail price is difficult to ascertain, the court may make a reasonable estimate using any reliable information, such as the reasonable replacement or restitution cost or the acquisition and preservation (<em>e.g.</em>, taxidermy) cost. Market value,</p>
<p>however, shall not be based on measurement of aesthetic loss (so called ‘contingent valuation’ methods).</p>
<p>5. If the offense involved the destruction of a substantial quantity of fish, wildlife, or plants, and the seriousness of the offense is not adequately measured by the market value, an upward departure may be warranted.&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §2Q2.1 captioned &quot;Background&quot; is amended by deleting the last two sentences as follows:</p>
<p>&quot;Enhancements are provided where the offense involved a commercial purpose, and where the fish, wildlife, or plants were not quarantined as required by law. An additional enhancement is provided where the market value of the species exceeded $2,000 or the offense involved a quantity of fish, wildlife, or plants that was substantial in relation either to the population of the species or to a discrete subpopulation of the species.&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This amendment is designed to strengthen the deterrent effect of the sanctions for violations covered by this guideline. The amendment expands the specific offense characteristic in subsection (b)(1) to cover categories of offenses that appear to be equally serious to those committed for a commercial purpose. In addition, the amendment expands the specific offense characteristic in subsection (b)(2) to cover other comparable types of risk of harm. Furthermore, the amendment modifies the specific offense characteristic in subsection (b)(3) to better encompass the types of cases that the Commission intended to cover.</p>

<p>1. Particular attention should be given to those items for which entry is prohibited, limited, or restricted. Especially when such items are harmful or protective quotas are in effect, the duties evaded on such items may not adequately reflect the harm to society or protected industries resulting from their importation. In such instances, the court should impose a sentence above the guideline. A sentence based upon an alternative measure of the ‘duty’ evaded, such as the increase in market value due to importation, or 25 percent of the items’ fair market value in the United States if the increase in market value due to importation is not readily ascertainable, might be considered.&quot;.</p>

<p><strong>456.</strong> <strong>Amendment:</strong> The Introductory Commentary to Chapter Three, Part B is amended by deleting the third sentence of the first paragraph as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;However, where the defendant has received mitigation by virtue of being convicted of an offense significantly less serious than his actual criminal conduct, <em>e.g.</em>, the defendant is convicted of unlawful possession of a controlled substance but his actual conduct involved drug trafficking, a further reduction in the offense level under §3B1.2 (Mitigating Role) ordinarily is not warranted because the defendant is not substantially less culpable than a defendant whose only conduct involved the less serious offense.&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §3B1.2 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended by inserting the following additional note:</p>
<p>&quot;4. If a defendant has received a lower offense level by virtue of being convicted of an offense significantly less serious than warranted by his actual criminal conduct, a reduction for a mitigating role under this section ordinarily is not warranted because such defendant is not substantially less culpable than a defendant whose only conduct involved the less serious offense. For example, if a defendant whose actual conduct involved a minimal role in the distribution of 25 grams of cocaine (an offense having a Chapter Two offense level of 14 under §2D1.1) is convicted of simple possession of cocaine (an offense having a Chapter Two offense level of 6 under §2D2.1), no reduction for a mitigating role is warranted because the defendant is not substantially less culpable than a defendant whose only conduct involved the simple possession of cocaine.&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This amendment clarifies a situation in which a defendant is not ordinarily eligible for a reduction under §3B1.2 (Mitigating Role) and moves the discussion of this issue from the Introductory Commentary of Chapter Three, Part B, to the Commentary of §3B1.2, where it more appropriately belongs.</p>

<p>&quot;(a) truthfully admitting the conduct comprising the offense(s) of conviction, and truthfully admitting or not falsely denying any additional relevant conduct for which the defendant is accountable under §1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct). Note that a defendant is not required to volunteer, or affirmatively admit, relevant conduct beyond the offense of conviction in order to obtain a reduction under subsection (a). A defendant may remain silent in respect to relevant conduct beyond the offense of conviction without affecting his ability to obtain a reduction under this subsection. However, a defendant who falsely denies, or frivolously contests, relevant conduct that the court determines to be true has acted in a manner inconsistent with acceptance of responsibility;&quot;;</p>

<p>&quot;3. Entry of a plea of guilty prior to the commencement of trial combined with truthful admission of involvement in the offense and related conduct will constitute significant evidence of acceptance of responsibility for the purposes of this section. However, this evidence may be outweighed by conduct of the defendant that is inconsistent with such acceptance of responsibility.&quot;,</p>
<p>and by inserting in lieu thereof:</p>
<p>&quot;3. Entry of a plea of guilty prior to the commencement of trial combined with truthfully admitting the conduct comprising the offense of conviction, and truthfully admitting or not falsely denying any additional relevant conduct for which he is accountable under §1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct) (<em>see</em> Application Note 1(a)), will constitute significant evidence of acceptance of responsibility for the purposes of subsection (a). However, this evidence may be outweighed by conduct of the defendant that is inconsistent with such acceptance of responsibility. A defendant who enters a guilty plea is not entitled to an adjustment under this section as a matter of right.&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §3E1.1 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended by inserting the following additional note:</p>
<p>&quot;6. Subsection (a) provides a 2-level decrease in offense level. Subsection (b) provides an additional 1-level decrease in offense level for a defendant at offense level 16 or greater prior to the operation of subsection (a) who both qualifies for a decrease under subsection (a) and who has assisted authorities in the investigation or prosecution of his own misconduct by taking one or both of the steps set forth in subsection (b). The timeliness of the defendant’s acceptance of responsibility is a consideration under both subsections, and is context specific. In general, the conduct qualifying for a decrease in offense level under subsection (b)(1) or (2) will occur particularly early in the case. For example, to qualify under subsection (b)(2), the defendant must have notified authorities of his intention to enter a plea of guilty at a sufficiently early point in the process so that the government may avoid preparing for trial and the court may schedule its calendar efficiently.&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §3E1.1 captioned &quot;Background&quot; is amended by deleting &quot;a recognition and affirmative acceptance of personal responsibility for the offense and related conduct&quot; and inserting in lieu thereof &quot;acceptance of responsibility for his offense&quot;; and by inserting the following additional paragraph at the end:</p>
<p>&quot; Subsection (a) provides a 2-level decrease in offense level. Subsection (b) provides an additional 1-level decrease for a defendant at offense level 16 or greater prior to operation of subsection (a) who both qualifies for a decrease under subsection (a) and has assisted authorities in the investigation or prosecution of his own misconduct by taking one or more of the steps specified in subsection (b). Such a defendant has accepted responsibility in a way that ensures the certainty of his just punishment in a timely manner, thereby appropriately meriting an additional reduction. Subsection (b) does not apply, however, to a defendant whose offense level is level 15 or lower prior to application of subsection (a). At offense level 15 or lower, the reduction in the guideline range provided by a 2-level decrease in offense level under subsection (a) (which is a greater proportional reduction in the guideline range than at higher offense levels due to the structure of the Sentencing Table) is adequate for the court to take into account the factors set forth in subsection (b) within the applicable guideline range.&quot;.</p>
<p>Section 4B1.1 is amended in the last sentence by deleting &quot;2-levels&quot; and inserting in lieu thereof &quot;the number of levels corresponding to that adjustment&quot;.</p>
<p>Section 4B1.4(b) is amended by deleting the last sentence as follows:</p>

<p>and inserting in lieu thereof:</p>
<p>&quot;*If an adjustment from §3E1.1 (Acceptance of Responsibility) applies, decrease the offense level by the number of levels corresponding to that adjustment.&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This amendment provides an additional reduction of one level for certain defendants whose acceptance of responsibility includes assistance to the government in the investigation or prosecution of their own misconduct. In addition, it replaces the term &quot;offense and related conduct&quot; with the term &quot;offense&quot; and provides guidance as to the meaning of this term in the context of this guideline.</p>

<p><strong>460.</strong> <strong>Amendment:</strong> Section 4A1.3 is amended in the fourth paragraph by deleting &quot;a Category IV criminal history&quot; wherever it appears and inserting in lieu thereof in each instance &quot;Criminal History Category IV&quot;; and by deleting:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The Commission contemplates that there may, on occasion, be a case of an egregious, serious criminal record in which even the guideline range for a Category VI criminal history is not adequate to reflect the seriousness of the defendant’s criminal history. In such a case, a decision above the guideline range for a defendant with a Category VI criminal history may be warranted. However, this provision is not symmetrical. The lower limit of the range for a Category I criminal history is set for a first offender with the lowest risk of recidivism. Therefore, a departure below the lower limit of the guideline range for a Category I criminal history on the basis of the adequacy of criminal history cannot be appropriate.&quot;,</p>
<p>and inserting in lieu thereof:</p>
<p>&quot;The Commission contemplates that there may, on occasion, be a case of an egregious, serious criminal record in which even the guideline range for Criminal History Category VI is not adequate to reflect the seriousness of the defendant’s criminal history. In such a case, a departure above the guideline range for a defendant with Criminal History Category VI may be warranted. In determining whether an upward departure from Criminal History Category VI is warranted, the court should consider that the nature of the prior offenses rather than simply their number is often more indicative of the seriousness of the defendant’s criminal record. For example, a defendant with five prior sentences for very large-scale fraud offenses may have 15 criminal history points, within the range of points typical for Criminal History Category VI, yet have a substantially more serious criminal history overall because of the nature of the prior offenses. On the other hand, a defendant with nine prior 60-day jail sentences for offenses such as petty larceny, prostitution, or possession of gambling slips has a higher number of criminal history points (18 points) than the typical Criminal History Category VI defendant, but not necessarily a more serious criminal history overall. Where the court determines that the extent and nature of the defendant’s criminal history, taken together, are sufficient to warrant an upward departure from Criminal History Category VI, the court should structure the departure by moving incrementally down the sentencing table to the next higher offense level in Criminal History Category VI until it finds a guideline range appropriate to the case.</p>
<p>However, this provision is not symmetrical. The lower limit of the range for Criminal History Category I is set for a first offender with the lowest risk of recidivism. Therefore, a departure below the lower limit of the guideline range for Criminal History Category I on the basis of the adequacy of criminal history cannot be appropriate.&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This amendment provides additional guidance concerning upward departure from Criminal History Category VI on the basis of adequacy of criminal history category, and makes minor editorial changes.</p>

<p>&quot;‘Crime of violence’ includes murder, manslaughter, kidnapping, aggravated assault, forcible sex offenses, robbery, arson, extortion, extortionate extension of credit, and burglary of a dwelling. Other offenses are included where (A) that offense has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another, or (B) the conduct set forth (<em>i.e.</em>, expressly charged) in the count of which the defendant was convicted involved use of explosives (including any explosive material or destructive device) or, by its nature, presented a serious potential risk of physical injury to another. Under this section, the conduct of which the defendant was convicted is the focus of inquiry.</p>
<p>The term ‘crime of violence’ does not include the offense of unlawful possession of a firearm by a felon. Where the instant offense is the unlawful possession of a firearm by a felon, the specific offense characteristics of §2K2.1 (Unlawful Receipt, Possession, or Transportation of Firearms or Ammunition; Prohibited Transactions Involving Firearms or Ammunition) provide an increase in offense level if the defendant has one or more prior felony convictions for a crime of violence or controlled substance offense; and, if the defendant is sentenced under the provisions of 18 U.S.C. § 924(e), §4B1.4 (Armed Career Criminal) will apply.&quot;,</p>

<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This amendment conforms the definition of &quot;sustaining a conviction&quot; in §4B1.2 to the definition of &quot;convicted of an offense&quot; in §4A1.2. In addition, this amendment ratifies a previous amendment to the commentary to §4B1.2 (amendment 433, effective November 1, 1991) and corrects a clerical error in a reference in that commentary to §2K2.1. The previous amendment to the text of Application Note 2 clarified that application of §4B1.2 is governed by the offense of conviction, and that the offense of being a felon in possession of a firearm is not a crime of violence within the meaning of this guideline. As a clarifying and conforming change, the previous commentary amendment reflected Commission intent that the term &quot;crime of violence,&quot; as that term is used in §§4B1.1 and 4B1.2, be interpreted consistently with that term as used in other provisions of the Guidelines Manual. For example, §4B1.4, as promulgated by amendment 355, effective November 1, 1990, provides an increased offense level for a &quot;felon-in-possession&quot; defendant who is subject to an enhanced sentence under 18 U.S.C. § 924(e) and who used or possessed the firearm in connection with a crime of violence (§4B1.4(b)(3)(A)). This action to ratify a previous commentary amendment was taken because of concerns raised by <em>United States v. Stinson</em>, 957 F.2d 813 (11th Cir. 1992), in which the court stated it would not follow amendment 433 because the commentary amendment was not submitted to Congress.</p>

<p><strong>465.</strong> <strong>Amendment:</strong> Section 5G1.3 is amended by deleting subsection (b) as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;(b) If subsection (a) does not apply, and the undischarged term of imprisonment resulted from offense(s) that constituted part of the same course of conduct as the instant offense and have been fully taken into account in the determination of the offense level for the instant offense, or if the prior undischarged term of imprisonment resulted from a federal offense and was imposed pursuant to the Sentencing Reform Act, the sentence for the instant offense shall be imposed to result in a combined sentence equal to the total punishment that would have been imposed under §5G1.2 (Sentencing on Multiple Counts of Conviction) had all the sentences been imposed at the same time.&quot;,</p>
<p>and inserting in lieu thereof:</p>
<p>&quot;(b) If subsection (a) does not apply, and the undischarged term of imprisonment resulted from offense(s) that have been fully taken into account in the determination of the offense level for the instant offense, the sentence for the instant offense shall be imposed to run concurrently to the undischarged term of imprisonment.&quot;.</p>
<p>Section 5G1.3(c) is amended by inserting &quot;(Policy Statement)&quot; immediately before &quot;In&quot;; and by deleting &quot;unexpired&quot; and inserting in lieu thereof &quot;undischarged&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §5G1.3 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended by deleting Notes 2-4 as follows:</p>
<p>&quot;2. Subsection (b) (which applies only if subsection (a) does not apply), applies in two situations. First, it applies if the sentence resulting in the undischarged term of imprisonment was a federal sentence imposed pursuant to the Sentencing Reform Act. In such cases, the court shall fashion a sentence equal to the total punishment that would have been imposed had both sentences been imposed at the same time. Second, it applies if the conduct resulting in the undischarged term of imprisonment was part of the same course of conduct as the instant offense and has been fully taken into account in determining the offense level for the instant offense (<em>e.g.</em>, where a defendant is prosecuted in both federal and state court for the same criminal conduct; or where a defendant is prosecuted in federal and state court for different criminal transactions that are part of the same course of conduct, such as two drug sales, but the conduct underlying both transactions is fully taken into account under §1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct) in determining the offense level for the instant offense).</p>
<p>3. When a sentence is imposed pursuant to subsection (b), the court should adjust for any term of imprisonment already served as a result of the conduct taken into account in determining the instant sentence (<em>e.g.</em>, if the appropriate total punishment determined under this subsection for all offenses is 30 months and the defendant has already served 10 months of the prior undischarged term of imprisonment, the court should impose a sentence of 20 months concurrent with the prior undischarged term).</p>
<p>4. Where the defendant is serving an unexpired term of imprisonment in circumstances other than those set forth in subsections (a) or (b), the court shall impose a consecutive sentence to the extent necessary to fashion a sentence resulting in incremental punishment for the multiple offenses. To the extent practicable, the court shall impose a sentence for the instant offense that results in a combined sentence that approximates the total punishment that would have been imposed under §5G1.2 (Sentencing on Multiple Counts of Conviction) had all of the offenses been federal offenses for which sentences were being imposed at the same time. Where the defendant is serving a term of imprisonment for a state offense, the information available may permit only a rough estimate of the total punishment that would have been imposed under the guidelines. It is not intended that the above methodology be applied in a manner that unduly complicates or prolongs the sentencing process. In fashioning an appropriate incremental punishment, the court should consider whether the offense was committed while the defendant was on bail or other release status from another offense. In such cases, a reasonable incremental penalty appropriately would include an additional enhancement equivalent to that provided in §2J1.7 (Commission of Offense While on Release).&quot;,</p>
<p>and inserting in lieu thereof:</p>
<p>&quot;2. Subsection (b) (which may apply only if subsection (a) does not apply), addresses cases in which the conduct resulting in the undischarged term of imprisonment has been fully taken into account under §1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct) in determining the offense level for the instant offense. This can occur, for example, where a defendant is prosecuted in both federal and state court, or in two or more federal jurisdictions, for the same criminal conduct or for different criminal transactions that were part of the same course of conduct.</p>
<p>When a sentence is imposed pursuant to subsection (b), the court should adjust for any term of imprisonment already served as a result of the conduct taken into account in determining the sentence for the instant offense. <em>Example</em>: The defendant has been convicted of a federal offense charging the sale of 40 grams of cocaine. Under §1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct), the defendant is held accountable for the sale of an additional 15 grams of cocaine that is part of the same course of conduct for which the defendant has been convicted and sentenced in state court (the defendant received a nine-month sentence of imprisonment, of which he has served six months at the time of sentencing on the instant federal offense). The guideline range applicable to the defendant is 10-16 months (Chapter Two offense level of 14 for sale of 55 grams of cocaine; 2-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility; final offense level of 12; Criminal History Category I). The court determines that a sentence of 13 months provides the appropriate total punishment. Because the defendant has already served six months on the related state charge, a sentence of seven months, imposed to run concurrently with the remainder of the defendant’s state sentence, achieves this result. For clarity, the court should note on the Judgment in a Criminal Case Order that the sentence imposed is not a departure from the guidelines because the defendant has been credited for guideline purposes under §5G1.3(b) with six months served in state custody.</p>
<p>3. Where the defendant is subject to an undischarged term of imprisonment in circumstances other than those set forth in subsections (a) or (b), subsection (c) applies and the court shall impose a consecutive sentence to the extent necessary to fashion a sentence resulting in a reasonable incremental punishment for the multiple offenses. In some circumstances, such incremental punishment can be achieved by the imposition of a sentence that is concurrent with the remainder of the unexpired term of imprisonment. In such cases, a consecutive sentence is not required. To the extent practicable, the court should consider a reasonable incremental penalty to be a sentence for the instant offense that results in a combined sentence of imprisonment that approximates the total punishment that would have been imposed under §5G1.2 (Sentencing on Multiple Counts of Conviction) had all of the offenses been federal offenses for which sentences were being imposed at the same time. It is recognized that this determination frequently will require an approximation. Where the defendant is serving a term of imprisonment for a state offense, the information available may permit only a rough estimate of the total punishment that would have been imposed under the guidelines. Where the offense resulting in the undischarged term of imprisonment is a federal offense for which a guideline determination has previously been made, the task will be somewhat more straightforward, although even in such cases a precise determination may not be possible.</p>
<p>It is not intended that the above methodology be applied in a manner that unduly complicates or prolongs the sentencing process. Additionally, this methodology does not, itself, require the court to depart from the guideline range established for the instant federal offense. Rather, this methodology is meant to assist the court in determining the appropriate sentence (<em>e.g.</em>, the appropriate point within the applicable guideline range, whether to order the sentence to run concurrently or consecutively to the undischarged term of imprisonment, or whether a departure is warranted). Generally, the court may achieve an appropriate sentence through its determination of an appropriate point within the applicable guideline range for the instant federal offense, combined with its determination of whether that sentence will run concurrently or consecutively to the undischarged term of imprisonment.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Illustrations of the Application of Subsection (c)</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(A) The guideline range applicable to the instant federal offense is 24-30 months. The court determines that a total punishment of 36 months’ imprisonment would appropriately reflect the instant federal offense and the offense resulting in the undischarged term of imprisonment. The undischarged term of imprisonment is an indeterminate sentence of imprisonment with a 60-month maximum. At the time of sentencing on the instant federal offense, the defendant has served ten months on the undischarged term of imprisonment. In this case, a sentence of 26 months’ imprisonment to be served concurrently with the remainder of the undischarged term of imprisonment would (1) be within the guideline range for the instant federal offense, and (2) achieve an appropriate total punishment (36 months).</p>
<p>(B) The applicable guideline range for the instant federal offense is 24-30 months. The court determines that a total punishment of 36 months’ imprisonment would appropriately reflect the instant federal offense and the offense resulting in the undischarged term of imprisonment. The undischarged term of imprisonment is a six-month determinate sentence. At the time of sentencing on the instant federal offense, the defendant has served three months on the undischarged term of imprisonment. In this case, a sentence of 30 months’ imprisonment to be served consecutively to the undischarged term of imprisonment would (1) be within the guideline range for the instant federal offense, and (2) achieve an appropriate total punishment (36 months).</p>
<p>(C) The applicable guideline range for the instant federal offense is 24-30 months. The court determines that a total punishment of 60 months’ imprisonment would appropriately reflect the instant federal offense and the offense resulting in the undischarged term of imprisonment. The undischarged term of imprisonment is a 12-month determinate sentence. In this case, a sentence of 30 months’ imprisonment to be served consecutively to the undischarged term of imprisonment would be the greatest sentence imposable without departure for the instant federal offense.</p>
<p>(D) The applicable guideline range for the instant federal offense is 24-30 months. The court determines that a total punishment of 36 months’ imprisonment would appropriately reflect the instant federal offense and the offense resulting in the undischarged term of imprisonment. The undischarged term of imprisonment is an indeterminate sentence with a 60-month maximum. At the time of sentencing on the instant federal offense, the defendant has served 22 months on the undischarged term of imprisonment. In this case, a sentence of 24 months to be served concurrently with the remainder of the undischarged term of imprisonment would be the lowest sentence imposable without departure for the instant federal offense.&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This amendment deletes the prong of §5G1.3(b) pertaining to the sentencing of a defendant subject to an undischarged term of imprisonment previously imposed pursuant to the Sentencing Reform Act because the Commission found a number of problems in implementation. Cases previously addressed by this prong henceforth will be addressed by subsection (c), which is designed to produce a similar result but requires less precise calculations. Consistent with the structure of the Guidelines Manual, subsection (c) is expressly designated a policy statement. In addition, this amendment provides additional commentary explaining, and providing examples of, the operation of this section.</p>

<p>Section 6B1.2(a) is amended by inserting the following additional paragraph at the end:</p>
<p>&quot;<em>Provided</em>, that a plea agreement that includes the dismissal of a charge or a plea agreement not to pursue a potential charge shall not preclude the conduct underlying such charge from being considered under the provisions of §1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct) in connection with the count(s) of which the defendant is convicted.&quot;.</p>

<p>&quot;will accept a recommended sentence or a plea agreement requiring imposition of a specific sentence only if the court is satisfied either that the contemplated sentence is within the guidelines or, if not, that the recommended sentence or agreement&quot;,</p>
<p>and inserting in lieu thereof:</p>
<p>&quot;should accept a recommended sentence or a plea agreement requiring imposition of a specific sentence only if the court is satisfied either that such sentence is an appropriate sentence within the applicable guideline range or, if not, that the sentence&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §6B1.2 is amended by inserting the following additional paragraphs at the end:</p>
<p>&quot; A defendant who enters a plea of guilty in a timely manner will enhance the likelihood of his receiving a reduction in offense level under §3E1.1 (Acceptance of Responsibility). Further reduction in offense level (or sentence) due to a plea agreement will tend to undermine the sentencing guidelines.</p>
<p>The second paragraph of subsection (a) provides that a plea agreement that includes the dismissal of a charge, or a plea agreement not to pursue a potential charge, shall not prevent the conduct underlying that charge from being considered under the provisions of §1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct) in connection with the count(s) of which the defendant is convicted. This paragraph prevents a plea agreement from restricting consideration of conduct that is within the scope of §1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct) in respect to the count(s) of which the defendant is convicted; it does not in any way expand or modify the scope of §1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct).&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This amendment clarifies that a plea agreement to dismiss a charge or not to pursue a potential charge does not insulate the conduct underlying such charge from the operation of §1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct) in respect to the count(s) of which the defendant is convicted. In addition, this amendment makes clearer the Commission’s policy that plea agreements should not undermine the sentencing guidelines.</p>

<p><strong>470.</strong> <strong>Amendment:</strong> The Commentary to §2F1.1 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended in Note 7 in the first paragraph by inserting the following additional sentence as the second sentence:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;As in theft cases, loss is the value of the money, property, or services unlawfully taken; it does not, for example, include interest the victim could have earned on such funds had the offense not occurred.&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §2F1.1 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended in Note 7(b) by deleting:</p>
<p>&quot;In fraudulent loan application cases and contract procurement cases where the defendant’s capabilities are fraudulently represented, the loss is the actual loss to the victim (or if the loss has not yet come about, the expected loss). For example, if a defendant fraudulently obtains a loan by misrepresenting the value of his assets, the loss is the amount of the loan not repaid at the time the offense is discovered, reduced by the amount the lending institution has recovered, or can expect to recover, from any assets pledged to secure the loan.&quot;,</p>
<p>and inserting in lieu thereof:</p>
<p>&quot;In fraudulent loan application cases and contract procurement cases, the loss is the actual loss to the victim (or if the loss has not yet come about, the expected loss). For example, if a defendant fraudulently obtains a loan by misrepresenting the value of his assets, the loss is the amount of the loan not repaid at the time the offense is discovered, reduced by the amount the lending institution has recovered (or can expect to recover) from any assets pledged to secure the loan. However, where the intended loss is greater than the actual loss, the intended loss is to be used.&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This amendment clarifies that interest is not included in the determination of loss. In, addition, it clarifies that in fraudulent loan application cases, as in other types of fraud, if the intended loss is greater than the actual loss, the intended loss is used. Finally, it makes an editorial improvement in this commentary by deleting an unnecessary phrase.</p>

<p><strong>471.</strong> <strong>Amendment:</strong> The Commentary to §2K1.3 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended by inserting the following additional note:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;11. As used in subsections (b)(3) and (c)(1), ‘another felony offense’ and ‘another offense’ refer to offenses other than explosives or firearms possession or trafficking offenses. However, where the defendant used or possessed a firearm or explosive to facilitate another firearms or explosives offense (<em>e.g.</em>, the defendant used or possessed a firearm to protect the delivery of an unlawful shipment of explosives), an upward departure under §5K2.6 (Weapons and Dangerous Instrumentalities) may be warranted.&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §2K2.1 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended in Note 15 by deleting &quot;or (a)(5)&quot; and inserting in lieu thereof &quot;(a)(4)(B), or (a)(6)&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §2K2.1 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended by inserting the following additional note:</p>
<p>&quot;18. As used in subsections (b)(5) and (c)(1), ‘another felony offense’ and ‘another offense’ refer to offenses other than explosives or firearms possession or trafficking offenses. However, where the defendant used or possessed a firearm or explosive to facilitate another firearms or explosives offense (<em>e.g.</em>, the defendant used or possessed a firearm to protect the delivery of an unlawful shipment of explosives), an upward departure under §5K2.6 (Weapons and Dangerous Instrumentalities) may be warranted.&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This amendment clarifies the meaning of the terms &quot;another felony offense’ and &quot;another offense,&quot; and corrects a clerical error.</p>

<p><strong>472.</strong> <strong>Amendment:</strong> The Commentary to §4A1.2 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended in Note 8 by deleting the last sentence as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;If the government is able to show that a sentence imposed outside this time period is evidence of similar misconduct or the defendant’s receipt of a substantial portion of income from criminal livelihood, the court may consider this information in determining whether to depart and sentence above the applicable guideline range.&quot;,</p>
<p>and by inserting in lieu thereof:</p>
<p>&quot;If the court finds that a sentence imposed outside this time period is evidence of similar, or serious dissimilar, criminal conduct, the court may consider this information in determining whether an upward departure is warranted under §4A1.3 (Adequacy of Criminal History Category).&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This amendment clarifies that dissimilar, serious prior offenses outside the applicable time period may be considered in determining whether an upward departure is warranted under §4A1.3. The amendment provides additional Commission guidance on an issue that has produced conflicting decisions among the courts of appeals. <em>Compare</em>, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>United States</em> <em>v. Leake</em>, 908 F.2d 550, 554 (9th Cir. 1990) (upward departure impermissible for remote prior convictions dissimilar to instant offense) <em>and</em> <em>United States v. Samuels</em>, 938 F.2d 210, 215 (D.C. Cir. 1991) (suggesting the same) <em>with</em> <em>United States v. Williams</em>, 910 F.2d 1574, 1579 (7th Cir. 1990) (although older prior crimes dissimilar to instant offense, upward departure permissible if convictions are reliable information of increased recidivism risk), <em>rev’d</em> <em>on</em> <em>other</em> <em>grounds</em>, 112 S. Ct. 1112 (1992) <em>and</em> <em>United States v. Russell</em>, 905 F.2d 1439, 1444 (10th Cir. 1990) (same).</p>

<p><strong>473.</strong> <strong>Amendment:</strong> The Commentary to §7B1.1 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended by deleting Notes 2 and 3 as follows:</p>

<p>(i) has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another; or</p>
<p>(ii) is burglary of a dwelling, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.</p>
