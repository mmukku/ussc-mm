<p>&quot;(1) If the offense involved an express or implied threat of death, bodily injury, or kidnapping, increase by 2 levels.</p>
<p>(2) If the greater of the amount demanded or the loss to the victim exceeded $10,000, increase by the corresponding number of levels from the table in §2B3.1(b)(6).</p>

<p>Section 2B3.2 is amended by inserting the following additional subsection:</p>
<p>&quot;(c) Cross Reference</p>
<p>(1) If the offense was tantamount to attempted murder, apply §2A2.1 (Assault With Intent to Commit Murder; Attempted Murder) if the resulting offense level is greater than that determined above.&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §2B3.2 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended in Note 1 by inserting &quot;‘bodily injury,’ ‘serious bodily injury,’ ‘permanent or life-threatening bodily injury,’&quot; immediately before &quot;abducted&quot;; and in Note 4 by deleting &quot;9&quot; and inserting in lieu thereof &quot;11&quot;.</p>

<p>&quot;5. Valuation of loss is discussed in the Commentary to §2B1.1 (Larceny, Embezzlement, and Other Forms of Theft).&quot;,</p>
<p>and inserting in lieu thereof:</p>
<p>&quot;5. ‘Loss to the victim,’ as used in subsection (b)(2), means any demand paid plus any additional consequential loss from the offense (<em>e.g.</em>, the cost of defensive measures taken in direct response to the offense).</p>
<p>6. In certain cases, an extortionate demand may be accompanied by conduct that does not qualify as a display of a dangerous weapon under subsection (b)(3)(A)(v) but is nonetheless similar in seriousness, demonstrating the defendant’s preparation or ability to carry out the threatened harm (<em>e.g.</em>, an extortionate demand containing a threat to tamper with a consumer product accompanied by a workable plan showing how the product’s tamper-resistant seals could be defeated, or a threat to kidnap a person accompanied by information showing study of that person’s daily routine). Subsection (b)(3)(B) addresses such cases.</p>
<p>7. If the offense involved the threat of death or serious bodily injury to numerous victims (<em>e.g.</em>, in the case of a plan to derail a passenger train or poison consumer products), an upward departure may be warranted.</p>
<p>8. If the offense involved organized criminal activity, or a threat to a family member of the victim, an upward departure may be warranted.&quot;.</p>

<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This amendment provides a specific offense characteristic to distinguish the greater seriousness of offenses that involve an express or implied threat of death, bodily injury, or kidnapping; conforms the loss table to that used in the robbery guideline to reflect that the typical case under the amended guideline will have an offense level that is more closely comparable to robbery; increases the offense levels for offenses involving use or possession of a firearm to conform to an amendment being made to the robbery guideline; adds a subdivision to the specific offense characteristic dealing with use or possession of a dangerous weapon to address cases in which the conduct is tantamount in seriousness to the brandishing, display, or possession of a dangerous weapon, but does not qualify under the current specific offense characteristic for weapon enhancement; modifies subsection (b)(1) to provide that the greater of the amount demanded or the loss to the victim is used; adds a cross reference to §2A2.1 to address cases in which the conduct was tantamount to attempted murder; and sets forth commentary describing certain aggravating factors that may warrant an upward departure.</p>

<p>Section 2C1.1(b)(2)(B) is amended by deleting &quot;bribe&quot; and inserting in lieu thereof &quot;payment&quot;.</p>
<p>Section 2C1.1(c) is amended by deleting:</p>
<p>&quot;(1) If the bribe was for the purpose of concealing or facilitating another criminal offense, or for obstructing justice in respect to another criminal offense, apply §2X3.1 (Accessory After the Fact) in respect to such other criminal offense if the resulting offense level is greater than that determined above.&quot;;</p>
<p>by renumbering subsection (c)(2) as (c)(3); and by inserting the following as subsections (c)(1) and (2):</p>
<p>&quot;(1) If the offense was committed for the purpose of facilitating the commission of another criminal offense, apply the offense guideline applicable to a conspiracy to commit that other offense if the resulting offense level is greater than that determined above.</p>
<p>(2) If the offense was committed for the purpose of concealing, or obstructing justice in respect to, another criminal offense, apply §2X3.1 (Accessory After the Fact) or §2J1.2 (Obstruction of Justice), as appropriate, in respect to that other offense if the resulting offense level is greater than that determined above.&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §2C1.1 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended by deleting Note 2 as follows:</p>
<p>&quot;2. ‘Value of the bribe or the benefit received, or to be received, in return for the bribe’ means the greater of the value of the bribe or the value of the benefit received, or to be received, in return for the bribe. The ‘value of the benefit received or to be received’ means the net value of such benefit. For example, if a $150,000 contract on which $20,000 profit was made was awarded in return for a bribe, the value of the benefit received in return is $20,000.&quot;,</p>
<p>and inserting in lieu thereof:</p>
<p>&quot;2. ‘Loss’ is discussed in the Commentary to §2B1.1 (Larceny, Embezzlement, and Other Forms of Theft) and includes both actual and intended loss. The value of ‘the benefit received or to be received’ means the net value of such benefit. <em>Examples</em>: (1) A government employee, in return for a $500 bribe, reduces the price of a piece of surplus property offered for sale by the government from $10,000 to $2,000; the value of the benefit received is $8,000. (2) A $150,000 contract on which $20,000 profit was made was awarded in return for a bribe; the value of the benefit received is $20,000. Do not deduct the value of the bribe itself in computing the value of the benefit received or to be received. In the above examples, therefore, the value of the benefit received would be the same regardless of the value of the bribe.&quot;;</p>
<p>The Commentary to §2C1.1 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended in Note 3 by deleting &quot;§2C1.1(c)(1) or (2).&quot; and inserting in lieu thereof &quot;§2C1.1(c)(1), (2), or (3). In such cases, an adjustment from §3B1.3 (Abuse of Position of Trust or Use of Special Skill) may apply.&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §2C1.1 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended in Note 4 by deleting &quot;bribe&quot; and inserting in lieu thereof &quot;unlawful payment&quot;; and by deleting &quot;and (2)&quot; and inserting in lieu thereof &quot;, (2), and (3)&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §2C1.1 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended in Note 6 by inserting the following as the first sentence:</p>
<p>&quot;Subsection (b)(1) provides an adjustment for offenses involving more than one incident of either bribery or extortion.&quot;;</p>
<p>by deleting &quot;bribe&quot; the first time it occurs and inserting in lieu thereof &quot;incident of bribery or extortion&quot;; and by inserting &quot;or extortion&quot; immediately before &quot;, even if charged&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §2C1.1 captioned &quot;Background&quot; is amended by deleting the third paragraph as follows:</p>
<p>&quot; The amount of the bribe is used as a factor in the guideline not because it directly measures harm to society, but because it is improbable that a large bribe would be given for a favor of little consequence. Moreover, for deterrence purposes, the punishment should be commensurate with the gain.&quot;,</p>
<p>and inserting in lieu thereof:</p>
<p>&quot; In determining the net value of the benefit received or to be received, the value of the bribe is not deducted from the gross value of such benefit; the harm is the same regardless of value of the bribe paid to receive the benefit. Where the value of the bribe exceeds the value of the benefit or the value of the benefit cannot be determined, the value of the bribe is used because it is likely that the payer of such a bribe expected something in return that would be worth more than the value of the bribe. Moreover, for deterrence purposes, the punishment should be commensurate with the gain to the payer or the recipient of the bribe, whichever is higher.&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §2C1.1 captioned &quot;Background&quot; is amended in the fourth paragraph by deleting &quot;bribe is&quot; and inserting in lieu thereof &quot;payment was&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §2C1.1 captioned &quot;Background&quot; is amended by deleting the fifth, sixth, and seventh paragraphs as follows:</p>
<p>&quot;Under §2C1.1(c)(1), if the purpose of the bribe involved the facilitation of another criminal offense or the obstruction of justice in respect to another criminal offense, the guideline for §2X3.1 (Accessory After the Fact) in respect to that criminal offense will be applied, if the result is greater than that determined above. For example, if a bribe was given for the purpose of facilitating or covering up the offense of espionage, the guideline for accessory after the fact to espionage would be applied.</p>
<p>Under §2C1.1(c)(2), if the offense involved forcible extortion, the guideline from §2B3.2 (Extortion by Force or Threat of Injury or Serious Damage) will apply if the result is greater than that determined above.</p>
<p>Note that, when applying 2C1.1(c)(1) or (2), an adjustment from Chapter Three, Part B (Role in the Offense) will also apply. This normally will result in an increase of at least 2 levels.&quot;,</p>
<p>and inserting in lieu thereof:</p>
<p>&quot; Under §2C1.1(c)(1), if the payment was to facilitate the commission of another criminal offense, the guideline applicable to a conspiracy to commit that other offense will apply if the result is greater than that determined above. For example, if a bribe was given to a law enforcement officer to allow the smuggling of a quantity of cocaine, the guideline for conspiracy to import cocaine would be applied if it resulted in a greater offense level.</p>
<p>Under §2C1.1(c)(2), if the payment was to conceal another criminal offense or obstruct justice in respect to another criminal offense, the guideline from §2X3.1 (Accessory After the Fact) or §2J1.2 (Obstruction of Justice), as appropriate, will apply if the result is greater than that determined above. For example, if a bribe was given for the purpose of concealing the offense of espionage, the guideline for accessory after the fact to espionage would be applied.</p>
<p>Under §2C1.1(c)(3), if the offense involved forcible extortion, the guideline from §2B3.2 (Extortion by Force or Threat of Injury or Serious Damage) will apply if the result is greater than that determined above.</p>
<p>When the offense level is determined under §2C1.1(c)(1), (2), or (3), an adjustment from §3B1.3 (Abuse of Position of Trust or Use of Special Skill) may apply.&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This amendment adds an additional factor in subsection (b)(2)(A) to take into account loss to the government from the offense; expands subsection (c) to distinguish an offense committed for the purpose of facilitating the commission of another offense from an offense committed to cover up or obstruct justice in respect to another offense; clarifies the term &quot;value of the benefit received&quot;; and substitutes &quot;payment&quot; for &quot;bribe&quot; and adds &quot;or extortion&quot; where necessary to reflect that this guideline covers both bribery and extortion under color of official right.</p>

<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This amendment adds offenses involving anabolic steroids to §2D1.1 to reflect that Title XIX of the Crime Control Act of 1990 (Public Law 101-647) reclassified anabolic steroids as Schedule III controlled substances under 21 U.S.C. § 812(c). Because of the variety of substances involved, the Commission has determined that a measure based on quantity unit, rather than weight, provides the most appropriate measure of the scale of the offense.</p>

<p><em>Application Notes</em>:</p>
<p>1. The definition of ‘firearm’ used in this section is that set forth in 18 U.S.C. § 921(a)(3) (if the defendant is convicted under 18 U.S.C. § 922) and 26 U.S.C. § 5845(a) (if the defendant is convicted under 26 U.S.C. § 5861). These definitions are somewhat broader than that used in Application Note 1(e) of the Commentary to §1B1.1 (Application Instructions). Under 18 U.S.C. § 921(a)(3), the term ‘firearm’ means (A) any weapon (including a starter gun) which will or is designed to or may readily be converted to expel a projectile by the action of an explosive; (B) the frame or receiver of any such weapon; (C) any firearm muffler or firearm silencer; or (D) any destructive device. Under 26 U.S.C. § 5845(a), the term ‘firearm’ includes a shotgun, or a weapon made from a shotgun, with a barrel or barrels of less than 18 inches in length; a weapon made from a shotgun or rifle with an overall length of less than 26 inches; a rifle, or weapon made from a rifle, with a barrel or barrels less than 16 inches in length; a machine gun; a muffler or silencer for a firearm; a destructive device; and certain other large bore weapons.</p>
<p>2. Under §2K2.1(b)(1), intended lawful use, as determined by the surrounding circumstances, provides a decrease in the offense level. Relevant circumstances include, among others, the number and type of firearms (sawed-off shotguns, for example, have few legitimate uses) and ammunition, the location and circumstances of possession, the nature of the defendant’s criminal history (<em>e.g.</em>, whether involving firearms), and the extent to which possession was restricted by local law.</p>
<p><em>Background</em>: Under pre-guidelines practice, there was substantial sentencing variation for these crimes. From the Commission’s investigations, it appeared that the variation was attributable primarily to the wide variety of circumstances under which these offenses occur. Apart from the nature of the defendant’s criminal history, his actual or intended use of the firearm was probably the most important factor in determining the sentence.</p>
<p>Statistics showed that pre-guidelines sentences averaged two to three months lower if the firearm involved was a rifle or an unaltered shotgun. This may reflect the fact that these weapons tend to be more suitable than others for recreational activities. However, some rifles or shotguns may be possessed for criminal purposes, while some handguns may be suitable primarily for recreation. Therefore, the guideline is not based upon the type of firearm. Intended lawful use, as determined by the surrounding circumstances, is a mitigating factor.</p>
<p>Available pre-guidelines data were not sufficient to determine the effect a stolen firearm had on the average sentence. However, reviews of pre-guidelines cases suggested that this factor tended to result in more severe sentences. Independent studies show that stolen firearms are used dispropor­tionately in the commission of crimes.</p>
<p>The firearm statutes often are used as a device to enable the federal court to exercise jurisdiction over offenses that otherwise could be prosecuted only under state law. For example, a convicted felon may be prosecuted for possessing a firearm if he used the firearm to rob a gasoline station. In pre-guidelines practice, such prosecutions resulted in high sentences because of the true nature of the underlying conduct. The cross reference at §2K2.1(c)(2) deals with such cases.</p>
<p>§2K2.2. <em>Unlawful Trafficking and Other Prohibited Transactions Involving Firearms</em></p>
<p>(a) Base Offense Level:</p>
<p>(1) 18, if the defendant is convicted under 18 U.S.C. § 922(o) or 26 U.S.C. § 5861;</p>
<p>(2) 6, otherwise.</p>
<p>(b) Specific Offense Characteristics</p>
<p>(1) If the offense involved distribution of a firearm, or possession with intent to distribute, and the number of firearms unlawfully distributed, or to be distributed, exceeded two, increase as follows:</p>
<p><em>Number of Firearms</em> <em>Increase in Level</em></p>
<p>(A) 3 ‑ 4 add 1</p>
<p>(B) 5 ‑ 7 add 2</p>
<p>(C) 8 ‑ 12 add 3</p>
<p>(D) 13 ‑ 24 add 4</p>
<p>(E) 25 - 49 add 5</p>
<p>(F) 50 or more add 6.</p>
<p>(2) If any of the firearms was stolen or had an altered or obliterated serial number, increase by 2 levels.</p>
<p>(3) If more than one of the following applies, use the greater:</p>
<p>(A) If the defendant is convicted under 18 U.S.C. § 922(d), increase by 6 levels; or</p>
<p>(B) If the defendant is convicted under 18 U.S.C. § 922(b)(1) or (b)(2), increase by 1 level.</p>
<p>(c) Cross Reference</p>
<p>(1) If the defendant, at the time of the offense, had been convicted in any court of a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, apply §2K2.1 (Unlawful Receipt, Possession, or Transportation of Firearms or Ammunition) if the resulting offense level is greater than that determined above.</p>

<p>&quot;4. The adjustment under §2L1.2(b)(1) is in addition to any criminal history points added for such conviction in Chapter 4, Part A (Criminal History).&quot;,</p>
<p>and inserting in lieu thereof:</p>
<p>&quot;4. A 16-level increase is provided under subsection (b)(2) in the case of a defendant who was previously deported after a conviction for an aggravated felony.</p>
<p>5. An adjustment under subsection (b)(1) or (b)(2) for a prior felony conviction applies in addition to any criminal history points added for such conviction in Chapter Four, Part A (Criminal History).</p>
<p>6. ‘Deported after a conviction,’ as used in subsections (b)(1) and (b)(2), means that the deportation was subsequent to the conviction, whether or not the deportation was in response to such conviction.</p>
<p>7. ‘Aggravated felony,’ as used in subsection (b)(2), means murder; any illicit trafficking in any controlled substance (as defined in 21 U.S.C. § 802), including any drug trafficking crime as defined in 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(2); any illicit trafficking in any firearms or destructive devices as defined in 18 U.S.C. § 921; any offense described in 18 U.S.C. § 1956 (relating to laundering of monetary instruments); any crime of violence (as defined in 18 U.S.C. § 16, not including a purely political offense) for which the term of imprisonment imposed (regardless of any suspension of such imprisonment) is at least five years; or any attempt or conspiracy to commit any such act. The term ‘aggravated felony’ applies to offenses described in the previous sentence whether in violation of federal or state law and also applies to offenses described in the previous sentence in violation of foreign law for which the term of imprisonment was completed within the previous 15 years. <em>See</em> 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43).&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This amendment adds a specific offense characteristic providing an increase of 16 levels above the base offense level under §2L1.2 for defendants who reenter the United States after having been deported subsequent to a conviction for an aggravated felony. Previously, such cases were addressed by a recommendation for consideration of an upward departure. This amendment also modifies §2L1.1 to provide a base offense level of 20 for a defendant who is convicted under 8 U.S.C. § 1327 for an offense involving the smuggling, transporting, or harboring of an alien who was deported after a conviction for an aggravated felony. The Commission has determined that these increased offense levels are appropriate to reflect the serious nature of these offenses.

<p><strong>376.</strong> <strong>Amendment:</strong> Section 2N1.1 is amended in the title by deleting &quot;Serious&quot; and inserting in lieu thereof &quot;Bodily&quot;.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Section 2N1.1 is amended by deleting:</p>
<p>&quot;(b) Cross Reference</p>
<p>(1) If the offense involved extortion, apply §2B3.2 (Extortion by Force or Threat of Injury or Serious Damage) if the resulting offense level is greater than that determined above.&quot;,</p>
<p>and inserting in lieu thereof:</p>
<p>&quot;(b) Specific Offense Characteristic</p>
<p>(1) (A) If any victim sustained permanent or life-threatening bodily injury, increase by 4 levels; (B) if any victim sustained serious bodily injury, increase by 2 levels; or (C) if the degree of injury is between that specified in subdivisions (A) and (B), increase by 3 levels.</p>
<p>(c) Cross References</p>
<p>(1) If the offense resulted in death, apply §2A1.1 (First Degree Murder) if the death was caused intentionally or knowingly, or §2A1.2 (Second Degree Murder) in any other case.</p>
<p>(2) If the offense was tantamount to attempted murder, apply §2A2.1 (Assault With Intent to Commit Murder; Attempted Murder) if the resulting offense level is greater than that determined above.</p>
<p>(3) If the offense involved extortion, apply §2B3.2 (Extortion by Force or Threat of Injury or Serious Damage) if the resulting offense level is greater than that determined above.</p>
<p>(d) Special Instruction</p>
<p>(1) If the defendant is convicted of a single count involving (A) the death or permanent, life-threatening, or serious bodily injury of more than one victim, or (B) conduct tantamount to the attempted murder of more than one victim, Chapter Three, Part D (Multiple Counts) shall be applied as if the defendant had been convicted of a separate count for each such victim.&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §2N1.1 captioned &quot;Application Note&quot; is amended by deleting:</p>
<p>&quot;1. If death, bodily injury, extreme psychological injury, or substantial property damage or monetary loss resulted, an upward departure may be warranted. <em>See</em> Chapter Five, Part K (Departures).&quot;,</p>
<p>and inserting in lieu thereof:</p>
<p>&quot;1. The base offense level reflects that this offense typically poses a risk of death or serious bodily injury to one or more victims; or causes, or is intended to cause, bodily injury. Where the offense posed a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury to numerous victims, or caused extreme psychological injury or substantial property damage or monetary loss, an upward departure may be warranted. In the unusual case in which the offense did not cause a risk of death or serious bodily injury, and neither caused nor was intended to cause bodily injury, a downward departure may be warranted.</p>
<p>2. The special instruction in subsection (d)(1) applies whether the offense level is determined under subsection (b)(1) or by use of a cross reference in subsection (c).&quot;;</p>

<p>The Commentary to §2N1.1 captioned &quot;Background&quot; is deleted in its entirety as follows:</p>
<p>&quot;<em>Background</em>: The base offense level reflects the risk of death or serious injury posed to significant numbers of people by this type of product tampering.&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This amendment adds a specific offense characteristic for permanent, life-threatening, or serious bodily injury, and adds cross references for cases in which the offense resulted in death or was tantamount to attempted murder. In addition, a special instruction is added to address certain conduct involving multiple victims. Finally, the title of this guideline is revised to reflect more accurately the coverage of the guideline, and the background commentary is revised to clarify the &quot;heartland&quot; conduct to which the guideline applies.</p>

<p>Section 2R1.1 is amended by deleting:</p>
<p>&quot;(c) Fines</p>
<p>A fine shall be imposed in addition to any term of impris­onment. The guideline fine range for an indi­vidual conspirator is from 4 to 10 percent of the volume of commerce, but not less than $20,000. The fine range for an organiza­tion is from 20 to 50 percent of the volume of commerce, but not less than $100,000.&quot;,</p>
<p>and inserting in lieu thereof:</p>
<p>&quot;(c) Special Instruction for Fines</p>
<p>(1) For an individual, the guideline fine range shall be from one to five percent of the volume of commerce, but not less than $20,000.&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §2R1.1 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended by deleting:</p>
<p>&quot;1. Because the guideline sentences depend on the volume of commerce done by each firm, role in the offense is implicitly taken into account. Accordingly, the provisions of §3B1.1 (Aggravating Role) are to be applied only in unusual circumstances. An increase for role under §3B1.1 might be appropriate only where a defendant actually coerced others into participating in a conspiracy -- an unusual circumstance. Conversely, a decrease for role under §3B1.2 (Mitigating Role) would not be appropriate merely because an individual defendant or his firm did not profit substantially from the violation. An individual defendant should be considered for a downward adjustment for a mitigating role in the offense only if he was responsible in some minor way for his firm’s participation in the conspiracy. A complementary bidder who did not win a bid would not for that reason qualify for a downward adjustment, but a low-level employee who participated in only one of several agreements constituting a conspiracy would.&quot;,</p>
<p>and inserting in lieu thereof:</p>
<p>&quot;1. The provisions of §3B1.1 (Aggravating Role) and §3B1.2 (Mitigating Role) should be applied to an individual defendant as appropriate to reflect the individual’s role in committing the offense. For example, if a sales manager organizes or leads the price-fixing activity of five or more participants, a 4-level increase is called for under §3B1.1. An individual defendant should be considered for a downward adjustment under §3B1.2 for a mitigating role in the offense only if he was responsible in some minor way for his firm’s participation in the conspiracy.&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §2R1.1 captioned &quot;Background&quot; is amended in the third paragraph by deleting &quot;four&quot; and inserting in lieu thereof &quot;six&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §2R1.1 captioned &quot;Background&quot; is amended by deleting the fourth paragraph as follows:</p>
<p>&quot; The guideline impris­onment terms represent a substantial change from pre-guidelines practice. Under pre-guidelines practice, approximately 39 percent of all individuals convicted of antitrust violations were imprisoned. Considering all defendants sentenced, the average time served under pre-guidelines practice was only forty-five days. The guideline prison terms are, however, consistent with the parole guidelines. The fines specified in the guideline represent substantial increases over pre-guidelines practice. Under pre-guidelines practice, the average fine for individuals was only approxi­mately $27,000; for corporations, it was approximately $160,000.&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This amendment increases the offense levels for antitrust violations to make them more comparable to the offense levels for fraud with similar amounts of loss. The base offense level for antitrust violations starts higher than the base offense level for fraud violations to reflect the serious nature of and the difficulty of detecting such violations, but the offense levels for antitrust offenses based on volume of commerce increase less rapidly than the offense levels for fraud, in part, because, on the average, the level of mark-up from an antitrust violation may tend to decline with the volume of commerce involved. This amendment also reduces the minimum guideline fine level based on the volume of commerce to reflect a marginal shift from fines to imprisonment as the more effective means to deter antitrust offenses. The provision addressing fines for organizational defendants in the current guideline is deleted. Such fines are addressed by the provisions pertaining to the sentencing of organizational defendants that are added by a separate amendment (amendment 422).</p>

<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This amendment revises this guideline to reflect the enactment of subsection (a)(3) of 18 U.S.C. § 1956 that authorizes undercover &quot;sting&quot; operations in money laundering cases. Such cases differ from those prosecuted under subsection (a)(1) in that the money being laundered is not actually criminal proceeds, but is government &quot;sting&quot; money that an undercover officer represents to be criminal proceeds. In all other respects, subsections (a)(1) and (a)(3) are the same.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;(B) made false statements to conceal or disguise the evasion of reporting requirements; or</p>
<p>(C) reasonably should have believed that the funds were criminally derived property;&quot;,</p>
<p>and inserting in lieu thereof:</p>

<p>Section 2S1.3(b)(1) is amended by deleting &quot;5 levels.&quot; and inserting in lieu thereof &quot;4 levels. If the resulting offense level is less than level 13, increase to level 13.&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §2S1.3 captioned &quot;Statutory Provisions&quot; is amended by deleting &quot;18 U.S.C. § 1005;&quot;; and by deleting &quot;5316,&quot; immediately before &quot;5322&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §2S1.3 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended by deleting:</p>
<p>&quot;2. Subsection (a)(1)(C) applies where a reasonable person would have believed from the circumstances that the funds were criminally derived property. Subsection (b)(1) applies if the defendant knew or believed the funds were criminally derived property. Subsection (b)(1) applies in addition to, and not in lieu of, subsection (a)(1)(C). Where subsection (b)(1) applies, subsection (a)(1)(C) also will apply. It is possible that a defendant ‘believed’ or ‘reasonably should have believed’ that the funds were criminally derived property even if, in fact, the funds were not so derived (e.g., in a ‘sting’ operation where the defendant is told the funds were derived from the unlawful sale of controlled substances).&quot;;</p>
<p>and in the caption by deleting &quot;Notes&quot; and inserting in lieu thereof &quot;Note&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §2S1.3 captioned &quot;Background&quot; is amended by deleting the second and third paragraphs as follows:</p>
<p>&quot; A base offense level of 13 is provided for those offenses where the defendant either structured the transaction to evade reporting requirements, made false statements to conceal or disguise the activity, or reasonably should have believed that the funds were criminally derived property. A lower alternative base offense level of 5 is provided in all other cases. The Commission anticipates that such cases will involve simple recordkeeping or other more minor technical violations of the regulatory scheme governing certain monetary transactions committed by defendants who reasonably believe that the funds at issue emanated from legitimate sources.</p>
<p>Where the defendant actually knew or believed that the funds were criminally derived property, subsection (b)(1) provides for a 5 level increase in the offense level.&quot;,</p>
<p>and inserting in lieu thereof:</p>
<p>&quot; A base offense level of 13 is provided for those offenses where the defendant either structured the transaction to evade reporting requirements or knowingly filed, or caused another to file, a report containing materially false statements. A lower alternative base offense level of 5 is provided in all other cases.</p>
<p>Where the defendant actually knew or believed that the funds were criminally derived property, subsection (b)(1) provides for the greater of a 4-level increase or an increase to level 13.&quot;.</p>
<p>Chapter Two, Part S is amended by inserting an additional guideline with accompanying commentary as §2S1.4 (Failure to File Currency and Monetary Instrument Report).</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This amendment clarifies the scope of the specific offense characteristics in §2S1.3 and modifies subsection (b)(1) so that it does not produce a result that exceeds the comparable offense level under §2S1.2. In addition, this amendment creates an additional offense guideline (§2S1.4) for offenses involving Currency and Monetary Instrument Reports (CMIR). Currently, such offenses are covered by §2S1.3, which deals with all currency transaction reporting requirements. CMIR violations are committed by individuals who, when entering or leaving the country, knowingly conceal $10,000 or more in cash or bearer instruments on their persons or in their personal effects and knowingly fail to file the report required by the U.S. Customs Service. Such criminal conduct is sufficiently different from the other offenses covered by §2S1.3 to merit treatment in a separate guideline.</p>

<p><strong>381.</strong> <strong>Amendment:</strong> The Commentary to §4A1.1 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended by inserting the following additional sentence as the second sentence of Note 4 and the third sentence of Note 5:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Failure to report for service of a sentence of imprisonment is to be treated as an escape from such sentence. <em>See</em> §4A1.2(n).&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §4A1.1 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended in the third (formerly second) sentence of Note 4 by inserting the following immediately before the period at the end of the sentence:</p>
<p>&quot;having a custodial or supervisory component, although active supervision is not required for this item to apply. For example, a term of unsupervised probation would be included; but a sentence to pay a fine, by itself, would not be included. A defendant who commits the instant offense while a violation warrant from a prior sentence is outstanding (<em>e.g.</em>, a probation, parole, or supervised release violation warrant) shall be deemed to be under a criminal justice sentence for the purposes of this provision if that sentence is otherwise countable, even if that sentence would have expired absent such warrant. <em>See</em> §4A1.2(m)&quot;.</p>
<p>Section 4A1.2(a) is amended by inserting the following additional subdivision:</p>
<p>&quot;(4) Where a defendant has been convicted of an offense, but not yet sentenced, such conviction shall be counted as if it constituted a prior sentence under §4A1.1(c) if a sentence resulting from that conviction otherwise would be countable. In the case of a conviction for an offense set forth in §4A1.2(c)(1), apply this provision only where the sentence for such offense would be countable regardless of type or length.</p>
<p>‘Convicted of an offense,’ for the purposes of this provision, means that the guilt of the defendant has been established, whether by guilty plea, trial, or plea of <em>nolo</em> <em>contendere</em>.&quot;.</p>
<p>Section 4A1.2(k)(2) is amended by deleting the last sentence as follows:</p>
<p>&quot;It may also affect the time period under which certain sentences are counted as provided in §4A1.2(e)(1).&quot;;</p>
<p>by inserting &quot;(A)&quot; immediately after &quot;(2)&quot;; and by inserting the following additional subdivision:</p>
<p>&quot;(B) Revocation of probation, parole, supervised release, special parole, or mandatory release may affect the time period under which certain sentences are counted as provided in §4A1.2(d)(2) and (e). For the purposes of determining the applicable time period, use the following: (i) in the case of an adult term of imprisonment totaling more than one year and one month, the date of last release from incarceration on such sentence (<em>see</em> §4A1.2(e)(1)); (ii) in the case of any other confinement sentence for an offense committed prior to the defendant’s eighteenth birthday, the date of the defendant’s last release from confinement on such sentence (<em>see</em> §4A1.2(d)(2)(A)); and (iii) in any other case, the date of the original sentence (<em>see</em> §4A1.2(d)(2)(B) and (e)(2)).&quot;.</p>
<p>Section 4A1.2 is amended by inserting the following additional subsections:</p>
<p>&quot;(l) <em>Sentences on Appeal</em></p>
<p>Prior sentences under appeal are counted except as expressly provided below. In the case of a prior sentence, the execution of which has been stayed pending appeal, §4A1.1(a), (b), (c), (d), and (f) shall apply as if the execution of such sentence had not been stayed; §4A1.1(e) shall not apply.</p>
<p>(m) <em>Effect of a Violation Warrant</em></p>
<p>For the purposes of §4A1.1(d), a defendant who commits the instant offense while a violation warrant from a prior sentence is outstanding (<em>e.g.</em>, a probation, parole, or supervised release violation warrant) shall be deemed to be under a criminal justice sentence if that sentence is otherwise countable, even if that sentence would have expired absent such warrant.</p>
<p>(n) <em>Failure to Report for Service of Sentence of Imprisonment</em></p>
<p>For the purposes of §4A1.1(d) and (e), failure to report for service of a sentence of imprisonment shall be treated as an escape from such sentence.</p>
<p>(o) <em>Felony Offense</em></p>
<p>For the purposes of §4A1.2(c), a ‘felony offense’ means any federal, state, or local offense punishable by death or a term of imprisonment exceeding one year, regardless of the actual sentence imposed.&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §4A1.2 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended in Note 1 by inserting the following additional paragraph:</p>
<p>&quot;Under §4A1.2(a)(4), a conviction for which the defendant has not yet been sentenced is treated as if it were a prior sentence under §4A1.1(c) if a sentence resulting from such conviction otherwise would have been counted. In the case of an offense set forth in §4A1.2(c)(1) (which lists certain misdemeanor and petty offenses), a conviction for which the defendant has not yet been sentenced is treated as if it were a prior sentence under §4A1.2(a)(4) only where the offense is similar to the instant offense (because sentences for other offenses set forth in §4A1.2(c)(1) are counted only if they are of a specified type and length).&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §4A1.2 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended in Note 2 by inserting, immediately after &quot;stated maximum&quot;, the following:</p>
<p>&quot;(<em>e.g.</em>, in the case of a determinate sentence of five years, the stated maximum is five years; in the case of an indeterminate sentence of one to five years, the stated maximum is five years; in the case of an indeterminate sentence for a term not to exceed five years, the stated maximum is five years; in the case of an indeterminate sentence for a term not to exceed the defendant’s twenty-first birthday, the stated maximum is the amount of time in pre-trial detention plus the amount of time between the date of sentence and the defendant’s twenty-first birthday)&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §4A1.2 is amended in Note 11 by inserting the following additional paragraph at the end:</p>
<p>&quot;Where a revocation applies to multiple sentences, and such sentences are counted separately under §4A1.2(a)(2), add the term of imprisonment imposed upon revocation to the sentence that will result in the greatest increase in criminal history points. <em>Example</em>: A defendant was serving two probationary sentences, each counted separately under §4A1.2(a)(2); probation was revoked on both sentences as a result of the same violation conduct; and the defendant was sentenced to a total of 45 days of imprisonment. If one sentence had been a ‘straight’ probationary sentence and the other had been a probationary sentence that had required service of 15 days of imprisonment, the revocation term of imprisonment (45 days) would be added to the probationary sentence that had the 15-day term of imprisonment. This would result in a total of 2 criminal history points under §4A1.1(b) (for the combined 60-day term of imprisonment) and 1 criminal history point under §4A1.1(c) (for the other probationary sentence).&quot;.</p>
<p>Section 4A1.3(d) is amended by deleting &quot;, sentencing, or appeal&quot; and inserting in lieu thereof &quot;or sentencing&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This amendment clarifies the meaning of the term &quot;under a criminal justice sentence&quot; as used in §4A1.1; inserts a new subdivision in §4A1.2(a) to address the case in which the defendant has been convicted of a prior offense, but has not yet been sentenced for that offense; inserts an additional subdivision in §4A1.2(k) to clarify the determination of the applicable time periods in revocation cases; inserts additional subsections in §4A1.2 to address the counting of sentences stayed pending appeal, the effect of a violation warrant on the counting of points under §4A1.1(d), the counting of a failure to report for service of sentence under §4A1.1(d) and (e), and the definition of a felony offense as used in §4A1.2(c); adds an example to Application Note 2 in the Commentary to §4A1.2 to illustrate the meaning of &quot;stated maximum&quot; sentence; adds an additional application note in the Commentary to §4A1.2 addressing the counting of points in complex revocation cases; and conforms the Commentary of §4A1.3 to the addition of §4A1.2(l).</p>

<p><strong>382.</strong> <strong>Amendment:</strong> Section 4A1.1 is amended by inserting the following additional subsection:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;(f) Add 1 point for each prior sentence resulting from a conviction of a crime of violence that did not receive any points under (a), (b), or (c) above because such sentence was considered related to another sentence resulting from a conviction of a crime of violence, up to a total of 3 points for this item. <em>Provided</em>, that this item does not apply where the sentences are considered related because the offenses occurred on the same occasion.&quot;.</p>
<p>Section 4A1.1 is amended in the first sentence by deleting &quot;(e)&quot; and inserting in lieu thereof &quot;(f)&quot;.</p>
<p>Section 4A1.1(c) is amended by deleting &quot;included&quot; and inserting in lieu thereof &quot;counted&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §4A1.1 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended by inserting the following additional note:</p>
<p>&quot;6. <em>§4A1.1(f)</em>. Where the defendant received two or more prior sentences as a result of convictions for crimes of violence that are treated as related cases but did not arise from the same occasion (<em>i.e.</em>, offenses committed on different occasions that were part of a single common scheme or plan or were consolidated for trial or sentencing; <em>see</em> Application Note 3 of the Commentary to §4A1.2), one point is added under §4A1.1(f) for each such sentence that did not result in any additional points under §4A1.1(a), (b), or (c). A total of up to 3 points may be added under §4A1.1(f). ‘Crime of violence’ is defined in §4B1.2(1); <em>see</em> §4A1.2(p).</p>
<p>For example, a defendant’s criminal history includes two robbery convictions for offenses committed on different occasions that were consolidated for sentencing and therefore are treated as related. If the defendant received a five-year sentence of imprisonment for one robbery and a four-year sentence of imprisonment for the other robbery (consecutively or concurrently), a total of 3 points is added under §4A1.1(a). An additional point is added under §4A1.1(f) because the second sentence did not result in any additional point(s) (under §4A1.1(a), (b), or (c)). In contrast, if the defendant received a one-year sentence of imprisonment for one robbery and a nine-month consecutive sentence of imprisonment for the other robbery, a total of 3 points also is added under §4A1.1(a) (a one-year sentence of imprisonment and a consecutive nine-month sentence of imprisonment are treated as a combined one-year-nine-month sentence of imprisonment). But no additional point is added under §4A1.1(f) because the sentence for the second robbery already resulted in an additional point under §4A1.1(a). Without the second sentence, the defendant would only have received two points under §4A1.1(b) for the one-year sentence of imprisonment).&quot;.</p>
<p>Section 4A1.2(a)(2) is amended by deleting &quot;the criminal history&quot; and inserting in lieu thereof &quot;§4A1.1(a), (b), and (c)&quot;.</p>
<p>Section 4A1.2 is amended by inserting the following additional subsection:</p>
<p>&quot;(p) <em>Crime of Violence Defined</em></p>
<p>For the purposes of §4A1.1(f), the definition of ‘crime of violence’ is that set forth in §4B1.2(1).&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §4A1.2 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended in Note 3 by deleting:</p>
<p>&quot;Cases are considered related if they (1) occurred on a single occasion,&quot;,</p>
<p>and inserting in lieu thereof:</p>
<p>&quot;Prior sentences are not considered related if they were for offenses that were separated by an intervening arrest (<em>i.e.</em>, the defendant is arrested for the first offense prior to committing the second offense). Otherwise, prior sentences are considered related if they resulted from offenses that (1) occurred on the same occasion,&quot;;</p>
<p>and by deleting:</p>
<p>&quot;For example, if the defendant commits a number of offenses on independent occasions separated by arrests, and the resulting criminal cases are consolidated and result in a combined sentence of eight years, counting merely three points for this factor will not adequately reflect either the seriousness of the defendant’s criminal history or the frequency with which he commits crimes. In such circumstances, the court should consider whether departure is warranted. <em>See</em> §4A1.3.&quot;,</p>
<p>and inserting in lieu thereof:</p>
<p>&quot;For example, if a defendant was convicted of a number of serious non-violent offenses committed on different occasions, and the resulting sentences were treated as related because the cases were consolidated for sentencing, the assignment of a single set of points may not adequately reflect the seriousness of the defendant’s criminal history or the frequency with which he has committed crimes. In such circumstances, an upward departure may be warranted. Note that the above example refers to serious non-violent offenses. Where prior related sentences result from convictions of crimes of violence, §4A1.1(f) will apply.&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This amendment provides for a specific enhancement under §4A1.2(f) in certain cases having prior convictions of crimes of violence not arising from the same incident that otherwise would be treated as related under §4A1.2. In addition, the definition of related cases in Application Note 3 in the Commentary to §4A1.2 is amended to provide that cases separated by an intervening arrest for one of the offenses are not treated as related cases.</p>

<p>&quot;(a) Restitution shall be ordered for convictions under Title 18 of the United States Code or under 49 U.S.C. § 1472(h), (i), (j) or (n) in accordance with 18 U.S.C. § 3663(d), and may be ordered as a condition of probation or supervised release in any other case.&quot;,</p>
<p>and inserting in lieu thereof:</p>
<p>&quot;(a) The court shall --</p>
<p>(1) enter a restitution order if such order is authorized under 18 U.S.C. §§ 3663-3664; or</p>
<p>(2) if a restitution order would be authorized under 18 U.S.C. §§ 3663-3664, except for the fact that the offense of conviction is not an offense set forth in Title 18, United States Code, or 49 U.S.C. § 1472(h), (i), (j), or (n), impose a term of probation or supervised release with a condition requiring restitution.</p>
<p>(b) <em>Provided</em>, that the provisions of subsection (a) do not apply when full restitution has been made, or to the extent the court determines that the complication and prolongation of the sentencing process resulting from the fashioning of a restitution requirement outweighs the need to provide restitution to any victims through the criminal process.&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §5E1.1 captioned &quot;Background&quot; is amended in the first paragraph by deleting the last sentence as follows:</p>
<p>&quot;An order of restitution may be appropriate in offenses not specifically referenced in 18 U.S.C. § 3663 where victims require relief more promptly than the civil justice system provides.&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §5E1.1 captioned &quot;Background&quot; is amended in the second paragraph by deleting &quot;5E1.1 requires the court to order restitution for offenses under Title 18, or 49 U.S.C. § 1472(h), (i), (j) or (n), unless&quot; and inserting in lieu thereof &quot;(a)(1) of this guideline requires the court to order restitution for offenses under Title 18, United States Code, or 49 U.S.C. § 1472(h), (i), (j) or (n), unless full restitution has already been made or&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §5E1.1 captioned &quot;Background&quot; is amended in the sixth paragraph by deleting &quot;how and to whom&quot; and by inserting in lieu thereof &quot;the manner in which, and the persons to whom,&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §5E1.1. captioned &quot;Background&quot; is amended by inserting the following additional paragraph at the end:</p>
<p>&quot; Subsection (a)(2) provides for restitution as a condition of probation or supervised release for offenses not set forth in Title 18, United States Code, or 49 U.S.C. § 1472(h), (i), (j), or (n).&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This amendment expands §5E1.1 to require restitution as a condition of probation or supervised release for offenses not set forth in Title 18 and 49 U.S.C. § 1472(h), (i), (j), and (n). Currently, §5E1.1 permits, but does not require, restitution to be ordered as a condition of probation or supervised release for offenses not set forth in Title 18, United States Code, or 49 U.S.C. § 1472(h) (i), (j), and (n).</p>
<p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> <strong>The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1991.</strong></p>

<p><strong>384.</strong> <strong>Amendment:</strong> Section 5E1.2(c) is amended by deleting:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;(1) The minimum of the fine range is the greater of:</p>
<p>(A) the amount shown in column A of the table below; or</p>
<p>(B) the pecuniary gain to the defendant, less restitution made or ordered.</p>
<p>(2) Except as specified in (4) below, the maximum of the fine range is the greater of:</p>
<p>(A) the amount shown in column B of the table below;</p>
<p>(B) twice the gross pecuniary loss caused by the offense; or</p>
<p>(C) three times the gross pecuniary gain to all participants in the offense.&quot;,</p>
<p>and inserting in lieu thereof:</p>
<p>&quot;(1) The minimum of the fine range is the amount shown in column A of the table below.</p>
<p>(2) Except as specified in (4) below, the maximum of the fine range is the amount shown in column B of the table below.&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §5E1.2 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended in Note 3 by deleting the first two paragraphs as follows:</p>
<p>&quot;Alternative fine limits are provided in subsection (c). The terms ‘pecuniary gain’ and ‘pecuniary loss’ are taken from 18 U.S.C. § 3571(d). The Commission does not intend precise or detailed calculation of the gain or loss in using the alternative fine limits.</p>
<p>Where it is readily ascertainable that the defendant cannot, and is not likely to become able to, pay a fine greater than the maximum fine set forth in Column B of the Fine Table in subsection (c)(3), calculation of the alternative maximum fines under subsections (c)(2)(B) (twice the gross pecuniary loss caused by the offense) and (c)(2)(C) (three times the gross pecuniary gain to all participants in the offense) is unnecessary. In such cases, a statement that ‘the alternative maximums of the fine table were not calculated because it is readily ascertainable that the defendant cannot, and is not likely to become able to, pay a fine greater than the maximum set forth in the fine table’ is recommended in lieu of such calculations.&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §5E1.2 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended by deleting:</p>
<p>&quot;4. ‘Restitution made or ordered’ refers to restitution for the instant offense made before or at the time of sentencing, as well as any restitution ordered at the time of sentencing for the instant offense.&quot;,</p>
<p>and inserting in lieu thereof:</p>
<p>&quot;4. The Commission envisions that for most defendants, the maximum of the guideline fine range from subsection (c) will be at least twice the amount of gain or loss resulting from the offense. Where, however, two times either the amount of gain to the defendant or the amount of loss caused by the offense exceeds the maximum of the fine guideline, an upward departure from the fine guideline may be warranted.</p>
<p>Moreover, where a sentence within the applicable fine guideline range would not be sufficient to ensure both the disgorgement of any gain from the offense that otherwise would not be disgorged (<em>e.g.</em>, by restitution or forfeiture) and an adequate punitive fine, an upward departure from the fine guideline range may be warranted.&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §5E1.2 captioned &quot;Background&quot; is deleted in its entirety as follows:</p>
<p>&quot;<em>Background</em>: These guidelines permit a relatively wide range of fines. The Commission may promulgate more detailed guidelines for the imposition of fines after analyzing practice under these initial guidelines.</p>
<p>Recent legislation provides for substantial increases in fines. 18 U.S.C. § 3571(b). With few restrictions, 42 U.S.C. § 10601(b), and (c) authorize fine payments up to $100 million to be deposited in the Crime Victims Fund in the United States Treasury. With vigorous enforcement, higher fines should be effective punitive and deterrent sanctions.</p>
<p>A larger multiple of the gain than of the loss is used in subsection (c)(2) because most offenses result in losses to society that exceed the gain to the participants. In addition, in many such cases restitution will not be feasible. These larger fines authorized under subsection (c)(2) are, of course, subject to the absolute limits on fines that are imposed by statute.</p>
<p>The Commission has not attempted to define gain or loss precisely. It is expected that the terms will be used flexibly and consistently with their use in the criminal code, including former 18 U.S.C. § 3623(c)(1).&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This amendment is designed to simplify the operation of this guideline and conserve probation and court resources by eliminating the need for the determination of loss and gain under this section in most cases. Experience has shown that for the vast majority of defendants, the amount from the fine table in subsection (c)(3) or the amount from subsection (c)(4), as applicable, is more than twice the gain or loss from the offense. This amendment provides that the guideline fine range is to be determined from subsection (c)(3) or (c)(4), as applicable. In the unusual case in which twice the defendant’s gain from the offense or twice the loss caused by the offense exceeds the maximum of the guideline range, an upward departure may be considered.</p>

<p><strong>385.</strong> <strong>Amendment:</strong> Chapter Five, Part G is amended by deleting §5G1.3 in its entirety as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;§5G1.3. <em>Imposition of a Sentence on a Defendant Serving an Unexpired Term of Imprisonment</em></p>
<p>If the instant offense was committed while the defendant was serving a term of imprisonment (including work release, furlough, or escape status), the sentence for the instant offense shall be imposed to run consecutively to the unexpired term of imprisonment.</p>
<p><em>Commentary</em></p>
<p>Under this guideline, the court shall impose a consecutive sentence where the instant offense (or any part thereof) was committed while the defendant was serving an unexpired term of imprisonment.</p>
<p>Where the defendant is serving an unexpired term of imprisonment, but did not commit the instant offense while serving that term of imprisonment, the sentence for the instant offense may be imposed to run consecutively or concurrently with the unexpired term of imprisonment. The court may consider imposing a sentence for the instant offense that results in a combined sentence that approximates the total punishment that would have been imposed under §5G1.2 (Sentencing on Multiple Counts of Conviction) had all of the offenses been federal offenses for which sentences were being imposed at the same time. Where the defendant is serving a term of imprisonment for a state offense, the information available may permit only a rough estimate of the total punishment that would have been imposed under the guidelines. It is not intended that the above methodology be applied in a manner that unduly complicates or prolongs the sentencing process.&quot;.</p>
<p>A replacement guideline with accompanying commentary is inserted as §5G1.3 (Imposition of a Sentence on a Defendant Subject to an Undischarged Term of Imprisonment).</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This amendment provides additional structure and guidance for the decision to impose a consecutive or concurrent sentence upon a defendant subject to an undischarged term of imprisonment to reduce the potential for unwarranted disparity in such determinations.</p>

<p><strong>386.</strong> <strong>Amendment:</strong> The Introductory Commentary to Chapter Five, Part H is amended by deleting:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot; Congress has directed the Commission to consider whether certain specific offender characteristics ‘have any relevance to the nature, extent, place of service, or other incidents of an appropriate sentence’ and to take them into account only to the extent they are determined relevant by the Commission. 28 U.S.C. § 994(d).&quot;,</p>
<p>and inserting in lieu thereof:</p>
<p>&quot; The following policy statements address the relevance of certain offender characteristics to the determination of whether a sentence should be outside the applicable guideline range and, in certain cases, to the determination of a sentence within the applicable guideline range. Under 28 U.S.C. § 994(d), the Commission is directed to consider whether certain specific offender characteristics ‘have any relevance to the nature, extent, place of service, or other incidents of an appropriate sentence’ and to take them into account only to the extent they are determined to be relevant by the Commission.</p>
<p>The Commission has determined that certain factors are not ordinarily relevant to the determination of whether a sentence should be outside the applicable guideline range. Unless expressly stated, this does not mean that the Commission views such factors as necessarily inappropriate to the determination of the sentence within the applicable guideline range or to the determination of various other incidents of an appropriate sentence (<em>e.g.</em>, the appropriate conditions of probation or supervised release).&quot;.</p>
<p>Section 5H1.1 is amended by deleting:</p>
<p>&quot;Age is not ordinarily relevant in determining whether a sentence should be outside the guidelines. Neither is it ordinarily relevant in determining the type of sentence to be imposed when the guidelines provide sentencing options. Age may be a reason to go below the guidelines when the offender is elderly <em>and</em> infirm and where a form of punishment (<em>e.g.</em>, home confinement) might be equally efficient as and less costly than incarceration. If, independent of the consideration of age, a defendant is sentenced to probation or supervised release, age may be relevant in the determination of the length and conditions of supervision.&quot;,</p>
<p>and inserting in lieu thereof:</p>
<p>&quot;Age (including youth) is not ordinarily relevant in determining whether a sentence should be outside the applicable guideline range. Age may be a reason to impose a sentence below the applicable guideline range when the defendant is elderly and infirm and where a form of punishment such as home confinement might be equally efficient as and less costly than incarceration. Physical condition, which may be related to age, is addressed at §5H1.4 (Physical Condition, Including Drug or Alcohol Dependence or Abuse).</p>
<p>The guidelines are not applicable to a person sentenced as a juvenile delinquent under the provisions of 18 U.S.C. § 5037.&quot;.</p>
<p>Section 5H1.2 is amended by deleting:</p>
<p>&quot;Education and vocational skills are not ordinarily relevant in determining whether a sentence should be outside the guidelines, but the extent to which a defendant may have misused special training or education to facilitate criminal activity is an express guideline factor. <em>See</em> §3B1.3 (Abuse of Position of Trust or Use of Special Skill). Neither are education and vocational skills relevant in determining the type of sentence to be imposed when the guidelines provide sentencing options. If, independent of consideration of education and vocational skills, a defendant is sentenced to probation or supervised release, these considerations may be relevant in the determination of the length and conditions of supervision for rehabilitative purposes, for public protection by restricting activities that allow for the utilization of a certain skill, or in determining the type or length of community service.&quot;,</p>
<p>and by inserting in lieu thereof:</p>

<p>Section 5H1.3 is amended by deleting:</p>
<p>&quot;Mental and emotional conditions are not ordinarily relevant in determining whether a sentence should be outside the guidelines, except as provided in the general provisions in Chapter Five. Mental and emotional conditions, whether mitigating or aggravating, may be relevant in determining the length and conditions of probation or supervised release.&quot;,</p>
<p>and inserting in lieu thereof:</p>
<p>&quot;Mental and emotional conditions are not ordinarily relevant in determining whether a sentence should be outside the applicable guideline range, except as provided in Chapter Five, Part K, Subpart 2 (Other Grounds for Departure).</p>
<p>Mental and emotional conditions may be relevant in determining the conditions of probation or supervised release; <em>e.g.</em>, participation in a mental health program (<em>see</em> recommended condition (24) at §5B1.4 (Recommended Conditions of Probation and Supervised Release)).&quot;.</p>
<p>Section 5H1.4 is amended by deleting:</p>
<p>&quot;<em>Physical Condition, Including Drug Dependence and Alcohol Abuse</em> (Policy Statement)</p>
<p>Physical condition is not ordinarily relevant in determining whether a sentence should be outside the guidelines or where within the guidelines a sentence should fall. However, an extraordinary physical impairment may be a reason to impose a sentence other than imprisonment.</p>
<p>Drug dependence or alcohol abuse is not a reason for imposing a sentence below the guidelines. Substance abuse is highly correlated to an increased propensity to commit crime. Due to this increased risk, it is highly recommended that a defendant who is incarcerated also be sentenced to supervised release with a requirement that the defendant participate in an appropriate substance abuse program. If participation in a substance abuse program is required, the length of supervised release should take into account the length of time necessary for the supervisory body to judge the success of the program.</p>
<p>This provision would also apply in cases where the defendant received a sentence of probation. The substance abuse condition is strongly recommended and the length of probation should be adjusted accordingly. Failure to comply would normally result in revocation of probation.&quot;,</p>
<p>and inserting in lieu thereof:</p>
<p>&quot;<em>Physical Condition, Including Drug or Alcohol Dependence or Abuse</em> (Policy Statement)</p>
<p>Physical condition or appearance, including physique, is not ordinarily relevant in determining whether a sentence should be outside the applicable guideline range. However, an extraordinary physical impairment may be a reason to impose a sentence below the applicable guideline range; <em>e.g.</em>, in the case of a seriously infirm defendant, home detention may be as efficient as, and less costly than, imprisonment.</p>
<p>Drug or alcohol dependence or abuse is not a reason for imposing a sentence below the guidelines. Substance abuse is highly correlated to an increased propensity to commit crime. Due to this increased risk, it is highly recommended that a defendant who is incarcerated also be sentenced to supervised release with a requirement that the defendant participate in an appropriate substance abuse program (<em>see</em> recommended condition (23) at §5B1.4 (Recommended Conditions of Probation and Supervised Release)). If participation in a substance abuse program is required, the length of supervised release should take into account the length of time necessary for the supervisory body to judge the success of the program.</p>
<p>Similarly, where a defendant who is a substance abuser is sentenced to probation, it is strongly recommended that the conditions of probation contain a requirement that the defendant participate in an appropriate substance abuse program (<em>see</em> recommended condition (23) at §5B1.4 (Recommended Conditions of Probation and Supervised Release)).&quot;.</p>
<p>Section 5H1.5 is amended by deleting:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&quot;Employment record is not ordinarily relevant in determining whether a sentence should be outside the guidelines or where within the guidelines a sentence should fall. Employment record may be relevant in determining the type of sentence to be imposed when the guidelines provide for sentencing options. If, independent of the consideration of employment record, a defendant is sentenced to probation or supervised release, considerations of employment record may be relevant in the determination of the length and conditions of supervision.&quot;,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>and inserting in lieu thereof:</p>
<p>&quot;Employment record is not ordinarily relevant in determining whether a sentence should be outside the applicable guideline range.</p>

<p>Section 5H1.6 is amended by deleting:</p>
<p>&quot;Family ties and responsibilities and community ties are not ordinarily relevant in determining whether a sentence should be outside the guidelines. Family responsibilities that are complied with are relevant in determining whether to impose restitution and fines. Where the guidelines provide probation as an option, these factors may be relevant in this determination. If a defendant is sentenced to probation or supervised release, family ties and responsibilities that are met may be relevant in the determination of the length and conditions of supervision.&quot;,</p>
<p>and inserting in lieu thereof:</p>
<p>&quot;Family ties and responsibilities and community ties are not ordinarily relevant in determining whether a sentence should be outside the applicable guideline range.</p>
<p>Family responsibilities that are complied with may be relevant to the determination of the amount of restitution or fine.&quot;.</p>
<p>Chapter Five, Part H is amended by inserting an additional policy statement as §5H1.11 (Military, Civic, Charitable, or Public Service; Employment-Related Contributions; Record of Prior Good Works (Policy Statement)).</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This amendment expresses the Commission’s intent that the factors set forth in this part are not ordinarily relevant in determining whether a sentence should be outside the applicable guideline range; but that, unless expressly stated, these policy statements do not mean that the Commission views such factors as necessarily inappropriate to the determination of the sentence within the applicable guideline range. The language within these sections is revised for clarity and consistency. In addition, this amendment adds language that expressly states that the guidelines do not apply to defendants sentenced as juvenile delinquents; and sets forth the Commission’s position that physical appearance, including physique, military, civic, charitable, or public service, employment-related contributions, and record of prior good works are not ordinarily relevant in determining whether a sentence should be outside the applicable guideline range.</p>

<p>The Commentary to §1B1.3 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended in Note 2 by inserting the following additional paragraph at the end:</p>
<p>&quot;As noted above, subsection (a)(2) applies to offenses of a character for which §3D1.2(d) would require grouping of multiple counts, had the defendant been convicted of multiple counts. For example, the defendant sells 30 grams of cocaine (a violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841) on one occasion and, as part of the same course of conduct or common scheme or plan, attempts to sell an additional 15 grams of cocaine (a violation of 21 U.S.C. 846) on another occasion. The defendant is convicted of one count charging the completed sale of 30 grams of cocaine. The two offenses (sale of cocaine and attempted sale of cocaine), although covered by different statutory provisions, are of a character for which §3D1.2(d) would require the grouping of counts, had the defendant been convicted of both counts. Therefore, subsection (a)(2) applies and the total amount of cocaine (45 grams) involved is used to determine the offense level.&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §1B1.3 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended in Note 4 by inserting &quot;; Property Damage by Use of Explosives&quot; immediately following &quot;Arson&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §1B1.3 captioned &quot;Application Notes is amended in Note 5 by deleting:</p>
<p>&quot;<em>E.g.</em>, in §2K2.2, a base offense level of 16 is used ‘if the defendant is convicted under 18 U.S.C. § 922(o) or 26 U.S.C. § 5861.’&quot;,</p>
<p>and inserting in lieu thereof:</p>
<p>&quot;For example, in §2K1.5, subsection (b)(1) applies ‘If the defendant is convicted under 49 U.S.C. § 1472(l)(2).’&quot;;</p>
<p>by deleting:</p>
<p>&quot;Examples of this usage are found in §2K1.3(b)(4) (‘If the defendant was a person prohibited from receiving explosives under 18 U.S.C. § 842(i), or if the defendant knowingly distributed explosives to a person prohibited from receiving explosives under 18 U.S.C. § 842(i), increase by 10 levels’); and&quot;,</p>
<p>and inserting in lieu thereof &quot;An example of this usage is found in&quot;; and by inserting the following additional paragraph at the end:</p>
<p>&quot;An express direction to apply a particular factor only if the defendant was convicted of a particular statute includes the determination of the offense level where the defendant was convicted of conspiracy, attempt, solicitation, aiding or abetting, accessory after the fact, or misprision of felony in respect to that particular statute. For example, §2K1.5(b)(1) (which is applicable only if the defendant is convicted under 49 U.S.C. § 1472(l)(2)) would be applied in determining the offense level under §2X3.1 (Accessory After the Fact) where the defendant was convicted of accessory after the fact to a violation of 49 U.S.C. § 1472(l)(2).&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §1B1.3 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended by inserting the following additional notes:</p>
<p>&quot;6. In the case of a partially completed offense (<em>e.g.</em>, an offense involving an attempted theft of $800,000 and a completed theft of $30,000), the offense level is to be determined in accordance with §2X1.1 (Attempt, Solicitation, or Conspiracy) whether the conviction is for the substantive offense, the inchoate offense (attempt, solicitation, or conspiracy), or both. <em>See</em> Application Note 4 in the Commentary to §2X1.1. Note, however, that Application Note 4 is not applicable where the offense level is determined under §2X1.1(c)(1).</p>
<p>7. For the purposes of subsection (a)(2), offense conduct associated with a sentence that was imposed prior to the acts or omissions constituting the instant federal offense (the offense of conviction) is not considered as part of the same course of conduct or common scheme or plan as the offense of conviction.</p>
<p><em>Examples</em>: (1) The defendant was convicted for the sale of cocaine and sentenced to state prison. Immediately upon release from prison, he again sold cocaine to the same person, using the same accomplices and <em>modus operandi</em>. The instant federal offense (the offense of conviction) charges this latter sale. In this example, the offense conduct relevant to the state prison sentence is considered as prior criminal history, not as part of the same course of conduct or common scheme or plan as the offense of conviction. The prior state prison sentence is counted under Chapter Four (Criminal History and Criminal Livelihood). (2) The defendant engaged in two cocaine sales constituting part of the same course of conduct or common scheme or plan. Subsequently, he is arrested by state authorities for the first sale and by federal authorities for the second sale. He is convicted in state court for the first sale and sentenced to imprisonment; he is then convicted in federal court for the second sale. In this case, the cocaine sales are not separated by an intervening sentence. Therefore, under subsection (a)(2), the cocaine sale associated with the state conviction is considered as relevant conduct to the instant federal offense. The state prison sentence for that sale is not counted as a prior sentence; <em>see</em> §4A1.2(a)(1).</p>
<p>Note, however, in certain cases, offense conduct associated with a previously imposed sentence may be expressly charged in the offense of conviction. Unless otherwise provided, such conduct will be considered relevant conduct under subsection (a)(1), not (a)(2).&quot;.</p>

<p><strong>390.</strong> <strong>Amendment:</strong> The Commentary to §1B1.8 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended by inserting the following additional notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;5. This guideline limits the use of certain incriminating information furnished by a defendant in the context of a defendant-government agreement for the defendant to provide information concerning the unlawful activities of other persons. The guideline operates as a limitation on the use of such incriminating information in determining the applicable guideline range, and not merely as a restriction of the government’s presentation of such information (<em>e.g.</em>, where the defendant, subsequent to having entered into a cooperation agreement, repeats such information to the probation officer preparing the presentence report, the use of such information remains protected by this section).</p>
<p>6. Unless the cooperation agreement relates to the provision of information concerning the unlawful activities of others, this guideline does not apply (<em>i.e.</em>, an agreement by the defendant simply to detail the extent of his own unlawful activities, not involving an agreement to provide information concerning the unlawful activity of another person, is not covered by this guideline).&quot;.</p>

</blockquote>
<p><strong>393.</strong> <strong>Amendment:</strong> The Commentary to §2B1.1 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended in Note 2 by deleting:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;In cases of partially completed conduct, the loss is to be determined in accordance with the provisions of §2X1.1 (Attempt, Solicitation, or Conspiracy). <em>E.g.</em>, in the case of the theft of a government check or money order, loss refers to the loss level that would have occurred if the check or money order had been cashed. Similarly, if a defendant is apprehended in the process of taking a vehicle, the loss refers to the value of the vehicle even if the vehicle is recovered immediately.&quot;,</p>
<p>and inserting in lieu thereof:</p>
<p>&quot;<em>Examples</em>: (1) In the case of a theft of a check or money order, the loss is the loss that would have occurred if the check or money order had been cashed. (2) In the case of a defendant apprehended taking a vehicle, the loss is the value of the vehicle even if the vehicle is recovered immediately.</p>
<p>In the case of a partially completed offense (<em>e.g.</em>, an offense involving a completed theft that is part of a larger, attempted theft), the offense level is to be determined in accordance with the provisions of §2X1.1 (Attempt, Solicitation, or Conspiracy) whether the conviction is for the substantive offense, the inchoate offense (attempt, solicitation, or conspiracy), or both; <em>see</em> Application Note 4 in the Commentary to §2X1.1.&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §2B1.1 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended in Note 4 by deleting &quot;Attempts&quot; and inserting in lieu thereof &quot;Attempt, Solicitation, or Conspiracy&quot;; and by inserting &quot;and Deceit&quot; immediately following &quot;Fraud&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §2F1.1 is amended by deleting Notes 7 and 8 as follows:</p>
<p>&quot;7. Valuation of loss is discussed in the Commentary to §2B1.1 (Larceny, Embezzlement, and Other Forms of Theft). In keeping with the Commission’s policy on attempts, if a probable or intended loss that the defendant was attempting to inflict can be determined, that figure would be used if it was larger than the actual loss. For example, if the fraud consisted of attempting to sell $40,000 in worthless securities, or representing that a forged check for $40,000 was genuine, the ‘loss’ would be treated as $40,000 for purposes of this guideline.</p>
<p>8. The amount of loss need not be precise. The court is not expected to identify each victim and the loss he suffered to arrive at an exact figure. The court need only make a reasonable estimate of the range of loss, given the available information. The estimate may be based on the approximate number of victims and an estimate of the average loss to each victim, or on more general factors, such as the nature and duration of the fraud and the revenues generated by similar operations. Estimates based upon aggregate ‘market loss’ (<em>e.g.</em>, the aggregate decline in market value of a stock resulting from disclosure of information that was wrongfully withheld or misrepresented) are especially appropriate for securities cases. The offender’s gross gain from committing the fraud is an alternative estimate that ordinarily will understate the loss.&quot;;</p>
<p>by deleting Note 10 as follows:</p>
<p>&quot;10. In a few instances, the total dollar loss that results from the offense may overstate its seriousness. Such situations typically occur when a misrepresentation is of limited materiality or is not the sole cause of the loss. Examples would include understating debts to a limited degree in order to obtain a substantial loan which the defendant genuinely expected to repay; attempting to negotiate an instrument that was so obviously fraudulent that no one would seriously consider honoring it; and making a misrepresentation in a securities offering that enabled the securities to be sold at inflated prices, but where the value of the securities subsequently declined in substantial part for other reasons. In such instances, a downward departure may be warranted.&quot;;</p>
<p>by renumbering Note 9 as Note 10; by inserting the following as Notes 7, 8 and 9:</p>
<p>&quot;7. Valuation of loss is discussed in the Commentary to §2B1.1 (Larceny, Embezzlement, and Other Forms of Theft). Consistent with the provisions of §2X1.1 (Attempt, Solicitation or Conspiracy), if an intended loss that the defendant was attempting to inflict can be determined, this figure will be used if it is greater than the actual loss. Frequently, loss in a fraud case will be the same as in a theft case. For example, if the fraud consisted of selling or attempting to sell $40,000 in worthless securities, or representing that a forged check for $40,000 was genuine, the loss would be $40,000.</p>
<p>There are, however, instances where additional factors are to be considered in determining the loss or intended loss:</p>
<p>(a) <em>Fraud Involving Misrepresentation of the Value of an Item or Product Substitution</em></p>
<p>A fraud may involve the misrepresentation of the value of an item that does have some value (in contrast to an item that is worthless). Where, for example, a defendant fraudulently represents that stock is worth $40,000 and the stock is worth only $10,000, the loss is the amount by which the stock was overvalued (<em>i.e.</em>, $30,000). In a case involving a misrepresentation concerning the quality of a consumer product, the loss is the difference between the amount paid by the victim for the product and the amount for which the victim could resell the product received.</p>
<p>(b) <em>Fraudulent Loan Application and Contract Procurement Cases</em></p>
<p>In fraudulent loan application cases and contract procurement cases where the defendant’s capabilities are fraudulently represented, the loss is the actual loss to the victim (or if the loss has not yet come about, the expected loss). For example, if a defendant fraudulently obtains a loan by misrepresenting the value of his assets, the loss is the amount of the loan not repaid at the time the offense is discovered, reduced by the amount the lending institution has recovered, or can expect to recover, from any assets pledged to secure the loan.</p>
<p>In some cases, the loss determined above may significantly understate or overstate the seriousness of the defendant’s conduct. For example, where the defendant substantially understated his debts to obtain a loan, which he nevertheless repaid, the loss determined above (zero loss) will tend not to reflect adequately the risk of loss created by the defendant’s conduct. Conversely, a defendant may understate his debts to a limited degree to obtain a loan (<em>e.g.</em>, to expand a grain export business), which he genuinely expected to repay and for which he would have qualified at a higher interest rate had he made truthful disclosure, but he is unable to repay the loan because of some unforeseen event (<em>e.g.</em>, an embargo imposed on grain exports) which would have caused a default in any event. In such a case, the loss determined above may overstate the seriousness of the defendant’s conduct.</p>
<p>(c) <em>Consequential Damages in Procurement Fraud and Product Substitution Cases</em></p>
<p>In contrast to other types of cases, loss in a procurement fraud or product substitution case includes not only direct damages, but also consequential damages that were reasonably foreseeable. For example, in a case involving a defense product substitution offense, the loss includes the government’s reasonably foreseeable costs of making substitute transactions and handling or disposing of the product delivered or retrofitting the product so that it can be used for its intended purpose, plus the government’s reasonably foreseeable cost of rectifying the actual or potential disruption to government operations caused by the product substitution. Similarly, in the case of fraud affecting a defense contract award, loss includes the reasonably foreseeable administrative cost to the government and other participants of repeating or correcting the procurement action affected, plus any increased cost to procure the product or service involved that was reasonably foreseeable. Inclusion of reasonably foreseeable consequential damages directly in the calculation of loss in procurement fraud and product substitution cases reflects that such damages frequently are substantial in such cases.</p>
<p>(d) <em>Diversion of Government Program Benefits</em></p>
<p>In a case involving diversion of government program benefits, loss is the value of the benefits diverted from intended recipients or uses.</p>
<p>(e) <em>Davis-Bacon Act Cases</em></p>
<p>In a case involving a Davis-Bacon Act violation (a violation of 40 U.S.C. § 276a, criminally prosecuted under 18 U.S.C. § 1001), the loss is the difference between the legally required and actual wages paid.</p>
<p>8. For the purposes of subsection (b)(1), the loss need not be determined with precision. The court need only make a reasonable estimate of the loss, given the available information. This estimate, for example, may be based on the approximate number of victims and an estimate of the average loss to each victim, or on more general factors, such as the nature and duration of the fraud and the revenues generated by similar operations. The offender’s gain from committing the fraud is an alternative estimate that ordinarily will underestimate the loss.</p>
<p>9. In the case of a partially completed offense (<em>e.g.</em>, an offense involving a completed fraud that is part of a larger, attempted fraud), the offense level is to be determined in accordance with the provisions of §2X1.1 (Attempt, Solicitation, or Conspiracy) whether the conviction is for the substantive offense, the inchoate offense (attempt, solicitation, or conspiracy), or both; <em>see</em> Application Note 4 in the Commentary to §2X1.1.&quot;;</p>
<p>and in the renumbered Note 10 (formerly Note 9) by deleting:</p>
<p>&quot;Dollar loss often does not fully capture the harmfulness and seriousness of the conduct. In such instances, an upward departure may be warranted.&quot;,</p>
<p>and inserting in lieu thereof:</p>
<p>&quot;In cases in which the loss determined under subsection (b)(1) does not fully capture the harmfulness and seriousness of the conduct, an upward departure may be warranted.&quot;;</p>
<p>by deleting subdivision (f) as follows:</p>
<p>&quot;(f) completion of the offense was prevented, or the offense was interrupted before it caused serious harm.&quot;;</p>
<p>by deleting the semicolon at the end of subdivision (e) and inserting in lieu thereof a period; and by inserting the following additional paragraph at the end:</p>
<p>&quot;In a few instances, the loss determined under subsection (b)(1) may overstate the seriousness of the offense. This may occur, for example, where a defendant attempted to negotiate an instrument that was so obviously fraudulent that no one would seriously consider honoring it.&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This amendment provides a more precise reference in the commentary of these guidelines to the discussion in §2X1.1 that applies in the case of a partially completed offense. In addition, the amendment reorders the material in these notes, and divides them into separate paragraphs for greater clarity. The amendment also conforms the wording of Application Note 7 of the Commentary to §2F1.1 to Application Note 2 of the Commentary to §2B1.1 to make clear that the treatment of attempts in cases of fraud and theft is identical. Finally, this amendment provides additional guidance with respect to the determination of loss, and makes editorial improvements.</p>

<p><strong>396.</strong> <strong>Amendment:</strong> The Commentary to §2D1.1 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended in Note 10 in the first paragraph by deleting &quot;grams of a substance containing heroin&quot; and inserting in lieu thereof &quot;kilograms of marihuana&quot;; in the second paragraph by deleting:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;If all the drugs are ‘equivalents’ of the same drug, <em>e.g.</em>, stimulants that are grouped with cocaine, convert them to that drug. In other cases, convert each of the drugs to either the heroin or marihuana equivalents, add the quantities, and look up the total in the Drug Quantity Table to obtain the combined offense level. Use the marihuana equivalents when the only substances involved are ‘Schedule I Marihuana,’ ‘Schedule III Substances,’ ‘Schedule IV Substances,’ ‘Schedule V Substances’ or ‘Schedule I or II Depressants.’ Otherwise, use the heroin equivalents.&quot;,</p>
<p>and inserting in lieu thereof:</p>
<p>&quot;In each case, convert each of the drugs to its marihuana equivalent, add the quantities, and look up the total in the Drug Quantity Table to obtain the combined offense level.&quot;;</p>
<p>in the first example by deleting:</p>
<p>&quot;a. The defendant is convicted of selling seventy grams of a substance containing PCP (Level 22) and 250 milligrams of a substance containing LSD (Level 18). Both PCP and LSD are grouped together in the Drug Equivalency Tables under the heading ‘LSD, PCP, and Other Schedule I and II Hallucinogens,’ which provide PCP equivalencies. The 250 milligrams of LSD is equivalent to twenty-five grams of PCP. The total is therefore ninety-five grams of PCP, for which the Drug Quantity Table provides an offense level of 24.&quot;,</p>
<p>and inserting in lieu thereof:</p>
<p>&quot;a. The defendant is convicted of selling 70 grams of a substance containing PCP (Level 22) and 250 milligrams of a substance containing LSD (Level 18). The PCP converts to 70 kilograms of marihuana; the LSD converts to 25 kilograms of marihuana. The total is therefore equivalent to 95 kilograms of marihuana, for which the Drug Quantity Table provides an offense level of 24.&quot;;</p>
<p>and in the third example by deleting:</p>
<p>&quot;c. The defendant is convicted of selling eighty grams of cocaine (Level 16) and five kilograms of marihuana (Level 14). The cocaine is equivalent to sixteen grams of heroin; the marihuana, to five grams of heroin. The total equivalent is twenty-one grams of heroin, which has an offense level of 18 in the Drug Quantity Table.&quot;,</p>
<p>and inserting in lieu thereof:</p>
<p>&quot;c. The defendant is convicted of selling 80 grams of cocaine (Level 16) and five kilograms of marihuana (Level 14). The cocaine is equivalent to 16 kilograms of marihuana. The total is therefore equivalent to 21 kilograms of marihuana, which has an offense level of 18 in the Drug Quantity Table.&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §2D1.1 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended in Note 10 by inserting the following additional paragraph as the third paragraph:</p>
<p>&quot;For certain types of controlled substances, the marihuana equivalencies in the Drug Equivalency Tables are ‘capped’ at specified amounts (<em>e.g.</em>, the combined equivalent weight of all Schedule V controlled substances shall not exceed 999 grams of marihuana). Where there are controlled substances from more than one schedule (<em>e.g.</em>, a quantity of a Schedule IV substance and a quantity of a Schedule V substance), determine the marihuana equivalency for each schedule separately (subject to the cap, if any, applicable to that schedule). Then add the marihuana equivalencies to determine the combined marihuana equivalency (subject to the cap, if any, applicable to the combined amounts).&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §2D1.1 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended in Note 10 by inserting the following additional example immediately after example (c):</p>
<p>&quot;d. The defendant is convicted of selling 28 kilograms of a Schedule III substance, 50 kilograms of a Schedule IV substance, and 100 kilograms of a Schedule V substance. The marihuana equivalency for the Schedule III substance is 56 kilograms of marihuana (below the cap of 59.99 kilograms of marihuana set forth as the maximum equivalent weight for Schedule III substances). The marihuana equivalency for the Schedule IV substance is subject to a cap of 4.99 kilograms of marihuana set forth as the maximum equivalent weight for Schedule IV substances (without the cap it would have been 6.25 kilograms). The marihuana equivalency for the Schedule V substance is subject to the cap of 999 grams of marihuana set forth as the maximum equivalent weight for Schedule V substances (without the cap it would have been 1.25 kilograms). The combined equivalent weight, determined by adding together the above amounts, is subject to the cap of 59.99 kilograms of marihuana set forth as the maximum combined equivalent weight for Schedule III, IV, and V substances. Without the cap, the combined equivalent weight would have been 61.99 (56 + 4.99 + .999) kilograms.&quot;.</p>

<p>The Commentary to §2D1.1 captioned &quot;Background&quot; is amended by inserting the following additional paragraph as the fourth paragraph:</p>
<p>&quot; In cases involving fifty or more marihuana plants, an equivalency of one plant to one kilogram of marihuana is derived from the statutory penalty provisions of 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(A), (B), and (D). In cases involving fewer than fifty plants, the statute is silent as to the equivalency. For cases involving fewer than fifty plants, the Commission has adopted an equivalency of 100 grams per plant, or the actual weight of the usable marihuana, whichever is greater. The decision to treat each plant as equal to 100 grams is premised on the fact that the average yield from a mature marihuana plant equals 100 grams of marihuana. In controlled substance offenses, an attempt is assigned the same offense level as the object of the attempt (<em>see</em> §2D1.4). Consequently, the Commission adopted the policy that, in the case of fewer than fifty marihuana plants, each plant is to be treated as the equivalent of an attempt to produce 100 grams of marihuana, except where the actual weight of the usable marihuana is greater.&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This amendment substitutes a single conversion for Schedule III substances (1 gm of a Schedule III substance = 2 gms of marihuana) that will simplify application of the guidelines as well as address currently unlisted Schedule III substances. Because the equivalencies for Schedule III substances are not statutorily based, nor are the pharmacological equivalencies as clear as with Schedule I or II Substances, a generic listing was deemed appropriate. For the same reasons, the amendment provides a single conversion for Schedule IV substances (1 gm of a Schedule IV substance = 0.125 gm of marihuana) and Schedule V substances (1 gm of a Schedule V substance = 0.0125 gm of marihuana). The amendment also adds a conversion for anabolic steroids consistent with their treatment in the Drug Quantity Table. In addition, the amendment adds footnotes to the Drug Equivalency Tables for Schedule I or II depressants and Schedule III, IV, and V substances to remove an ambiguity in guideline application by expressly limiting the combined equivalent weight of such substances to the marihuana amount consistent with the highest offense level for such substances provided in the Drug Quantity Table. <em>See</em> <em>United States v. Gurgliolo</em>, 894 F.2d 56 (3d Cir. 1990). The amendment inserts an additional listing under &quot;Secobarbital and Other Schedule I and II Depressants&quot; to reflect that glutethimide has been changed from a Schedule III to a Schedule II controlled substance under 21 C.F.R. §1308.12. In addition, the amendment simplifies the application of the Drug Equivalency Table by referencing the conversions to one substance (marihuana) rather than to four substances; the use of one referent rather than four makes no substantive change but will make the required computations easier and reduce the likelihood of computational error. Finally, the amendment sets forth the rationale for the Commission’s treatment of fewer than fifty marihuana plants.</p>

<p>The Commentary to §2D1.7 is amended by inserting the following at the end:</p>
<p>&quot;<em>Application Note</em>:</p>
<p>1. The typical case addressed by this guideline involves small-scale trafficking in drug paraphernalia (generally from a retail establishment that also sells items that are not unlawful). In a case involving a large-scale dealer, distributor, or manufacturer, an upward departure may be warranted. Conversely, where the offense was not committed for pecuniary gain (<em>e.g.</em>, transportation for the defendant’s personal use), a downward departure may be warranted.&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This amendment revises the title of the guideline to address the expanded coverage of the underlying statute, as amended by Section 2401 of the Crime Control Act of 1990 (Public Law 101-647), adds a cross reference to address cases in which the</p>
<p>underlying conduct involves a controlled substance offense, and adds an application note to specify the &quot;heartland&quot; types of cases addressed by the offense level set forth in the guideline.</p>

<p>&quot;2. By statute, a term of imprisonment imposed for this offense runs consecutively to any other term of imprisonment imposed. 18 U.S.C. § 3146(b)(1).&quot;;</p>
<p>by renumbering Note 3 as Note 2; and by inserting the following additional notes:</p>
<p>&quot;3. In the case of a failure to appear for service of sentence, any term of imprisonment imposed on the failure to appear count is to be imposed consecutively to any term of imprisonment imposed for the underlying offense. <em>See</em> §5G1.3(a). The guideline range for the failure to appear count is to be determined independently and the grouping rules of §§ 3D1.2-3D1.5 do not apply.</p>
<p>Otherwise, in the case of a conviction on both the underlying offense and the failure to appear, the failure to appear is treated under §3C1.1 (Obstructing or Impeding the Administration of Justice) as an obstruction of the underlying offense; and the failure to appear count and the count(s) for the underlying offense are grouped together under §3D1.2(c). Note that although 18 U.S.C. § 3146(b)(2) does not require a sentence of imprisonment on a failure to appear count, it does require that any sentence of imprisonment on a failure to appear count be imposed consecutively to any other sentence of imprisonment. Therefore, in such cases, the combined sentence must be constructed to provide a ‘total punishment’ that satisfies the requirements both of §5G1.2 (Sentencing on Multiple Counts of Conviction) and 18 U.S.C. § 3146(b)(2). For example, where the combined applicable guideline range for both counts is 30-37 months and the court determines a ‘total punishment’ of 36 months is appropriate, a sentence of thirty months for the underlying offense plus a consecutive six months sentence for the failure to appear count would satisfy these requirements.</p>
<p>4. In some cases, the defendant may be sentenced on the underlying offense (the offense in respect to which the defendant failed to appear) before being sentenced on the failure to appear offense. In such cases, criminal history points for the sentence imposed on the underlying offense are to be counted in determining the guideline range on the failure to appear offense only where the offense level is determined under subsection (a)(1) (<em>i.e.</em>, where the offense constituted a failure to report for service of sentence).&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This amendment inserts an application note (Note 3) to clarify the interaction of §§2J1.6, 3C1.1, 5G1.2, and 5G1.3; and inserts an application note (Note 4) to clarify the interaction of §§2J1.6 and 4A1.1.</p>

<p><strong>405.</strong> <strong>Amendment:</strong> The Commentary to §2K2.4 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended in Note 2 by deleting &quot;§2B3.1(b)(2)&quot; and inserting in lieu thereof &quot;§2B3.1(b)(2)(A)-(F)&quot;; and by inserting the following additional paragraphs at the end:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;<em>Provided</em>, that where the maximum of the guideline range from Chapter Five, Part A (Sentencing Table) determined by an offense level adjusted under the procedure described in the preceding paragraph, plus the term of imprisonment required under 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) or § 929(a), is less than the maximum of the guideline range that would apply to the underlying offense absent such adjustment, the procedure described in the preceding paragraph does not apply. Instead, the guideline range applicable to the underlying offense absent such adjustment is to be used after subtracting the term of imprisonment imposed under 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) or § 929(a) from both the minimum and maximum of such range.</p>
<p><em>Example</em>: A defendant, is to be sentenced under the robbery guideline; his unadjusted offense level from §2B3.1 is 30, including a 7-level enhancement for discharging a firearm; no Chapter Three adjustments are applicable; and his criminal history category is Category IV. His unadjusted guideline range from Chapter Five, Part A (Sentencing Table) is 135-168 months. This defendant has also been convicted under 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) arising from the possession of a weapon during the robbery, and therefore must be sentenced to an additional consecutive five-year term of imprisonment. The defendant’s adjusted guideline range, which takes into account the conviction under 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) by eliminating the 7-level weapon enhancement, is 70-87 months. Because the maximum of the defendant’s adjusted guideline range plus the five year consecutive sentence (87 months + 60 months = 147 months) is less than the maximum of the defendant’s unadjusted guideline range (168 months), the defendant is to be sentenced using the unadjusted guideline range after subtracting the 60 month sentence to be imposed under 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) from both the minimum and maximum of the unadjusted range (<em>e.g.</em>, 135 months - 60 months = 75 months; 168 months - 60 months = 108 months). A sentence imposed for the underlying offense using the guideline range determined in this manner (75-108 months) when combined with the consecutive sentence imposed under 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) or § 929(a), will produce the appropriate total term of imprisonment.&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This amendment provides an additional instruction for the determination of the offense level in cases in which the defendant is convicted under 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) or §929(a) in addition to a count for the offense in respect to which the firearm was used or possessed. The amendment is designed to prevent the anomalous result of the total punishment being less when there are convictions on both such counts than if the defendant was convicted only of the offense in respect to which the weapon was used or possessed.</p>

<p><strong>406.</strong> <strong>Amendment:</strong> The Commentary to §2P1.1 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended by inserting the following additional note:</p>

<p>&quot;6. If the adjustment in subsection (b)(1) applies as a result of conduct that involves an official victim, do not apply §3A1.2 (Official Victim).&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This amendment addresses the issue raised in <em>United States v. Dugan</em>, 912 F.2d 942 (8th Cir. 1990) concerning the interaction between §2P1.1(b)(1) and §3A1.2 by expressly providing that where an enhancement from subsection (b)(1) applies, §3A1.2 does not apply.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;difficulty of computing the tax loss, which may become the subject of protracted civil litigation. It is expected that the measure used will generally understate the tax due, and will not call for a sentence approaching the maximum unless very large incomes are involved.

<p>and inserting in lieu thereof:</p>
<p>&quot;potential difficulty of determining the amount of tax the taxpayer owed. It is expected that this alternative measure generally will understate the amount of tax owed&quot;.</p>

<p><strong>409.</strong> <strong>Amendment:</strong> Section 2T1.6 is amended by inserting the following additional subsection:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;(b) Cross Reference</p>
<p>(1) Where the offense involved embezzlement by withholding tax from an employee’s earnings and willfully failing to account to the employee for it, apply §2B1.1 (Larceny, Embezzlement, and Other Forms of Theft) if the resulting offense level is greater than that determined above.&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §2T1.6 captioned &quot;Application Note&quot; is amended in Note 1 by deleting &quot;In such instances, an upward departure may be warranted&quot; and inserting in lieu thereof &quot;Subsection (b)(1) addresses such cases&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This amendment replaces the recommendation in the commentary of this guideline concerning consideration of an upward departure where the court finds that the offense involved embezzlement of an employee’s funds with a cross reference that provides for the application of §2B1.1 (Larceny, Embezzlement, and Other Forms of Theft) in such cases where that guideline results in the greater offense level.</p>

<p><strong>410.</strong> <strong>Amendment:</strong> Section 2T3.1(a) is amended by deleting &quot;Level from §2T4.1 (Tax Table) corresponding to the tax loss.&quot; and inserting in lieu thereof:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;(1) The level from §2T4.1 (Tax Table) corresponding to the tax loss, if the tax loss exceeded $1,000; or</p>

<p>(3) 4, if the tax loss did not exceed $100.&quot;.</p>

<p>(1) If sophisticated means were used to impede discovery of the nature or existence of the offense, increase by 2 levels.&quot;.</p>
<p>Section 2T3.2(a) is amended by deleting &quot;Level from §2T4.1 (Tax Table) corresponding to the tax loss.&quot; and inserting in lieu thereof:</p>

<p>&quot;(b) Specific Offense Characteristic</p>
<p>(1) If sophisticated means were used to impede discovery of the nature or existence of the offense, increase by 2 levels.&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This amendment lowers the offense level for the least serious offenses (evasion of import duty of $1,000 or less without use of sophisticated means) to provide an offense level equal to the offense level for theft of the same amount without more than minimal planning. In addition, it adds an adjustment for &quot;sophisticated means&quot; to conform with other tax evasion guidelines (<em>e.g.</em>, §2T1.1).</p>

<p>&quot;<em>Application Note</em>:</p>
<p>1. Guidelines and policy statements that can be applied meaningfully in the absence of a Chapter Two offense guideline include: §5B1.3 (Conditions of Probation); §5B1.4 (Recommended Conditions of Probation and Supervised Release); §5D1.1 (Imposition of a Term of Supervised Release); §5D1.2 (Term of Supervised Release); §5D1.3 (Conditions of Supervised Release); §5E1.1 (Restitution); §5E1.3 (Special Assessments); §5E1.4 (Forfeiture); Chapter Five, Part F (Sentencing Options); §5G1.3 (Imposition of a Sentence on a Defendant Subject to an Undischarged Term of Imprisonment); Chapter Five, Part H (Specific Offender Characteristics); Chapter Five, Part J (Relief from Disability); Chapter Five, Part K (Departures); Chapter Six, Part A (Sentencing Procedures); Chapter Six, Part B (Plea Agreements).&quot;.</p>

<p>&quot; The sentencing guidelines apply to convictions under 18 U.S.C. § 13 (Assimilative Crimes Act) and 18 U.S.C. § 1153 (Indian Major Crimes Act); <em>see</em> 18 U.S.C. § 3551(a), as amended by section 1602 of Public Law 101-647.&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This amendment inserts an application note to clarify that, in the case of an offense for which there is no sufficiently analogous offense guideline, any guidelines and policy statements that can be meaningfully applied in the absence of a Chapter Two offense guideline remain applicable. This amendment also clarifies the applicability of the sentencing guidelines to convictions under 18 U.S.C. §§ 13 (Assimilative Crimes Act) and 1153 (Indian Major Crimes Act). Section 1602 of the Crime Control Act of 1990 (Public Law 101-647) resolved this issue by amending 18 U.S.C. § 3551(a) to provide expressly that Chapter 227 of Title 18, United States Code (including the sentencing guidelines) applies to convictions under these statutes.</p>

<p>&quot;For offenses in which there are no identifiable victims (<em>e.g.</em>, drug or immigration offenses, where society at large is the victim), the ‘victim’ for purposes of subsections (a) and (b) is the societal interest that is harmed. In such cases, the counts are grouped together when the societal interests that are harmed are closely related. Where one count, for example, involves unlawfully entering the United States and the other involves possession of fraudulent evidence of citizenship, the counts are grouped together because the societal interests harmed (the interests protected by laws governing immigration) are closely related. In contrast, where one count involves the sale of controlled substances and the other involves an immigration law violation, the counts are not grouped together because different societal interests are harmed.&quot;;</p>
<p>and by deleting the last sentence as follows:</p>
<p>&quot;Thus, for so-called ‘victimless’ crimes (crimes in which society at large is the victim), the grouping decision must be based primarily upon the nature of the interest invaded by each offense.&quot;.</p>

<p>and inserting in lieu thereof:</p>
<p>&quot;The base offense level is 6; 1 level is added because of the value of the property (§2F1.1(b)(1)); and 2 levels are added because the conduct involved repeated acts with some planning (§2F1.1(b)(2)(A)). The resulting offense level is 9.&quot;.</p>

<p>&quot;(c) Special Instruction for Fines - Organizations</p>
<p>(1) In lieu of the pecuniary loss under subsection (a)(3) of §8C2.4 (Base Fine), use the greatest of: (A) the value of the unlawful payment; (B) if a bribe, the value of the benefit received or to be received in return for the unlawful payment; or (C) if a bribe, the consequential damages resulting from the unlawful payment.&quot;.</p>
<p>Section 2E5.6 is amended by inserting the following additional subsection:</p>
<p>&quot;(c) Special Instruction for Fines - Organizations</p>
<p>(1) In lieu of the pecuniary loss under subsection (a)(3) of §8C2.4 (Base Fine), use the greatest of: (A) the value of the unlawful payment; (B) if a bribe, the value of the benefit received or to be received in return for the unlawful payment; or (C) if a bribe, the consequential damages resulting from the unlawful payment.&quot;.</p>
<p>Section 2R1.1 is amended by inserting the following additional subsection:</p>
<p>&quot;(d) Special Instructions for Fines - Organizations</p>
<p>(1) In lieu of the pecuniary loss under subsection (a)(3) of §8C2.4 (Base Fine), use 20 percent of the volume of affected commerce.</p>
<p>(2) When applying §8C2.6 (Minimum and Maximum Multipliers), neither the minimum nor maximum multiplier shall be less than 0.75.</p>
<p>(3) In a bid-rigging case in which the organization submitted one or more complementary bids, use as the organization’s volume of commerce the greater of (A) the volume of commerce done by the organization in the goods or services that were affected by the violation, or (B) the largest contract on which the organization submitted a complementary bid in connection with the bid-rigging conspiracy.&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §2R1.1 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended by deleting:</p>
<p>&quot;3. In setting the fine for an organization, the court should consider whether the organization encouraged or took steps to prevent the violation, whether high-level management was aware of the violation, and whether the organization previously engaged in antitrust violations.&quot;,</p>
<p>and inserting in lieu thereof:</p>
<p>&quot;3. The fine for an organization is determined by applying Chapter Eight (Sentencing of Organizations). In selecting a fine for an organization within the guideline fine range, the court should consider both the gain to the organization from the offense and the loss caused by the organization. It is estimated that the average gain from price-fixing is 10 percent of the selling price. The loss from price-fixing exceeds the gain because, among other things, injury is inflicted upon consumers who are unable or for other reasons do not buy the product at the higher prices. Because the loss from price-fixing exceeds the gain, subsection (d)(1) provides that 20 percent of the volume of affected commerce is to be used in lieu of the pecuniary loss under §8C2.4(a)(3). The purpose for specifying a percent of the volume of commerce is to avoid the time and expense that would be required for the court to determine the actual gain or loss. In cases in which the actual monopoly overcharge appears to be either substantially more or substantially less than 10 percent, this factor should be considered in setting the fine within the guideline fine range.&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §2R1.1 captioned &quot;Background&quot; is amended by deleting the last paragraph as follows:</p>
<p>&quot; Substantial fines are an essential part of the sanction. It is estimated that the average additional profit attributable to price fixing is 10 percent of the selling price. The Commission has specified that a fine from two to five times that amount be imposed on organi­zational defendants as a deterrent because of the difficulty in identifying violators. Addi­tional monetary penalties can be provided through private treble damage actions. A lower fine is specified for individuals. The Commission believes that most antitrust defendants have the resources and earning capacity to pay these fines, at least over time. The statutory maximum fine is $250,000 for individuals and $1,000,000 for organizations, but is increased when there are convictions on multiple counts.&quot;,</p>
<p>and inserting in lieu thereof:</p>
<p>&quot; Substantial fines are an essential part of the sentence. For an individual, the guideline fine range is from one to five percent of the volume of commerce, but not less than $20,000. For an organization, the guideline fine range is determined under Chapter Eight (Sentencing of Organizations), but pursuant to subsection (d)(2), the minimum multiplier is at least 0.75. This multiplier, which requires a minimum fine of 15 percent of the volume of commerce for the least serious case, was selected to provide an effective deterrent to antitrust offenses. At the same time, this minimum multiplier maintains incentives for desired organizational behavior. Because the Department of Justice has a well-established amnesty program for organizations that self-report antitrust offenses, no lower minimum multiplier is needed as an incentive for self-reporting. A minimum multiplier of at least 0.75 ensures that fines imposed in antitrust cases will exceed the average monopoly overcharge.</p>
<p>The Commission believes that most antitrust defendants have the resources and earning capacity to pay the fines called for by this guideline, at least over time on an installment basis. The statutory maximum fine is $350,000 for individuals and $10,000,000 for organizations, but is increased when there are convictions on multiple counts.&quot;.</p>
<p>Section 2S1.1 is amended by inserting the following additional subsection:</p>
<p>&quot;(c) Special Instruction for Fines - Organizations</p>
<p>(1) In lieu of the applicable amount from the table in subsection (d) of §8C2.4 (Base Fine), use:</p>
<p>(A) the greater of $250,000 or 100 percent of the value of the funds if subsections (a)(1) and (b)(1) are used to determine the offense level; or</p>
<p>(B) the greater of $200,000 or 70 percent of the value of the funds if subsections (a)(2) and (b)(1) are used to determine the offense level; or</p>
<p>(C) the greater of $200,000 or 70 percent of the value of the funds if subsection (a)(1) but not (b)(1) is used to determine the offense level; or</p>
<p>(D) the greater of $150,000 or 50 percent of the value of the funds if subsection (a)(2) but not (b)(1) is used to determine the offense level.&quot;.</p>

<p>&quot;(c) Special Instruction for Fines - Organizations</p>

<p>(A) the greater of $175,000 or 60 percent of the value of the funds if subsection (b)(1)(A) is used to determine the offense level; or</p>
<p>(B) the greater of $150,000 or 50 percent of the value of the funds if subsection (b)(1)(B) is used to determine the offense level.&quot;.</p>
<p>Section 2S1.3 is amended by inserting the following additional subsection:</p>
<p>&quot;(c) Special Instruction for Fines - Organizations</p>
<p>(1) In lieu of the applicable amount from the table in subsection (d) of §8C2.4 (Base Fine), use:</p>
<p>(A) the greater of $125,000 or 30 percent of the value of the funds if subsections (a)(1) and (b)(1) are used to determine the offense level; or</p>
<p>(B) the greater of $50,000 or 20 percent of the value of the funds if subsection (a)(1) but not (b)(1) are used to determine the offense level.&quot;.</p>
<p>Section 2S1.4 is amended by inserting the following additional subsection:</p>
<p>&quot;(c) Special Instruction for Fines - Organizations</p>
<p>(1) In lieu of the applicable amount from the table in subsection (d) of §8C2.4 (Base Fine), use:</p>

The appellate review provisions of the Act, however, authorize appeals of occupational restrictions that deviate from the minimum and maximum limitations ‘established in the <em>guideline</em>’ (emphasis added).&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This amendment deletes an outdated paragraph. Section 7103(b)(3) of Public Law 100-690 amended 28 U.S.C. § 994 by adding subsection (a)(1)(E), which expressly authorizes the Commission to promulgate guidelines addressing occupational restrictions as a condition of probation or supervised release.</p>

<p><strong>429.</strong> <strong>Amendment:</strong> The Commentary to §1B1.5 captioned &quot;Application Note&quot; is amended in Note 1 by deleting &quot;2D1.2(a)(1), 2H1.2(a)(2)&quot; and inserting in lieu thereof &quot;2D1.2(a)(1), (2), and 2H1.1(a)(2)&quot;; by deleting &quot;§§2A4.1(b)(5)(B), 2Q1.2(b)(5)&quot; and inserting in lieu thereof &quot;§2A4.1(b)(7)&quot;; and by inserting the following additional paragraph:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;A reference may also be to a specific subsection of another guideline; <em>e.g.</em>, the reference in §2D1.10(a)(1) to ‘3 plus the offense level from the Drug Quantity Table in §2D1.1’. In such case, only the specific subsection of that other guideline is used.&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §1B1.5 captioned &quot;Application Note&quot; is amended by inserting the following additional notes:</p>
<p>&quot;2. A reference may require that the offense level be determined under another offense guideline. In such case, the adjustments in Chapter Three, Parts A (Victim-Related Adjustments), B (Role in the Offense), and E (Acceptance of Responsibility) are also to be determined in respect to that other offense guideline. For example, a defendant convicted of possession of a firearm by a felon, to which §2K2.1 (Unlawful Receipt, Possession, or Transportation of Firearms or Ammunition; Prohibited Transactions Involving Firearms or Ammunition) applies, is found to have used that firearm in the commission of a robbery. The cross reference at §2K2.1(c) directs that the robbery offense guideline be used. The adjustments in Chapter Three, Parts A, B and E are to be applied as if the offense of conviction had directly referenced the robbery guideline.</p>
<p>3. A reference to another guideline may direct that such reference is to be used only if it results in a greater offense level. In such cases, the greater offense level means the greater final offense level (<em>i.e.</em>, the greater offense level taking into account both the Chapter Two offense level and any applicable Chapter Three adjustments). Although the offense guideline that results in the greater offense level under Chapter Two will most frequently result in the greater final offense level, this will not always be the case. If, for example, a role or abuse of trust adjustment applies to the cross-referenced offense guideline, but not to the guideline initially applied, the greater Chapter Two offense level may not necessarily result in a greater final offense level.</p>
<p>4. A reference may direct that, if the conduct involved another offense, the offense guideline for such other offense is to be applied. Where there is more than one such other offense, the most serious such offense (or group of closely-related offenses in the case of offenses that would be grouped together under §3D1.2(d)) is to be used. For example, if a defendant convicted of possession of a firearm by a felon, to which §2K2.1 (Unlawful Receipt, Possession, or Transportation of Firearms or Ammunition; Prohibited Transactions Involving Firearms or Ammunition) applies, is found to have possessed that firearm during commission of a series of offenses, the cross reference at §2K2.1(c) is applied to the offense resulting in the greatest offense level.&quot;;</p>

<p><strong>430.</strong> <strong>Amendment:</strong> The Commentary to §2H1.1 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended by inserting the following additional paragraph as the first paragraph of Note 1:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;‘Underlying offense,’ as used in this guideline, includes any offense under federal, state, or local law other than an offense that is itself covered under Chapter Two, Part H, Subpart 1, 2, or 4. For example, in the case of a conspiracy to interfere with a person’s civil rights (a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 241) that involved an aggravated assault (the use of force) to deny certain rights or benefits in furtherance of discrimination (a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 245), the underlying offense in respect to both the violation of 18 U.S.C. § 241 (to which §2H1.1 applies) and the violation of 18 U.S.C. § 245 (to which §2H1.3 applies) would be the aggravated assault.&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §2H1.1 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended in Note 1 by inserting the following additional paragraph at the end:</p>
<p>&quot;In certain cases, the count of which the defendant is convicted may set forth conduct that constitutes more than one underlying offense (<em>e.g.</em>, two instances of assault, or one instance of assault and one instance of arson). In such cases, determine the offense level for the underlying offense by treating each underlying offense as if contained in a separate count of conviction. To determine which of the alternative base offense levels (<em>e.g.</em>, §2H1.1(a)(1) or (a)(2)) results in the greater offense level, apply Chapter Three, Parts A, B, C, and D to each alternative base offense level. Use whichever results in the greater offense level. Example: The defendant is convicted of one count of conspiracy to violate civil rights that included two level 12 underlying offenses (of a type not grouped together under Chapter Three, Part D). No adjustment from Chapter Three, Parts A, B, or C applies. The base offense level from §2H1.1(a)(1) is 15. The offense level for each underlying offense from §2H1.1(a)(2) is 14 (2 + 12). Under Chapter Three, Part D (Multiple Counts), the two level 14 underlying offenses result in a combined offense level of 16. This offense level is greater than the alternative base offense level of 15 under §2H1.1(a)(1). Therefore, the case is treated as if there were two counts, one for each underlying offense, with a base offense level under §2H1.1(a)(2) of 14 for each underlying offense.&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §2H1.1 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended in the first sentence of the second paragraph of Note 1 (formerly the first paragraph) by deleting &quot;contained in the particular guideline in Chapter Two) for any underlying criminal conduct&quot; and inserting in lieu thereof &quot;and cross references) from the offense guideline in Chapter Two that most closely corresponds to the underlying offense&quot;; in the last sentence of the second paragraph of Note 1 (formerly the first paragraph) by deleting &quot;an offense&quot; and &quot;that offense&quot; and inserting in lieu thereof &quot;arson&quot; in each instance.</p>

</blockquote>
<p><strong>431.</strong> <strong>Amendment:</strong> The Commentary to §2J1.7 captioned &quot;Background&quot; is amended by deleting the first paragraph as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;An enhancement under 18 U.S.C. § 3147 may be imposed only upon application of the government; it cannot be imposed on the court’s own motion. In this respect, it is similar to a separate count of conviction and, for this reason, is placed in Chapter Two of the guidelines.&quot;,</p>
<p>and inserting in lieu thereof:</p>
<p>&quot;An enhancement under 18 U.S.C. § 3147 may be imposed only after sufficient notice to the defendant by the government or the court, and applies only in the case of a conviction for a federal offense that is committed while on release on another federal charge.&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This amendment corrects the description in the Background Commentary of the operation of the statute to which this guideline applies.</p>

<p><strong>432.</strong> <strong>Amendment:</strong> The Commentary to §2N2.1 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended in Note 1 by inserting &quot;or reckless&quot; immediately before &quot;conduct&quot;.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Commentary to §2N2.1 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended in Note 4 by deleting &quot;anabolic steroids&quot; and inserting in lieu thereof &quot;human growth hormones&quot;, and by inserting at the end:</p>
<p>&quot;Offenses involving anabolic steroids are covered by Chapter Two, Part D (Offenses Involving Drugs). In the case of an offense involving a substance purported to be an anabolic steroid, but not containing any active ingredient, apply §2F1.1 (Fraud and Deceit) with ‘loss’ measured by the amount paid, or to be paid, by the victim for such substance.&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This amendment clarifies Application Note 1 with respect to reckless conduct, conforms Application Note 4 to reflect that offenses involving anabolic steroids will be covered under §2D1.1 (Amendment 369), and clarifies the treatment of an offense involving a substance purported to be an anabolic steroid, but containing no active ingredient.</p>

<p>&quot;Under this section, the conduct of which the defendant was convicted is the focus of inquiry.</p>
<p>The term ‘crime of violence’ does not include the offense of unlawful possession of a firearm by a felon. Where the instant offense is the unlawful possession of a firearm by a felon, the specific offense characteristics of §2K2.1 (Unlawful Receipt, Possession, or Transportation of Firearms or Ammunition; Prohibited Transactions Involving Firearms or Ammunition) provide an increase in offense level if the defendant has one or more prior felony convictions for a crime of violence or controlled substance offense; and, if the defendant is sentenced under the provisions of 18 U.S.C. § 924(e), §4B1.4 (Armed Career Criminal) will apply.&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §4B1.2 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended in Note 2 by inserting &quot;(including any explosive material or destructive device)&quot; immediately following &quot;explosives&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §4B1.2 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended in Note 3 by inserting the following additional sentences at the end:</p>
<p>&quot;A conviction for an offense committed at age eighteen or older is an adult conviction. A conviction for an offense committed prior to age eighteen is an adult conviction if it is classified as an adult conviction under the laws of the jurisdiction in which the defendant was convicted (<em>e.g.</em>, a federal conviction for an offense committed prior to the defendant’s eighteenth birthday is an adult conviction if the defendant was expressly proceeded against as an adult).&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This amendment clarifies that the application of §4B1.2 is determined by the offense of conviction (<em>i.e.</em>, the conduct charged in the count of which the defendant was convicted); clarifies that the offense of unlawful possession of a weapon is not a crime of violence for the purposes of this section; clarifies the definition of a prior adult conviction; makes the definitions in §4B1.2(2) more comprehensive; and clarifies the application of §4B1.2(3) by specifying the particular provisions of Chapter Four, Part A to which this subsection refers.</p>

<p>The Commentary to §1B1.3 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended by renumbering Notes 2-7 as Notes 3-8, respectively; and by deleting Note 1 as follows:</p>
<p>&quot;1. Conduct ‘for which the defendant would be otherwise accountable,’ as used in subsection (a)(1), includes conduct that the defendant counseled, commanded, induced, procured, or willfully caused. (<em>Cf</em>. 18 U.S.C. § 2.) In the case of criminal activity undertaken in concert with others, whether or not charged as a conspiracy, the conduct for which the defendant ‘would be otherwise accountable’ also includes conduct of others in furtherance of the execution of the jointly-undertaken criminal activity that was reasonably foreseeable by the defendant. Because a count may be broadly worded and include the conduct of many participants over a substantial period of time, the scope of the jointly-undertaken criminal activity, and hence relevant conduct, is not necessarily the same for every participant. Where it is established that the conduct was neither within the scope of the defendant’s agreement, nor was reasonably foreseeable in connection with the criminal activity the defendant agreed to jointly undertake, such conduct is not included in establishing the defendant’s offense level under this guideline.</p>
<p>In the case of solicitation, misprision, or accessory after the fact, the conduct for which the defendant ‘would be otherwise accountable’ includes all conduct relevant to determining the offense level for the underlying offense that was known, or reasonably should have been known, by the defendant.</p>
<p><em>Illustrations of Conduct for Which the Defendant is Accountable</em></p>
<p>a. Defendant A, one of ten off-loaders hired by Defendant B, was convicted of importation of marihuana, as a result of his assistance in off-loading a boat containing a one-ton shipment of marihuana. Regardless of the number of bales of marihuana that he actually unloaded, and notwithstanding any claim on his part that he was neither aware of, nor could reasonably foresee, that the boat contained this quantity of marihuana, Defendant A is held accountable for the entire one-ton quantity of marihuana on the boat because he aided and abetted the unloading, and hence the importation, of the entire shipment.</p>
<p>b. Defendant C, the getaway driver in an armed bank robbery in which $15,000 is taken and a teller is injured, is convicted of the substantive count of bank robbery. Defendant C is accountable for the money taken because he aided and abetted the taking of the money. He is accountable for the injury inflicted because he participated in concerted criminal conduct that he could reasonably foresee might result in the infliction of injury.</p>
