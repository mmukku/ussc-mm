<p>For amendments effective after November 1, 1997, <em>see</em> Appendix C, Volume II.</p>
<p>The format under which the amendments are presented in this Appendix is designed to facilitate a comparison between previously existing and amended provisions, in the event it becomes necessary to reference the former guideline, policy statement, or commentary language.</p>
<p><strong>AMENDMENTS</strong></p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> <strong>Amendment:</strong> Section 1B1.1(b) is amended by inserting &quot;in the order listed&quot; immediately following &quot;Chapter Two&quot;.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Section 1B1.1(d) is amended by deleting &quot;one&quot; and &quot;three&quot; and inserting in lieu thereof &quot;(a)&quot; and &quot;(c)&quot; respectively.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §1B1.1 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended by inserting the following additional note:</p>
<p>&quot;4. The offense level adjustments from more than one specific offense characteristic within an offense guideline are cumulative (added together) unless the guideline specifies that only the greater (or greatest) is to be used. Within each specific offense characteristic subsection, however, the offense level adjustments are alternative; only the one that best describes the conduct is to be used. <em>E.g.</em>, in §2A2.2(b)(3), pertaining to degree of bodily injury, the subsection that best</p>
<p>describes the level of bodily injury is used; the adjustments for different degrees of bodily injury (subsections (A), (B), and (C)) are not added together.&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> The purposes of this amendment are to correct a clerical error and to clarify the operation of the guidelines by consolidating the former §1B1.4 (Determining the Offense Level) with this section.</p>
<p><strong>Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is January 15, 1988. </strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>2.</strong> <strong>Amendment:</strong> Section 1B1.2(a) is amended by deleting &quot;guideline&quot; the first time it appears and inserting in lieu thereof &quot;offense guideline section&quot;.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Section 1B1.2(a) is amended by inserting the following additional sentence at the end of the subsection: &quot;Similarly, stipulations to additional offenses are treated as if the defendant had been convicted of separate counts charging those offenses.&quot;.</p>
<p>Section 1B1.2(b) is amended by deleting:</p>
<p>&quot;The court shall determine any applicable specific offense characteristic, victim-related adjustment, or departure from the guidelines attributable to offense conduct, according to the principles in §1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct).&quot;,</p>
<p>and inserting in lieu thereof:</p>
<p>&quot;After determining the appropriate offense guideline section pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, determine the applicable guideline range in accordance with §1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct).&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §1B1.2 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended in Note 2 by deleting:</p>
<p>&quot;any applicable victim-related adjustment from Chapter Three, Part A, and any guideline departures attributable to the offense conduct from Chapter Five, Part K, using a ‘relevant conduct’ standard, as that standard is defined in §1B1.3.&quot;,</p>
<p>and inserting in lieu thereof:</p>
<p>&quot;and any other applicable sentencing factors pursuant to the relevant conduct definition in §1B1.3.&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §1B1.2 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended in Note 3 by deleting:</p>
<p>&quot;In such instances, the court should consider all conduct, circumstances, and injury relevant to the offense (as well as all relevant offender characteristics). <em>See</em> §1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct).&quot;,</p>
<p>and inserting in lieu thereof:</p>
<p>&quot;<em>See</em> §§1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct) and 1B1.4 (Information to be Used in Imposing Sentence).&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> The purposes of this amendment are to correct a clerical error and to clarify the operation of the guidelines.</p>
<p><strong>Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is January 15, 1988.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>3.</strong> <strong>Amendment:</strong> Chapter One, Part B is amended by deleting §1B1.3 in its entirety as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;§1B1.3. <em>Relevant Conduct</em></p>
<p>To determine the seriousness of the offense conduct, all conduct, circumstances, and injuries relevant to the offense of conviction shall be taken into account.</p>
<p>(a) Unless otherwise specified under the guidelines, conduct and circumstances relevant to the offense of conviction means:</p>
<p>acts or omissions committed or aided and abetted by the defendant, or by a person for whose conduct the defendant is legally accountable, that (1) are part of the same course of conduct, or a common scheme or plan, as the offense of conviction, or (2) are relevant to the defendant’s state of mind or motive in committing the offense of conviction, or (3) indicate the defendant’s degree of dependence upon criminal activity for a livelihood.</p>
<p>(b) Injury relevant to the offense of conviction means harm which is caused intentionally, recklessly or by criminal negligence in the course of conduct relevant to the offense of conviction.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Commentary</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Application Note</em>:</p>
<p>1. In sentencing, the court should consider all relevant offense and offender characteristics. For purposes of assessing offense conduct, the relevant conduct and circumstances of the offense of conviction are as follows:</p>
<p>a. conduct directed toward preparation for or commission of the offense of conviction, and efforts to avoid detection and responsibility for the offense of conviction;</p>
<p>b. conduct indicating that the offense of conviction was to some degree part of a broader purpose, scheme, or plan;</p>
<p>c. conduct that is relevant to the state of mind or motive of the defendant in committing the crime;</p>
<p>d. conduct that is relevant to the defendant’s involvement in crime as a livelihood.</p>
<p>The first three criteria are derived from two sources, Rule 8(a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, governing joinder of similar or related offenses, and Rule 404(b) of the Federal Rules of Evidence, permitting admission of evidence of other crimes to establish motive, intent, plan, and common scheme. These rules provide standards that govern consideration at trial of crimes &quot;of the same or similar character,&quot; and utilize concepts and terminology familiar to judges, prosecutors, and defenders. The governing standard should be liberally construed in favor of considering information generally appropriate to sentencing. When other crimes are inadmissible under the Rule 404(b) standard, such crimes may not be &quot;relevant to the offense of conviction&quot; under the criteria that determine this question for purposes of Chapter Two; such crimes would, however, be considered in determining the relevant offender characteristics to the extent authorized by Chapter Three (Adjustments), and Chapter Four (Criminal History and Criminal Livelihood) and Chapter Five, Part H (Specific Offender Characteristics). This construction is consistent with the existing rule that &quot;[n]o limitation shall be placed on the information concerning the background, character, and conduct of a person convicted of an offense . . . for the purpose of imposing an appropriate sentence,&quot; 18 U.S.C. § 3577, so long as the information &quot;has sufficient indicia of reliability to support its probable accuracy.&quot; <em>United States v. Marshall</em>, 519 F. Supp. 751 (D. Wis. 1981), <em>aff’d</em>, 719 F.2d 887 (7th Cir. 1983).</p>
<p>The last of these criteria is intended to ensure that a judge may consider at sentencing, information that, although not specifically within other criteria of relevance, indicates that the defendant engages in crime for a living. Inclusion of this information in sentencing considerations is consistent with 28 U.S.C. § 994(d)(11).&quot;.</p>
<p>A replacement guideline with accompanying commentary is inserted as §1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct (Factors that Determine the Guideline Range)).</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> The purpose of this amendment is to clarify the guideline. The amended language restates the intent of §1B1.3 as originally promulgated.</p>
<p><strong>Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is January 15, 1988. </strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>4.</strong> <strong>Amendment:</strong> Chapter One, Part B is amended by deleting §1B1.4 in its entirety as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;§1B1.4. <em>Determining the Offense Level</em></p>
<p>In determining the offense level:</p>
<p>(a) determine the base offense level from Chapter Two;</p>
<p>(b) make any applicable adjustments for specific offense characteristics from Chapter Two <em>in the order listed</em>;</p>
<p>(c) make any applicable adjustments from Chapter Three;</p>
<p>(d) make any applicable adjustments from Chapter Four, Part B (Career Offenders and Criminal Livelihood).</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Commentary</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Application Notes</em>:</p>
<p>1. A particular guideline (in the base offense level or in a specific offense characteristic) may expressly direct that a particular factor be applied only if the defendant was convicted of a particular statute. <em>E.g.</em>, in §2K2.3, a base offense level of 12 is used &quot;if convicted under 26 U.S.C. § 5861.&quot; Unless such an express direction is included, conviction under the statute is not required. Thus, use of a statutory reference to describe a particular set of circumstances does not require a conviction under the referenced statute. Examples of this usage are found in §2K1.3(b)(4) (&quot;if the defendant was a person prohibited from receiving explosives under 18 U.S.C. § 842(i), or if the defendant knowingly distributed explosives to a person prohibited from receiving explosives under 18 U.S.C. § 842(i), increase by 10 levels&quot;); and §2A3.4(b)(2) (&quot;if the abusive contact was accomplished as defined in 18 U.S.C. § 2242, increase by 4 levels&quot;). In such cases, the particular circumstances described are to be evaluated under the &quot;relevant conduct&quot; standard of §1B1.3.</p>
<p>2. Once the appropriate base offense level is determined, all specific offense characteristics are to be applied in the order listed.</p>
<p>3. The offense level adjustments from more than one specific offense characteristic within an offense guideline are cumulative (added together) unless the guideline specifies that only the greater (or greatest) is to be used. Within each specific offense characteristic subsection, however, the offense level adjustments are alternative; only the one that best describes the conduct is to be used. <em>E.g</em>., in §2A2.2(b)(3), pertaining to degree of bodily injury, the subsection that best describes the level of bodily injury is used; the adjustments from different degrees of bodily injury (subsections (A), (B) and (C)) are not added together).</p>
<p>4. The adjustments in Chapter Three that may apply include Part A (Victim-Related Adjustments), Part B (Role in the Offense), Part C (Obstruction), Part D (Multiple Counts), and Part E (Acceptance of Responsibility).&quot;.</p>
<p>A replacement guideline with accompanying commentary is inserted as §1B1.4 (Information to be Used in Imposing Sentence (Selecting a Point Within the Guideline Range or Departing from the Guidelines)).</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> The purposes of this amendment are to remove material made redundant by the reorganization of this Part and to replace it with material that clarifies the operation of the guidelines. The material formerly in this section is now covered by §1B1.1.</p>
<p><strong>Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is January 15, 1988.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>5.</strong> <strong>Amendment:</strong> Chapter One, Part B, is amended by inserting an additional guideline with accompanying commentary as §1B1.8 (Use of Certain Information).</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> The purpose of this amendment is to facilitate cooperation agreements by ensuring that certain information revealed by a defendant, as part of an agreement to cooperate with the government by providing information concerning unlawful activities of others, will not be used to increase the guideline sentence.</p>
<p><strong>Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is June 15, 1988.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>6.</strong> <strong>Amendment:</strong> Chapter One, Part B, is amended by inserting an additional guideline with accompanying commentary as §1B1.9 (Petty Offenses).</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> The purpose of this guideline is to delete coverage of petty offenses.</p>
<p><strong>Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is June 15, 1988.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>7.</strong> <strong>Amendment:</strong> Section 2B1.1(b)(1) is amended by deleting &quot;value of the property taken&quot; and inserting in lieu thereof &quot;loss&quot;.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Commentary to §2B1.1 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended in Note 2 by deleting:</p>
<p>&quot;Loss is to be based upon replacement cost to the victim or market value of the property, whichever is greater.&quot;,</p>
<p>and inserting in lieu thereof:</p>
<p>&quot;‘Loss’ means the value of the property taken, damaged, or destroyed. Ordinarily, when property is taken or destroyed the loss is the fair market value of the particular property at issue. Where the market value is difficult to ascertain or inadequate to measure harm to the victim, the court may measure loss in some other way, such as reasonable replacement cost to the victim. When property is damaged the loss is the cost of repairs, not to exceed the loss had the property been destroyed. In cases of partially completed conduct, the loss is to be determined in accordance with the provisions of §2X1.1 (Attempt, Solicitation, or Conspiracy Not Covered by a Specific Guideline). <em>E.g.</em>, in the case of the theft of a government check or money order, loss refers to the loss that would have occurred if the check or money order had been cashed. Similarly, if a defendant is apprehended in the process of taking a vehicle, the loss refers to the value of the vehicle even if the vehicle is recovered immediately.&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> The purpose of this amendment is to clarify the guideline in respect to the determination of loss.</p>
<p><strong>Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is June 15, 1988.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>8.</strong> <strong>Amendment:</strong> Section 2B1.2 is amended by transposing the texts of subsections (b)(2) and (3).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Commentary to §2B1.2 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended by deleting:</p>
<p>&quot;3. For consistency with §2B1.1, it is the Commission’s intent that specific offense characteristic (b)(3) be applied before (b)(2).&quot;,</p>
<p>and by renumbering Note 4 as Note 3.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> The purpose of this amendment is to correct a clerical error in the guideline. Correction of the error makes the deleted commentary unnecessary.</p>
<p><strong>Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is January 15, 1988.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>9.</strong> <strong>Amendment:</strong> Section 2B1.2(b)(1) is amended by deleting &quot;taken&quot;, and inserting &quot;stolen&quot; immediately before &quot;property&quot;.</p>
<blockquote>

<p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> <strong>The effective date of this amendment is June 15, 1988.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>10.</strong> <strong>Amendment:</strong> Section 2B1.3(b)(1) is amended by deleting &quot;amount of the property damage or destruction, or the cost of restoration,&quot; and inserting in lieu thereof &quot;loss&quot;.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&quot;§2X5.1. <em>Other Offenses</em> (Policy Statement)</p>
<p>For offenses for which no specific guideline has been promulgated:</p>
<p>(a) If the offense is a felony or class A misdemeanor, the most analogous guideline should be applied. If no sufficiently analogous guideline exists, any sentence that is reasonable and consistent with the purposes of sentencing should be imposed. <em>See</em> 18 U.S.C. § 3553(b).</p>
<p>(b) If the offense is a Class B or C misdemeanor or an infraction, any sentence that is reasonable and consistent with the purpose of sentencing should be imposed. <em>See</em> 18 U.S.C. § 3553(b).</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Commentary</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Background</em>: This policy statement addresses cases in which a defendant has been convicted of an offense for which no specific guideline has been written. For a felony or a class A misdemeanor (<em>see</em> 18 U.S.C. §§ 3559(a) and 3581(b)), the court is directed to apply the most analogous guideline. If no sufficiently analogous guideline exists, the court is directed to sentence without reference to a specific guideline or guideline range, as provided in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(b).</p>
<p>For a class B or C misdemeanor or an infraction (<em>see</em> 18 U.S.C. §§ 3559(a) and 3581(b)) that is not covered by a specific guideline, the court is directed to sentence without reference to a specific guideline or guideline range, as provided in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(b). An inquiry as to whether there is a sufficiently analogous guideline that might be applied is not required. The Commission makes this distinction in treatment because for many lesser offenses (<em>e.g.</em>, traffic infractions), generally handled under assimilative offense provisions by magistrates, there will be no sufficiently analogous guideline, and a case-by-case determination in respect to this issue for the high volume of cases processed each year would be unduly burdensome and would not significantly reduce disparity.&quot;.</p>
<p>A replacement guideline with accompanying commentary is inserted as §2X5.1 (Other Offenses).</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> The purposes of this amendment are to make the section a binding guideline (as the Commission originally intended with respect to felonies and Class A misdemeanors) rather than a policy statement, to delete language relating to petty offenses, and to conform and clarify the commentary.</p>

<p>&quot;(d) When counts involve the same general type of offense and the guidelines for that type of offense determine the offense level primarily on the basis of the total amount of harm or loss, the quantity of a substance involved, or some other measure of aggregate harm.

<p>&quot;(b) The generally applicable minimum and maximum fine for each offense level is shown in the Fine Table in subsection (c) below. Unless a statute expressly authorizes a greater amount, no fine may exceed $250,000 for a felony or a misdemeanor resulting in the loss of human life; $25,000 for any other misdemeanor; or $1,000 for an infraction. 18 U.S.C. § 3571(b)(1).</p>
<p>(c) (1) The minimum fine range is the greater of:</p>
<p>(A) the amount shown in column A of the table below; or</p>
<p>(B) any monetary gain to the defendant, less any restitution made or ordered.</p>
<p>(2) Except as specified in (4) below, the maximum fine is the greater of:</p>
<p>(A) the amount shown in column B of the table below;</p>
<p>(B) twice the estimated loss caused by the offense; or</p>
<p>(C) three times the estimated gain to the defendant.&quot;,</p>

<p>&quot;(b) Except as provided in subsections (f) and (i) below, or otherwise required by statute, the fine imposed shall be within the range specified in subsection (c) below.</p>
<p>(c) (1) The minimum of the fine range is the greater of:</p>

<p>(2) Except as specified in (4) below, the maximum of the fine range is the greater of:</p>
<p>(A) the amount shown in column B of the table below;</p>
<p>(B) twice the gross pecuniary loss caused by the offense; or</p>
<p>(C) three times the gross pecuniary gain to all participants in the offense.&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §5E4.2 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended by deleting:</p>
<p>&quot;2. The maximum fines generally authorized by statute are restated in subsection (b). These apply to each count of conviction. Ordinarily, the maximum fines on each count are independent and cumulative. However, if the offenses ‘arise from a common scheme or plan’ and ‘do not cause separable or distinguishable kinds of harm or damage,’ the aggregate fine may not exceed ‘twice the amount imposable for the most serious offense.’ 18 U.S.C. § 3572(b) (former 18 U.S.C. § 3623(c)(2)).</p>
<p>3. Alternative fine limits are provided in subsection (c)(2). The term ‘estimated gain’ is used to emphasize that the Commission does not intend precise or detailed calculation of the monetary gain (nor of the loss) in using the alternative fine limits. In many cases, circumstances will make it unnecessary to consider these standards other than in the most general terms.&quot;,</p>
<p>and inserting in lieu thereof:</p>
<p>&quot;2. In general, the maximum fine permitted by law as to each count of conviction is $250,000 for a felony or for any misdemeanor resulting in death; $100,000 for a Class A misdemeanor; and $5,000 for any other offense. 18 U.S.C. § 3571(b)(3)‑(7). However, higher or lower limits may apply when specified by statute. 18 U.S.C. § 3571(b)(1), (e). As an alternative maximum, the court may fine the defendant up to the greater of twice the gross gain or twice the gross loss. 18 U.S.C. § 3571(b)(2), (d).</p>
<p>3. Alternative fine limits are provided in subsection (c). The terms ‘pecuniary gain’ and ‘pecuniary loss’ are taken from 18 U.S.C. § 3571(d). The Commission does not intend precise or detailed calculation of the gain or loss in using the alternative fine limits. In many cases, circumstances will make it unnecessary to consider these standards other than in the most general terms.&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §5E4.2 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended in Note 4 by deleting &quot;Any restitution&quot; and inserting in lieu thereof &quot;Restitution&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §5E4.2 captioned &quot;Background&quot; is amended by deleting:</p>
<p>&quot;defendant. In addition, the Commission concluded that greater latitude with a gain-based fine was justified; when the court finds it necessary to rely on the gain, rather than the loss, to set the fine, ordering restitution usually will not be feasible because of the difficulty in computing the amount.&quot;,</p>

<p>With regard to labor racketeering offenses, a part of the punishment imposed by 29 U.S.C. §§ 504 and 511 is the prohibition of convicted persons from service in labor unions, employer associations, employee benefit plans, and as labor relations consultants. Violations of these provisions are felony offenses. Persons convicted after October 12, 1984, may petition the sentencing court to reduce the statutory disability (thirteen years after sentence or imprisonment, whichever is later) to a lesser period (not less than three years after entry of judgment in the trial court). After November 1, 1987, petitions for exemption from the disability that were formerly administered by the United States Parole Commission will be transferred to the courts. Relief shall not be given in such cases to aid rehabilitation, but may be granted only following a clear demonstration by the convicted person that he has been rehabilitated since commission of the crime.&quot;.</p>

<p><em>Statutory Provision</em>: 21 U.S.C. § 848.</p>
<p><em>Application Note</em>:</p>
<p>1. Do not apply any adjustment from Chapter Three, Part B (Role in the Offense).</p>
<p><em>Background</em>: The base offense levels for continuing criminal enterprises are mandatory minimum sentences provided by the statute that mandate imprisonment for leaders of large scale drug enterprises. A conviction establishes that the defendant controlled and exercised decision-making authority over one of the most serious forms of ongoing criminal activity. Therefore, an adjustment for role in the offense in Chapter Three, Part B, is not applicable.&quot;.</p>
<p>A replacement guideline with accompanying commentary is inserted as §2D1.5 (Continuing Criminal Enterprise).</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> The purpose of this amendment is to ensure that the guideline adequately reflects the seriousness of the criminal conduct. The previous guideline specified sentences that were lower than sentences typically imposed on defendants convicted of engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise, a result that the Commission did not intend. The guideline is also amended to delete, as unnecessary, provisions that referred to statutory minimum sentences.</p>

<p><strong>68.</strong> <strong>Amendment:</strong> Chapter One, Part A, section 4(b) is amended in the first sentence of the fourth paragraph by deleting &quot;three&quot; and inserting in lieu thereof &quot;two&quot;; in the fourth paragraph by deleting the second through eighth sentences as follows:</p>
<p>&quot;The first kind, which will most frequently be used, is in effect an interpolation between two adjacent, numerically oriented guideline rules. A specific offense characteristic, for example, might require an increase of four levels for serious bodily injury but two levels for bodily injury. Rather than requiring a court to force middle instances into either the ‘serious’ or the ‘simple’ category, the guideline commentary suggests that the court may interpolate and select a midpoint increase of three levels. The Commission has decided to call such an interpolation a ‘departure’ in light of the legal views that a guideline providing for a range of increases in offense levels may violate the statute’s 25 percent rule (though other have presented contrary legal arguments). Since interpolations are technically departures, the courts will have to provide reasons for their selection, and it will be subject to review for ‘reasonableness’ on appeal. The Commission believes, however, that a simple reference by the court to the ‘mid-category’ nature of the facts will typically provide sufficient reason. It does not foresee serious practical problems arising out of the application of the appeal provisions to this form of departure.&quot;;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>in the first sentence of the fifth paragraph by deleting &quot;second&quot; and inserting in lieu thereof &quot;first&quot;; and, in the first sentence of the sixth paragraph by deleting &quot;third&quot; and inserting in lieu thereof &quot;second&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> The purpose of this amendment is to eliminate references to interpolation as a special type of departure. The Commission has reviewed the discussion of interpolation in Chapter One, which has been read as describing &quot;interpolation&quot; as a departure from an offense level rather than from the guideline range established after the determination of an offense level. The Commission concluded that it is simpler to add intermediate offense level adjustments to the guidelines in the cases where interpolation is most likely to be considered (<em>i.e.</em>, degree of bodily injury). This amendment is not intended to preclude interpolation in other cases; where appropriate, the court will be able to achieve the same result by use of the regular departure provisions.</p>
