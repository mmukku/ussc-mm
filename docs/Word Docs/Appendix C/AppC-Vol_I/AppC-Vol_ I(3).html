<p>(2) Level from §2D1.1, corresponding to double the drug amount involved, for involving an individual at least fifteen years of age and less than eighteen years of age.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Commentary</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Statutory Provision</em>: 21 U.S.C. § 845b.</p>
<p><em>Application Notes</em>:</p>
<p>1. If multiple drugs or offenses occur and all or some of them involve juveniles, double or triple the drug amounts for those offenses involving juveniles before totalling the amounts. For example, if there are three drug offenses of conviction and only one involves juveniles in trafficking, add the amount from the first and second offense, double the amount for the offense involving juveniles, and total. Use that total to determine the base offense level.</p>
<p>2. The reference to the level from §2D1.1 includes the base offense level plus the specific offense characteristic dealing with a weapon. Under §2D1.1(b)(1) there is a 2-level increase for possession of a firearm or other dangerous weapon during commission of the offense.</p>
<p><em>Background</em>: The statute addressed by this section punishes any person eighteen years of age or older who knowingly employs or uses any person younger than eighteen to violate or to conceal any violation of any provision of Title 21. Section 845b provides a minimum mandatory period of imprisonment of one year. An increased penalty for the employment or use of persons fourteen years of age or younger reflects the enhanced sentence authorized by 21 U.S.C. § 845b(d).</p>
<p>§2D1.3. <em>Distribu­ting Controlled Substances to Individuals Younger than Twenty-One Years, To Pregnant Women, or Within 1000 Feet of a School or College</em></p>
<p>(a) Base Offense Level:</p>

<p>(2) (A) Level from §2D1.1, corresponding to double the drug amount involved, but in no event less than level 13, for distributing a controlled substance other than five grams or less of marihuana to an individual under the age of twenty-one years; or</p>
<p>(B) Level from §2D1.1, corresponding to double the drug amount involved, but in no event less than level 13, for distributing or manufacturing a controlled substance other than five grams or less of marihuana within 1000 feet of a schoolyard.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Commentary</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Statutory Provisions</em>: 21 U.S.C. §§ 845, 845a.</p>
<p><em>Application Notes</em>:</p>
<p>1. The provisions addressed by this section contain a mandatory minimum period of imprisonment of one year. The base offense level is determined as in §2D1.2. If both subsections (a)(1) and (a)(2) apply to a single distribution (<em>e.g.</em>, the distribution of 10 grams of a controlled substance to a pregnant woman under twenty-one years of age), the enhancements are applied cumulatively, <em>i.e.</em>, by using four times rather than two times the amount distributed. However, only one of the enhancements in §2D1.3(a)(2) shall apply in a given case.</p>
<p>2. If multiple drugs or offenses occur, determine the offense level as described in the Commentary to §2D1.2.</p>
<p>3. The reference to the level from §2D1.1 includes the base offense level plus the specific offense characteristic dealing with a weapon. Under §2D1.1(b)(1) there is a 2-level increase for possession of a firearm, or other dangerous weapon during the commission of the offense.</p>
<p><em>Background</em>: The guideline sentences for distribution of controlled substances to individuals under twenty-one years of age or within 1000 feet of a school or college treat the distribution of less than five grams of marihuana less harshly than other controlled substances. This distinction is based on the statutory provisions that specifically exempt convictions for the distribution of less than five grams of marihuana from the mandatory minimum one-year imprisonment requirement.&quot;.</p>
<p>A replacement guideline with accompanying commentary is inserted as §2D1.2 (Drug Offenses Occurring Near Protected Locations or Involving Underage or Pregnant Individuals).</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> The purposes of this amendment are to implement the directive in Section 6454 of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988, and to expand the coverage of the guideline to include the provision of Sections 6458 and 6459 of that Act. The amendment also covers the provisions of 21 U.S.C. § 845, 845a, and 845b not included in the statutory direction to the Commission.</p>

</blockquote>
<p><strong>136.</strong> <strong>Amendment:</strong> The Commentary to §2D1.4 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended in Note 1 by deleting:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Where the defendant was not reasonably capable of producing the negotiated amount, the court may depart and impose a sentence lower than the sentence that would otherwise result.&quot;,</p>
<p>and inserting in lieu thereof:</p>
<p>&quot;However, where the court finds that the defendant did not intend to produce and was not reasonably capable of producing the negotiated amount, the court shall exclude from the guideline calculation the amount that it finds the defendant did not intend to produce and was not reasonably capable of producing.&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> Application Note 1 currently provides that the &quot;weight under negotiation in an uncompleted distribution shall be used to calculate the applicable amount.&quot; The instruction then provides &quot;Where the defendant was not reasonably capable of producing the negotiated amount the court may depart and impose a sentence lower than the sentence that would otherwise result.&quot; This provision may result in inflated offense levels in uncompleted offenses where a defendant is merely &quot;puffing,&quot; even though the court is then authorized to address the situation by a downward departure. The purpose of this amendment is to provide a more direct procedure for calculating the offense level where the court finds that the defendant did not intend to produce and was not reasonably capable of producing the negotiated amount.</p>

<p>The Commentary to §2D2.3 is amended by inserting at the end:</p>
<p>&quot;<em>Background</em>: This section implements the direction to the Commission in Section 6482 of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988. Offenses covered by this guideline may vary widely with regard to harm and risk of harm. The offense levels assume that the offense involved the operation of a common carrier carrying a number of passengers, <em>e.g.</em>, a bus. If no or only a few passengers were placed at risk, a downward departure may be warranted. If the offense resulted in the death or serious bodily injury of a large number of persons, such that the resulting offense level under subsection (b) would not adequately reflect the seriousness of the offense, an upward departure may be warranted.&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> The purpose of this amendment is to implement the directive to the Commission in Section 6482 of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988. In addition, the base offense level under subsection (a)(3) is increased to reflect the seriousness of the offense.</p>

<p>&quot;4. Certain conduct may be charged in the count of conviction as part of a ‘pattern of racketeering activity’ even though the defendant has previously been sentenced for that conduct. Where such previously imposed sentence resulted from a conviction prior to the last overt act of the instant offense, treat as a prior sentence under §4A1.2(a)(1) and not as part of the instant offense. This treatment is designed to produce a result consistent with the distinction between the instant offense and criminal history found throughout the guidelines. If this treatment produces an anomalous result in a particular case, a guideline departure may be warranted.&quot;.</p>

<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> The purposes of this amendment are to conform the theft and fraud loss tables to the tax evasion table in order to remove an unintended inconsistency between these tables in cases where the amount is greater than $40,000, to increase the offense levels for offenses with larger losses to provide additional deterrence and better reflect the seriousness of the conduct, and to eliminate minor gaps in the loss table.</p>

See the discussion&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §2H1.4 captioned &quot;Background&quot; is amended in the first paragraph by deleting &quot;, except where death results, in which case the maximum term of imprisonment authorized is life imprisonment&quot; and inserting in lieu there of &quot;if no bodily injury results, ten years if bodily injury results, and life imprisonment if death results&quot;, by deleting &quot;Given this</p>

<p>The Commentary to §2H1.4 captioned &quot;Background&quot; is amended by inserting the following sentences at the end of the first paragraph:</p>
<p>&quot;The 6-level increase under subsection (a)(2) reflects the 2-level increase that is applied to other offenses covered in this Part plus a 4-level increase for the commission of the offense under actual or purported legal authority. This 4-level increase is inherent in the base offense level of 10 under subsection (a)(1).&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> The purpose of this amendment is to correct an anomaly between the offense level under this section and §2H1.5 when the offense level is determined under subsection (a)(2). Section 2H1.4 is similar to §2H1.5 in that it may or may not involve the use of force. Under §2H1.4, however, the offense must involve the abuse of actual or purported legal authority. The base offense level of 10 used in 2H1.4(a)(1) has a built-in 4-level enhancement (which corresponds to the base offense level of 6 under §2H1.5(a)(1) plus the 4-level increase for a public official). There is an anomaly, however, when the base offense level from (a)(2) is used. In such cases, §2H1.4 results in an offense level that is 4 levels less than §2H1.5 when the offense is committed by a public official. The Commentary to §2H1.4 is also amended to reflect the increase in the maximum authorized sentence from one to ten years in cases involving bodily injury.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>(1) If the purpose of the conduct was to facilitate another offense, apply the guideline applicable to an attempt to commit that offense, if the resulting offense level is greater than that determined above.&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> The purpose of this amendment is to correct an anomaly in §2H3.1. Currently, specific offense characteristic (b)(1) applies only to base offense level (a)(1). Consequently, conduct facilitating an offense for economic gain of level 8 or 9 would result in a greater offense level (11 or 12) than conduct facilitating a more serious (level 10 or 11) offense.</p>

<p><em>Commentary</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Statutory Provision</em>: 18 U.S.C. § 3147.</p>
<p><em>Application Notes</em>:</p>
<p>1. This guideline applies whenever a sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3147 is imposed.</p>
<p>2. By statute, a term of imprisonment imposed for a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 3147 runs consecutively to any other term of imprisonment. Consequently, a sentence for such a violation is exempt from grouping under the multiple count rules. <em>See</em> §3D1.2.</p>
<p><em>Background</em>: Because defendants convicted under this section will generally have a prior criminal history, the guideline sentences provided are greater than they otherwise might appear.&quot;.</p>
<p>A replacement guideline with accompanying commentary is inserted as §2J1.7 (Commission of Offense While on Release).</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> The purpose of this amendment is to reflect the fact that 18 U.S.C. § 3147 is an enhancement provision, not a distinct offense. Created in 1984 as part of the Comprehensive Crime Control Act, the statute contained interim provisions (mandatory consecutive sentences that were subject to the parole and good time provisions of prior law) that were to be in effect until the sentencing guidelines took effect. The Senate Report to S.1762 indicates that the mandatory nature of the interim provisions was to be eliminated when the sentencing guidelines took effect (&quot;Section 213(h) [220(g) of the CCCA of 1984] amends the new provision in title I of this Act relating to consecutive enhanced penalties for committing an offense while on release (new 18 U.S.C. § 3147)) by eliminating the mandatory nature of the penalties in favor of utilizing sentencing guidelines&quot; (Senate Report 98-225 at 186). The statute, as amended, however, did not actually eliminate all language referring to mandatory penalties. A mandatory consecutive term of imprisonment is required but, unlike other mandatory provisions, there is no minimum required.</p>
<p>The amendment converts this section into an offense level adjustment for the offense committed while on release, a treatment that is considerably more consistent with the treatment of other offense/offender characteristics.</p>
<p><strong>Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1989.</strong></p>
