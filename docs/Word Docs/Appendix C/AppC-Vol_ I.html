<p>(b) Injury relevant to the offense of conviction means harm which is caused intentionally, recklessly or by criminal negligence in the course of conduct relevant to the offense of conviction.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Commentary</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Application Note</em>:</p>
<p>1. In sentencing, the court should consider all relevant offense and offender characteristics. For purposes of assessing offense conduct, the relevant conduct and circumstances of the offense of conviction are as follows:</p>
<p>a. conduct directed toward preparation for or commission of the offense of conviction, and efforts to avoid detection and responsibility for the offense of conviction;</p>
<p>b. conduct indicating that the offense of conviction was to some degree part of a broader purpose, scheme, or plan;</p>
<p>c. conduct that is relevant to the state of mind or motive of the defendant in committing the crime;</p>
<p>d. conduct that is relevant to the defendant’s involvement in crime as a livelihood.</p>
<p>The first three criteria are derived from two sources, Rule 8(a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, governing joinder of similar or related offenses, and Rule 404(b) of the Federal Rules of Evidence, permitting admission of evidence of other crimes to establish motive, intent, plan, and common scheme. These rules provide standards that govern consideration at trial of crimes &quot;of the same or similar character,&quot; and utilize concepts and terminology familiar to judges, prosecutors, and defenders. The governing standard should be liberally construed in favor of considering information generally appropriate to sentencing. When other crimes are inadmissible under the Rule 404(b) standard, such crimes may not be &quot;relevant to the offense of conviction&quot; under the criteria that determine this question for purposes of Chapter Two; such crimes would, however, be considered in determining the relevant offender characteristics to the extent authorized by Chapter Three (Adjustments), and Chapter Four (Criminal History and Criminal Livelihood) and Chapter Five, Part H (Specific Offender Characteristics). This construction is consistent with the existing rule that &quot;[n]o limitation shall be placed on the information concerning the background, character, and conduct of a person convicted of an offense . . . for the purpose of imposing an appropriate sentence,&quot; 18 U.S.C. § 3577, so long as the information &quot;has sufficient indicia of reliability to support its probable accuracy.&quot; <em>United States v. Marshall</em>, 519 F. Supp. 751 (D. Wis. 1981), <em>aff’d</em>, 719 F.2d 887 (7th Cir. 1983).</p>
<p>The last of these criteria is intended to ensure that a judge may consider at sentencing, information that, although not specifically within other criteria of relevance, indicates that the defendant engages in crime for a living. Inclusion of this information in sentencing considerations is consistent with 28 U.S.C. § 994(d)(11).&quot;.</p>
<p>A replacement guideline with accompanying commentary is inserted as §1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct (Factors that Determine the Guideline Range)).</p>

<p>&quot;§1B1.4. <em>Determining the Offense Level</em></p>
<p>In determining the offense level:</p>
<p>(a) determine the base offense level from Chapter Two;</p>
<p>(b) make any applicable adjustments for specific offense characteristics from Chapter Two <em>in the order listed</em>;</p>
<p>(c) make any applicable adjustments from Chapter Three;</p>

</blockquote>
<p><em>Commentary</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Application Notes</em>:</p>
<p>1. A particular guideline (in the base offense level or in a specific offense characteristic) may expressly direct that a particular factor be applied only if the defendant was convicted of a particular statute. <em>E.g.</em>, in §2K2.3, a base offense level of 12 is used &quot;if convicted under 26 U.S.C. § 5861.&quot; Unless such an express direction is included, conviction under the statute is not required. Thus, use of a statutory reference to describe a particular set of circumstances does not require a conviction under the referenced statute. Examples of this usage are found in §2K1.3(b)(4) (&quot;if the defendant was a person prohibited from receiving explosives under 18 U.S.C. § 842(i), or if the defendant knowingly distributed explosives to a person prohibited from receiving explosives under 18 U.S.C. § 842(i), increase by 10 levels&quot;); and §2A3.4(b)(2) (&quot;if the abusive contact was accomplished as defined in 18 U.S.C. § 2242, increase by 4 levels&quot;). In such cases, the particular circumstances described are to be evaluated under the &quot;relevant conduct&quot; standard of §1B1.3.</p>
<p>2. Once the appropriate base offense level is determined, all specific offense characteristics are to be applied in the order listed.</p>
<p>3. The offense level adjustments from more than one specific offense characteristic within an offense guideline are cumulative (added together) unless the guideline specifies that only the greater (or greatest) is to be used. Within each specific offense characteristic subsection, however, the offense level adjustments are alternative; only the one that best describes the conduct is to be used. <em>E.g</em>., in §2A2.2(b)(3), pertaining to degree of bodily injury, the subsection that best describes the level of bodily injury is used; the adjustments from different degrees of bodily injury (subsections (A), (B) and (C)) are not added together).</p>
<p>4. The adjustments in Chapter Three that may apply include Part A (Victim-Related Adjustments), Part B (Role in the Offense), Part C (Obstruction), Part D (Multiple Counts), and Part E (Acceptance of Responsibility).&quot;.</p>
<p>A replacement guideline with accompanying commentary is inserted as §1B1.4 (Information to be Used in Imposing Sentence (Selecting a Point Within the Guideline Range or Departing from the Guidelines)).</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> The purposes of this amendment are to remove material made redundant by the reorganization of this Part and to replace it with material that clarifies the operation of the guidelines. The material formerly in this section is now covered by §1B1.1.</p>

<p>&quot;Loss is to be based upon replacement cost to the victim or market value of the property, whichever is greater.&quot;,</p>
<p>and inserting in lieu thereof:</p>
<p>&quot;‘Loss’ means the value of the property taken, damaged, or destroyed. Ordinarily, when property is taken or destroyed the loss is the fair market value of the particular property at issue. Where the market value is difficult to ascertain or inadequate to measure harm to the victim, the court may measure loss in some other way, such as reasonable replacement cost to the victim. When property is damaged the loss is the cost of repairs, not to exceed the loss had the property been destroyed. In cases of partially completed conduct, the loss is to be determined in accordance with the provisions of §2X1.1 (Attempt, Solicitation, or Conspiracy Not Covered by a Specific Guideline). <em>E.g.</em>, in the case of the theft of a government check or money order, loss refers to the loss that would have occurred if the check or money order had been cashed. Similarly, if a defendant is apprehended in the process of taking a vehicle, the loss refers to the value of the vehicle even if the vehicle is recovered immediately.&quot;.</p>

<p>For offenses for which no specific guideline has been promulgated:</p>
<p>(a) If the offense is a felony or class A misdemeanor, the most analogous guideline should be applied. If no sufficiently analogous guideline exists, any sentence that is reasonable and consistent with the purposes of sentencing should be imposed. <em>See</em> 18 U.S.C. § 3553(b).</p>

</blockquote>
<p><em>Commentary</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Background</em>: This policy statement addresses cases in which a defendant has been convicted of an offense for which no specific guideline has been written. For a felony or a class A misdemeanor (<em>see</em> 18 U.S.C. §§ 3559(a) and 3581(b)), the court is directed to apply the most analogous guideline. If no sufficiently analogous guideline exists, the court is directed to sentence without reference to a specific guideline or guideline range, as provided in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(b).</p>
<p>For a class B or C misdemeanor or an infraction (<em>see</em> 18 U.S.C. §§ 3559(a) and 3581(b)) that is not covered by a specific guideline, the court is directed to sentence without reference to a specific guideline or guideline range, as provided in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(b). An inquiry as to whether there is a sufficiently analogous guideline that might be applied is not required. The Commission makes this distinction in treatment because for many lesser offenses (<em>e.g.</em>, traffic infractions), generally handled under assimilative offense provisions by magistrates, there will be no sufficiently analogous guideline, and a case-by-case determination in respect to this issue for the high volume of cases processed each year would be unduly burdensome and would not significantly reduce disparity.&quot;.</p>
<p>A replacement guideline with accompanying commentary is inserted as §2X5.1 (Other Offenses).</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> The purposes of this amendment are to make the section a binding guideline (as the Commission originally intended with respect to felonies and Class A misdemeanors) rather than a policy statement, to delete language relating to petty offenses, and to conform and clarify the commentary.</p>

Unless a statute expressly authorizes a greater amount, no fine may exceed $250,000 for a felony or a misdemeanor resulting in the loss of human life; $25,000 for any other misdemeanor; or $1,000 for an infraction. 18 U.S.C. § 3571(b)(1).</p>

<p>&quot;2. The maximum fines generally authorized by statute are restated in subsection (b). These apply to each count of conviction. Ordinarily, the maximum fines on each count are independent and cumulative. However, if the offenses ‘arise from a common scheme or plan’ and ‘do not cause separable or distinguishable kinds of harm or damage,’ the aggregate fine may not exceed ‘twice the amount imposable for the most serious offense.’ 18 U.S.C. § 3572(b) (former 18 U.S.C. § 3623(c)(2)).</p>
<p>3. Alternative fine limits are provided in subsection (c)(2). The term ‘estimated gain’ is used to emphasize that the Commission does not intend precise or detailed calculation of the monetary gain (nor of the loss) in using the alternative fine limits. In many cases, circumstances will make it unnecessary to consider these standards other than in the most general terms.&quot;,</p>
<p>and inserting in lieu thereof:</p>
<p>&quot;2. In general, the maximum fine permitted by law as to each count of conviction is $250,000 for a felony or for any misdemeanor resulting in death; $100,000 for a Class A misdemeanor; and $5,000 for any other offense. 18 U.S.C. § 3571(b)(3)‑(7). However, higher or lower limits may apply when specified by statute. 18 U.S.C. § 3571(b)(1), (e). As an alternative maximum, the court may fine the defendant up to the greater of twice the gross gain or twice the gross loss. 18 U.S.C. § 3571(b)(2), (d).</p>
<p>3. Alternative fine limits are provided in subsection (c). The terms ‘pecuniary gain’ and ‘pecuniary loss’ are taken from 18 U.S.C. § 3571(d). The Commission does not intend precise or detailed calculation of the gain or loss in using the alternative fine limits. In many cases, circumstances will make it unnecessary to consider these standards other than in the most general terms.&quot;.</p>

<p>&quot;defendant. In addition, the Commission concluded that greater latitude with a gain-based fine was justified; when the court finds it necessary to rely on the gain, rather than the loss, to set the fine, ordering restitution usually will not be feasible because of the difficulty in computing the amount.&quot;,</p>

<p>With regard to labor racketeering offenses, a part of the punishment imposed by 29 U.S.C. §§ 504 and 511 is the prohibition of convicted persons from service in labor unions, employer associations, employee benefit plans, and as labor relations consultants.

Persons convicted after October 12, 1984, may petition the sentencing court to reduce the statutory disability (thirteen years after sentence or imprisonment, whichever is later) to a lesser period (not less than three years after entry of judgment in the trial court). After November 1, 1987, petitions for exemption from the disability that were formerly administered by the United States Parole Commission will be transferred to the courts. Relief shall not be given in such cases to aid rehabilitation, but may be granted only following a clear demonstration by the convicted person that he has been rehabilitated since commission of the crime.&quot;.</p>

<p><em>Statutory Provision</em>: 21 U.S.C. § 848.</p>
<p><em>Application Note</em>:</p>
<p>1. Do not apply any adjustment from Chapter Three, Part B (Role in the Offense).</p>
<p><em>Background</em>: The base offense levels for continuing criminal enterprises are mandatory minimum sentences provided by the statute that mandate imprisonment for leaders of large scale drug enterprises. A conviction establishes that the defendant controlled and exercised decision-making authority over one of the most serious forms of ongoing criminal activity. Therefore, an adjustment for role in the offense in Chapter Three, Part B, is not applicable.&quot;.</p>
<p>A replacement guideline with accompanying commentary is inserted as §2D1.5 (Continuing Criminal Enterprise).</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> The purpose of this amendment is to ensure that the guideline adequately reflects the seriousness of the criminal conduct. The previous guideline specified sentences that were lower than sentences typically imposed on defendants convicted of engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise, a result that the Commission did not intend. The guideline is also amended to delete, as unnecessary, provisions that referred to statutory minimum sentences.</p>

<p>&quot;The first kind, which will most frequently be used, is in effect an interpolation between two adjacent, numerically oriented guideline rules. A specific offense characteristic, for example, might require an increase of four levels for serious bodily injury but two levels for bodily injury. Rather than requiring a court to force middle instances into either the ‘serious’ or the ‘simple’ category, the guideline commentary suggests that the court may interpolate and select a midpoint increase of three levels. The Commission has decided to call such an interpolation a ‘departure’ in light of the legal views that a guideline providing for a range of increases in offense levels may violate the statute’s 25 percent rule (though other have presented contrary legal arguments). Since interpolations are technically departures, the courts will have to provide reasons for their selection, and it will be subject to review for ‘reasonableness’ on appeal. The Commission believes, however, that a simple reference by the court to the ‘mid-category’ nature of the facts will typically provide sufficient reason.

<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> The purpose of this amendment is to eliminate references to interpolation as a special type of departure. The Commission has reviewed the discussion of interpolation in Chapter One, which has been read as describing &quot;interpolation&quot; as a departure from an offense level rather than from the guideline range established after the determination of an offense level. The Commission concluded that it is simpler to add intermediate offense level adjustments to the guidelines in the cases where interpolation is most likely to be considered (<em>i.e.</em>, degree of bodily injury). This amendment is not intended to preclude interpolation in other cases; where appropriate, the court will be able to achieve the same result by use of the regular departure provisions.</p>

<p>&quot;Similarly, stipulations to additional offenses are treated as if the defendant had been convicted of separate counts charging those offenses.&quot;,</p>
<p>and by inserting the following additional subsections:</p>
<p>&quot;(c) A conviction by a plea of guilty or <em>nolo</em> <em>contendere</em> containing a stipulation that specifically establishes the commission of additional offense(s) shall be treated as if the defendant had been convicted of additional count(s) charging those offense(s).</p>
<p>(d) A conviction on a count charging a conspiracy to commit more than one offense shall be treated as if the defendant had been convicted on a separate count of conspiracy for each offense that the defendant conspired to commit.&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §1B1.2 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended in the second paragraph of Note 1 by deleting:</p>
<p>&quot;Similarly, if the defendant pleads guilty to one robbery but admits the elements of two additional robberies as part of a plea agreement, the guideline applicable to three robberies is to be applied.&quot;,</p>
<p>and by inserting the following additional notes:</p>
<p>&quot;4. Subsections (c) and (d) address circumstances in which the provisions of Chapter Three, Part D (Multiple Counts) are to be applied although there may be only one count of conviction. Subsection (c) provides that in the case of a stipulation to the commission of additional offense(s), the guidelines are to be applied as if the defendant had been convicted of an additional count for each of the offenses stipulated. For example, if the defendant is convicted of one count of robbery but, as part of a plea agreement, admits to having committed two additional robberies, the guidelines are to be applied as if the defendant had been convicted of three counts of robbery. Subsection (d) provides that a conviction on a conspiracy count charging conspiracy to commit more than one offense is treated as if the defendant had been convicted of a separate conspiracy count for each offense that he conspired to commit. For example, where a conviction on a single count of conspiracy establishes that the defendant conspired to commit three robberies, the guidelines are to be applied as if the defendant had been convicted on one count of conspiracy to commit the first robbery, one count of conspiracy to commit the second robbery, and one count of conspiracy to commit the third robbery.</p>
<p>5. Particular care must be taken in applying subsection (d) because there are cases in which the jury’s verdict does not establish which offense(s) was the object of the conspiracy. In such cases, subsection (d) should only be applied with respect to an object offense alleged in the conspiracy count if the court, were it sitting as a trier of fact, would convict the defendant of conspiring to commit that object offense. Note, however, if the object offenses specified in the conspiracy count would be grouped together under §3D1.2(d) (<em>e.g.</em>, a conspiracy to steal three government checks) it is not necessary to engage in the foregoing analysis, because §1B1.3(a)(2) governs consideration of the defendant’s conduct.&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> The purpose of this amendment is to add a guideline subsection (subsection (d)) expressly providing that a conviction of conspiracy to commit more than one offense is treated for guideline purposes as if the defendant had been convicted of a separate conspiracy count for each offense that the defendant conspired to commit. The current</p>
<p>instruction in Application Note 9 of §3D1.2 is inadequate. For consistency, material now contained at §1B1.2(a) concerning stipulations to having committed additional offenses is moved to a new subsection (subsection (c)).</p>
<p>Additional commentary (Application Note 5) is provided to address cases in which the jury’s verdict does not specify how many or which offenses were the object of the conspiracy of which the defendant was convicted. <em>Compare</em> <em>United States v. Johnson</em>, 713 F.2d 633, 645-46 (11th Cir. 1983) (conviction stands if there is sufficient proof with respect to any one of the objectives) <em>cert</em>. <em>denied</em> <em>sub</em> <em>nom</em>. <em>Wilkins v. United States</em>, 465 U.S. 1081 (1984) <em>with</em> <em>United States v. Tarnopol</em>, 561 F.2d 466 (3d Cir. 1977) (failure of proof with respect to any one of the objectives renders the conspiracy conviction invalid). In order to maintain consistency with other §1B1.2(a) determinations, this decision should be governed by a reasonable doubt standard. A higher standard of proof should govern the creation of what is, in effect, a new count of conviction for the purposes of Chapter Three, Part D (Multiple Counts). Because the guidelines do not explicitly establish standards of proof, the proposed new application note calls upon the court to determine which offense(s) was the object of the conspiracy as if it were &quot;sitting as a trier of fact.&quot; The foregoing determination is not required, however, in the case of offenses that are grouped together under §3D1.2(d) (<em>e.g.</em>, fraud and theft) because §1B1.3(a)(2) governs consideration of the defendant’s conduct.</p>

<p>The Commentary to §1B1.3 captioned &quot;Background&quot; is amended by deleting:</p>
<p>&quot; Subsection (a)(4) requires consideration of the defendant’s ‘state of mind, intent, motive or purpose in committing the offense.’ The defendant’s state of mind is an element of the offense that may constitute a specific offense characteristic. <em>See</em>, <em>e.g.</em>, §2A1.4 (Involuntary Manslaughter) (distinction made between recklessness and criminal negligence). The guidelines also incorporate broader notions of intent or purpose that are not elements of the offense, <em>e.g.</em>, whether the offense was committed for profit, or for the purpose of facilitating a more serious offense. Accordingly, such factors must be considered in determining the applicable guideline range.&quot;,</p>
<p>and inserting in lieu thereof:</p>
<p>&quot; Subsection (a)(4) requires consideration of any other information specified in the applicable guideline. For example, §2A1.4 (Involuntary Manslaughter) specifies consideration of the defendant’s state of mind; §2K1.4 (Arson; Property Damage By Use of Explosives) specifies consideration of the risk of harm created.&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> The purpose of this amendment is to delete language pertaining to &quot;risk of harm&quot; and &quot;state of mind&quot; as unnecessary. Cases in which the guidelines specifically address risk of harm or state of mind are covered in the amended guideline under subsection (a)(4) [formerly subsection (a)(5)].

<p>&quot;If the conviction is for conspiracy, it includes conduct in furtherance of the conspiracy that was known to or was reasonably foreseeable by the defendant. If the conviction is for solicitation, misprision or accessory after the fact, it includes all conduct relevant to determining the offense level for the underlying offense that was known to or reasonably should have been known by the defendant. <em>See</em> <em>generally</em> §§2X1.1-2X4.1.&quot;,</p>
<p>and inserting in lieu thereof:</p>
<p>&quot;In the case of criminal activity undertaken in concert with others, whether or not charged as a conspiracy, the conduct for which the defendant ‘would be otherwise accountable’ also includes conduct of others in furtherance of the execution of the jointly-undertaken criminal activity that was reasonably foreseeable by the defendant. Because a count may be broadly worded and include the conduct of many participants over a substantial period of time, the scope of the jointly-undertaken criminal activity, and hence relevant conduct, is not necessarily the same for every participant. Where it is established that the conduct was neither within the scope of the defendant’s agreement, nor was reasonably foreseeable in connection with the criminal activity the defendant agreed to jointly undertake, such conduct is not included in establishing the defendant’s offense level under this guideline.</p>
<p>In the case of solicitation, misprision, or accessory after the fact, the conduct for which the defendant ‘would be otherwise accountable’ includes all conduct relevant to determining the offense level for the underlying offense that was known, or reasonably should have been known, by the defendant.</p>
<p><em>Illustrations of Conduct for Which the Defendant is Accountable</em></p>
<p>a. Defendant A, one of ten off-loaders hired by Defendant B, was convicted of importation of marihuana, as a result of his assistance in off-loading a boat containing a one-ton shipment of marihuana. Regardless of the number of bales of marihuana that he actually unloaded, and notwithstanding any claim on his part that he was neither aware of, nor could reasonably foresee, that the boat contained this quantity of marihuana, Defendant A is held accountable for the entire one-ton quantity of marihuana on the boat because he aided and abetted the unloading, and hence the importation, of the entire shipment.</p>
<p>b. Defendant C, the getaway driver in an armed bank robbery in which $15,000 is taken and a teller is injured, is convicted of the substantive count of bank robbery. Defendant C is accountable for the money taken because he aided and abetted the taking of the money. He is accountable for the injury inflicted because he participated in concerted criminal conduct that he could reasonably foresee might result in the infliction of injury.</p>
<p>c. Defendant D pays Defendant E a small amount to forge an endorsement on an $800 stolen government check. Unknown to Defendant E, Defendant D then uses that check as a down payment in a scheme to fraudulently obtain $15,000 worth of merchandise. Defendant E is convicted of forging the $800 check. Defendant E is not accountable for the $15,000 because the fraudulent scheme to obtain $15,000 was beyond the scope of, and not reasonably foreseeable in connection with, the criminal activity he jointly undertook with Defendant D.</p>
<p>d. Defendants F and G, working together, design and execute a scheme to sell fraudulent stocks by telephone. Defendant F fraudulently obtains $20,000. Defendant G fraudulently obtains $35,000. Each is convicted of mail fraud. Each defendant is accountable for the entire amount ($55,000) because each aided and abetted the other in the fraudulent conduct. Alternatively, because Defendants F and G engaged in concerted criminal activity, each is accountable for the entire $55,000 loss because the conduct of each was in furtherance of the jointly undertaken criminal activity and was reasonably foreseeable.</p>
<p>e. Defendants H and I engaged in an ongoing marihuana importation conspiracy in which Defendant J was hired only to help off-load a single shipment. Defendants H, I, and J are included in a single count charging conspiracy to import marihuana. For the purposes of determining the offense level under this guideline, Defendant J is accountable for the entire single shipment of marihuana he conspired to help import and any acts or omissions in furtherance of the importation that were reasonably foreseeable. He is not accountable for prior or subsequent shipments of marihuana imported by Defendants H or I if those acts were beyond the scope of, and not reasonably foreseeable in connection with, the criminal activity he agreed to jointly undertake with Defendants H and I (<em>i.e.</em>, the importation of the single shipment of marihuana).&quot;.</p>

<p>&quot;3. All other provisions of the guidelines should be disregarded to the extent that they purport to cover petty offenses.&quot;.</p>

<p>and inserting in lieu thereof:</p>
<p>&quot;exempted all Class B and C misdemeanors and infractions from the coverage of the guidelines&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> The purposes of this amendment are to conform the guideline to a revision in the statutory definition of a petty offense, and to convert the wording of the Commission’s emergency amendment at §1B1.9 (effective June 15, 1988) to that appropriate for a permanent amendment. Section 7089 of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 revises the definition of a petty offense so that it no longer exactly corresponds with a Class B or C misdemeanor or infraction. Under the revised definition, a Class B or C misdemeanor or infraction that has an authorized fine of more than $5,000 for an individual (or more than $10,000 for an organization) will not be a petty offense. This legislative revision does not affect the maximum terms of imprisonment authorized. The maximum authorized term of imprisonment remains controlled by the grade of the offense (<em>i.e.</em>, the maximum term of imprisonment remains five days for an infraction, thirty days for a Class C misdemeanor, and six months for a Class B misdemeanor). Because the statutory grade of the offense (<em>i.e.</em>, a Class B or C misdemeanor or an infraction) is the more relevant definition for guideline purposes, this amendment deletes the references in §1B1.9 to &quot;petty offenses&quot; and in lieu thereof inserts references to &quot;Class B and C misdemeanors and infractions.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Prior to the applicability of the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, a defendant convicted under this statute and sentenced to life imprisonment could be paroled (<em>see</em> 18 U.S.C. § 4205(a)). Because of the abolition of parole by that Act, the language of 18 U.S.C. § 1111(b) (which was not amended by the Act) appears on its face to provide a mandatory minimum sentence of life imprisonment for this offense. Other provisions of the Act, however, classify this offense as a Class A felony (<em>see</em> 18 U.S.C. § 3559(a)(1)), for which a term of imprisonment of any period of time is authorized as an alternative to imprisonment for the duration of the defendant’s life (<em>see</em> 18 U.S.C. §§ 3559(b), 3581(b)(1), <em>as amended</em>); hence, the relevance of the discussion in Application Note 1, <em>supra</em>, regarding circumstances in which a sentence less than life may be appropriate for a conviction under this statute.&quot;</p>

<p><em>Statutory Provisions</em>: 18 U.S.C. §§ 2244, 2245.</p>
<p><em>Application Notes</em>:</p>
<p>1. ‘Accomplished as defined in 18 U.S.C. § 2241’ means accomplished by force, threat, or other means as defined in 18 U.S.C. § 2241(a) or (b) (<em>i.e.</em>, by using force against that person; by threatening or placing that other person in fear that any person will be subject to death, serious bodily injury, or kidnapping; by rendering the victim unconscious; or by administering by force or threat of force, or without the knowledge or permission of the victim, a drug, intoxicant, or other similar substance and thereby substantially impairing the ability of the victim to appraise or control conduct).</p>
<p>2. ‘Accomplished as defined in 18 U.S.C. § 2242’ means accomplished by threatening or placing the victim in fear (other than by threatening or placing the victim in fear that any person will be subjected to death, serious bodily injury, or kidnapping); or when the victim is incapable of appraising the nature of the conduct or physically incapable of declining participation in, or communicating unwillingness to engage in, that sexual act.</p>
<p><em>Background</em>: This section covers abusive sexual contact not amounting to criminal sexual abuse (criminal sexual abuse is covered under §2A3.1-3.3). Enhancements are provided for the use of force or threats. The maximum term of imprisonment authorized by statute for offenses covered in this section is five years (if accomplished as defined in 18 U.S.C. § 2241), three years (if accomplished as defined in 18 U.S.C. § 2242), and six months otherwise. The base offense level applies to conduct that is consensual.&quot;.</p>
<p>A replacement guideline with accompanying commentary is inserted as §2A3.4 (Abusive Sexual Contact or Attempt to Commit Abusive Sexual Contact).</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> The purposes of the amendment are to make the offense levels under this guideline consistent with the structure of related guidelines (§§2A3.1, 2A3.2, 2G1.2, 2G2.1, and 2G2.2) and to reflect the increased maximum sentences for certain conduct covered by this guideline. The amendment increases all offense levels, but in particular provides enhanced punishment for victimization of minors and children.</p>

Typically, the scope of such activity is substantial (<em>i.e.</em>, the value of the stolen property, combined with an enhancement for ‘more than minimal planning’ would itself result in an offense level of at least 14), but the value of the property is particularly difficult to ascertain in individual cases because the stolen property is rapidly resold or otherwise disposed of in the course of the offense.

<p>The Commentary to §2B3.1 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended by inserting the following additional note:</p>
<p>&quot;8. An ‘express threat of death,’ as used in subsection (b)(2)(D), may be in the form of an oral or written statement, act, gesture, or combination thereof. For example, an oral or written demand using words such as ‘Give me the money or I will kill you’, ‘Give me the money or I will pull the pin on the grenade I have in my pocket’, ‘Give me the money or I will shoot you’, ‘Give me your money or else (where the defendant draws his hand across his throat in a slashing motion)’, or ‘Give me the money or you are dead’ would constitute an express threat of death. The court should consider that the intent of the underlying provision is to provide an increased offense level for cases in which the offender(s) engaged in conduct that would instill in a reasonable person, who is a victim of the offense, significantly greater fear than that necessary to constitute an element of the offense of robbery.&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §2B3.1 captioned &quot;Background&quot; is amended in the first paragraph by deleting the third sentence as follows:</p>
<p>&quot;Banks and post offices carry a minimum 1 level enhancement for property loss because such institutions generally have more cash readily available, and whether the defendant obtains more or less than $2,500 is largely fortuitous.&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> The purposes of this amendment are to increase the offense level for robbery to better reflect the seriousness of the offense and past practice, to provide an increased enhancement for the robbery of the property of a financial institution or post office, to provide an enhancement for an express threat of death, and to provide that an object that appeared to be a dangerous weapon is to be treated as a dangerous weapon for the purposes of subsection (b)(2)(C).</p>

<p>Under the current bribery guideline, there is no enhancement for repeated instances of bribery if the conduct involves the same course of conduct or common scheme or plan and the same victim (as frequently is the case where the government is the victim) because such cases are</p>
<p>grouped under §3D1.2(b). In contrast, the fraud and theft guidelines generally provide a 2-level increase in cases of repeated instances under the second prong of the &quot;more than minimal planning&quot; definition.</p>
<p>Unlike the theft and fraud guidelines, it is arguable that the value of any bribe that was part of the same course of conduct or a common scheme or plan as the offense of conviction, but not included in the count of conviction, is excluded from consideration. This is because §1B1.3(a)(2), which authorizes consideration of conduct not expressly included in the offense of conviction but part of the same course of conduct or common scheme or plan, applies only to offenses grouped under §3D1.2(d). Thus, if the defendant pleads to one count of a bribery offense involving one $10,000 bribe in satisfaction of a 15 count indictment involving an additional $80,000 in separate bribes that were part of the same course of conduct, the current bribery guideline, unlike the theft and fraud guidelines, would not take into account the additional $80,000, and there would be no increase for repeated instances.</p>
<p>The current guideline may also create various anomalies because the multiple count rule (which applies only where the offenses are not grouped under §3D1.2(b)) increases the offense level differently than the monetary table. For example, an elected public official who takes three unrelated $200 bribes has an offense level of 21; the same defendant who took two unrelated $500,000 bribes would have an offense level of 20.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> The purpose of this amendment is to address the above noted issues. A specific offense characteristic is added to provide a 2-level increase where the offense involved more than one bribe or gratuity. In addition, such offenses will be grouped under §3D1.2(d) which allows for aggregation of the amount of the bribes from the same course of conduct or common scheme or plan under §1B1.3(a)(2) (as in theft and fraud offenses).</p>

<p><em>Statutory Provision</em>: 21 U.S.C. § 845b.</p>
<p><em>Application Notes</em>:</p>
<p>1. If multiple drugs or offenses occur and all or some of them involve juveniles, double or triple the drug amounts for those offenses involving juveniles before totalling the amounts. For example, if there are three drug offenses of conviction and only one involves juveniles in trafficking, add the amount from the first and second offense, double the amount for the offense involving juveniles, and total. Use that total to determine the base offense level.</p>
<p>2. The reference to the level from §2D1.1 includes the base offense level plus the specific offense characteristic dealing with a weapon. Under §2D1.1(b)(1) there is a 2-level increase for possession of a firearm or other dangerous weapon during commission of the offense.</p>
<p><em>Background</em>: The statute addressed by this section punishes any person eighteen years of age or older who knowingly employs or uses any person younger than eighteen to violate or to conceal any violation of any provision of Title 21. Section 845b provides a minimum mandatory period of imprisonment of one year. An increased penalty for the employment or use of persons fourteen years of age or younger reflects the enhanced sentence authorized by 21 U.S.C. § 845b(d).</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Statutory Provisions</em>: 21 U.S.C. §§ 845, 845a.</p>
<p><em>Application Notes</em>:</p>
<p>1. The provisions addressed by this section contain a mandatory minimum period of imprisonment of one year. The base offense level is determined as in §2D1.2. If both subsections (a)(1) and (a)(2) apply to a single distribution (<em>e.g.</em>, the distribution of 10 grams of a controlled substance to a pregnant woman under twenty-one years of age), the enhancements are applied cumulatively, <em>i.e.</em>, by using four times rather than two times the amount distributed. However, only one of the enhancements in §2D1.3(a)(2) shall apply in a given case.</p>
<p>2. If multiple drugs or offenses occur, determine the offense level as described in the Commentary to §2D1.2.</p>
<p>3. The reference to the level from §2D1.1 includes the base offense level plus the specific offense characteristic dealing with a weapon. Under §2D1.1(b)(1) there is a 2-level increase for possession of a firearm, or other dangerous weapon during the commission of the offense.</p>
<p><em>Background</em>: The guideline sentences for distribution of controlled substances to individuals under twenty-one years of age or within 1000 feet of a school or college treat the distribution of less than five grams of marihuana less harshly than other controlled substances. This distinction is based on the statutory provisions that specifically exempt convictions for the distribution of less than five grams of marihuana from the mandatory minimum one-year imprisonment requirement.&quot;.</p>
<p>A replacement guideline with accompanying commentary is inserted as §2D1.2 (Drug Offenses Occurring Near Protected Locations or Involving Underage or Pregnant Individuals).</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> The purposes of this amendment are to implement the directive in Section 6454 of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988, and to expand the coverage of the guideline to include the provision of Sections 6458 and 6459 of that Act. The amendment also covers the provisions of 21 U.S.C. § 845, 845a, and 845b not included in the statutory direction to the Commission.</p>

<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> Application Note 1 currently provides that the &quot;weight under negotiation in an uncompleted distribution shall be used to calculate the applicable amount.&quot; The instruction then provides &quot;Where the defendant was not reasonably capable of producing the negotiated amount the court may depart and impose a sentence lower than the sentence that would otherwise result.&quot; This provision may result in inflated offense levels in uncompleted offenses where a defendant is merely &quot;puffing,&quot; even though the court is then authorized to address the situation by a downward departure.

See the discussion&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §2H1.4 captioned &quot;Background&quot; is amended in the first paragraph by deleting &quot;, except where death results, in which case the maximum term of imprisonment authorized is life imprisonment&quot; and inserting in lieu there of &quot;if no bodily injury results, ten years if bodily injury results, and life imprisonment if death results&quot;, by deleting &quot;Given this</p>

<p>The Commentary to §2H1.4 captioned &quot;Background&quot; is amended by inserting the following sentences at the end of the first paragraph:</p>
<p>&quot;The 6-level increase under subsection (a)(2) reflects the 2-level increase that is applied to other offenses covered in this Part plus a 4-level increase for the commission of the offense under actual or purported legal authority. This 4-level increase is inherent in the base offense level of 10 under subsection (a)(1).&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> The purpose of this amendment is to correct an anomaly between the offense level under this section and §2H1.5 when the offense level is determined under subsection (a)(2). Section 2H1.4 is similar to §2H1.5 in that it may or may not involve the use of force. Under §2H1.4, however, the offense must involve the abuse of actual or purported legal authority. The base offense level of 10 used in 2H1.4(a)(1) has a built-in 4-level enhancement (which corresponds to the base offense level of 6 under §2H1.5(a)(1) plus the 4-level increase for a public official). There is an anomaly, however, when the base offense level from (a)(2) is used. In such cases, §2H1.4 results in an offense level that is 4 levels less than §2H1.5 when the offense is committed by a public official. The Commentary to §2H1.4 is also amended to reflect the increase in the maximum authorized sentence from one to ten years in cases involving bodily injury.</p>

<p><em>Statutory Provision</em>: 18 U.S.C. § 3147.</p>
<p><em>Application Notes</em>:</p>
<p>1. This guideline applies whenever a sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3147 is imposed.</p>
<p>2. By statute, a term of imprisonment imposed for a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 3147 runs consecutively to any other term of imprisonment. Consequently, a sentence for such a violation is exempt from grouping under the multiple count rules. <em>See</em> §3D1.2.</p>
<p><em>Background</em>: Because defendants convicted under this section will generally have a prior criminal history, the guideline sentences provided are greater than they otherwise might appear.&quot;.</p>
<p>A replacement guideline with accompanying commentary is inserted as §2J1.7 (Commission of Offense While on Release).</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> The purpose of this amendment is to reflect the fact that 18 U.S.C. § 3147 is an enhancement provision, not a distinct offense. Created in 1984 as part of the Comprehensive Crime Control Act, the statute contained interim provisions (mandatory consecutive sentences that were subject to the parole and good time provisions of prior law) that were to be in effect until the sentencing guidelines took effect. The Senate Report to S.1762 indicates that the mandatory nature of the interim provisions was to be eliminated when the sentencing guidelines took effect (&quot;Section 213(h) [220(g) of the CCCA of 1984] amends the new provision in title I of this Act relating to consecutive enhanced penalties for committing an offense while on release (new 18 U.S.C. § 3147)) by eliminating the mandatory nature of the penalties in favor of utilizing sentencing guidelines&quot; (Senate Report 98-225 at 186). The statute, as amended, however, did not actually eliminate all language referring to mandatory penalties. A mandatory consecutive term of imprisonment is required but, unlike other mandatory provisions, there is no minimum required.</p>
<p>The amendment converts this section into an offense level adjustment for the offense committed while on release, a treatment that is considerably more consistent with the treatment of other offense/offender characteristics.</p>

<p><em>Application Notes</em>:</p>
<p>1. The definition of ‘firearm’ used in this section is that set forth in 18 U.S.C. § 921(a)(3) (if the defendant is convicted under 18 U.S.C. § 922) and 26 U.S.C. § 5845(a) (if the defendant is convicted under 26 U.S.C. § 5861). These definitions are somewhat broader than that used in Application Note 1(e) of the Commentary to §1B1.1 (Application Instructions). Under 18 U.S.C. § 921(a)(3), the term ‘firearm’ means (A) any weapon (including a starter gun) which will or is designed to or may readily be converted to expel a projectile by the action of an explosive; (B) the frame or receiver of any such weapon; (C) any firearm muffler or firearm silencer; or (D) any destructive device. Under 26 U.S.C. § 5845(a), the term ‘firearm’ includes a shotgun, or a weapon made from a shotgun, with a barrel or barrels of less than 18 inches in length; a weapon made from a shotgun or rifle with an overall length of less than 26 inches; a rifle, or weapon made from a rifle, with a barrel or barrels less than 16 inches in length; a machine gun; a muffler or silencer for a firearm; a destructive device; and certain other large bore weapons.</p>
<p>2. Under §2K2.1(b)(1), intended lawful use, as determined by the surrounding circumstances, provides a decrease in the offense level. Relevant circumstances include, among others, the number and type of firearms (sawed-off shotguns, for example, have few legitimate uses) and ammunition, the location and circumstances of possession, the nature of the defendant’s criminal history (<em>e.g.</em>, whether involving firearms), and the extent to which possession was restricted by local law.&quot;.</p>

<p>&quot;§2K2.2. <em>Receipt, Possession, or Transportation of Firearms and Other Weapons in Violation of National Firearms Act</em></p>

<p>(b) Specific Offense Characteristics</p>
<p>(1) If the firearm was stolen or had an altered or obliterated serial number, increase by 1 level.</p>
<p>(2) If the firearm was a silencer, increase by 4 levels.</p>

<p><em>Commentary</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Statutory Provisions</em>: 26 U.S.C. §§ 5861(b) through (l).</p>
<p><em>Application Notes</em>:</p>
<p>1. Under §2K2.2(b)(3), intended lawful use, as determined by the surrounding circumstances, provides a decrease in offense level. Relevant circumstances include, among others, the number and type of firearms (sawed-off shotguns, for example, have few legitimate uses) and ammunition, the location and circumstances of possession, the nature of the defendant’s criminal history (<em>e.g.</em>, whether involving firearms), and the extent to which possession is restricted by local law.</p>
<p>2. Subsection (c)(1) refers to any situation in which the defendant possessed a firearm to facilitate another offense that he committed or attempted.</p>
<p><em>Background</em>: 26 U.S.C. § 5861 prohibits the unlicensed receipt, possession, transportation, or manufacture of certain firearms, such as machine guns, silencers, rifles and shotguns with shortened barrels, and destructive devices. As with §2K2.1, there is considerable variation in the conduct included under this statutory provision and some violations may be relatively technical.</p>
<p>§2K2.3. <em>Prohibited Transactions in or Shipment of Firearms and Other Weapons</em></p>
<p>(a) Base Offense Level:</p>
<p>(1) 12, if convicted under 26 U.S.C. § 5861; or</p>
<p>(2) 6, otherwise.</p>
<p>(b) Specific Offense Characteristics</p>
<p>(1) If the number of firearms unlawfully dealt in exceeded 5, increase as follows:</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Number of Firearms</em> <em>Increase in Level</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>(A) 6 ‑ 10 add 1</p>

<p>(D) 51 ‑ 100 add 4</p>
<p>(E) 101 ‑ 200 add 5</p>
<p>(F) more than 200 add 6</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(2) If any of the following applies, use the greatest:</p>
<p>(A) If the defendant knew or had reason to believe that a purchaser was a person prohibited by federal law from owning the firearm, increase by 2 levels.</p>
<p>(B) If the defendant knew or had reason to believe that a purchaser resided in another state in which he was prohibited from owning the firearm, increase by 1 level.</p>
<p>(C) If the defendant knew or had reason to believe that a firearm was stolen or had an altered or obliterated serial number, increase by 1 level.</p>
<p>(c) Cross Reference</p>
<p>(1) If the defendant provided the firearm to another for the purpose of committing another offense, or knowing that he planned to use it in committing another offense, apply §2X1.1 (Attempt or Conspiracy) in respect to such other offense, if the resulting offense level is higher.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Statutory Provisions</em>: 18 U.S.C. § 922 (a)(1), (a)(5), (b)(2), (b)(3), (d), (i), (j), (k), (l); 26 U.S.C. § 5861(a).</p>
<p><em>Background</em>: This section applies to a variety of offenses involving prohibited transactions in or transportation of firearms and certain other weapons.&quot;.</p>
<p>A replacement guideline with accompanying commentary is inserted as §2K2.2 (Unlawful Trafficking and Other Prohibited Transactions Involving Firearms).</p>
<p>Chapter Two, Part K, Subpart 2 is amended by inserting an additional guideline with accompanying commentary as §2K2.3 (Receiving, Transporting, Shipping or Transferring a Firearm or Ammunition With Intent to Commit Another Offense, or With Knowledge that It Will Be Used in Committing Another Offense).</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This amendment addresses a number of diverse substantive and technical issues, as well as the creation of several new offenses, and increased statutory maximum penalties for certain other offenses. Because there exist a large number of overlapping statutory provisions, the three basic guidelines, §2K2.1 (Possession by a prohibited person), §2K2.2 (Possession of certain types of weapons), and §2K2.3 (Unlawful trafficking) are not closely tied to the actual conduct. The amendment addresses this issue by consolidating the current three guidelines into two guidelines: (1) unlawful possession, receipt, or transportation, and (2) unlawful trafficking; and by more carefully drawing the distinctions between the base offense levels provided. The third guideline in this amendment is a new guideline to address transfer of a weapon with intent or knowledge that it will be used to</p>
<p>commit another offense (formerly covered in a cross reference) and a new offense added by the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 (Section 6211)(Interstate travel to acquire a firearm for a criminal purpose).</p>
<p>The base offense level for conduct covered by the current §2K2.1 is increased in the amendment from 9 to 12. The statutorily authorized maximum sentence for the conduct covered under §2K2.1 was increased from five to ten years by the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 (Section 6462). Note, however, that the most aggravated conduct under §2K2.1 (possession of a weapon during commission of another offense) is handled by the cross-reference at subsection (c) and is based upon the offense level for an attempt to commit the underlying offense. <em>See</em> Background Commentary to current §2K2.1. The offense level for unlawful possession of a machine gun, sawed off shotgun, or destructive device is increased from 12 to 16. In addition, the amendment raises the enhancement for stolen weapons or obliterated serial numbers from 1 to 2 levels to better reflect the seriousness of this conduct. The numbers currently used in the table for the distribution of multiple weapons in §2K2.2 are amended to increase the offense level more rapidly for sale of multiple weapons.</p>

<p>The Commentary to §2K2.4 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended by inserting the following additional note:</p>
<p>&quot;4. Subsection (b) sets forth special provisions concerning the imposition of fines. Where there is also a conviction for the underlying offense, a consolidated fine guideline is determined by the offense level that would have applied to the underlying offense absent a conviction under 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) or 929(a). This is because the offense level for the underlying offense may be reduced when there is also a conviction under 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) or 929(a) in that any specific offense characteristic for possession, use, or discharge of a firearm is not applied (<em>see</em> Application Note 2). The Commission has not established a fine guideline range for the unusual case in which there is no conviction for the underlying offense.&quot;.</p>

While this subdivision may apply in connection with a variety of offenses that are not by nature targeted against official victims, its applicability is limited to assaultive conduct against law enforcement or corrections officers that is sufficiently serious to create at least a ‘substantial risk of serious bodily injury’ and that is proximate in time to the commission of the offense.</p>

<p>&quot;under a federal or state law prohibiting the manufacture, import, export, or distribution of a controlled substance (or a counterfeit substance) or the possession of a controlled substance (or a counterfeit substance) with intent to manufacture, import, export, or distribute&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §4B1.2 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended by deleting:</p>
<p>&quot;1. ‘Crime of violence’ is defined in 18 U.S.C. § 16 to mean an offense that has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person or property of another, or any other offense that is a felony and that by its nature involves a substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used in committing the offense. The Commission interprets this as follows: murder, manslaughter, kidnapping, aggravated assault, extortionate extension of credit, forcible sex offenses, arson, or robbery are covered by this provision. Other offenses are covered only if the conduct for which the defendant was specifically convicted meets the above definition. For example, conviction for an escape accomplished by force or threat of injury would be covered; conviction for an escape by stealth would not be covered. Conviction for burglary of a dwelling would be covered; conviction for burglary of other structures would not be covered.</p>
<p>2. ‘Controlled substance offense’ includes any federal or state offense that is substantially similar to any of those listed in subsection (2) of the guideline. These offenses include manufacturing, importing, distributing, dispensing, or possessing with intent to manufacture, import, distribute, or dispense, a controlled substance (or a counterfeit substance). This definition also includes aiding and abetting, conspiring, or attempting to commit such offenses, and other offenses that are substantially equivalent to the offenses listed.&quot;,</p>
<p>and inserting in lieu thereof:</p>
<p>&quot;1. The terms ‘crime of violence’ and ‘controlled substance offense’ include the offenses of aiding and abetting, conspiring, and attempting to commit such offenses.</p>
<p>2. ‘Crime of violence’ includes murder, manslaughter, kidnapping, aggravated assault, forcible sex offenses, robbery, arson, extortion, extortionate extension of credit, and burglary of a dwelling. Other offenses are included where (A) that offense has as an element the use attempted use, or threatened use, of physical force against the person of another, or (B) the conduct set forth in the count of which the defendant was convicted involved use of explosives or, by its nature, presented a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.&quot;.</p>

The first prong of the definition in application Note 2 above is derived from former 18 U.S.C. § 3575, the provision from which the statutory instruction underlying this guideline (28 U.S.C. § 994 (i)(2)) was itself derived.</p>

<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This amendment provides that the maximum of the guideline range is six months wherever the minimum of the guideline range is zero months. The court has discretion to impose a sentence of up to 6 months imprisonment for a Class B misdemeanor (Class B or C misdemeanors and infractions are not covered by the guidelines; <em>see</em> §1B1.9). It appears anomalous that the Commission guidelines allow less discretion for certain felonies and Class A misdemeanors. In fact, in certain cases, a plea to a reduced charge of a Class B misdemeanor could result in a higher potential sentence because the sentence for the felony or Class A misdemeanor might be restricted to less than 6 months by the guidelines. This can happen when the Sentencing Table provides a guideline range of 0-1 month, 0-2 months, 0-3, 0-4, or 0-5 months. These very narrow ranges are not required by statute, which allows a 6 month guideline range in such cases. This anomaly is removed by amending the guideline table to provide that whenever the lower limit of the guideline range is 0 months, the upper limit of the guideline range is six months.</p>

<p>&quot;‘Home detention’ means a program of confinement and supervision that restricts the defendant to his place of residence continuously, or during specified hours, enforced by appropriate means of surveillance by the probation office. The judge may also impose other conditions of probation or supervised release appropriate to effectuate home detention. If the confinement is only during specified hours, the defendant shall engage exclusively in gainful employment, community service or treatment during the non-residential hours.&quot;,</p>
<p>and inserting in lieu thereof:</p>
<p>&quot;‘Home detention’ means a program of confinement and supervision that restricts the defendant to his place of residence continuously, except for authorized absences, enforced by appropriate means of surveillance by the probation office. When an order of home detention is imposed, the defendant is required to be in his place of residence at all times except for approved absences for gainful employment, community service, religious services, medical care, educational or training programs, and such other times as may be specifically authorized. Electronic monitoring is an appropriate means of surveillance and ordinarily should be used in connection with home detention. However, alternative means of surveillance may be used so long as they are as effective as electronic monitoring.&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §5F5.2 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended in Note 2 by deleting:</p>
<p>&quot;Home detention generally should not be imposed for a period in excess of six months. However, a longer term may be appropriate for disabled, elderly or extremely ill defendants who would otherwise be imprisoned.&quot;,</p>
<p>and inserting in lieu thereof:</p>
<p>&quot;The court may impose other conditions of probation or supervised release appropriate to effectuate home detention. If the court concludes that the amenities available in the residence of a defendant would cause home detention not to be sufficiently punitive, the court may limit the amenities available.&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §5F5.2 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended by inserting the following additional note:</p>
<p>&quot;3. The defendant’s place of residence, for purposes of home detention, need not be the place where the defendant previously resided. It may be any place of residence, so long as the owner of the residence (and any other person(s) from whom consent is necessary) agrees to any conditions that may be imposed by the court, <em>e.g.</em>, conditions that a monitoring system be installed, that there will be no ‘call forwarding’ or ‘call waiting’ services, or that there will be no cordless telephones or answering machines.&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §5F5.2 is amended by inserting at the end:</p>
<p>&quot;<em>Background</em>: The Commission has concluded that the surveillance necessary for effective use of home detention ordinarily requires electronic monitoring. However, in some cases home detention may effectively be enforced without electronic monitoring, <em>e.g.</em>, when the defendant is physically incapacitated, or where some other effective means of surveillance is available. Accordingly, the Commission has not required that electronic monitoring be a necessary condition for home detention. Nevertheless, before ordering home detention without electronic monitoring, the court should be confident that an alternative form of surveillance will be equally effective.</p>
<p>In the usual case, the Commission assumes that a condition requiring that the defendant seek and maintain gainful employment will be imposed when home detention is ordered.&quot;.</p>

<p>&quot;(25) <em>Curfew</em></p>
<p>If the court concludes that restricting the defendant to his place of residence during evening and nighttime hours is necessary to provide just punishment for the offense, to protect the public from crimes that the defendant might commit during those hours, or to assist in the rehabilitation of the defendant, a condition of curfew is recommended.

<p>&quot;<em>Commentary</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Application Note</em>:</p>
<p>1. Home detention, as defined by §5F5.2, may only be used as a substitute for imprisonment. <em>See</em> §5C2.1 (Imposition of a Term of Imprisonment). Under home detention, the defendant, with specified exceptions, is restricted to his place of residence during all non-working hours. Curfew, which limits the defendant to his place of residence during evening and nighttime hours, is less restrictive than home detention and may be imposed as a condition of probation whether or not imprisonment could have been ordered.&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> The purposes of this amendment are to set forth the conditions under which curfew is a recommended condition of probation and clarify that electronic monitoring may be used as a means of surveillance in connection with an order of curfew.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;2. <em>The Statutory Mission</em></p>
<p>The Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984 foresees guidelines that will further the basic purposes of criminal punishment, <em>i.e.</em>, deterring crime, incapacitating the offender, providing just punishment, and rehabilitating the offender. It delegates to the Commission broad authority to review and rationalize the federal sentencing process.</p>
<p>The statute contains many detailed instructions as to how this determination should be made, but the most important of them instructs the Commission to create categories of offense behavior and offender characteristics. An offense behavior category might consist, for example, of ‘bank robbery/committed with a gun/$2500 taken.’ An offender characteristic category might be ‘offender with one prior conviction who was not sentenced to imprisonment.’ The Commission is required to prescribe guideline ranges that specify an appropriate sentence for each class of convicted persons, to be determined by coordinating the offense behavior categories with the offender characteristic categories. The statute contemplates the guidelines will establish a range of sentences for every coordination of categories. Where the guidelines call for imprisonment, the range must be narrow: the maximum imprisonment cannot exceed the minimum by more than the greater of 25 percent or six months. 28 U.S.C. § 994(b)(2).</p>
<p>The sentencing judge must select a sentence from within the guideline range. If, however, a particular case presents atypical features, the Act allows the judge to depart from the guidelines and sentence outside the range. In that case, the judge must specify reasons for departure. 18 U.S.C. § 3553(b). If the court sentences within the guideline range, an appellate court may review the sentence to see if the guideline was correctly</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>applied. If the judge departs from the guideline range, an appellate court may review the reasonableness of the departure. 18 U.S.C. § 3742. The Act requires the offender to serve virtually all of any prison sentence imposed, for it abolishes parole and substantially restructures good behavior adjustments.</p>
<p>The law requires the Commission to send its initial guidelines to Congress by April 13, 1987, and under the present statute they take effect automatically on November 1, 1987. Pub. L. No. 98-473, § 235, <em>reprinted at</em> 18 U.S.C. § 3551. The Commission may submit guideline amendments each year to Congress between the beginning of a regular session and May 1. The amendments will take effect automatically 180 days after submission unless a law is enacted to the contrary. 28 U.S.C. § 994(p).</p>
<p>The Commission, with the aid of its legal and research staff, considerable public testimony, and written commentary, has developed an initial set of guidelines which it now transmits to Congress. The Commission emphasizes, however, that it views the guideline-writing process as evolutionary. It expects, and the governing statute anticipates, that continuing research, experience, and analysis will result in modifications and revisions to the guidelines by submission of amendments to Congress. To this end, the Commission is established as a permanent agency to monitor sentencing practices in the federal courts throughout the nation.</p>
<p>3. <em>The Basic Approach</em> (Policy Statement)</p>
<p>To understand these guidelines and the rationale that underlies them, one must begin with the three objectives that Congress, in enacting the new sentencing law, sought to achieve. Its basic objective was to enhance the ability of the criminal justice system to reduce crime through an effective, fair sentencing system. To achieve this objective, Congress first sought <em>honesty</em> in sentencing. It sought to avoid the confusion and implicit deception that arises out of the present sentencing system which requires a judge to impose an indeterminate sentence that is automatically reduced in most cases by ‘good time’ credits. In addition, the parole commission is permitted to determine how much of the remainder of any prison sentence an offender actually will serve. This usually results in a substantial reduction in the effective length of the sentence imposed, with defendants often serving only about one-third of the sentence handed down by the court.</p>
<p>Second, Congress sought <em>uniformity</em> in sentencing by narrowing the wide disparity in sentences imposed by different federal courts for similar criminal conduct by similar offenders. Third, Congress sought <em>proportionality</em> in sentencing through a system that imposes appropriately different sentences for criminal conduct of different severity.</p>
<p>Honesty is easy to achieve: The abolition of parole makes the sentence imposed by the court the sentence the offender will serve. There is a tension, however, between the mandate of uniformity (treat similar cases alike) and the mandate of proportionality (treat different cases differently) which, like the historical tension between law and equity, makes it difficult to achieve both goals simultaneously. Perfect uniformity -- sentencing every offender to five years -- destroys proportionality. Having only a few simple categories of crimes would make the guidelines uniform and easy to administer, but might lump together offenses that are different in important respects. For example, a single category for robbery that lumps together armed and unarmed robberies, robberies with and without injuries, robberies of a few dollars and robberies of millions, is far too broad.</p>
<p>At the same time, a sentencing system tailored to fit every conceivable wrinkle of each case can become unworkable and seriously compromise the certainty of punishment and its deterrent effect. A bank robber with (or without) a gun, which the robber kept hidden (or brandished), might have frightened (or merely warned), injured seriously (or less seriously), tied up (or simply pushed) a guard, a teller or a customer, at night (or at noon), for a bad (or arguably less bad) motive, in an effort to obtain money for other crimes (or for other purposes), in the company of a few (or many) other robbers, for the first (or fourth) time that day, while sober (or under the influence of drugs or alcohol), and so forth.</p>
<p>The list of potentially relevant features of criminal behavior is long; the fact that they can occur in multiple combinations means that the list of possible permutations of factors is virtually endless. The appropriate relationships among these different factors are exceedingly difficult to establish, for they are often context specific. Sentencing courts do not treat the occurrence of a simple bruise identically in all cases, irrespective of whether that bruise occurred in the context of a bank robbery or in the context of a breach of peace. This is so, in part, because the risk that such a harm will occur differs depending on the underlying offense with which it is connected (and therefore may already be counted, to a different degree, in the punishment for the underlying offense); and also because, in part, the relationship between punishment and multiple harms is not simply additive. The relation varies, depending on how much other harm has occurred. (Thus, one cannot easily assign points for each kind of harm and simply add them up, irrespective of context and total amounts.)</p>
<p>The larger the number of subcategories, the greater the complexity that is created and the less workable the system. Moreover, the subcategories themselves, sometimes too broad and sometimes too narrow, will apply and interact in unforeseen ways to unforeseen situations, thus failing to cure the unfairness of a simple, broad category system. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, probation officers and courts, in applying a complex system of subcategories, would have to make a host of decisions about whether the underlying facts are sufficient to bring the case within a particular subcategory. The greater the number of decisions required and the greater their complexity, the greater the risk that different judges will apply the guidelines differently to situations that, in fact, are similar, thereby reintroducing the very disparity that the guidelines were designed to eliminate.</p>
<p>In view of the arguments, it is tempting to retreat to the simple, broad-category approach and to grant judges the discretion to select the proper point along a broad sentencing range. Obviously, however, granting such broad discretion risks correspondingly broad disparity in sentencing, for different courts may exercise their discretionary powers in different ways. That is to say, such an approach risks a return to the wide disparity that Congress established the Commission to limit.</p>
<p>In the end, there is no completely satisfying solution to this practical stalemate. The Commission has had to simply balance the comparative virtues and vices of broad, simple categorization and detailed, complex subcategorization, and within the constraints established by that balance, minimize the discretionary powers of the sentencing court. Any ultimate system will, to a degree, enjoy the benefits and suffer from the drawbacks of each approach.</p>
<p>A philosophical problem arose when the Commission attempted to reconcile the differing perceptions of the purposes of criminal punishment. Most observers of the criminal law agree that the ultimate aim of the law itself, and of punishment in particular, is the control of crime. Beyond this point, however, the consensus seems to break down. Some argue that appropriate punishment should be defined primarily on the basis of the moral principle of ‘just deserts.’ Under this principle, punishment should be scaled to the offender’s culpability and the resulting harms. Thus, if a defendant is less culpable, the defendant deserves less punishment. Others argue that punishment should be imposed primarily on the basis of practical ‘crime control’ considerations. Defendants sentenced under this scheme should receive the punishment that most effectively lessens the likelihood of future crime, either by deterring others or incapacitating the defendant.</p>
<p>Adherents of these points of view have urged the Commission to choose between them, to accord one primacy over the other. Such a choice would be profoundly difficult. The relevant literature is vast, the arguments deep, and each point of view has much to be said in its favor. A clear-cut Commission decision in favor of one of these approaches would diminish the chance that the guidelines would find the widespread acceptance they need for effective implementation. As a practical matter, in most sentencing decisions both philosophies may prove consistent with the same result.</p>
<p>For now, the Commission has sought to solve both the practical and philosophical problems of developing a coherent sentencing system by taking an empirical approach that uses data estimating the existing sentencing system as a starting point. It has analyzed data drawn from 10,000 presentence investigations, crimes as distinguished in substantive criminal statutes, the United States Parole Commission’s guidelines and resulting statistics, and data from other relevant sources, in order to determine which distinctions are important in present practice. After examination, the Commission has accepted, modified, or rationalized the more important of these distinctions.</p>
<p>This empirical approach has helped the Commission resolve its practical problem by defining a list of relevant distinctions that, although of considerable length, is short enough to create a manageable set of guidelines. Existing categories are relatively broad and omit many distinctions that some may believe important, yet they include most of the major distinctions that statutes and presentence data suggest make a significant difference in sentencing decisions. Important distinctions that are ignored in existing practice probably occur rarely. A sentencing judge may take this unusual case into account by departing from the guidelines.</p>
<p>The Commission’s empirical approach has also helped resolve its philosophical dilemma. Those who adhere to a just deserts philosophy may concede that the lack of moral consensus might make it difficult to say exactly what punishment is deserved for a particular crime, specified in minute detail. Likewise, those who subscribe to a philosophy of crime control may acknowledge that the lack of sufficient, readily available data might make it difficult to say exactly what punishment will best prevent that crime. Both groups might therefore recognize the wisdom of looking to those distinctions that judges and legislators have, in fact, made over the course of time. These established distinctions are ones that the community believes, or has found over time, to be important from either a moral or crime-control perspective.</p>
<p>The Commission has not simply copied estimates of existing practice as revealed by the data (even though establishing offense values on this basis would help eliminate disparity, for the data represent averages). Rather, it has departed from the data at different points for various important reasons. Congressional statutes, for example, may suggest or require departure, as in the case of the new drug law that imposes increased and mandatory minimum sentences. In addition, the data may reveal inconsistencies in treatment, such as punishing economic crime less severely than other apparently equivalent behavior.</p>
<p>Despite these policy-oriented departures from present practice, the guidelines represent an approach that begins with, and builds upon, empirical data. The guidelines will not please those who wish the Commission to adopt a single philosophical theory and then work deductively to establish a simple and perfect set of categorizations and distinctions. The guidelines may prove acceptable, however, to those who seek more modest, incremental improvements in the status quo, who believe the best is often the enemy of the good, and who recognize that these initial guidelines are but the first step in an evolutionary process. After spending considerable time and resources exploring alternative approaches, the Commission has developed these guidelines as a practical effort toward the achievement of a more honest, uniform, equitable, and therefore effective, sentencing system.</p>
<p>4. <em>The Guidelines’ Resolution of Major Issues</em> (Policy Statement)</p>
<p>The guideline-writing process has required the Commission to resolve a host of important policy questions, typically involving rather evenly balanced sets of competing considerations. As an aid to understanding the guidelines, this introduction will briefly discuss several of those issues. Commentary in the guidelines explains others.</p>
<p>(a) <em>Real Offense vs. Charge Offense Sentencing</em>.</p>
<p>One of the most important questions for the Commission to decide was whether to base sentences upon the actual conduct in which the defendant engaged regardless of the charges for which he was indicted or convicted (‘real offense’ sentencing), or upon the conduct that constitutes the elements of the offense with which the defendant was charged and of which he was convicted (‘charge offense’ sentencing). A bank robber, for example, might have used a gun, frightened bystanders, taken $50,000, injured a teller, refused to stop when ordered, and raced away damaging property during escape. A pure real offense system would sentence on the basis of all identifiable conduct. A pure charge offense system would overlook some of the harms that did not constitute statutory elements of the offenses of which the defendant was convicted.</p>
<p>The Commission initially sought to develop a real offense system. After all, the present sentencing system is, in a sense, a real offense system. The sentencing court (and the parole commission) take account of the conduct in which the defendant actually engaged, as determined in a presentence report, at the sentencing hearing, or before a parole commission hearing officer. The Commission’s initial efforts in this direction, carried out in the spring and early summer of 1986, proved unproductive mostly for practical reasons. To make such a system work, even to formalize and rationalize the status quo, would have required the Commission to decide precisely which harms to take into account, how to add them up, and what kinds of procedures the courts should use to determine the presence or absence of disputed factual elements. The Commission found no practical way to combine and account for the large number of diverse harms arising in different circumstances; nor did it find a practical way to reconcile the need for a fair adjudicatory procedure with the need for a speedy sentencing process, given the potential existence of hosts of adjudicated ‘real harm’ facts in many typical cases. The effort proposed as a solution to these problems required the use of, for example, quadratic roots and other mathematical operations that the Commission considered too complex to be workable, and, in the Commission’s view, risked return to wide disparity in practice.</p>
<p>The Commission therefore abandoned the effort to devise a ‘pure’ real offense system and instead experimented with a ‘modified real offense system,’ which it published for public comment in a September 1986 preliminary draft.</p>
<p>This version also foundered in several major respects on the rock of practicality. It was highly complex and its mechanical rules for adding harms (<em>e.g</em>., bodily injury added the same punishment irrespective of context) threatened to work considerable unfairness. Ultimately, the Commission decided that it could not find a practical or fair and efficient way to implement either a pure or modified real offense system of the sort it originally wanted, and it abandoned that approach.</p>
<p>The Commission, in its January 1987 Revised Draft and the present guidelines, has moved closer to a ‘charge offense’ system. The system is not, however, pure; it has a number of real elements. For one thing, the hundreds of overlapping and duplicative statutory provisions that make up the federal criminal law have forced the Commission to write guidelines that are descriptive of generic conduct rather than tracking purely statutory language. For another, the guidelines, both through specific offense characteristics and adjustments, take account of a number of important, commonly occurring real offense elements such as role in the offense, the presence of a gun, or the amount of money actually taken.</p>
<p>Finally, it is important not to overstate the difference in practice between a real and a charge offense system. The federal criminal system, in practice, deals mostly with drug offenses, bank robberies and white collar crimes (such as fraud, embezzlement, and bribery). For the most part, the conduct that an indictment charges approximates the real and relevant conduct in which the offender actually engaged.</p>
<p>The Commission recognizes its system will not completely cure the problems of a real offense system. It may still be necessary, for example, for a court to determine some particular real facts that will make a difference to the sentence. Yet, the Commission believes that the instances of controversial facts will be far fewer; indeed, there will be few enough so that the court system will be able to devise fair procedures for their determination. See <em>United States v. Fatico</em>, 579 F.2d 707 (2d Cir. 1978) (permitting introduction of hearsay evidence at sentencing hearing under certain conditions), <em>on remand</em>, 458 F. Supp. 388 (E.D.N.Y. 1978), <em>aff’d</em>, 603 F.2d 1053 (2d Cir. 1979) (holding that the government need not prove facts at sentencing hearing beyond a reasonable doubt), <em>cert. denied</em>, 444 U.S. 1073 (1980).</p>
<p>The Commission also recognizes that a charge offense system has drawbacks of its own. One of the most important is its potential to turn over to the prosecutor the power to determine the sentence by increasing or decreasing the number (or content) of the counts in an indictment. Of course, the defendant’s actual conduct (that which the prosecutor can prove in court) imposes a natural limit upon the prosecutor’s ability to increase a defendant’s sentence. Moreover, the Commission has written its rules for the treatment of multicount convictions with an eye toward eliminating unfair treatment that might flow from count manipulation. For example, the guidelines treat a three-count indictment, each count of which charges sale of 100 grams of heroin, or theft of $10,000, the same as a single-count indictment charging sale of 300 grams of heroin or theft of $30,000. Further, a sentencing court may control any inappropriate manipulation of the indictment through use of its power to depart from the specific guideline sentence. Finally, the Commission will closely monitor problems arising out of count manipulation and will make appropriate adjustments should they become necessary.</p>
<p>(b) <em>Departures</em>.</p>
<p>The new sentencing statute permits a court to depart from a guideline-specified sentence only when it finds ‘an aggravating or mitigating circumstance of a kind, or to a degree, not adequately taken into consideration by the Sentencing Commission . . .’. 18 U.S.C. § 3553(b). Thus, in principle, the Commission, by specifying that it had adequately considered a particular factor, could prevent a court from using it as grounds for departure. In this initial set of guidelines, however, the Commission does not so limit the courts’ departure powers. The Commission intends the sentencing courts to treat each guideline as carving out a ‘heartland,’ a set of typical cases embodying the conduct that each guideline describes. When a court finds an atypical case, one to which a particular guideline linguistically applies but where conduct significantly differs from the norm, the court may consider whether a departure is warranted. Section 5H1.10 (Race, Sex, National Origin, Creed, Religion, Socio-Economic Status), the third sentence of §5H1.4, and the last sentence of §5K2.12, list a few factors that the court cannot take into account as grounds for departure. With those specific exceptions, however, the Commission does not intend to limit the kinds of factors (whether or not mentioned anywhere else in the guidelines) that could constitute grounds for departure in an unusual case.</p>
<p>The Commission has adopted this departure policy for two basic reasons. First is the difficulty of foreseeing and capturing a single set of guidelines that encompasses the vast range of human conduct potentially relevant to a sentencing decision. The Commission also recognizes that in the initial set of guidelines it need not do so. The Commission is a permanent body, empowered by law to write and rewrite guidelines, with progressive changes, over many years. By monitoring when courts depart from the guidelines and by analyzing their stated reasons for doing so, the Commission, over time, will be able to create more accurate guidelines that specify precisely where departures should and should not be permitted.</p>
<p>Second, the Commission believes that despite the courts’ legal freedom to depart from the guidelines, they will not do so very often. This is because the guidelines, offense by offense, seek to take account of those factors that the Commission’s sentencing data indicate make a significant difference in sentencing at the present time. Thus, for example, where the presence of actual physical injury currently makes an important difference in final sentences, as in the case of robbery, assault, or arson, the guidelines specifically instruct the judge to use this factor to augment the sentence. Where the guidelines do not specify an augmentation or diminution, this is generally because the sentencing data do not permit the Commission, at this time, to conclude that the factor is empirically important in relation to the particular offense. Of course, a factor (say physical injury) may nonetheless sometimes occur in connection with a crime (such as fraud) where it does not often occur. If, however, as the data indicate, such occurrences are rare, they are precisely the type of events that the court’s departure powers were designed to cover -- unusual cases outside the range of the more typical offenses for which the guidelines were designed. Of course, the Commission recognizes that even its collection and analysis of 10,000 presentence reports are an imperfect source of data sentencing estimates. Rather than rely heavily at this time upon impressionistic accounts, however, the Commission believes it wiser to wait and collect additional data from our continuing monitoring process that may demonstrate how the guidelines work in practice before further modification.</p>
<p>It is important to note that the guidelines refer to two different kinds of departure.</p>
<p>The first kind involves instances in which the guidelines provide specific guidance for departure, by analogy or by other numerical or non-numerical suggestions. For example, the commentary to §2G1.1 (Transportation for Prostitution), recommends a downward adjustment of eight levels where commercial purpose was not involved. The Commission intends such suggestions as policy guidance for the courts. The Commission expects that most departures will reflect the suggestions, and that the courts of appeals may prove more likely to find departures ‘unreasonable’ where they fall outside suggested levels.</p>
<p>A second kind of departure will remain unguided. It may rest upon grounds referred to in Chapter 5, Part K (Departures), or on grounds not mentioned in the guidelines. While Chapter 5, Part K lists factors that the Commission believes may constitute grounds for departure, those suggested grounds are not exhaustive. The Commission recognizes that there may be other grounds for departure that are not mentioned; it also believes there may be cases in which a departure outside suggested levels is warranted. In its view, however, such cases will be highly unusual.</p>
<p>(c) <em>Plea Agreements</em>.</p>
<p>Nearly ninety percent of all federal criminal cases involve guilty pleas, and many of these cases involve some form of plea agreement. Some commentators on early Commission guideline drafts have urged the Commission not to attempt any major reforms of the agreement process, on the grounds that any set of guidelines that threatens to radically change present practice also threatens to make the federal system unmanageable. Others, starting with the same facts, have argued that guidelines which fail to control and limit plea agreements would leave untouched a ‘loophole’ large enough to undo the good that sentencing guidelines may bring. Still other commentators make both sets of arguments.</p>
<p>The Commission has decided that these initial guidelines will not, in general, make significant changes in current plea agreement practices. The court will accept or reject any such agreements primarily in accordance with the rules set forth in Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(e). The Commission will collect data on the courts’ plea practices and will analyze this information to determine when and why the courts accept or reject plea agreements. In light of this information and analysis, the Commission will seek to further regulate the plea agreement process as appropriate.</p>
<p>The Commission nonetheless expects the initial set of guidelines to have a positive, rationalizing impact upon plea agreements for two reasons. First, the guidelines create a clear, definite expectation in respect to the sentence that a court will impose if a trial takes place. Insofar as a prosecutor and defense attorney seek to agree about a likely sentence or range of sentences, they will no longer work in the dark. This fact alone should help to reduce irrationality in respect to actual sentencing outcomes. Second, the guidelines create a norm to which judges will likely refer when they decide whether, under Rule 11(e), to accept or to reject a plea agreement or recommendation. Since they will have before them the norm, the relevant factors (as disclosed in the plea agreement), and the reason for the agreement, they will find it easier than at present to determine whether there is sufficient reason to accept a plea agreement that departs from the norm.</p>
<p>(d) <em>Probation and Split Sentences</em>.</p>
<p>The statute provides that the guidelines are to ‘reflect the general appropriateness of imposing a sentence other than imprisonment in cases in which the defendant is a first offender who has not been convicted of a crime of violence or an otherwise serious offense . . .’ 28 U.S.C. § 994(j). Under present sentencing practice, courts sentence to probation an inappropriately high percentage of offenders guilty of certain economic crimes, such as theft, tax evasion, antitrust offenses, insider trading, fraud, and embezzlement, that in the Commission’s view are ‘serious.’ If the guidelines were to permit courts to impose probation instead of prison in many or all such cases, the present sentences would continue to be ineffective.</p>
<p>The Commission’s solution to this problem has been to write guidelines that classify as ‘serious’ (and therefore subject to mandatory prison sentences) many offenses for which probation is now frequently given. At the same time, the guidelines will permit the sentencing court to impose short prison terms in many such cases. The Commission’s view is that the definite prospect of prison, though the term is short, will act as a significant deterrent to many of these crimes, particularly when compared with the status quo where probation, not prison, is the norm.</p>
<p>More specifically, the guidelines work as follows in respect to a first offender. For offense levels one through six, the sentencing court may elect to sentence the offender to probation (with or without confinement conditions) or to a prison term. For offense levels seven through ten, the court may substitute probation for a prison term, but the probation must include confinement conditions (community confinement, intermittent confinement, or home detention). For offense levels eleven and twelve, the court must impose at least one half the minimum confinement sentence in the form of prison confinement, the remainder to be served on supervised release with a condition of community confinement or home detention. The Commission, of course, has not dealt with the single acts of aberrant behavior that still may justify probation at higher offense levels through departures.</p>
<p>(e) <em>Multi-Count Convictions</em>.</p>
<p>The Commission, like other sentencing commissions, has found it particularly difficult to develop rules for sentencing defendants convicted of multiple violations of law, each of which makes up a separate count in an indictment. The reason it is difficult is that when a defendant engages in conduct that causes several harms, each additional harm, even if it increases the extent to which punishment is warranted, does not necessarily warrant a proportionate increase in punishment. A defendant who assaults others during a fight, for example, may warrant more punishment if he injures ten people than if he injures one, but his conduct does not necessarily warrant ten times the punishment. If it did, many of the simplest offenses, for reasons that are often fortuitous, would lead to life sentences of imprisonment‑-sentences that neither ‘just deserts’ nor ‘crime control’ theories of punishment would find justified.</p>
<p>Several individual guidelines provide special instructions for increasing punishment when the conduct that is the subject of that count involves multiple occurrences or has caused several harms. The guidelines also provide general rules for aggravating punishment in light of multiple harms charged separately in separate counts. These rules may produce occasional anomalies, but normally they will permit an appropriate degree of aggravation of punishment when multiple offenses that are the subjects of separate counts take place.</p>
<p>These rules are set out in Chapter Three, Part D. They essentially provide: (1) When the conduct involves fungible items, <em>e.g.</em>, separate drug transactions or thefts of money, the amounts are added and the guidelines apply to the total amount. (2) When nonfungible harms are involved, the offense level for the most serious count is increased (according to a somewhat diminishing scale) to reflect the existence of other counts of conviction.</p>
<p>The rules have been written in order to minimize the possibility that an arbitrary casting of a single transaction into several counts will produce a longer sentence. In addition, the sentencing court will have adequate power to prevent such a result through departures where necessary to produce a mitigated sentence.</p>
<p>(f) <em>Regulatory Offenses</em>.</p>
<p>Regulatory statutes, though primarily civil in nature, sometimes contain criminal provisions in respect to particularly harmful activity. Such criminal provisions often describe not only substantive offenses, but also more technical, administratively-related offenses such as failure to keep accurate records or to provide requested information. These criminal statutes pose two problems. First, which criminal regulatory provisions should the Commission initially consider, and second, how should it treat technical or administratively-related criminal violations?</p>
<p>In respect to the first problem, the Commission found that it cannot comprehensively treat all regulatory violations in the initial set of guidelines. There are hundreds of such provisions scattered throughout the United States Code. To find all potential violations would involve examination of each individual federal regulation. Because of this practical difficulty, the Commission has sought to determine, with the assistance of the Department of Justice and several regulatory agencies, which criminal regulatory offenses are particularly important in light of the need for enforcement of the general regulatory scheme. The Commission has sought to treat these offenses in these initial guidelines. It will address the less common regulatory offenses in the future.</p>
<p>In respect to the second problem, the Commission has developed a system for treating technical recordkeeping and reporting offenses, dividing them into four categories.</p>
<p>First, in the simplest of cases, the offender may have failed to fill out a form intentionally, but without knowledge or intent that substantive harm would likely follow. He might fail, for example, to keep an accurate record of toxic substance transport, but that failure may not lead, nor be likely to lead, to the release or improper treatment of any toxic substance. Second, the same failure may be accompanied by a significant likelihood that substantive harm will occur; it may make a release of a toxic substance more likely. Third, the same failure may have led to substantive harm. Fourth, the failure may represent an effort to conceal a substantive harm that has occurred.</p>
<p>The structure of a typical guideline for a regulatory offense is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The guideline provides a low base offense level (6) aimed at the first type of recordkeeping or reporting offense. It gives the court the legal authority to impose a punishment ranging from probation up to six months of imprisonment.</p>
<p>(2) Specific offense characteristics designed to reflect substantive offenses that do occur (in respect to some regulatory offenses), or that are likely to occur, increase the offense level.</p>
<p>(3) A specific offense characteristic also provides that a recordkeeping or reporting offense that conceals a substantive offense will be treated like the substantive offense.</p>
<p>The Commission views this structure as an initial effort. It may revise its approach in light of further experience and analysis of regulatory crimes.</p>
<p>(g) <em>Sentencing Ranges</em>.</p>
<p>In determining the appropriate sentencing ranges for each offense, the Commission began by estimating the average sentences now being served within each category. It also examined the sentence specified in congressional statutes, in the parole guidelines, and in other relevant, analogous sources. The Commission’s forthcoming detailed report will contain a comparison between estimates of existing sentencing practices and sentences under the guidelines.</p>
<p>While the Commission has not considered itself bound by existing sentencing practice, it has not tried to develop an entirely new system of sentencing on the basis of theory alone. Guideline sentences in many instances will approximate existing practice, but adherence to the guidelines will help to eliminate wide disparity. For example, where a high percentage of persons now receive probation, a guideline may include one or more specific offense characteristics in an effort to distinguish those types of defendants who now receive probation from those who receive more severe sentences. In some instances, short sentences of incarceration for all offenders in a category have been substituted for a current sentencing practice of very wide variability in which some defendants receive probation while others receive several years in prison for the same offense. Moreover, inasmuch as those who currently plead guilty often receive lesser sentences, the guidelines also permit the court to impose lesser sentences on those defendants who accept responsibility and those who cooperate with the government.</p>
<p>The Commission has also examined its sentencing ranges in light of their likely impact upon prison population. Specific legislation, such as the new drug law and the career offender provisions of the sentencing law, require the Commission to promulgate rules that will lead to substantial prison population increases. These increases will occur irrespective of any guidelines. The guidelines themselves, insofar as they reflect policy decisions made by the Commission (rather than legislated mandatory minimum, or career offender, sentences), will lead to an increase in prison population that computer models, produced by the Commission and the Bureau of Prisons, estimate at approximately 10 percent, over a period of ten years.</p>
<p>(h) <em>The Sentencing Table</em>.</p>
<p>The Commission has established a sentencing table. For technical and practical reasons it has 43 levels. Each row in the table contains levels that overlap with the levels in the preceding and succeeding rows. By overlapping the levels, the table should discourage unnecessary litigation. Both prosecutor and defendant will realize that the difference between one level and another will not necessarily make a difference in the sentence that the judge imposes. Thus, little purpose will be served in protracted litigation trying to determine, for example, whether $10,000 or $11,000 was obtained as a result of a fraud. At the same time, the rows work to increase a sentence proportionately. A change of 6 levels roughly doubles the sentence irrespective of the level at which one starts. The Commission, aware of the legal requirement that the maximum of any range cannot exceed the minimum by more than the greater of 25 percent or six months, also wishes to permit courts the greatest possible range for exercising discretion. The table overlaps offense levels meaningfully, works proportionately, and at the same time preserves the maximum degree of allowable discretion for the judge within each level.</p>
<p>Similarly, many of the individual guidelines refer to tables that correlate amounts of money with offense levels. These tables often have many, rather than a few levels. Again, the reason is to minimize the likelihood of unnecessary litigation. If a money table were to make only a few distinctions, each distinction would become more important and litigation as to which category an offender fell within would become more likely. Where a table has many smaller monetary distinctions, it minimizes the likelihood of litigation, for the importance of the precise amount of money involved is considerably less.</p>
<p>5. <em>A Concluding Note</em></p>
<p>The Commission emphasizes that its approach in this initial set of guidelines is one of caution. It has examined the many hundreds of criminal statutes in the United States Code. It has begun with those that are the basis for a significant number of prosecutions. It has sought to place them in a rational order. It has developed additional distinctions relevant to the application of these provisions, and it has applied sentencing ranges to each resulting category. In doing so, it has relied upon estimates of existing sentencing practices as revealed by its own statistical analyses, based on summary reports of some 40,000 convictions, a sample of 10,000 augmented presentence reports, the parole guidelines and policy judgments.</p>
<p>The Commission recognizes that some will criticize this approach as overly cautious, as representing too little a departure from existing practice. Yet, it will cure wide disparity. The Commission is a permanent body that can amend the guidelines each year. Although the data available to it, like all data, are imperfect, experience with these guidelines will lead to additional information and provide a firm empirical basis for revision.</p>
<p>Finally, the guidelines will apply to approximately 90 percent of all cases in the federal courts. Because of time constraints and the nonexistence of statistical information, some offenses that occur infrequently are not considered in this initial set of guidelines. They will, however, be addressed in the near future. Their exclusion from this initial submission does not reflect any judgment about their seriousness. The Commission has also deferred promulgation of guidelines pertaining to fines, probation and other sanctions for organizational defendants, with the exception of antitrust violations. The Commission also expects to address this area in the near future.&quot;.</p>

<p>&quot;‘Offenses of a character for which §3D1.2(d) would require grouping of multiple counts,’ as used in subsection (a)(2), applies to offenses for which grouping of counts would be required under §3D1.2(d) had the defendant been convicted of multiple counts. Application of this provision does not require the defendant, in fact, to have been convicted of multiple counts. For example, where the defendant engaged in three drug sales of 10, 15, and 20 grams of cocaine, as part of the same course of conduct or common scheme or plan, subsection (a)(2) provides that the total quantity of cocaine involved (45 grams) is to be used to determine the offense level even if the defendant is convicted of a single count charging only one of the sales. If the defendant is convicted of multiple counts for the above noted sales, the grouping rules of Chapter Three, Part D (Multiple Counts) provide that the counts are grouped together. Although Chapter Three, Part D (Multiple Counts) applies to multiple counts of conviction, it does not limit the scope of subsection (a)(2). Subsection (a)(2) merely incorporates by reference the types of offenses set forth in §3D1.2(d); thus, as discussed above, multiple counts of conviction are not required for subsection (a)(2) to apply.&quot;.</p>

In addition, a finding is made that there are two other sales, also part of the common scheme or plan, each involving 10 grams of cocaine. The total amount of all four sales (40 grams of cocaine) will be used to determine the offense level for each count under §1B1.3(a)(2). The two counts will then be grouped together under either this subsection or subsection (d) to avoid double counting.&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This amendment clarifies the intended scope of §1B1.3(a)(2) in conjunction with Chapter Three, Part D (Multiple Counts) to ensure that the latter is not read to limit the former only to conduct of which the defendant was convicted.</p>

<p>&quot;Prior to the applicability of the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, a defendant convicted under this statute and sentenced to life imprisonment could be paroled (<em>see</em> 18 U.S.C. § 4205(a)). Because of the abolition of parole by that Act, the language of 18 U.S.C. § 1111(b) (which was not amended by the Act) appears on its face to provide a mandatory minimum sentence of life imprisonment for this offense. Other provisions of the Act, however, classify this offense as a Class A felony (<em>see</em> 18 U.S.C. § 3559(a)(1)), for which a term of imprisonment of any period of time is authorized as an alternative to imprisonment for the duration of the defendant’s life (<em>see</em> 18 U.S.C. §§ 3559(b), 3581(b)(1), <em>as amended</em>); hence, the relevance of the discussion in Application Note 1, <em>supra</em>, regarding circumstances in which a sentence less than life may be appropriate for a conviction under this statute.&quot;,</p>
<p>and inserting in lieu thereof:</p>
<p>&quot;Whether a mandatory minimum term of life imprisonment is applicable to every defendant convicted of first degree murder under 18 U.S.C. § 1111 is a matter of statutory interpretation for the courts. The discussion in Application Note 1, <em>supra</em>, regarding circumstances in which a downward departure may be warranted is relevant in the event the penalty provisions of 18 U.S.C. § 1111 are construed to permit a sentence less than life imprisonment, or in the event the defendant is convicted under a statute that expressly authorizes a sentence of less than life imprisonment (<em>e.g.</em>, 18 U.S.C. §§ 2113(e), 2118(c)(2), 21 U.S.C. § 848(e)).&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This amendment clarifies the commentary with respect to circumstances that may warrant a departure below the guideline range for offenses to which this guideline applies. This amendment also reserves for the courts the issue of whether life imprisonment is the mandatory minimum sentence for first degree murder under 18 U.S.C. § 1111.</p>

<p>&quot;An attempted manslaughter, or assault with intent to commit manslaughter, is covered under §2A2.2 (Aggravated Assault).&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §2A2.1 captioned &quot;Background&quot; is amended by deleting the second and third paragraphs as follows:</p>
<p>&quot; The maximum term of imprisonment authorized by statute for conspiracy to murder is life imprisonment (18 U.S.C. § 1117). The maximum term of imprisonment authorized by statute for solicitation to murder is twenty years (18 U.S.C. § 373). The statutes that prohibit attempted murder, or assaults with intent to commit murder, vary widely in the maximum term of imprisonment authorized. Assault with intent to commit murder (18 U.S.C. § 113(a)) carries a maximum authorized term of twenty years imprisonment. An attempted assassination of certain essential government officials (18 U.S.C. § 351(c)) carries a maximum authorized term of life imprisonment. An attempted murder of foreign officials (18 U.S.C. § 1116(a)) carries a maximum authorized term of twenty years imprisonment. An attempt to commit murder, other than an assault with intent to commit murder covered by 18 U.S.C. § 113(a), carries a maximum term of three years imprisonment (18 U.S.C. § 1113).</p>
<p>Enhancements are provided for planning, weapon use, injury, and commission of the crime for hire. All of the factors can apply in the case of an assault; only the last can apply in the case of a conspiracy that does not include an assault; and none can apply in the case of a mere solicitation.&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §2A2.2 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended in Note 3 by inserting the following additional sentence as the first sentence: &quot;This guideline also covers attempted manslaughter and assault with intent to commit manslaughter.&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §2A2.2 captioned &quot;Background&quot; is amended in the first sentence of the first paragraph by deleting &quot;where there is no intent to kill&quot; immediately following &quot; assaults&quot;.</p>

<p>&quot;2. If the offense level for the underlying conduct is less than the alternative minimum base offense level specified (<em>i.e.</em>, 23), the alternative minimum base offense level is to be used.&quot;;</p>
<p>and in the caption by deleting &quot;Notes&quot; and inserting in lieu thereof &quot;Note&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §2X1.1 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended in Note 1 in the paragraph beginning &quot;Offense guidelines that expressly cover attempts&quot; by deleting &quot;Conspiracy or Solicitation to Commit Murder;&quot; immediately before &quot;Attempted Murder&quot;; in the paragraph beginning &quot;Offense guidelines that expressly cover conspiracies&quot; by deleting &quot;§2A2.1 (Assault With Intent to Commit Murder; Conspiracy or Solicitation to Commit Murder; Attempted Murder)&quot; and inserting in lieu thereof &quot;§2A1.5 (Conspiracy or Solicitation to Commit Murder)&quot;; and in the paragraph beginning &quot;Offense guidelines that expressly cover solicitations&quot; by deleting &quot;§2A2.1 (Assault With Intent to Commit Murder; Conspiracy or Solicitation to Commit Murder; Attempted Murder)&quot; and inserting in lieu thereof &quot;§2A1.5 (Conspiracy or Solicitation to Commit Murder)&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This amendment restructures §2A2.1, and increases the offense level for attempted murder and assault with intent to commit murder where the intended offense, if successful, would have constituted first degree murder to better reflect the seriousness of this conduct. For the same reason, the enhancement for an offense involving the offer or receipt of anything of pecuniary value for undertaking the murder is increased. For greater clarity, an additional guideline (§2A1.5) is inserted to cover conspiracy or solicitation to commit murder. Section 2E1.4 is amended to conform the offense level to that of §2A1.5.</p>

<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This amendment reorders the specific offense characteristics in §§2B1.1, 2B1.2, and 2B1.3 that address offenses involving U.S. mail. In cases involving the theft or destruction of U.S. mail, the theft guideline (§2B1.1), stolen property guideline (§2B1.2), property destruction guideline (§2B1.3), and forgery guideline (§2B5.2) produce identical results if the amount involved more than $1,000, or if the offense did not involve more than minimal planning. However, because of the ordering of the specific offense characteristics, there is a 1 or 2‑level difference between §§2B1.1, 2B1.2 and 2B1.3 on the one hand, and §2B5.2 on the other, in cases of stolen or destroyed mail involving more than minimal planning and a loss of $1,000 or less. In these cases, §§2B1.1, 2B1.2 and 2B1.3 produce a result that is 1 or 2-levels lower than §2B5.2. This amendment corrects this anomaly by conforming the offense levels in §§2B1.1, 2B1.2, and 2B1.3 to that of §2B5.2 in such cases.</p>

<p>The Commentary to §2B1.3 captioned &quot;Statutory Provisions&quot; is amended by deleting the last sentence as follows:</p>
<p>&quot;Arson is treated separately in Part K, Offenses Involving Public Order and Safety.&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §2H1.1 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended in Note 1 by deleting &quot;(Other than by Arson or Explosives)&quot; immediately following &quot;or Destruction&quot;.</p>

<p>The Commentary to §2H3.3 captioned &quot;Background&quot; is amended by deleting &quot;(Other than by Arson or Explosives)&quot; immediately following &quot;or Destruction&quot;.</p>
<p>Section 2Q1.6(a)(2) is amended by deleting &quot;(Other Than by Arson or Explosives)&quot; immediately following &quot;or Destruction&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This amendment inserts a cross reference providing that offense conduct constituting arson or property destruction by explosives is to be treated under §2K1.4 (Arson, Property Destruction by Explosives). Because arson or property damage by use of explosives is an aggravated form of property destruction, just as armed robbery is an aggravated form of robbery, the use of the same &quot;relevant conduct&quot; standard to determine the offense level is appropriate.</p>

<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This amendment provides an additional equivalency to reflect the distinction between methamphetamine and pure methamphetamine in the Drug Quantity Table at §2D1.1(c), corrects an error in the equivalency for Phenylacetone/P<sub>2</sub>P, and deletes a duplicate listing for Mephobarbital.</p>
<p>In addition, this amendment clarifies that the &quot;Typical Weight Per Unit Table&quot; in Note 11 of the Commentary to §2D1.1 is not to be used where a more reliable estimate of the weight of the mixture or substance containing the controlled substance is available from case-specific information. This amendment also clarifies that for certain controlled substances this table provides an estimate of the weight of the actual controlled substance, not necessarily the weight of the mixture or substance containing the controlled substance, and therefore use of this table in such cases will provide a very conservative estimate. Finally, this amendment deletes listings for several controlled substances that are generally legitimately manufactured and then unlawfully diverted; in such cases, more accurate weight estimates can be obtained from other sources (<em>e.g.</em>, from the Drug Enforcement Administration or the manufacturer).</p>

<p>&quot;<em>Application Note</em>:</p>
<p>1. Where only part of the relevant offense conduct directly involved a protected location or an underage or pregnant individual, subsections (a)(1) and (a)(2) may result in different offense levels. For example, if the defendant, as part of the same course of conduct or common scheme or plan, sold 5 grams of heroin near a protected location and 10 grams of heroin elsewhere, the offense level from subsection (a)(1) would be level 16 (2 plus the offense level for the sale of 5 grams of heroin, the amount sold near the protected location); the offense level from subsection (a)(2) would be level 17 (1 plus the offense level for the sale of 15 grams of heroin, the total amount of heroin involved in the offense).&quot;.</p>

<p>The Commentary to §2D1.6 is amended by inserting, immediately before &quot;Background&quot;, the following:</p>
<p>&quot;<em>Application Note</em>:</p>
<p>1. Where the offense level for the underlying offense is to be determined by reference to §2D1.1, <em>see</em> Application Note 12 of the Commentary to §2D1.1, and Application Notes 1 and 2 of the Commentary to §2D1.4, for guidance in determining the scale of the offense. Note that the Drug Quantity Table in §2D1.1 provides a minimum offense level of 12 where the offense involves heroin (or other Schedule I or II Opiates), cocaine (or other Schedule I or II Stimulants), cocaine base, PCP, Methamphetamine, LSD (or other Schedule I or II Hallucinogens), Fentanyl, or Fentanyl Analogue (§2D1.1(c)(16)); and a minimum offense level of 6 otherwise (§2D1.1(c)(19)).&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This amendment is designed to reduce unwarranted disparity by requiring consideration in the guideline of the amount of the controlled substance involved in the offense, thus conforming this guideline section to the structure of §§2D1.1, 2D1.2, 2D1.4, and 2D1.5. The statute to which this guideline applies (21 U.S.C. § 843(b)) prohibits the use of a communications facility to commit, cause, or facilitate a felony controlled substance offense. Frequently, a conviction under this statute is the result of a plea bargain because the statute has a low maximum (four years with no prior felony drug conviction; eight years with a prior felony drug conviction) and no mandatory minimum. The current guideline has a base offense level of 12 and no specific offense characteristics. Therefore, the scale of the underlying drug offense is not reflected in the guideline. This results in a departure from the guideline range frequently being warranted. Without guidance as to whether or how far to depart, the potential for unwarranted disparity is substantial. Under this amendment, the guideline itself will take into account the scale of the underlying offense.</p>

<p>The Commentary to §2G2.1 captioned &quot;Background&quot; is deleted in its entirety as follows:</p>
<p>&quot;<em>Background</em>: This offense commonly involves the production source of a child pornography enterprise.

An enhancement is provided when the conduct involves the exploitation of a minor under age twelve to reflect the more serious nature of exploiting young children.&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This amendment revises subsection (b)(1) to provide distinctions for the age of the victim consistent with §2G1.2, and adds subsection (b)(2) to provide an increase for defendants who abuse a position of trust in exploiting minor children. A special instruction is added to conform the operation of the multiple count rule in this guideline with §§2G1.1 and 2G1.2.

<p>1. ‘Destructive device’ means any article described in 18 U.S.C. § 921(a)(4) (for example, explosive, incendiary, or poison gas bombs, grenades, mines, and similar devices and certain rockets, missiles, and large bore weapons).</p>
<p>2. If bodily injury resulted, an upward departure may be warranted. <em>See</em> Chapter Five, Part K (Departures).</p>
<p><em>Background</em>: Review of presentence reports indicates that many arson cases involve ‘malicious mischief,’ <em>i.e.</em>, minor property damage under circumstances that do not present an appreciable danger. A low base offense level is provided for these cases. However, aggravating factors are provided for instances where a defendant knowingly or recklessly endangered others, destroyed or attempted to destroy a residence, used a destructive device, or otherwise endangered others. As amended by Section 6474(b) of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 (effective November 18, 1988), 18 U.S.C. § 844(h) sets forth a mandatory sentencing enhancement of five years for the first offense and ten years for subsequent offenses if the defendant was convicted of using fire or an explosive to commit a felony or of carrying an explosive during the commission of a felony. <em>See</em> §2K1.7.&quot;.</p>

{id: 332, content:"<p><strong>332.</strong> <strong>Amendment:</strong> Section 2K1.7 is amended by inserting &quot;(a)&quot; immediately before &quot;If&quot;; and by inserting the following additional subsection:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;(b) Special Instruction for Fines</p>
<p>(1) Where there is a federal conviction for the underlying offense, the fine guideline shall be the fine guideline that would have been applicable had there only been a conviction for the underlying offense. This guideline shall be used as a consolidated fine guideline for both the underlying offense and the conviction underlying this section.&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §2K1.7 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended by inserting the following additional notes:</p>
<p>&quot;3. Where a sentence under this section is imposed in conjunction with a sentence for an underlying offense, any specific offense characteristic for the use of fire or explosives is not to be applied in respect to the guideline for the underlying offense.</p>
<p>4. Subsection (b) sets forth special provisions concerning the imposition of fines. Where there is also a conviction for the underlying offense, a consolidated fine guideline is determined by the offense level that would have applied to the underlying offense absent a conviction under 18 U.S.C. § 844(h). This is required because the offense level for the underlying offense may be reduced in that any specific offense characteristic for use of fire or explosives would not be applied (<em>see</em> Application Note 3). The Commission has not established a fine guideline range for the unusual case in which there is no conviction for the underlying offense, although a fine is authorized under 18 U.S.C. § 3571.&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §2K2.4 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended in Note 4 in the third sentence by inserting &quot;required&quot; immediately before &quot;because&quot;; and by inserting &quot;, although a fine is authorized under 18 U.S.C. § 3571&quot; immediately before the period at the end of the last sentence.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This amendment conforms §2K1.7 to §2K2.4, which includes specific instructions concerning treatment of fines and double counting. Both sections are based upon similarly written statutes that provide for a fixed mandatory, consecutive sentence of imprisonment. In addition, Application Note 4 of the Commentary to §2K2.4 is revised and expanded for greater clarity.</p>

<p>&quot;<em>Introductory Commentary</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Money laundering activities are essential to the operation of organized crime. Congress recently enacted new statutes prohibiting these activities and increased the maximum penalties.</p>
<p>The guidelines provide substantially increased punishments for these offenses. In fiscal year 1985, the time served by defendants convicted of felonies involving monetary transaction reporting under 31 U.S.C. §§ 5313, 5316, and 5322 averaged about ten months, and only a few defendants served as much as four to five years. However, courts have been imposing higher sentences as they come to appreciate the seriousness of this activity, and sentences as long as thirty-five years have been reported. Specifically, Congress made all reporting violations felonies in 1984, and enacted the Money Laundering Control Act of 1986 (18 U.S.C. §§ 1956, 1957), which creates new offenses and provides higher maximum sentences when knowledge, facilitation or concealment of serious criminal activity is proved.&quot;.</p>

<p>&quot;1. The following conduct, while not exclusive, may provide a basis for applying this adjustment:</p>
<p>(a) destroying or concealing material evidence, or attempting to do so;</p>
<p>(b) directing or procuring another person to destroy or conceal material evidence, or attempting to do so;</p>
<p>(c) testifying untruthfully or suborning untruthful testimony concerning a material fact, or producing or attempting to produce an altered, forged, or counterfeit document or record during a preliminary or grand jury proceeding, trial, sentencing proceeding, or any other judicial proceeding;</p>
<p>(d) threatening, intimidating, or otherwise unlawfully attempting to influence a co-defendant, witness, or juror, directly or indirectly;</p>
<p>(e) furnishing material falsehoods to a probation officer in the course of a presentence or other investigation for the court.</p>
<p>2. In applying this provision, suspect testimony and statements should be evaluated in a light most favorable to the defendant.</p>
<p>3. This provision is not intended to punish a defendant for the exercise of a constitutional right. A defendant’s denial of guilt is not a basis for application of this provision.</p>
<p>4. Where the defendant is convicted for an offense covered by §2J1.1 (Contempt), §2J1.2 (Obstruction of Justice), §2J1.3 (Perjury), §2J1.8 (Bribery of Witness), or §2J1.9 (Payment to Witness), this adjustment is not to be applied to the offense level for that offense except where a significant further obstruction occurred during the investigation or prosecution of the obstruction offense itself (<em>e.g.</em>, where the defendant threatened a witness during the course of the prosecution for the obstruction offense). Where the defendant is convicted both of the obstruction offense and the underlying offense, the count for the obstruction offense will be grouped with the count for the underlying offense under subsection (c) of §3D1.2 (Groups of Closely-Related Counts). The offense level for that Group of Closely-Related Counts will be the offense level for the underlying offense increased by the 2-level adjustment specified by this section, or the offense level for the obstruction offense, whichever is greater.&quot;,</p>
<p>and inserting in lieu thereof:</p>
<p>&quot;1. This provision is not intended to punish a defendant for the exercise of a constitutional right. A defendant’s denial of guilt (other than a denial of guilt under oath that constitutes perjury), refusal to admit guilt or provide information to a probation officer, or refusal to enter a plea of guilty is not a basis for application of this provision. In applying this provision, the defendant’s testimony and statements should be evaluated in a light most favorable to the defendant.</p>
<p>2. Obstructive conduct can vary widely in nature, degree of planning, and seriousness. Application Note 3 sets forth examples of the types of conduct to which this enhancement is intended to apply. Application Note 4 sets forth examples of less serious forms of conduct to which this enhancement is not intended to apply, but that ordinarily can appropriately be sanctioned by the determination of the particular sentence within the otherwise applicable guideline range. Although the conduct to which this enhancement applies is not subject to precise definition, comparison of the examples set forth in Application Notes 3 and 4 should assist the court in determining whether application of this enhancement is warranted in a particular case.</p>
<p>3. The following is a non-exhaustive list of examples of the types of conduct to which this enhancement applies:</p>
<p>(a) threatening, intimidating, or otherwise unlawfully influencing a co-defendant, witness, or juror, directly or indirectly, or attempting to do so;</p>
<p>(b) committing, suborning, or attempting to suborn perjury;</p>
<p>(c) producing or attempting to produce a false, altered, or counterfeit document or record during an official investigation or judicial proceeding;</p>
<p>(d) destroying or concealing or directing or procuring another person to destroy or conceal evidence that is material to an official investigation or judicial proceeding (<em>e.g.</em>, shredding a document or destroying ledgers upon learning that an official investigation has commenced or is about to commence), or attempting to do so; however, if such conduct occurred contemporaneously with arrest (<em>e.g.</em>, attempting to swallow or throw away a controlled substance), it shall not, standing alone, be sufficient to warrant an adjustment for obstruction unless it resulted in a material hindrance to the official investigation or prosecution of the instant offense or the sentencing of the offender;</p>
<p>(e) escaping or attempting to escape from custody before trial or sentencing; or willfully failing to appear, as ordered, for a judicial proceeding;</p>
<p>(f) providing materially false information to a judge or magistrate;</p>
<p>(g) providing a materially false statement to a law enforcement officer that significantly obstructed or impeded the official investigation or prosecution of the instant offense;</p>
<p>(h) providing materially false information to a probation officer in respect to a presentence or other investigation for the court;</p>
<p>(i) conduct prohibited by 18 U.S.C. §§ 1501-1516.</p>
<p>This adjustment also applies to any other obstructive conduct in respect to the official investigation, prosecution, or sentencing of the instant offense where there is a separate count of conviction for such conduct.</p>
<p>4. The following is a non-exhaustive list of examples of the types of conduct that, absent a separate count of conviction for such conduct, do not warrant application of this enhancement, but ordinarily can appropriately be sanctioned by the determination of the particular sentence within the otherwise applicable guideline range:</p>
<p>(a) providing a false name or identification document at arrest, except where such conduct actually resulted in a significant hindrance to the investigation or prosecution of the instant offense;</p>
<p>(b) making false statements, not under oath, to law enforcement officers, unless Application Note 3(g) above applies;</p>
<p>(c) providing incomplete or misleading information, not amounting to a material falsehood, in respect to a presentence investigation;</p>
<p>(d) avoiding or fleeing from arrest (<em>see</em>, <em>however</em>, §3C1.2 (Reckless Endangerment During Flight)).</p>
<p>5. ‘Material’ evidence, fact, statement, or information, as used in this section, means evidence, fact, statement, or information that, if believed, would tend to influence or affect the issue under determination.</p>
<p>6. Where the defendant is convicted for an offense covered by §2J1.1 (Contempt), §2J1.2 (Obstruction of Justice), §2J1.3 (Perjury or Subornation of Perjury), §2J1.5 (Failure to Appear by Material Witness), §2J1.6 (Failure to Appear by Defendant), §2J1.8 (Bribery of Witness), or §2J1.9 (Payment to Witness), this adjustment is not to be applied to the offense level for that offense except where a significant further obstruction occurred during the investigation or prosecution of the obstruction offense itself (<em>e.g.</em>, where the defendant threatened a witness during the course of the prosecution for the obstruction offense). Where the defendant is convicted both of the obstruction offense and the underlying offense, the count for the obstruction offense will be grouped with the count for the underlying offense under subsection (c) of §3D1.2 (Groups of Closely-Related Counts). The offense level for that group of closely-related counts will be the offense level for the underlying offense increased by the 2-level adjustment specified by this section, or the offense level for the obstruction offense, whichever is greater.&quot;.</p>

<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This amendment clarifies the operation of §3C1.1 and inserts an additional guideline to address reckless endangerment during flight. The Commission believes that reckless endangerment during flight is sufficiently different from other forms of obstructive conduct to warrant a separate enhancement.</p>

<p>&quot;(b) Any count for which the statute mandates imposition of a consecutive sentence is excluded from the operation of §§3D1.2-3D1.5. Sentences for such counts are governed by the provisions of §5G1.2(a).&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §3D1.1 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended in Note 1 by deleting:</p>
<p>&quot;Certain offenses, <em>e.g.</em>, 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) (use of a deadly or dangerous weapon in relation to a crime of violence or drug trafficking) by law carry mandatory consecutive sentences. Such offenses are exempted from the operation of these rules. <em>See</em> §3D1.2.&quot;,</p>
<p>and inserting in lieu thereof:</p>
<p>&quot;Counts for which a statute mandates imposition of a consecutive sentence are excepted from application of the multiple count rules. Convictions on such counts are not used in the determination of a combined offense level under this Part, but may affect the offense level for other counts. A conviction for 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) (use of firearm in commission of a crime of violence) provides a common example. In the case of a conviction under 18 U.S.C. § 924(c), the specific offense characteristic for weapon use in the primary offense is to be disregarded to avoid double counting. <em>See</em> Commentary to §2K2.4. <em>Example</em>: The defendant is convicted of one count of bank robbery (18 U.S.C. § 2113), and one count of use of a firearm in the commission of a crime of violence (18 U.S.C. § 924(c)). The two counts are not grouped together, and the offense level for the bank robbery count is computed without application of an enhancement for weapon possession or use. The mandatory five-year sentence on the weapon-use count runs consecutively, as required by law. <em>See</em> §5G1.2(a).&quot;.</p>
<p>Section 3D1.2 is amended by deleting the second sentence as follows:</p>
<p>&quot;A count for which the statute mandates imposition of a consecutive sentence is excluded from such Groups for purposes of §§3D1.2-3D1.5.&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §3D1.2 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended by deleting Note 1 as follows:</p>
<p>&quot;1. Counts for which the statute mandates imposition of a consecutive sentence are excepted from application of the multiple count rules. Convictions under such counts are excluded from the determination of the combined offense level. Convictions for 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) (use of firearm in commission of a crime of violence) provide a common example. Note that such a conviction usually does affect the offense level for other counts, however, in that in the event of such a conviction the specific offense characteristic for weapon use in the primary offense is to be disregarded. <em>See</em> Commentary to §2K2.4. Example: The defendant is convicted of one count of bank robbery in which he took $5,000 and discharged a weapon causing permanent bodily injury (18 U.S.C. § 2113), and one count of use of a firearm in the commission of a crime of violence (18 U.S.C. § 924(c)). The two counts are not grouped together, but the offense level for the bank robbery count is 28 (18 + 4 + 6) rather than 31. The mandatory five year sentence on the weapon-use count runs consecutively, as required by law.&quot;.</p>

<p>&quot;This provision does not authorize the grouping of offenses that cannot be considered to represent essentially one composite harm (<em>e.g.</em>, robbery of the same victim on different occasions involves multiple, separate instances of fear and risk of harm, not one composite harm).&quot;;</p>
<p>and by inserting the following as the second paragraph:</p>
<p>&quot;When one count charges a conspiracy or solicitation and the other charges a substantive offense that was the sole object of the conspiracy or solicitation, the counts will be grouped together under subsection (b).&quot;.</p>

<p>&quot;Counts involving offenses to which different offense guidelines apply are grouped together under subsection (d) if the offenses are of the same general type and otherwise meet the criteria for grouping under this subsection. In such cases, the offense guideline that results in the highest offense level is used; <em>see</em> §3D1.3(b). The ‘same general type’ of offense is to be construed broadly, and would include, for example, larceny, embezzlement, forgery, and fraud.&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This amendment clarifies the operation of §3D1.2(b), makes editorial improvements in §3D1.2(d), makes the listing of offenses in §3D1.2(d) more comprehensive, clarifies the interaction of §§ 3D1.2(d) and 3D1.3(b), and clarifies the Commentary of §3D1.2 by making explicit that offenses such as multiple robberies do not fit within the parameters of §3D1.2(b).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;2. Conviction by trial does not preclude a defendant from consideration under this section. A defendant may manifest sincere contrition even if he exercises his constitutional right to a trial. This may occur, for example, where a defendant goes to trial to assert and preserve issues that do not relate to factual guilt (<em>e.g.</em>, to make a constitutional challenge to a statute or a challenge to the applicability of a statute to his conduct).</p>
<p>3. A guilty plea may provide some evidence of the defendant’s acceptance of responsibility. However, it does not, by itself, entitle a defendant to a reduced sentence under this section.&quot;,</p>
<p>and inserting in lieu thereof:</p>
<p>&quot;2. This adjustment is not intended to apply to a defendant who puts the government to its burden of proof at trial by denying the essential factual elements of guilt, is convicted, and only then admits guilt and expresses remorse. Conviction by trial, however, does not automatically preclude a defendant from consideration for such a reduction. In rare situations a defendant may clearly demonstrate an acceptance of responsibility for his criminal conduct even though he exercises his constitutional right to a trial. This may occur, for example, where a defendant goes to trial to assert and preserve issues that do not relate to factual guilt (<em>e.g.</em>, to make a constitutional challenge to a statute or a challenge to the applicability of a statute to his conduct). In each such instance, however, a determination that a defendant has accepted responsibility will be based primarily upon pre-trial statements and conduct.</p>
<p>3. Entry of a plea of guilty prior to the commencement of trial combined with truthful admission of involvement in the offense and related conduct will constitute significant evidence of acceptance of responsibility for the purposes of this section. However, this evidence may be outweighed by conduct of the defendant that is inconsistent with such acceptance of responsibility.&quot;.</p>

<p>The Commentary to §4A1.2 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended by inserting the following additional notes:</p>
<p>&quot;12. <em>Local ordinance violations</em>. A number of local jurisdictions have enacted ordinances covering certain offenses (<em>e.g.</em>, larceny and assault misdemeanors) that are also violations of state criminal law. This enables a local court (<em>e.g.</em>, a municipal court) to exercise jurisdiction over such offenses. Such offenses are excluded from the definition of local ordinance violations in §4A1.2(c)(1) and, therefore, sentences for such offenses are to be treated as if the defendant had been convicted under state law.</p>
<p>13. <em>Insufficient funds check</em>. ‘Insufficient funds check,’ as used in §4A1.2(c)(1), does not include any conviction establishing that the defendant used a false name or non-existent account.&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This amendment clarifies that, for the purpose of computing criminal history points, there is no difference between the suspension of the &quot;imposition&quot; and &quot;execution&quot; of a prior sentence. This amendment also makes the provisions of §4A1.2(c)(1) more comprehensive in respect to certain vehicular offenses and clarifies the application of §4A1.2(c)(1) in respect to certain offenses prosecuted in municipal courts.

Convictions which the defendant shows to have been constitutionally invalid may not be counted in the criminal history score.

<p>&quot;<em>Background</em>: Prior sentences, not otherwise excluded, are to be counted in the criminal history score, including uncounseled misdemeanor sentences where imprisonment was not imposed.</p>
<p>The Commission leaves for court determination the issue of whether a defendant may collaterally attack at sentencing a prior conviction.&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This amendment clarifies the circumstances under which prior sentences are excluded from the criminal history score. In particular, the amendment clarifies the Commission’s intent regarding the counting of uncounseled misdemeanor convictions for which counsel constitutionally is not required because the defendant was not imprisoned. Lack of clarity regarding whether these prior sentences are to be counted may result not only in considerable disparity in guideline application, but also in the criminal history score not adequately reflecting the defendant’s failure to learn from the application of previous sanctions and his potential for recidivism. This amendment expressly states the Commission’s position that such convictions are to be counted for the purposes of criminal history under Chapter Four, Part A.</p>

<p>&quot;Where it is readily ascertainable that the defendant cannot, and is not likely to become able to, pay a fine greater than the maximum fine set forth in Column B of the Fine Table in subsection (c)(3), calculation of the alternative maximum fines under subsections (c)(2)(B) (twice the gross pecuniary loss caused by the offense) and (c)(2)(C) (three times the gross pecuniary gain to all participants in the offense) is unnecessary. In such cases, a statement that ‘the alternative maximums of the fine table were not calculated because it is readily ascertainable that the defendant cannot, and is not likely to become able to, pay a fine greater than the maximum set forth in the fine table’ is recommended in lieu of such calculations.</p>
<p>The determination of the fine guideline range may be dispensed with entirely upon a court determination of present and future inability to pay any fine. The inability of a defendant to post bail bond (having otherwise been determined eligible for release) and the fact that a defendant is represented by (or was determined eligible for) assigned counsel are significant indicators of present inability to pay any fine.

<p>&quot;CHAPTER SEVEN - VIOLATIONS OF PROBATION AND</p>
<p>SUPERVISED RELEASE</p>
<blockquote>
<p>§7A1.1. <em>Reporting of Violations of Probation and Supervised Release</em> (Policy Statement)</p>
<p>(a) The Probation Officer shall promptly report to the court any alleged violation of a condition of probation or supervised release that constitutes new criminal conduct, other than conduct that would constitute a petty offense.</p>
<p>(b) The Probation Officer shall promptly report to the court any other alleged violation of a condition of probation or supervised release, unless the officer determines: (1) that such violation is minor, not part of a continuing pattern of violation, and not indicative of a serious adjustment problem; and (2) that non-reporting will not present an undue risk to the public or be inconsistent with any directive of the court relative to the reporting of violations.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Commentary</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This policy statement addresses the reporting of violations of probation and supervised release. It is the Commission’s intent that significant violations be promptly reported to the court. At the same time, the Commission realizes that it would neither be practical nor desirable to require such reporting for every minor violation.</p>
<p>§7A1.2. <em>Revocation of Probation</em> (Policy Statement)</p>
<p>(a) Upon a finding of a violation of probation involving new criminal conduct, other than criminal conduct constituting a petty offense, the court shall revoke probation.</p>
<p>(b) Upon a finding of a violation of probation involving conduct other than conduct under subsection (a), the court may: (1) revoke probation; or (2) extend the term of probation and/or modify the conditions of probation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Commentary</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This policy statement expresses a presumption that probation is to be revoked in the case of new criminal conduct other than a petty offense. For lesser violations, the policy statements provide that the court may revoke probation, extend the term of supervision, or modify the conditions of supervision.</p>
<p>§7A1.3. <em>Revocation of Supervised Release</em> (Policy Statement)</p>
<p>(a) Upon a finding of a violation of supervised release involving new criminal conduct, other than criminal conduct constituting a petty offense, the court shall revoke supervised release.</p>
<p>(b) Upon a finding of a violation of supervised release involving conduct other than conduct under subsection (a), the court may: (1) revoke supervised release; or (2) extend the term of supervised release and/or modify the conditions of supervised release.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Commentary</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This policy statement expresses a presumption that supervised release is to be revoked in the case of new criminal conduct other than a petty offense. For lesser violations, the policy statements provide that the court may revoke supervised release, extend the term of supervision, or modify the conditions of supervision.</p>
<p>§7A1.4. <em>No Credit for Time Under Supervision</em> (Policy Statement)</p>
<p>(a) Upon revocation of probation, no credit shall be given (toward any sentence of imprisonment imposed) for any portion of the term of probation served prior to revocation.</p>
<p>(b) Upon revocation of supervised release, no credit shall be given (toward any term of imprisonment ordered) for time previously served on post-release supervision.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Commentary</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This policy statement provides that time served on probation or supervised release is not to be credited in the determination of any term of imprisonment imposed upon revocation.&quot;.</p>
<p>A replacement chapter containing policy statements with accompanying commentary is inserted as Chapter Seven (Violations of Probation and Supervised Release).</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This amendment replaces Chapter Seven with a set of more detailed policy statements applicable to violations of probation and supervised release. Under 28 U.S.C. § 994(a)(3), the Sentencing Commission is required to issue guidelines or policy statements applicable to the revocation of probation and supervised release. At this time, the Commission has chosen to promulgate policy statements only. These policy statements will provide guidance while allowing for the identification of any substantive or procedural issues that require further review. The Commission views these policy statements as evolutionary and will review relevant data and materials concerning revocation determinations under these policy statements. Revocation guidelines will be issued after federal judges, probation officers, practitioners, and others have the opportunity to evaluate and comment on these policy statements.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;(5) If the victim was kidnapped, abducted, or unlawfully restrained to facilitate the commission of another offense: (A) increase by 4 levels; or (B) if the result of applying this guideline is less than that resulting from application of the guideline for such other offense, apply the guideline for such other offense.&quot;,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and inserting in lieu thereof:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;(5) If the victim was sexually exploited, increase by 3 levels.</p>
<p>(6) If the victim is a minor and, in exchange for money or other consideration, was placed in the care or custody of another person who had no legal right to such care or custody of the victim, increase by 3 levels.</p>
<p>(7) If the victim was kidnapped, abducted, or unlawfully restrained during the commission of, or in connection with, another offense or escape therefrom; or if another offense was committed during the kidnapping, abduction, or unlawful restraint, increase to --</p>
<p>(A) the offense level from the Chapter Two offense guideline applicable to that other offense if such offense guideline includes an adjustment for kidnapping, abduction, or unlawful restraint, or otherwise takes such conduct into account; or</p>
<p>(B) 4 plus the offense level from the offense guideline applicable to that other offense, but in no event greater than level 43, in any other case,</p>
<p>if the resulting offense level is greater than that determined above.</p>
<p>(c) Cross Reference</p>
<p>(1) If the victim was killed under circumstances that would constitute murder under 18 U.S.C. § 1111 had such killing taken place within the territorial or maritime jurisdiction of the United States, apply §2A1.1 (First Degree Murder).&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §2A4.1 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended by inserting the following additional note:</p>
<p>&quot;4. ‘Sexually exploited’ includes offenses set forth in 18 U.S.C. §§ 2241-2244, 2251, and 2421-2423.&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §2A4.1 captioned &quot;Background&quot; is amended by inserting the following additional paragraph at the end:</p>
<p>&quot; Section 401 of Public Law 101-647 amended 18 U.S.C. § 1201 to require that courts take into account certain specific offense characteristics in cases involving a victim under eighteen years of age and directed the Commission to include those specific offense characteristics within the guidelines. Where the guidelines did not already take into account the conduct identified by the Act, additional specific offense characteristics have been provided.&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This amendment implements the instructions in Section 401 of the Crime Control Act of 1990 (Public Law 101-647), in some cases with a broader scope, by adding specific offense characteristics at subsections (b)(5) and (b)(6). With respect to the portion of the Congressional instruction pertaining to aiders or abettors, no amendment was required because §1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct) provides an offense level greater than that required by the Congressional instruction. A separate amendment (amendment 388) clarifies that maltreatment to a life threatening degree constitutes life-threatening bodily injury. In addition, this amendment replaces the current subsection (b)(5) with a revised subsection (b)(7) that addresses other offenses connected with kidnapping, abduction, or unlawful restraint in a manner that more appropriately reflects the combined seriousness of such offenses, and inserts a cross reference to address the case in which the victim was murdered.</p>

<p>6. In certain cases, an extortionate demand may be accompanied by conduct that does not qualify as a display of a dangerous weapon under subsection (b)(3)(A)(v) but is nonetheless similar in seriousness, demonstrating the defendant’s preparation or ability to carry out the threatened harm (<em>e.g.</em>, an extortionate demand containing a threat to tamper with a consumer product accompanied by a workable plan showing how the product’s tamper-resistant seals could be defeated, or a threat to kidnap a person accompanied by information showing study of that person’s daily routine).

<p>The Commentary to §2C1.1 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended by deleting Note 2 as follows:</p>
<p>&quot;2. ‘Value of the bribe or the benefit received, or to be received, in return for the bribe’ means the greater of the value of the bribe or the value of the benefit received, or to be received, in return for the bribe. The ‘value of the benefit received or to be received’ means the net value of such benefit. For example, if a $150,000 contract on which $20,000 profit was made was awarded in return for a bribe, the value of the benefit received in return is $20,000.&quot;,</p>
<p>and inserting in lieu thereof:</p>
<p>&quot;2. ‘Loss’ is discussed in the Commentary to §2B1.1 (Larceny, Embezzlement, and Other Forms of Theft) and includes both actual and intended loss. The value of ‘the benefit received or to be received’ means the net value of such benefit. <em>Examples</em>: (1) A government employee, in return for a $500 bribe, reduces the price of a piece of surplus property offered for sale by the government from $10,000 to $2,000; the value of the benefit received is $8,000. (2) A $150,000 contract on which $20,000 profit was made was awarded in return for a bribe; the value of the benefit received is $20,000. Do not deduct the value of the bribe itself in computing the value of the benefit received or to be received. In the above examples, therefore, the value of the benefit received would be the same regardless of the value of the bribe.&quot;;</p>
<p>The Commentary to §2C1.1 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended in Note 3 by deleting &quot;§2C1.1(c)(1) or (2).&quot; and inserting in lieu thereof &quot;§2C1.1(c)(1), (2), or (3). In such cases, an adjustment from §3B1.3 (Abuse of Position of Trust or Use of Special Skill) may apply.&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §2C1.1 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended in Note 4 by deleting &quot;bribe&quot; and inserting in lieu thereof &quot;unlawful payment&quot;; and by deleting &quot;and (2)&quot; and inserting in lieu thereof &quot;, (2), and (3)&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §2C1.1 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended in Note 6 by inserting the following as the first sentence:</p>
<p>&quot;Subsection (b)(1) provides an adjustment for offenses involving more than one incident of either bribery or extortion.&quot;;</p>
<p>by deleting &quot;bribe&quot; the first time it occurs and inserting in lieu thereof &quot;incident of bribery or extortion&quot;; and by inserting &quot;or extortion&quot; immediately before &quot;, even if charged&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §2C1.1 captioned &quot;Background&quot; is amended by deleting the third paragraph as follows:</p>
<p>&quot; The amount of the bribe is used as a factor in the guideline not because it directly measures harm to society, but because it is improbable that a large bribe would be given for a favor of little consequence. Moreover, for deterrence purposes, the punishment should be commensurate with the gain.&quot;,</p>
<p>and inserting in lieu thereof:</p>
<p>&quot; In determining the net value of the benefit received or to be received, the value of the bribe is not deducted from the gross value of such benefit; the harm is the same regardless of value of the bribe paid to receive the benefit. Where the value of the bribe exceeds the value of the benefit or the value of the benefit cannot be determined, the value of the bribe is used because it is likely that the payer of such a bribe expected something in return that would be worth more than the value of the bribe. Moreover, for deterrence purposes, the punishment should be commensurate with the gain to the payer or the recipient of the bribe, whichever is higher.&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §2C1.1 captioned &quot;Background&quot; is amended in the fourth paragraph by deleting &quot;bribe is&quot; and inserting in lieu thereof &quot;payment was&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §2C1.1 captioned &quot;Background&quot; is amended by deleting the fifth, sixth, and seventh paragraphs as follows:</p>
<p>&quot;Under §2C1.1(c)(1), if the purpose of the bribe involved the facilitation of another criminal offense or the obstruction of justice in respect to another criminal offense, the guideline for §2X3.1 (Accessory After the Fact) in respect to that criminal offense will be applied, if the result is greater than that determined above. For example, if a bribe was given for the purpose of facilitating or covering up the offense of espionage, the guideline for accessory after the fact to espionage would be applied.</p>
<p>Under §2C1.1(c)(2), if the offense involved forcible extortion, the guideline from §2B3.2 (Extortion by Force or Threat of Injury or Serious Damage) will apply if the result is greater than that determined above.</p>
<p>Note that, when applying 2C1.1(c)(1) or (2), an adjustment from Chapter Three, Part B (Role in the Offense) will also apply. This normally will result in an increase of at least 2 levels.&quot;,</p>
<p>and inserting in lieu thereof:</p>
<p>&quot; Under §2C1.1(c)(1), if the payment was to facilitate the commission of another criminal offense, the guideline applicable to a conspiracy to commit that other offense will apply if the result is greater than that determined above. For example, if a bribe was given to a law enforcement officer to allow the smuggling of a quantity of cocaine, the guideline for conspiracy to import cocaine would be applied if it resulted in a greater offense level.</p>
<p>Under §2C1.1(c)(2), if the payment was to conceal another criminal offense or obstruct justice in respect to another criminal offense, the guideline from §2X3.1 (Accessory After the Fact) or §2J1.2 (Obstruction of Justice), as appropriate, will apply if the result is greater than that determined above. For example, if a bribe was given for the purpose of concealing the offense of espionage, the guideline for accessory after the fact to espionage would be applied.</p>
<p>Under §2C1.1(c)(3), if the offense involved forcible extortion, the guideline from §2B3.2 (Extortion by Force or Threat of Injury or Serious Damage) will apply if the result is greater than that determined above.</p>
<p>When the offense level is determined under §2C1.1(c)(1), (2), or (3), an adjustment from §3B1.3 (Abuse of Position of Trust or Use of Special Skill) may apply.&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This amendment adds an additional factor in subsection (b)(2)(A) to take into account loss to the government from the offense; expands subsection (c) to distinguish an offense committed for the purpose of facilitating the commission of another offense from an offense committed to cover up or obstruct justice in respect to another offense; clarifies the term &quot;value of the benefit received&quot;; and substitutes &quot;payment&quot; for &quot;bribe&quot; and adds &quot;or extortion&quot; where necessary to reflect that this guideline covers both bribery and extortion under color of official right.</p>

<p>Section 2D1.1(c) is amended in the note following subdivision (19) by inserting the following additional paragraph at the end:</p>

<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This amendment adds offenses involving anabolic steroids to §2D1.1 to reflect that Title XIX of the Crime Control Act of 1990 (Public Law 101-647) reclassified anabolic steroids as Schedule III controlled substances under 21 U.S.C. § 812(c). Because of the variety of substances involved, the Commission has determined that a measure based on quantity unit, rather than weight, provides the most appropriate measure of the scale of the offense.</p>

<p><em>Statutory Provisions</em>: 18 U.S.C. § 922(a)(1), (a)(3), (a)(4), (a)(6), (e), (f), (g), (h), (i), (j), (k), (l), (n), and (o); 26 U.S.C. § 5861(b), (c), (d), (h), (i), (j), and (k). For additional statutory provision(s), <em>see</em> Appendix A (Statutory Index).</p>
<p><em>Application Notes</em>:</p>
<p>1. The definition of ‘firearm’ used in this section is that set forth in 18 U.S.C. § 921(a)(3) (if the defendant is convicted under 18 U.S.C. § 922) and 26 U.S.C. § 5845(a) (if the defendant is convicted under 26 U.S.C. § 5861). These definitions are somewhat broader than that used in Application Note 1(e) of the Commentary to §1B1.1 (Application Instructions). Under 18 U.S.C. § 921(a)(3), the term ‘firearm’ means (A) any weapon (including a starter gun) which will or is designed to or may readily be converted to expel a projectile by the action of an explosive; (B) the frame or receiver of any such weapon; (C) any firearm muffler or firearm silencer; or (D) any destructive device. Under 26 U.S.C. § 5845(a), the term ‘firearm’ includes a shotgun, or a weapon made from a shotgun, with a barrel or barrels of less than 18 inches in length; a weapon made from a shotgun or rifle with an overall length of less than 26 inches; a rifle, or weapon made from a rifle, with a barrel or barrels less than 16 inches in length; a machine gun; a muffler or silencer for a firearm; a destructive device; and certain other large bore weapons.</p>
<p>2. Under §2K2.1(b)(1), intended lawful use, as determined by the surrounding circumstances, provides a decrease in the offense level. Relevant circumstances include, among others, the number and type of firearms (sawed-off shotguns, for example, have few legitimate uses) and ammunition, the location and circumstances of possession, the nature of the defendant’s criminal history (<em>e.g.</em>, whether involving firearms), and the extent to which possession was restricted by local law.</p>
<p><em>Background</em>: Under pre-guidelines practice, there was substantial sentencing variation for these crimes. From the Commission’s investigations, it appeared that the variation was attributable primarily to the wide variety of circumstances under which these offenses occur. Apart from the nature of the defendant’s criminal history, his actual or intended use of the firearm was probably the most important factor in determining the sentence.</p>
<p>Statistics showed that pre-guidelines sentences averaged two to three months lower if the firearm involved was a rifle or an unaltered shotgun. This may reflect the fact that these weapons tend to be more suitable than others for recreational activities. However, some rifles or shotguns may be possessed for criminal purposes, while some handguns may be suitable primarily for recreation. Therefore, the guideline is not based upon the type of firearm. Intended lawful use, as determined by the surrounding circumstances, is a mitigating factor.</p>
<p>Available pre-guidelines data were not sufficient to determine the effect a stolen firearm had on the average sentence. However, reviews of pre-guidelines cases suggested that this factor tended to result in more severe sentences. Independent studies show that stolen firearms are used dispropor­tionately in the commission of crimes.</p>
<p>The firearm statutes often are used as a device to enable the federal court to exercise jurisdiction over offenses that otherwise could be prosecuted only under state law. For example, a convicted felon may be prosecuted for possessing a firearm if he used the firearm to rob a gasoline station. In pre-guidelines practice, such prosecutions resulted in high sentences because of the true nature of the underlying conduct. The cross reference at §2K2.1(c)(2) deals with such cases.</p>
<p>§2K2.2. <em>Unlawful Trafficking and Other Prohibited Transactions Involving Firearms</em></p>
<p>(a) Base Offense Level:</p>
<p>(1) 18, if the defendant is convicted under 18 U.S.C. § 922(o) or 26 U.S.C. § 5861;</p>
<p>(2) 6, otherwise.</p>
<p>(b) Specific Offense Characteristics</p>
<p>(1) If the offense involved distribution of a firearm, or possession with intent to distribute, and the number of firearms unlawfully distributed, or to be distributed, exceeded two, increase as follows:</p>
<p><em>Number of Firearms</em> <em>Increase in Level</em></p>
<p>(A) 3 ‑ 4 add 1</p>
<p>(B) 5 ‑ 7 add 2</p>
<p>(C) 8 ‑ 12 add 3</p>
<p>(D) 13 ‑ 24 add 4</p>
<p>(E) 25 - 49 add 5</p>
<p>(F) 50 or more add 6.</p>
<p>(2) If any of the firearms was stolen or had an altered or obliterated serial number, increase by 2 levels.</p>
<p>(3) If more than one of the following applies, use the greater:</p>
<p>(A) If the defendant is convicted under 18 U.S.C. § 922(d), increase by 6 levels; or</p>
<p>(B) If the defendant is convicted under 18 U.S.C. § 922(b)(1) or (b)(2), increase by 1 level.</p>
<p>(c) Cross Reference</p>
<p>(1) If the defendant, at the time of the offense, had been convicted in any court of a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, apply §2K2.1 (Unlawful Receipt, Possession, or Transportation of Firearms or Ammunition) if the resulting offense level is greater than that determined above.</p>

<p><em>Application Notes</em>:</p>
<p>1. The definition of ‘firearm’ used in this section is that set forth in 18 U.S.C. § 921(a)(3) (if the defendant is convicted under 18 U.S.C. § 922) and 26 U.S.C. § 5845(a) (if the defendant is convicted under 26 U.S.C § 5861). These definitions are somewhat broader than that used in Application Note 1(e) of the Commentary to §1B1.1 (Application Instructions). Under 18 U.S.C. § 921(a)(3), the term ‘firearm’ means (A) any weapon (including a starter gun) which will or is designed to or may readily be converted to expel a projectile by the action of an explosive; (B) the frame or receiver of any such weapon; (C) any firearm muffler or firearm silencer; or (D) any destructive device. Under 26 U.S.C. § 5845(a), the term ‘firearm’ includes a shotgun, or a weapon made from a shotgun, with a barrel or barrels of less than 18 inches in length; a weapon made from a shotgun or rifle with an overall length of less than 26 inches; a rifle, or weapon made from a rifle, with a barrel or barrels less than 16 inches in length; a machine gun; a muffler or silencer for a firearm; a destructive device; and certain other large bore weapons.</p>
<p>2. If the number of weapons involved exceeded fifty, an upward departure may be warranted. An upward departure especially may be warranted in the case of large numbers of military type weapons (<em>e.g.</em>, machine guns, automatic weapons, assault rifles).</p>
<p><em>Background</em>: This guideline applies to a variety of offenses involving firearms, ranging from unlawful distribution of silencers, machine guns, sawed-off shotguns and destructive devices, to essentially technical violations.</p>

<p>6. ‘Deported after a conviction,’ as used in subsections (b)(1) and (b)(2), means that the deportation was subsequent to the conviction, whether or not the deportation was in response to such conviction.</p>
<p>7. ‘Aggravated felony,’ as used in subsection (b)(2), means murder; any illicit trafficking in any controlled substance (as defined in 21 U.S.C. § 802), including any drug trafficking crime as defined in 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(2); any illicit trafficking in any firearms or destructive devices as defined in 18 U.S.C. § 921; any offense described in 18 U.S.C. § 1956 (relating to laundering of monetary instruments); any crime of violence (as defined in 18 U.S.C. § 16, not including a purely political offense) for which the term of imprisonment imposed (regardless of any suspension of such imprisonment) is at least five years; or any attempt or conspiracy to commit any such act. The term ‘aggravated felony’ applies to offenses described in the previous sentence whether in violation of federal or state law and also applies to offenses described in the previous sentence in violation of foreign law for which the term of imprisonment was completed within the previous 15 years. <em>See</em> 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43).&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This amendment adds a specific offense characteristic providing an increase of 16 levels above the base offense level under §2L1.2 for defendants who reenter the United States after having been deported subsequent to a conviction for an aggravated felony. Previously, such cases were addressed by a recommendation for consideration of an upward departure. This amendment also modifies §2L1.1 to provide a base offense level of 20 for a defendant who is convicted under 8 U.S.C. § 1327 for an offense involving the smuggling, transporting, or harboring of an alien who was deported after a conviction for an aggravated felony. The Commission has determined that these increased offense levels are appropriate to reflect the serious nature of these offenses. In addition, this amendment revises the Commentary to §2L1.2 to make the statutory reference more precise, and to clarify the operation of the guidelines in respect to prior criminal history.</p>

<p>The Commentary to §2R1.1 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended by deleting:</p>
<p>&quot;1. Because the guideline sentences depend on the volume of commerce done by each firm, role in the offense is implicitly taken into account. Accordingly, the provisions of §3B1.1 (Aggravating Role) are to be applied only in unusual circumstances. An increase for role under §3B1.1 might be appropriate only where a defendant actually coerced others into participating in a conspiracy -- an unusual circumstance. Conversely, a decrease for role under §3B1.2 (Mitigating Role) would not be appropriate merely because an individual defendant or his firm did not profit substantially from the violation. An individual defendant should be considered for a downward adjustment for a mitigating role in the offense only if he was responsible in some minor way for his firm’s participation in the conspiracy. A complementary bidder who did not win a bid would not for that reason qualify for a downward adjustment, but a low-level employee who participated in only one of several agreements constituting a conspiracy would.&quot;,</p>
<p>and inserting in lieu thereof:</p>
<p>&quot;1. The provisions of §3B1.1 (Aggravating Role) and §3B1.2 (Mitigating Role) should be applied to an individual defendant as appropriate to reflect the individual’s role in committing the offense. For example, if a sales manager organizes or leads the price-fixing activity of five or more participants, a 4-level increase is called for under §3B1.1. An individual defendant should be considered for a downward adjustment under §3B1.2 for a mitigating role in the offense only if he was responsible in some minor way for his firm’s participation in the conspiracy.&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §2R1.1 captioned &quot;Background&quot; is amended in the third paragraph by deleting &quot;four&quot; and inserting in lieu thereof &quot;six&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §2R1.1 captioned &quot;Background&quot; is amended by deleting the fourth paragraph as follows:</p>
<p>&quot; The guideline impris­onment terms represent a substantial change from pre-guidelines practice. Under pre-guidelines practice, approximately 39 percent of all individuals convicted of antitrust violations were imprisoned. Considering all defendants sentenced, the average time served under pre-guidelines practice was only forty-five days. The guideline prison terms are, however, consistent with the parole guidelines. The fines specified in the guideline represent substantial increases over pre-guidelines practice. Under pre-guidelines practice, the average fine for individuals was only approxi­mately $27,000; for corporations, it was approximately $160,000.&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This amendment increases the offense levels for antitrust violations to make them more comparable to the offense levels for fraud with similar amounts of loss. The base offense level for antitrust violations starts higher than the base offense level for fraud violations to reflect the serious nature of and the difficulty of detecting such violations, but the offense levels for antitrust offenses based on volume of commerce increase less rapidly than the offense levels for fraud, in part, because, on the average, the level of mark-up from an antitrust violation may tend to decline with the volume of commerce involved. This amendment also reduces the minimum guideline fine level based on the volume of commerce to reflect a marginal shift from fines to imprisonment as the more effective means to deter antitrust offenses. The provision addressing fines for organizational defendants in the current guideline is deleted. Such fines are addressed by the provisions pertaining to the sentencing of organizational defendants that are added by a separate amendment (amendment 422).</p>

In addition, this amendment creates an additional offense guideline (§2S1.4) for offenses involving Currency and Monetary Instrument Reports (CMIR). Currently, such offenses are covered by §2S1.3, which deals with all currency transaction reporting requirements. CMIR violations are committed by individuals who, when entering or leaving the country, knowingly conceal $10,000 or more in cash or bearer instruments on their persons or in their personal effects and knowingly fail to file the report required by the U.S. Customs Service. Such criminal conduct is sufficiently different from the other offenses covered by §2S1.3 to merit treatment in a separate guideline.</p>

<p>For the purposes of §4A1.1(d), a defendant who commits the instant offense while a violation warrant from a prior sentence is outstanding (<em>e.g.</em>, a probation, parole, or supervised release violation warrant) shall be deemed to be under a criminal justice sentence if that sentence is otherwise countable, even if that sentence would have expired absent such warrant.</p>
<p>(n) <em>Failure to Report for Service of Sentence of Imprisonment</em></p>
<p>For the purposes of §4A1.1(d) and (e), failure to report for service of a sentence of imprisonment shall be treated as an escape from such sentence.</p>
<p>(o) <em>Felony Offense</em></p>
<p>For the purposes of §4A1.2(c), a ‘felony offense’ means any federal, state, or local offense punishable by death or a term of imprisonment exceeding one year, regardless of the actual sentence imposed.&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §4A1.2 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended in Note 1 by inserting the following additional paragraph:</p>
<p>&quot;Under §4A1.2(a)(4), a conviction for which the defendant has not yet been sentenced is treated as if it were a prior sentence under §4A1.1(c) if a sentence resulting from such conviction otherwise would have been counted. In the case of an offense set forth in §4A1.2(c)(1) (which lists certain misdemeanor and petty offenses), a conviction for which the defendant has not yet been sentenced is treated as if it were a prior sentence under §4A1.2(a)(4) only where the offense is similar to the instant offense (because sentences for other offenses set forth in §4A1.2(c)(1) are counted only if they are of a specified type and length).&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §4A1.2 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended in Note 2 by inserting, immediately after &quot;stated maximum&quot;, the following:</p>
<p>&quot;(<em>e.g.</em>, in the case of a determinate sentence of five years, the stated maximum is five years; in the case of an indeterminate sentence of one to five years, the stated maximum is five years; in the case of an indeterminate sentence for a term not to exceed five years, the stated maximum is five years; in the case of an indeterminate sentence for a term not to exceed the defendant’s twenty-first birthday, the stated maximum is the amount of time in pre-trial detention plus the amount of time between the date of sentence and the defendant’s twenty-first birthday)&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §4A1.2 is amended in Note 11 by inserting the following additional paragraph at the end:</p>
<p>&quot;Where a revocation applies to multiple sentences, and such sentences are counted separately under §4A1.2(a)(2), add the term of imprisonment imposed upon revocation to the sentence that will result in the greatest increase in criminal history points. <em>Example</em>: A defendant was serving two probationary sentences, each counted separately under §4A1.2(a)(2); probation was revoked on both sentences as a result of the same violation conduct; and the defendant was sentenced to a total of 45 days of imprisonment. If one sentence had been a ‘straight’ probationary sentence and the other had been a probationary sentence that had required service of 15 days of imprisonment, the revocation term of imprisonment (45 days) would be added to the probationary sentence that had the 15-day term of imprisonment. This would result in a total of 2 criminal history points under §4A1.1(b) (for the combined 60-day term of imprisonment) and 1 criminal history point under §4A1.1(c) (for the other probationary sentence).&quot;.</p>
<p>Section 4A1.3(d) is amended by deleting &quot;, sentencing, or appeal&quot; and inserting in lieu thereof &quot;or sentencing&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This amendment clarifies the meaning of the term &quot;under a criminal justice sentence&quot; as used in §4A1.1; inserts a new subdivision in §4A1.2(a) to address the case in which the defendant has been convicted of a prior offense, but has not yet been sentenced for that offense; inserts an additional subdivision in §4A1.2(k) to clarify the determination of the applicable time periods in revocation cases; inserts additional subsections in §4A1.2 to address the counting of sentences stayed pending appeal, the effect of a violation warrant on the counting of points under §4A1.1(d), the counting of a failure to report for service of sentence under §4A1.1(d) and (e), and the definition of a felony offense as used in §4A1.2(c); adds an example to Application Note 2 in the Commentary to §4A1.2 to illustrate the meaning of &quot;stated maximum&quot; sentence; adds an additional application note in the Commentary to §4A1.2 addressing the counting of points in complex revocation cases; and conforms the Commentary of §4A1.3 to the addition of §4A1.2(l).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;(f) Add 1 point for each prior sentence resulting from a conviction of a crime of violence that did not receive any points under (a), (b), or (c) above because such sentence was considered related to another sentence resulting from a conviction of a crime of violence, up to a total of 3 points for this item. <em>Provided</em>, that this item does not apply where the sentences are considered related because the offenses occurred on the same occasion.&quot;.</p>
<p>Section 4A1.1 is amended in the first sentence by deleting &quot;(e)&quot; and inserting in lieu thereof &quot;(f)&quot;.</p>
<p>Section 4A1.1(c) is amended by deleting &quot;included&quot; and inserting in lieu thereof &quot;counted&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §4A1.1 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended by inserting the following additional note:</p>
<p>&quot;6. <em>§4A1.1(f)</em>. Where the defendant received two or more prior sentences as a result of convictions for crimes of violence that are treated as related cases but did not arise from the same occasion (<em>i.e.</em>, offenses committed on different occasions that were part of a single common scheme or plan or were consolidated for trial or sentencing; <em>see</em> Application Note 3 of the Commentary to §4A1.2), one point is added under §4A1.1(f) for each such sentence that did not result in any additional points under §4A1.1(a), (b), or (c). A total of up to 3 points may be added under §4A1.1(f). ‘Crime of violence’ is defined in §4B1.2(1); <em>see</em> §4A1.2(p).</p>
<p>For example, a defendant’s criminal history includes two robbery convictions for offenses committed on different occasions that were consolidated for sentencing and therefore are treated as related. If the defendant received a five-year sentence of imprisonment for one robbery and a four-year sentence of imprisonment for the other robbery (consecutively or concurrently), a total of 3 points is added under §4A1.1(a). An additional point is added under §4A1.1(f) because the second sentence did not result in any additional point(s) (under §4A1.1(a), (b), or (c)). In contrast, if the defendant received a one-year sentence of imprisonment for one robbery and a nine-month consecutive sentence of imprisonment for the other robbery, a total of 3 points also is added under §4A1.1(a) (a one-year sentence of imprisonment and a consecutive nine-month sentence of imprisonment are treated as a combined one-year-nine-month sentence of imprisonment). But no additional point is added under §4A1.1(f) because the sentence for the second robbery already resulted in an additional point under §4A1.1(a). Without the second sentence, the defendant would only have received two points under §4A1.1(b) for the one-year sentence of imprisonment).&quot;.</p>
<p>Section 4A1.2(a)(2) is amended by deleting &quot;the criminal history&quot; and inserting in lieu thereof &quot;§4A1.1(a), (b), and (c)&quot;.</p>
<p>Section 4A1.2 is amended by inserting the following additional subsection:</p>
<p>&quot;(p) <em>Crime of Violence Defined</em></p>
<p>For the purposes of §4A1.1(f), the definition of ‘crime of violence’ is that set forth in §4B1.2(1).&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §4A1.2 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended in Note 3 by deleting:</p>
<p>&quot;Cases are considered related if they (1) occurred on a single occasion,&quot;,</p>
<p>and inserting in lieu thereof:</p>
<p>&quot;Prior sentences are not considered related if they were for offenses that were separated by an intervening arrest (<em>i.e.</em>, the defendant is arrested for the first offense prior to committing the second offense). Otherwise, prior sentences are considered related if they resulted from offenses that (1) occurred on the same occasion,&quot;;</p>
<p>and by deleting:</p>
<p>&quot;For example, if the defendant commits a number of offenses on independent occasions separated by arrests, and the resulting criminal cases are consolidated and result in a combined sentence of eight years, counting merely three points for this factor will not adequately reflect either the seriousness of the defendant’s criminal history or the frequency with which he commits crimes. In such circumstances, the court should consider whether departure is warranted. <em>See</em> §4A1.3.&quot;,</p>
<p>and inserting in lieu thereof:</p>
<p>&quot;For example, if a defendant was convicted of a number of serious non-violent offenses committed on different occasions, and the resulting sentences were treated as related because the cases were consolidated for sentencing, the assignment of a single set of points may not adequately reflect the seriousness of the defendant’s criminal history or the frequency with which he has committed crimes. In such circumstances, an upward departure may be warranted. Note that the above example refers to serious non-violent offenses. Where prior related sentences result from convictions of crimes of violence, §4A1.1(f) will apply.&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This amendment provides for a specific enhancement under §4A1.2(f) in certain cases having prior convictions of crimes of violence not arising from the same incident that otherwise would be treated as related under §4A1.2. In addition, the definition of related cases in Application Note 3 in the Commentary to §4A1.2 is amended to provide that cases separated by an intervening arrest for one of the offenses are not treated as related cases.</p>

<p>&quot;(a) Restitution shall be ordered for convictions under Title 18 of the United States Code or under 49 U.S.C. § 1472(h), (i), (j) or (n) in accordance with 18 U.S.C. § 3663(d), and may be ordered as a condition of probation or supervised release in any other case.&quot;,</p>

<p>(2) Except as specified in (4) below, the maximum of the fine range is the amount shown in column B of the table below.&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §5E1.2 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended in Note 3 by deleting the first two paragraphs as follows:</p>
<p>&quot;Alternative fine limits are provided in subsection (c). The terms ‘pecuniary gain’ and ‘pecuniary loss’ are taken from 18 U.S.C. § 3571(d). The Commission does not intend precise or detailed calculation of the gain or loss in using the alternative fine limits.</p>
<p>Where it is readily ascertainable that the defendant cannot, and is not likely to become able to, pay a fine greater than the maximum fine set forth in Column B of the Fine Table in subsection (c)(3), calculation of the alternative maximum fines under subsections (c)(2)(B) (twice the gross pecuniary loss caused by the offense) and (c)(2)(C) (three times the gross pecuniary gain to all participants in the offense) is unnecessary. In such cases, a statement that ‘the alternative maximums of the fine table were not calculated because it is readily ascertainable that the defendant cannot, and is not likely to become able to, pay a fine greater than the maximum set forth in the fine table’ is recommended in lieu of such calculations.&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §5E1.2 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended by deleting:</p>
<p>&quot;4. ‘Restitution made or ordered’ refers to restitution for the instant offense made before or at the time of sentencing, as well as any restitution ordered at the time of sentencing for the instant offense.&quot;,</p>
<p>and inserting in lieu thereof:</p>
<p>&quot;4. The Commission envisions that for most defendants, the maximum of the guideline fine range from subsection (c) will be at least twice the amount of gain or loss resulting from the offense. Where, however, two times either the amount of gain to the defendant or the amount of loss caused by the offense exceeds the maximum of the fine guideline, an upward departure from the fine guideline may be warranted.</p>
<p>Moreover, where a sentence within the applicable fine guideline range would not be sufficient to ensure both the disgorgement of any gain from the offense that otherwise would not be disgorged (<em>e.g.</em>, by restitution or forfeiture) and an adequate punitive fine, an upward departure from the fine guideline range may be warranted.&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §5E1.2 captioned &quot;Background&quot; is deleted in its entirety as follows:</p>
<p>&quot;<em>Background</em>: These guidelines permit a relatively wide range of fines. The Commission may promulgate more detailed guidelines for the imposition of fines after analyzing practice under these initial guidelines.</p>
<p>Recent legislation provides for substantial increases in fines. 18 U.S.C. § 3571(b). With few restrictions, 42 U.S.C. § 10601(b), and (c) authorize fine payments up to $100 million to be deposited in the Crime Victims Fund in the United States Treasury. With vigorous enforcement, higher fines should be effective punitive and deterrent sanctions.</p>
<p>A larger multiple of the gain than of the loss is used in subsection (c)(2) because most offenses result in losses to society that exceed the gain to the participants. In addition, in many such cases restitution will not be feasible. These larger fines authorized under subsection (c)(2) are, of course, subject to the absolute limits on fines that are imposed by statute.</p>
<p>The Commission has not attempted to define gain or loss precisely. It is expected that the terms will be used flexibly and consistently with their use in the criminal code, including former 18 U.S.C. § 3623(c)(1).&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This amendment is designed to simplify the operation of this guideline and conserve probation and court resources by eliminating the need for the determination of loss and gain under this section in most cases. Experience has shown that for the vast majority of defendants, the amount from the fine table in subsection (c)(3) or the amount from subsection (c)(4), as applicable, is more than twice the gain or loss from the offense. This amendment provides that the guideline fine range is to be determined from subsection (c)(3) or (c)(4), as applicable. In the unusual case in which twice the defendant’s gain from the offense or twice the loss caused by the offense exceeds the maximum of the guideline range, an upward departure may be considered.</p>

<p>Under this guideline, the court shall impose a consecutive sentence where the instant offense (or any part thereof) was committed while the defendant was serving an unexpired term of imprisonment.</p>
<p>Where the defendant is serving an unexpired term of imprisonment, but did not commit the instant offense while serving that term of imprisonment, the sentence for the instant offense may be imposed to run consecutively or concurrently with the unexpired term of imprisonment. The court may consider imposing a sentence for the instant offense that results in a combined sentence that approximates the total punishment that would have been imposed under §5G1.2 (Sentencing on Multiple Counts of Conviction) had all of the offenses been federal offenses for which sentences were being imposed at the same time. Where the defendant is serving a term of imprisonment for a state offense, the information available may permit only a rough estimate of the total punishment that would have been imposed under the guidelines.

<p>Drug dependence or alcohol abuse is not a reason for imposing a sentence below the guidelines. Substance abuse is highly correlated to an increased propensity to commit crime. Due to this increased risk, it is highly recommended that a defendant who is incarcerated also be sentenced to supervised release with a requirement that the defendant participate in an appropriate substance abuse program.

In addition, this amendment adds language that expressly states that the guidelines do not apply to defendants sentenced as juvenile delinquents; and sets forth the Commission’s position that physical appearance, including physique, military, civic, charitable, or public service, employment-related contributions, and record of prior good works are not ordinarily relevant in determining whether a sentence should be outside the applicable guideline range.</p>

<p>The Commentary to §1B1.3 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended in Note 2 by inserting the following additional paragraph at the end:</p>
<p>&quot;As noted above, subsection (a)(2) applies to offenses of a character for which §3D1.2(d) would require grouping of multiple counts, had the defendant been convicted of multiple counts. For example, the defendant sells 30 grams of cocaine (a violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841) on one occasion and, as part of the same course of conduct or common scheme or plan, attempts to sell an additional 15 grams of cocaine (a violation of 21 U.S.C. 846) on another occasion. The defendant is convicted of one count charging the completed sale of 30 grams of cocaine. The two offenses (sale of cocaine and attempted sale of cocaine), although covered by different statutory provisions, are of a character for which §3D1.2(d) would require the grouping of counts, had the defendant been convicted of both counts. Therefore, subsection (a)(2) applies and the total amount of cocaine (45 grams) involved is used to determine the offense level.&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §1B1.3 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended in Note 4 by inserting &quot;; Property Damage by Use of Explosives&quot; immediately following &quot;Arson&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §1B1.3 captioned &quot;Application Notes is amended in Note 5 by deleting:</p>
<p>&quot;<em>E.g.</em>, in §2K2.2, a base offense level of 16 is used ‘if the defendant is convicted under 18 U.S.C. § 922(o) or 26 U.S.C. § 5861.’&quot;,</p>
<p>and inserting in lieu thereof:</p>
<p>&quot;For example, in §2K1.5, subsection (b)(1) applies ‘If the defendant is convicted under 49 U.S.C. § 1472(l)(2).’&quot;;</p>
<p>by deleting:</p>
<p>&quot;Examples of this usage are found in §2K1.3(b)(4) (‘If the defendant was a person prohibited from receiving explosives under 18 U.S.C. § 842(i), or if the defendant knowingly distributed explosives to a person prohibited from receiving explosives under 18 U.S.C. § 842(i), increase by 10 levels’); and&quot;,</p>
<p>and inserting in lieu thereof &quot;An example of this usage is found in&quot;; and by inserting the following additional paragraph at the end:</p>
<p>&quot;An express direction to apply a particular factor only if the defendant was convicted of a particular statute includes the determination of the offense level where the defendant was convicted of conspiracy, attempt, solicitation, aiding or abetting, accessory after the fact, or misprision of felony in respect to that particular statute. For example, §2K1.5(b)(1) (which is applicable only if the defendant is convicted under 49 U.S.C. § 1472(l)(2)) would be applied in determining the offense level under §2X3.1 (Accessory After the Fact) where the defendant was convicted of accessory after the fact to a violation of 49 U.S.C. § 1472(l)(2).&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §1B1.3 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended by inserting the following additional notes:</p>
<p>&quot;6. In the case of a partially completed offense (<em>e.g.</em>, an offense involving an attempted theft of $800,000 and a completed theft of $30,000), the offense level is to be determined in accordance with §2X1.1 (Attempt, Solicitation, or Conspiracy) whether the conviction is for the substantive offense, the inchoate offense (attempt, solicitation, or conspiracy), or both. <em>See</em> Application Note 4 in the Commentary to §2X1.1. Note, however, that Application Note 4 is not applicable where the offense level is determined under §2X1.1(c)(1).</p>
<p>7. For the purposes of subsection (a)(2), offense conduct associated with a sentence that was imposed prior to the acts or omissions constituting the instant federal offense (the offense of conviction) is not considered as part of the same course of conduct or common scheme or plan as the offense of conviction.</p>
<p><em>Examples</em>: (1) The defendant was convicted for the sale of cocaine and sentenced to state prison. Immediately upon release from prison, he again sold cocaine to the same person, using the same accomplices and <em>modus operandi</em>. The instant federal offense (the offense of conviction) charges this latter sale. In this example, the offense conduct relevant to the state prison sentence is considered as prior criminal history, not as part of the same course of conduct or common scheme or plan as the offense of conviction. The prior state prison sentence is counted under Chapter Four (Criminal History and Criminal Livelihood). (2) The defendant engaged in two cocaine sales constituting part of the same course of conduct or common scheme or plan. Subsequently, he is arrested by state authorities for the first sale and by federal authorities for the second sale. He is convicted in state court for the first sale and sentenced to imprisonment; he is then convicted in federal court for the second sale. In this case, the cocaine sales are not separated by an intervening sentence. Therefore, under subsection (a)(2), the cocaine sale associated with the state conviction is considered as relevant conduct to the instant federal offense. The state prison sentence for that sale is not counted as a prior sentence; <em>see</em> §4A1.2(a)(1).</p>
<p>Note, however, in certain cases, offense conduct associated with a previously imposed sentence may be expressly charged in the offense of conviction. Unless otherwise provided, such conduct will be considered relevant conduct under subsection (a)(1), not (a)(2).&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §1B1.3 captioned &quot;Background&quot; is amended by deleting the last paragraph as follows:</p>
<p>&quot;This guideline and §1B1.4 clarify the intent underlying §1B1.3 as originally promulgated.&quot;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;In cases of partially completed conduct, the loss is to be determined in accordance with the provisions of §2X1.1 (Attempt, Solicitation, or Conspiracy). <em>E.g.</em>, in the case of the theft of a government check or money order, loss refers to the loss level that would have occurred if the check or money order had been cashed. Similarly, if a defendant is apprehended in the process of taking a vehicle, the loss refers to the value of the vehicle even if the vehicle is recovered immediately.&quot;,</p>
<p>and inserting in lieu thereof:</p>
<p>&quot;<em>Examples</em>: (1) In the case of a theft of a check or money order, the loss is the loss that would have occurred if the check or money order had been cashed. (2) In the case of a defendant apprehended taking a vehicle, the loss is the value of the vehicle even if the vehicle is recovered immediately.</p>
<p>In the case of a partially completed offense (<em>e.g.</em>, an offense involving a completed theft that is part of a larger, attempted theft), the offense level is to be determined in accordance with the provisions of §2X1.1 (Attempt, Solicitation, or Conspiracy) whether the conviction is for the substantive offense, the inchoate offense (attempt, solicitation, or conspiracy), or both; <em>see</em> Application Note 4 in the Commentary to §2X1.1.&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §2B1.1 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended in Note 4 by deleting &quot;Attempts&quot; and inserting in lieu thereof &quot;Attempt, Solicitation, or Conspiracy&quot;; and by inserting &quot;and Deceit&quot; immediately following &quot;Fraud&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §2F1.1 is amended by deleting Notes 7 and 8 as follows:</p>
<p>&quot;7. Valuation of loss is discussed in the Commentary to §2B1.1 (Larceny, Embezzlement, and Other Forms of Theft). In keeping with the Commission’s policy on attempts, if a probable or intended loss that the defendant was attempting to inflict can be determined, that figure would be used if it was larger than the actual loss. For example, if the fraud consisted of attempting to sell $40,000 in worthless securities, or representing that a forged check for $40,000 was genuine, the ‘loss’ would be treated as $40,000 for purposes of this guideline.</p>
<p>8. The amount of loss need not be precise. The court is not expected to identify each victim and the loss he suffered to arrive at an exact figure. The court need only make a reasonable estimate of the range of loss, given the available information. The estimate may be based on the approximate number of victims and an estimate of the average loss to each victim, or on more general factors, such as the nature and duration of the fraud and the revenues generated by similar operations. Estimates based upon aggregate ‘market loss’ (<em>e.g.</em>, the aggregate decline in market value of a stock resulting from disclosure of information that was wrongfully withheld or misrepresented) are especially appropriate for securities cases. The offender’s gross gain from committing the fraud is an alternative estimate that ordinarily will understate the loss.&quot;;</p>
<p>by deleting Note 10 as follows:</p>
<p>&quot;10. In a few instances, the total dollar loss that results from the offense may overstate its seriousness. Such situations typically occur when a misrepresentation is of limited materiality or is not the sole cause of the loss. Examples would include understating debts to a limited degree in order to obtain a substantial loan which the defendant genuinely expected to repay; attempting to negotiate an instrument that was so obviously fraudulent that no one would seriously consider honoring it; and making a misrepresentation in a securities offering that enabled the securities to be sold at inflated prices, but where the value of the securities subsequently declined in substantial part for other reasons. In such instances, a downward departure may be warranted.&quot;;</p>
<p>by renumbering Note 9 as Note 10; by inserting the following as Notes 7, 8 and 9:</p>
<p>&quot;7. Valuation of loss is discussed in the Commentary to §2B1.1 (Larceny, Embezzlement, and Other Forms of Theft). Consistent with the provisions of §2X1.1 (Attempt, Solicitation or Conspiracy), if an intended loss that the defendant was attempting to inflict can be determined, this figure will be used if it is greater than the actual loss. Frequently, loss in a fraud case will be the same as in a theft case. For example, if the fraud consisted of selling or attempting to sell $40,000 in worthless securities, or representing that a forged check for $40,000 was genuine, the loss would be $40,000.</p>
<p>There are, however, instances where additional factors are to be considered in determining the loss or intended loss:</p>
<p>(a) <em>Fraud Involving Misrepresentation of the Value of an Item or Product Substitution</em></p>
<p>A fraud may involve the misrepresentation of the value of an item that does have some value (in contrast to an item that is worthless). Where, for example, a defendant fraudulently represents that stock is worth $40,000 and the stock is worth only $10,000, the loss is the amount by which the stock was overvalued (<em>i.e.</em>, $30,000). In a case involving a misrepresentation concerning the quality of a consumer product, the loss is the difference between the amount paid by the victim for the product and the amount for which the victim could resell the product received.</p>
<p>(b) <em>Fraudulent Loan Application and Contract Procurement Cases</em></p>
<p>In fraudulent loan application cases and contract procurement cases where the defendant’s capabilities are fraudulently represented, the loss is the actual loss to the victim (or if the loss has not yet come about, the expected loss). For example, if a defendant fraudulently obtains a loan by misrepresenting the value of his assets, the loss is the amount of the loan not repaid at the time the offense is discovered, reduced by the amount the lending institution has recovered, or can expect to recover, from any assets pledged to secure the loan.</p>
<p>In some cases, the loss determined above may significantly understate or overstate the seriousness of the defendant’s conduct. For example, where the defendant substantially understated his debts to obtain a loan, which he nevertheless repaid, the loss determined above (zero loss) will tend not to reflect adequately the risk of loss created by the defendant’s conduct. Conversely, a defendant may understate his debts to a limited degree to obtain a loan (<em>e.g.</em>, to expand a grain export business), which he genuinely expected to repay and for which he would have qualified at a higher interest rate had he made truthful disclosure, but he is unable to repay the loan because of some unforeseen event (<em>e.g.</em>, an embargo imposed on grain exports) which would have caused a default in any event. In such a case, the loss determined above may overstate the seriousness of the defendant’s conduct.</p>
<p>(c) <em>Consequential Damages in Procurement Fraud and Product Substitution Cases</em></p>
<p>In contrast to other types of cases, loss in a procurement fraud or product substitution case includes not only direct damages, but also consequential damages that were reasonably foreseeable. For example, in a case involving a defense product substitution offense, the loss includes the government’s reasonably foreseeable costs of making substitute transactions and handling or disposing of the product delivered or retrofitting the product so that it can be used for its intended purpose, plus the government’s reasonably foreseeable cost of rectifying the actual or potential disruption to government operations caused by the product substitution. Similarly, in the case of fraud affecting a defense contract award, loss includes the reasonably foreseeable administrative cost to the government and other participants of repeating or correcting the procurement action affected, plus any increased cost to procure the product or service involved that was reasonably foreseeable. Inclusion of reasonably foreseeable consequential damages directly in the calculation of loss in procurement fraud and product substitution cases reflects that such damages frequently are substantial in such cases.</p>
<p>(d) <em>Diversion of Government Program Benefits</em></p>
<p>In a case involving diversion of government program benefits, loss is the value of the benefits diverted from intended recipients or uses.</p>
<p>(e) <em>Davis-Bacon Act Cases</em></p>
<p>In a case involving a Davis-Bacon Act violation (a violation of 40 U.S.C. § 276a, criminally prosecuted under 18 U.S.C. § 1001), the loss is the difference between the legally required and actual wages paid.</p>
<p>8. For the purposes of subsection (b)(1), the loss need not be determined with precision. The court need only make a reasonable estimate of the loss, given the available information. This estimate, for example, may be based on the approximate number of victims and an estimate of the average loss to each victim, or on more general factors, such as the nature and duration of the fraud and the revenues generated by similar operations. The offender’s gain from committing the fraud is an alternative estimate that ordinarily will underestimate the loss.</p>
<p>9. In the case of a partially completed offense (<em>e.g.</em>, an offense involving a completed fraud that is part of a larger, attempted fraud), the offense level is to be determined in accordance with the provisions of §2X1.1 (Attempt, Solicitation, or Conspiracy) whether the conviction is for the substantive offense, the inchoate offense (attempt, solicitation, or conspiracy), or both; <em>see</em> Application Note 4 in the Commentary to §2X1.1.&quot;;</p>
<p>and in the renumbered Note 10 (formerly Note 9) by deleting:</p>
<p>&quot;Dollar loss often does not fully capture the harmfulness and seriousness of the conduct. In such instances, an upward departure may be warranted.&quot;,</p>
<p>and inserting in lieu thereof:</p>
<p>&quot;In cases in which the loss determined under subsection (b)(1) does not fully capture the harmfulness and seriousness of the conduct, an upward departure may be warranted.&quot;;</p>
<p>by deleting subdivision (f) as follows:</p>
<p>&quot;(f) completion of the offense was prevented, or the offense was interrupted before it caused serious harm.&quot;;</p>
<p>by deleting the semicolon at the end of subdivision (e) and inserting in lieu thereof a period; and by inserting the following additional paragraph at the end:</p>
<p>&quot;In a few instances, the loss determined under subsection (b)(1) may overstate the seriousness of the offense. This may occur, for example, where a defendant attempted to negotiate an instrument that was so obviously fraudulent that no one would seriously consider honoring it.&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This amendment provides a more precise reference in the commentary of these guidelines to the discussion in §2X1.1 that applies in the case of a partially completed offense. In addition, the amendment reorders the material in these notes, and divides them into separate paragraphs for greater clarity. The amendment also conforms the wording of Application Note 7 of the Commentary to §2F1.1 to Application Note 2 of the Commentary to §2B1.1 to make clear that the treatment of attempts in cases of fraud and theft is identical. Finally, this amendment provides additional guidance with respect to the determination of loss, and makes editorial improvements.</p>

<p>&quot;If all the drugs are ‘equivalents’ of the same drug, <em>e.g.</em>, stimulants that are grouped with cocaine, convert them to that drug. In other cases, convert each of the drugs to either the heroin or marihuana equivalents, add the quantities, and look up the total in the Drug Quantity Table to obtain the combined offense level. Use the marihuana equivalents when the only substances involved are ‘Schedule I Marihuana,’ ‘Schedule III Substances,’ ‘Schedule IV Substances,’ ‘Schedule V Substances’ or ‘Schedule I or II Depressants.’ Otherwise, use the heroin equivalents.&quot;,</p>
<p>and inserting in lieu thereof:</p>
<p>&quot;In each case, convert each of the drugs to its marihuana equivalent, add the quantities, and look up the total in the Drug Quantity Table to obtain the combined offense level.&quot;;</p>
<p>in the first example by deleting:</p>
<p>&quot;a. The defendant is convicted of selling seventy grams of a substance containing PCP (Level 22) and 250 milligrams of a substance containing LSD (Level 18). Both PCP and LSD are grouped together in the Drug Equivalency Tables under the heading ‘LSD, PCP, and Other Schedule I and II Hallucinogens,’ which provide PCP equivalencies. The 250 milligrams of LSD is equivalent to twenty-five grams of PCP. The total is therefore ninety-five grams of PCP, for which the Drug Quantity Table provides an offense level of 24.&quot;,</p>
<p>and inserting in lieu thereof:</p>
<p>&quot;a. The defendant is convicted of selling 70 grams of a substance containing PCP (Level 22) and 250 milligrams of a substance containing LSD (Level 18). The PCP converts to 70 kilograms of marihuana; the LSD converts to 25 kilograms of marihuana. The total is therefore equivalent to 95 kilograms of marihuana, for which the Drug Quantity Table provides an offense level of 24.&quot;;</p>
<p>and in the third example by deleting:</p>
<p>&quot;c. The defendant is convicted of selling eighty grams of cocaine (Level 16) and five kilograms of marihuana (Level 14). The cocaine is equivalent to sixteen grams of heroin; the marihuana, to five grams of heroin. The total equivalent is twenty-one grams of heroin, which has an offense level of 18 in the Drug Quantity Table.&quot;,</p>
<p>and inserting in lieu thereof:</p>
<p>&quot;c. The defendant is convicted of selling 80 grams of cocaine (Level 16) and five kilograms of marihuana (Level 14). The cocaine is equivalent to 16 kilograms of marihuana. The total is therefore equivalent to 21 kilograms of marihuana, which has an offense level of 18 in the Drug Quantity Table.&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §2D1.1 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended in Note 10 by inserting the following additional paragraph as the third paragraph:</p>
<p>&quot;For certain types of controlled substances, the marihuana equivalencies in the Drug Equivalency Tables are ‘capped’ at specified amounts (<em>e.g.</em>, the combined equivalent weight of all Schedule V controlled substances shall not exceed 999 grams of marihuana). Where there are controlled substances from more than one schedule (<em>e.g.</em>, a quantity of a Schedule IV substance and a quantity of a Schedule V substance), determine the marihuana equivalency for each schedule separately (subject to the cap, if any, applicable to that schedule). Then add the marihuana equivalencies to determine the combined marihuana equivalency (subject to the cap, if any, applicable to the combined amounts).&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §2D1.1 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended in Note 10 by inserting the following additional example immediately after example (c):</p>
<p>&quot;d. The defendant is convicted of selling 28 kilograms of a Schedule III substance, 50 kilograms of a Schedule IV substance, and 100 kilograms of a Schedule V substance. The marihuana equivalency for the Schedule III substance is 56 kilograms of marihuana (below the cap of 59.99 kilograms of marihuana set forth as the maximum equivalent weight for Schedule III substances). The marihuana equivalency for the Schedule IV substance is subject to a cap of 4.99 kilograms of marihuana set forth as the maximum equivalent weight for Schedule IV substances (without the cap it would have been 6.25 kilograms). The marihuana equivalency for the Schedule V substance is subject to the cap of 999 grams of marihuana set forth as the maximum equivalent weight for Schedule V substances (without the cap it would have been 1.25 kilograms). The combined equivalent weight, determined by adding together the above amounts, is subject to the cap of 59.99 kilograms of marihuana set forth as the maximum combined equivalent weight for Schedule III, IV, and V substances. Without the cap, the combined equivalent weight would have been 61.99 (56 + 4.99 + .999) kilograms.&quot;.</p>

<p>The Commentary to §2D1.1 captioned &quot;Background&quot; is amended by inserting the following additional paragraph as the fourth paragraph:</p>
<p>&quot; In cases involving fifty or more marihuana plants, an equivalency of one plant to one kilogram of marihuana is derived from the statutory penalty provisions of 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(A), (B), and (D). In cases involving fewer than fifty plants, the statute is silent as to the equivalency. For cases involving fewer than fifty plants, the Commission has adopted an equivalency of 100 grams per plant, or the actual weight of the usable marihuana, whichever is greater. The decision to treat each plant as equal to 100 grams is premised on the fact that the average yield from a mature marihuana plant equals 100 grams of marihuana. In controlled substance offenses, an attempt is assigned the same offense level as the object of the attempt (<em>see</em> §2D1.4). Consequently, the Commission adopted the policy that, in the case of fewer than fifty marihuana plants, each plant is to be treated as the equivalent of an attempt to produce 100 grams of marihuana, except where the actual weight of the usable marihuana is greater.&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This amendment substitutes a single conversion for Schedule III substances (1 gm of a Schedule III substance = 2 gms of marihuana) that will simplify application of the guidelines as well as address currently unlisted Schedule III substances. Because the equivalencies for Schedule III substances are not statutorily based, nor are the pharmacological equivalencies as clear as with Schedule I or II Substances, a generic listing was deemed appropriate. For the same reasons, the amendment provides a single conversion for Schedule IV substances (1 gm of a Schedule IV substance = 0.125 gm of marihuana) and Schedule V substances (1 gm of a Schedule V substance = 0.0125 gm of marihuana). The amendment also adds a conversion for anabolic steroids consistent with their treatment in the Drug Quantity Table. In addition, the amendment adds footnotes to the Drug Equivalency Tables for Schedule I or II depressants and Schedule III, IV, and V substances to remove an ambiguity in guideline application by expressly limiting the combined equivalent weight of such substances to the marihuana amount consistent with the highest offense level for such substances provided in the Drug Quantity Table. <em>See</em> <em>United States v. Gurgliolo</em>, 894 F.2d 56 (3d Cir. 1990). The amendment inserts an additional listing under &quot;Secobarbital and Other Schedule I and II Depressants&quot; to reflect that glutethimide has been changed from a Schedule III to a Schedule II controlled substance under 21 C.F.R. §1308.12. In addition, the amendment simplifies the application of the Drug Equivalency Table by referencing the conversions to one substance (marihuana) rather than to four substances; the use of one referent rather than four makes no substantive change but will make the required computations easier and reduce the likelihood of computational error. Finally, the amendment sets forth the rationale for the Commission’s treatment of fewer than fifty marihuana plants.</p>

<p>&quot;2. By statute, a term of imprisonment imposed for this offense runs consecutively to any other term of imprisonment imposed. 18 U.S.C. § 3146(b)(1).&quot;;</p>
<p>by renumbering Note 3 as Note 2; and by inserting the following additional notes:</p>
<p>&quot;3. In the case of a failure to appear for service of sentence, any term of imprisonment imposed on the failure to appear count is to be imposed consecutively to any term of imprisonment imposed for the underlying offense. <em>See</em> §5G1.3(a). The guideline range for the failure to appear count is to be determined independently and the grouping rules of §§ 3D1.2-3D1.5 do not apply.</p>
<p>Otherwise, in the case of a conviction on both the underlying offense and the failure to appear, the failure to appear is treated under §3C1.1 (Obstructing or Impeding the Administration of Justice) as an obstruction of the underlying offense; and the failure to appear count and the count(s) for the underlying offense are grouped together under §3D1.2(c). Note that although 18 U.S.C. § 3146(b)(2) does not require a sentence of imprisonment on a failure to appear count, it does require that any sentence of imprisonment on a failure to appear count be imposed consecutively to any other sentence of imprisonment. Therefore, in such cases, the combined sentence must be constructed to provide a ‘total punishment’ that satisfies the requirements both of §5G1.2 (Sentencing on Multiple Counts of Conviction) and 18 U.S.C. § 3146(b)(2). For example, where the combined applicable guideline range for both counts is 30-37 months and the court determines a ‘total punishment’ of 36 months is appropriate, a sentence of thirty months for the underlying offense plus a consecutive six months sentence for the failure to appear count would satisfy these requirements.</p>
<p>4. In some cases, the defendant may be sentenced on the underlying offense (the offense in respect to which the defendant failed to appear) before being sentenced on the failure to appear offense. In such cases, criminal history points for the sentence imposed on the underlying offense are to be counted in determining the guideline range on the failure to appear offense only where the offense level is determined under subsection (a)(1) (<em>i.e.</em>, where the offense constituted a failure to report for service of sentence).&quot;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;<em>Provided</em>, that where the maximum of the guideline range from Chapter Five, Part A (Sentencing Table) determined by an offense level adjusted under the procedure described in the preceding paragraph, plus the term of imprisonment required under 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) or § 929(a), is less than the maximum of the guideline range that would apply to the underlying offense absent such adjustment, the procedure described in the preceding paragraph does not apply. Instead, the guideline range applicable to the underlying offense absent such adjustment is to be used after subtracting the term of imprisonment imposed under 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) or § 929(a) from both the minimum and maximum of such range.</p>
<p><em>Example</em>: A defendant, is to be sentenced under the robbery guideline; his unadjusted offense level from §2B3.1 is 30, including a 7-level enhancement for discharging a firearm; no Chapter Three adjustments are applicable; and his criminal history category is Category IV. His unadjusted guideline range from Chapter Five, Part A (Sentencing Table) is 135-168 months. This defendant has also been convicted under 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) arising from the possession of a weapon during the robbery, and therefore must be sentenced to an additional consecutive five-year term of imprisonment. The defendant’s adjusted guideline range, which takes into account the conviction under 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) by eliminating the 7-level weapon enhancement, is 70-87 months. Because the maximum of the defendant’s adjusted guideline range plus the five year consecutive sentence (87 months + 60 months = 147 months) is less than the maximum of the defendant’s unadjusted guideline range (168 months), the defendant is to be sentenced using the unadjusted guideline range after subtracting the 60 month sentence to be imposed under 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) from both the minimum and maximum of the unadjusted range (<em>e.g.</em>, 135 months - 60 months = 75 months; 168 months - 60 months = 108 months). A sentence imposed for the underlying offense using the guideline range determined in this manner (75-108 months) when combined with the consecutive sentence imposed under 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) or § 929(a), will produce the appropriate total term of imprisonment.&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This amendment provides an additional instruction for the determination of the offense level in cases in which the defendant is convicted under 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) or §929(a) in addition to a count for the offense in respect to which the firearm was used or possessed. The amendment is designed to prevent the anomalous result of the total punishment being less when there are convictions on both such counts than if the defendant was convicted only of the offense in respect to which the weapon was used or possessed.</p>

<p>The Commentary to §3D1.2 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended in Note 2 by inserting the following immediately after the second sentence:</p>
<p>&quot;For offenses in which there are no identifiable victims (<em>e.g.</em>, drug or immigration offenses, where society at large is the victim), the ‘victim’ for purposes of subsections (a) and (b) is the societal interest that is harmed. In such cases, the counts are grouped together when the societal interests that are harmed are closely related. Where one count, for example, involves unlawfully entering the United States and the other involves possession of fraudulent evidence of citizenship, the counts are grouped together because the societal interests harmed (the interests protected by laws governing immigration) are closely related. In contrast, where one count involves the sale of controlled substances and the other involves an immigration law violation, the counts are not grouped together because different societal interests are harmed.&quot;;</p>
<p>and by deleting the last sentence as follows:</p>
<p>&quot;Thus, for so-called ‘victimless’ crimes (crimes in which society at large is the victim), the grouping decision must be based primarily upon the nature of the interest invaded by each offense.&quot;.</p>

<p>&quot;A conspiracy, attempt, or solicitation to commit an offense is covered under subsection (d) if the offense that is the object of the conspiracy, attempt, or solicitation is covered under subsection (d).&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary following §3D1.5 captioned &quot;Illustrations of the Operation of the Multiple-Count Rules&quot; is amended in example 1 by deleting &quot;gun was discharged&quot; and inserting in lieu thereof &quot;firearm was displayed&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary following §3D1.5 captioned &quot;Illustrations of the Operation of the Multiple-Count Rules&quot; is amended in example 2 by deleting:</p>
<p>&quot;The base offense level is 6, and there is an aggravator of 1 level for property value. However, because the conduct involved repeated acts with some planning, the offense level is raised to 8 (§2F1.1(b)(2)(B)). The combined offense level therefore is 8.&quot;,</p>
<p>and inserting in lieu thereof:</p>
<p>&quot;The base offense level is 6; 1 level is added because of the value of the property (§2F1.1(b)(1)); and 2 levels are added because the conduct involved repeated acts with some planning (§2F1.1(b)(2)(A)). The resulting offense level is 9.&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary following §3D1.5 captioned &quot;Illustrations of the Operation of the Multiple-Count Rules&quot; is amended in example 4 by deleting &quot;§2B4.1 (Commercial Bribery)&quot; and inserting in lieu thereof &quot;§2B4.1 (Bribery in Procurement of Bank Loan and Other Commercial Bribery)&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This amendment revises §3D1.2(d) to reflect amendments to the offense guidelines of Chapter Two; clarifies the commentary in Note 1 to expressly state that a conspiracy, attempt, or solicitation to commit an offense covered under subsection (d) is also covered under subsection (d); clarifies the commentary in Note 2 with respect to the meaning of the term &quot;victim&quot; where society at large is the victim; merges former Note 8 with Note 5 for greater clarity; conforms two illustrations of the operation of the guidelines to the guidelines, as amended; corrects an inaccurate illustration; and corrects a reference to the title of an offense guideline.</p>

<p>&quot;3. The fine for an organization is determined by applying Chapter Eight (Sentencing of Organizations). In selecting a fine for an organization within the guideline fine range, the court should consider both the gain to the organization from the offense and the loss caused by the organization. It is estimated that the average gain from price-fixing is 10 percent of the selling price. The loss from price-fixing exceeds the gain because, among other things, injury is inflicted upon consumers who are unable or for other reasons do not buy the product at the higher prices. Because the loss from price-fixing exceeds the gain, subsection (d)(1) provides that 20 percent of the volume of affected commerce is to be used in lieu of the pecuniary loss under §8C2.4(a)(3). The purpose for specifying a percent of the volume of commerce is to avoid the time and expense that would be required for the court to determine the actual gain or loss. In cases in which the actual monopoly overcharge appears to be either substantially more or substantially less than 10 percent, this factor should be considered in setting the fine within the guideline fine range.&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §2R1.1 captioned &quot;Background&quot; is amended by deleting the last paragraph as follows:</p>
<p>&quot; Substantial fines are an essential part of the sanction. It is estimated that the average additional profit attributable to price fixing is 10 percent of the selling price. The Commission has specified that a fine from two to five times that amount be imposed on organi­zational defendants as a deterrent because of the difficulty in identifying violators. Addi­tional monetary penalties can be provided through private treble damage actions. A lower fine is specified for individuals. The Commission believes that most antitrust defendants have the resources and earning capacity to pay these fines, at least over time. The statutory maximum fine is $250,000 for individuals and $1,000,000 for organizations, but is increased when there are convictions on multiple counts.&quot;,</p>
<p>and inserting in lieu thereof:</p>
<p>&quot; Substantial fines are an essential part of the sentence. For an individual, the guideline fine range is from one to five percent of the volume of commerce, but not less than $20,000. For an organization, the guideline fine range is determined under Chapter Eight (Sentencing of Organizations), but pursuant to subsection (d)(2), the minimum multiplier is at least 0.75. This multiplier, which requires a minimum fine of 15 percent of the volume of commerce for the least serious case, was selected to provide an effective deterrent to antitrust offenses. At the same time, this minimum multiplier maintains incentives for desired organizational behavior. Because the Department of Justice has a well-established amnesty program for organizations that self-report antitrust offenses, no lower minimum multiplier is needed as an incentive for self-reporting. A minimum multiplier of at least 0.75 ensures that fines imposed in antitrust cases will exceed the average monopoly overcharge.</p>
<p>The Commission believes that most antitrust defendants have the resources and earning capacity to pay the fines called for by this guideline, at least over time on an installment basis. The statutory maximum fine is $350,000 for individuals and $10,000,000 for organizations, but is increased when there are convictions on multiple counts.&quot;.</p>

<p>The Commentary to §1B1.5 captioned &quot;Application Note&quot; is amended by inserting the following additional notes:</p>
<p>&quot;2. A reference may require that the offense level be determined under another offense guideline. In such case, the adjustments in Chapter Three, Parts A (Victim-Related Adjustments), B (Role in the Offense), and E (Acceptance of Responsibility) are also to be determined in respect to that other offense guideline. For example, a defendant convicted of possession of a firearm by a felon, to which §2K2.1 (Unlawful Receipt, Possession, or Transportation of Firearms or Ammunition; Prohibited Transactions Involving Firearms or Ammunition) applies, is found to have used that firearm in the commission of a robbery. The cross reference at §2K2.1(c) directs that the robbery offense guideline be used. The adjustments in Chapter Three, Parts A, B and E are to be applied as if the offense of conviction had directly referenced the robbery guideline.</p>
<p>3. A reference to another guideline may direct that such reference is to be used only if it results in a greater offense level. In such cases, the greater offense level means the greater final offense level (<em>i.e.</em>, the greater offense level taking into account both the Chapter Two offense level and any applicable Chapter Three adjustments). Although the offense guideline that results in the greater offense level under Chapter Two will most frequently result in the greater final offense level, this will not always be the case. If, for example, a role or abuse of trust adjustment applies to the cross-referenced offense guideline, but not to the guideline initially applied, the greater Chapter Two offense level may not necessarily result in a greater final offense level.</p>
<p>4. A reference may direct that, if the conduct involved another offense, the offense guideline for such other offense is to be applied. Where there is more than one such other offense, the most serious such offense (or group of closely-related offenses in the case of offenses that would be grouped together under §3D1.2(d)) is to be used. For example, if a defendant convicted of possession of a firearm by a felon, to which §2K2.1 (Unlawful Receipt, Possession, or Transportation of Firearms or Ammunition; Prohibited Transactions Involving Firearms or Ammunition) applies, is found to have possessed that firearm during commission of a series of offenses, the cross reference at §2K2.1(c) is applied to the offense resulting in the greatest offense level.&quot;;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;‘Underlying offense,’ as used in this guideline, includes any offense under federal, state, or local law other than an offense that is itself covered under Chapter Two, Part H, Subpart 1, 2, or 4. For example, in the case of a conspiracy to interfere with a person’s civil rights (a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 241) that involved an aggravated assault (the use of force) to deny certain rights or benefits in furtherance of discrimination (a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 245), the underlying offense in respect to both the violation of 18 U.S.C. § 241 (to which §2H1.1 applies) and the violation of 18 U.S.C. § 245 (to which §2H1.3 applies) would be the aggravated assault.&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §2H1.1 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended in Note 1 by inserting the following additional paragraph at the end:</p>
<p>&quot;In certain cases, the count of which the defendant is convicted may set forth conduct that constitutes more than one underlying offense (<em>e.g.</em>, two instances of assault, or one instance of assault and one instance of arson). In such cases, determine the offense level for the underlying offense by treating each underlying offense as if contained in a separate count of conviction. To determine which of the alternative base offense levels (<em>e.g.</em>, §2H1.1(a)(1) or (a)(2)) results in the greater offense level, apply Chapter Three, Parts A, B, C, and D to each alternative base offense level. Use whichever results in the greater offense level. Example: The defendant is convicted of one count of conspiracy to violate civil rights that included two level 12 underlying offenses (of a type not grouped together under Chapter Three, Part D). No adjustment from Chapter Three, Parts A, B, or C applies. The base offense level from §2H1.1(a)(1) is 15. The offense level for each underlying offense from §2H1.1(a)(2) is 14 (2 + 12). Under Chapter Three, Part D (Multiple Counts), the two level 14 underlying offenses result in a combined offense level of 16. This offense level is greater than the alternative base offense level of 15 under §2H1.1(a)(1). Therefore, the case is treated as if there were two counts, one for each underlying offense, with a base offense level under §2H1.1(a)(2) of 14 for each underlying offense.&quot;.</p>

<p>&quot;1. Conduct ‘for which the defendant would be otherwise accountable,’ as used in subsection (a)(1), includes conduct that the defendant counseled, commanded, induced, procured, or willfully caused. (<em>Cf</em>. 18 U.S.C. § 2.) In the case of criminal activity undertaken in concert with others, whether or not charged as a conspiracy, the conduct for which the defendant ‘would be otherwise accountable’ also includes conduct of others in furtherance of the execution of the jointly-undertaken criminal activity that was reasonably foreseeable by the defendant. Because a count may be broadly worded and include the conduct of many participants over a substantial period of time, the scope of the jointly-undertaken criminal activity, and hence relevant conduct, is not necessarily the same for every participant. Where it is established that the conduct was neither within the scope of the defendant’s agreement, nor was reasonably foreseeable in connection with the criminal activity the defendant agreed to jointly undertake, such conduct is not included in establishing the defendant’s offense level under this guideline.</p>
<p>In the case of solicitation, misprision, or accessory after the fact, the conduct for which the defendant ‘would be otherwise accountable’ includes all conduct relevant to determining the offense level for the underlying offense that was known, or reasonably should have been known, by the defendant.</p>
<p><em>Illustrations of Conduct for Which the Defendant is Accountable</em></p>
<p>a. Defendant A, one of ten off-loaders hired by Defendant B, was convicted of importation of marihuana, as a result of his assistance in off-loading a boat containing a one-ton shipment of marihuana. Regardless of the number of bales of marihuana that he actually unloaded, and notwithstanding any claim on his part that he was neither aware of, nor could reasonably foresee, that the boat contained this quantity of marihuana, Defendant A is held accountable for the entire one-ton quantity of marihuana on the boat because he aided and abetted the unloading, and hence the importation, of the entire shipment.</p>
<p>b. Defendant C, the getaway driver in an armed bank robbery in which $15,000 is taken and a teller is injured, is convicted of the substantive count of bank robbery. Defendant C is accountable for the money taken because he aided and abetted the taking of the money. He is accountable for the injury inflicted because he participated in concerted criminal conduct that he could reasonably foresee might result in the infliction of injury.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>c. Defendant D pays Defendant E a small amount to forge an endorsement on an $800 stolen government check. Unknown to Defendant E, Defendant D then uses that check as a down payment in a scheme to fraudulently obtain $15,000 worth of merchandise. Defendant E is convicted of forging the $800 check. Defendant E is not accountable for the $15,000 because the fraudulent scheme to obtain $15,000 was beyond the scope of, and not reasonably foreseeable in connection with, the criminal activity he jointly undertook with Defendant D.</p>
<p>d. Defendants F and G, working together, design and execute a scheme to sell fraudulent stocks by telephone. Defendant F fraudulently obtains $20,000. Defendant G fraudulently obtains $35,000. Each is convicted of mail fraud. Each defendant is accountable for the entire amount ($55,000) because each aided and abetted the other in the fraudulent conduct. Alternatively, because Defendants F and G engaged in concerted criminal activity, each is accountable for the entire $55,000 loss because the conduct of each was in furtherance of the jointly undertaken criminal activity and was reasonably foreseeable.</p>
<p>e. Defendants H and I engaged in an ongoing marihuana importation conspiracy in which Defendant J was hired only to help off-load a single shipment. Defendants H, I, and J are included in a single count charging conspiracy to import marihuana. For the purposes of determining the offense level under this guideline, Defendant J is accountable for the entire single shipment of marihuana he conspired to help import and any acts or omissions in furtherance of the importation that were reasonably foreseeable. He is not accountable for prior or subsequent shipments of marihuana imported by Defendants H or I if those acts were beyond the scope of, and not reasonably foreseeable in connection with, the criminal activity he agreed to jointly undertake with Defendants H and I (<em>i.e.</em>, the importation of the single shipment of marihuana).&quot;,</p>
<p>and inserting in lieu thereof:</p>
<p>&quot;1. The principles and limits of sentencing accountability under this guideline are not always the same as the principles and limits of criminal liability. Under subsections (a)(1) and (a)(2), the focus is on the specific acts and omissions for which the defendant is to be held accountable in determining the applicable guideline range, rather than on whether the defendant is criminally liable for an offense as a principal, accomplice, or conspirator.</p>
<p>2. A ‘jointly undertaken criminal activity’ is a criminal plan, scheme, endeavor, or enterprise undertaken by the defendant in concert with others, whether or not charged as a conspiracy.</p>
<p>In the case of a jointly undertaken criminal activity, subsection (a)(1)(B) provides that a defendant is accountable for the conduct (acts and omissions) of others that was both:</p>
<p>(i) in furtherance of the jointly undertaken criminal activity; and</p>
<p>(ii) reasonably foreseeable in connection with that criminal activity.</p>
<p>Because a count may be worded broadly and include the conduct of many participants over a period of time, the scope of the criminal activity jointly undertaken by the defendant (the ‘jointly undertaken criminal activity’) is not necessarily the same as the scope of the entire conspiracy, and hence relevant conduct is not necessarily the same for every participant. In order to determine the defendant’s accountability for the conduct of others under subsection (a)(1)(B), the court must first determine the scope of the criminal activity the particular defendant agreed to jointly undertake (<em>i.e.</em>, the scope of the specific conduct and objectives embraced by the defendant’s agreement). The conduct of others that was both in furtherance of, and reasonably foreseeable in connection with, the criminal activity jointly undertaken by the defendant is relevant conduct under this provision. The conduct of others that was not in furtherance of the criminal activity jointly undertaken by the defendant, or was not reasonably foreseeable in connection with that criminal activity, is not relevant conduct under this provision.</p>
<p>In determining the scope of the criminal activity that the particular defendant agreed to jointly undertake (<em>i.e.</em>, the scope of the specific conduct and objectives embraced by the defendant’s agreement), the court may consider any explicit agreement or implicit agreement fairly inferred from the conduct of the defendant and others.</p>
<p>Note that the criminal activity that the defendant agreed to jointly undertake, and the reasonably foreseeable conduct of others in furtherance of that criminal activity, are not necessarily identical. For example, two defendants agree to commit a robbery and, during the course of that robbery, the first defendant assaults and injures a victim. The second defendant is accountable for the assault and injury to the victim (even if the second defendant had not agreed to the assault and had cautioned the first defendant to be careful not to hurt anyone) because the assaultive conduct was in furtherance of the jointly undertaken criminal activity (the robbery) and was reasonably foreseeable in connection with that criminal activity (given the nature of the offense).</p>
<p>With respect to offenses involving contraband (including controlled substances), the defendant is accountable for all quantities of contraband with which he was directly involved and, in the case of a jointly undertaken criminal activity, all reasonably foreseeable quantities of contraband that were within the scope of the criminal activity that he jointly undertook.</p>
<p>The requirement of reasonable foreseeability applies only in respect to the conduct (<em>i.e.</em>, acts and omissions) of others under subsection (a)(1)(B). It does not apply to conduct that the defendant personally undertakes, aids, abets, counsels, commands, induces, procures, or willfully causes; such conduct is addressed under subsection (a)(1)(A).</p>
<p><em>Illustrations of Conduct for Which the Defendant is Accountable</em></p>
<p>(a) <em>Acts and omissions aided or abetted by the defendant</em></p>
<p>(1) Defendant A is one of ten persons hired by Defendant B to off-load a ship containing marihuana. The off-loading of the ship is interrupted by law enforcement officers and one ton of marihuana is seized (the amount on the ship as well as the amount off-loaded). Defendant A and the other off-loaders are arrested and convicted of importation of marihuana. Regardless of the number of bales he personally unloaded, Defendant A is accountable for the entire one-ton quantity of marihuana. Defendant A aided and abetted the off-loading of the entire shipment of marihuana by directly participating in the off-loading of that shipment (<em>i.e.</em>, the specific objective of the criminal activity he joined was the off-loading of the entire shipment). Therefore, he is accountable for the entire shipment under subsection (a)(1)(A) without regard to the issue of reasonable foreseeability. This is conceptually similar to the case of a defendant who transports a suitcase knowing that it contains a controlled substance and, therefore, is accountable for the controlled substance in the suitcase regardless of his knowledge or lack of knowledge of the actual type or amount of that controlled substance.</p>
<p>In certain cases, a defendant may be accountable for particular conduct under more than one subsection of this guideline. As noted in the preceding paragraph, Defendant A is accountable for the entire one-ton shipment of marihuana under subsection (a)(1)(A). Defendant A also is accountable for the entire one-ton shipment of marihuana on the basis of subsection (a)(1)(B)(applying to a jointly undertaken criminal activity). Defendant A engaged in a jointly undertaken criminal activity (the scope of which was the importation of the shipment of marihuana). A finding that the one-ton quantity of marihuana was reasonably foreseeable is warranted from the nature of the undertaking itself (the importation of marihuana by ship typically involves very large quantities of marihuana). The specific circumstances of the case (the defendant was one of ten persons off-loading the marihuana in bales) also support this finding. In an actual case, of course, if a defendant’s accountability for particular conduct is established under one provision of this guideline, it is not necessary to review alternative provisions under which such accountability might be established.</p>
<p>(b) <em>Acts and omissions aided or abetted by the defendant; requirement that the conduct of others be in furtherance of the jointly undertaken criminal activity and reasonably foreseeable</em></p>
<p>(1) Defendant C is the getaway driver in an armed bank robbery in which $15,000 is taken and a teller is assaulted and injured. Defendant C is accountable for the money taken under subsection (a)(1)(A) because he aided and abetted the act of taking the money (the taking of money was the specific objective of the offense he joined). Defendant C is accountable for the injury to the teller under subsection (a)(1)(B) because the assault on the teller was in furtherance of the jointly undertaken criminal activity (the robbery) and was reasonably foreseeable in connection with that criminal activity (given the nature of the offense).</p>
<p>As noted earlier, a defendant may be accountable for particular conduct under more than one subsection. In this example, Defendant C also is accountable for the money taken on the basis of subsection (a)(1)(B) because the taking of money was in furtherance of the jointly undertaken criminal activity (the robbery) and was reasonably foreseeable (as noted, the taking of money was the specific objective of the jointly undertaken criminal activity).</p>
<p>(c) <em>Requirement that the conduct of others be in furtherance of the jointly undertaken criminal activity and reasonably foreseeable; scope of the criminal activity</em></p>
<p>(1) Defendant D pays Defendant E a small amount to forge an endorsement on an $800 stolen government check. Unknown to Defendant E, Defendant D then uses that check as a down payment in a scheme to fraudulently obtain $15,000 worth of merchandise. Defendant E is convicted of forging the $800 check and is accountable for the forgery of this check under subsection (a)(1)(A). Defendant E is not accountable for the $15,000 because the fraudulent scheme to obtain $15,000 was not in furtherance of the criminal activity he jointly undertook with Defendant D (<em>i.e.</em>, the forgery of the $800 check).</p>
<p>(2) Defendants F and G, working together, design and execute a scheme to sell fraudulent stocks by telephone. Defendant F fraudulently obtains $20,000. Defendant G fraudulently obtains $35,000. Each is convicted of mail fraud. Defendants F and G each are accountable for the entire amount ($55,000). Each defendant is accountable for the amount he personally obtained under subsection (a)(1)(A). Each defendant is accountable for the amount obtained by his accomplice under subsection (a)(1)(B) because the conduct of each was in furtherance of the jointly undertaken criminal activity and was reasonably foreseeable in connection with that criminal activity.</p>
<p>(3) Defendants H and I engaged in an ongoing marihuana importation conspiracy in which Defendant J was hired only to help off-load a single shipment. Defendants H, I, and J are included in a single count charging conspiracy to import marihuana. Defendant J is accountable for the entire single shipment of marihuana he helped import under subsection (a)(1)(A) and any acts and omissions in furtherance of the importation of that shipment that were reasonably foreseeable (<em>see</em> the discussion in example (a)(1) above). He is not accountable for prior or subsequent shipments of marihuana imported by Defendants H or I because those acts were not in furtherance of his jointly undertaken criminal activity (the importation of the single shipment of marihuana).</p>
<p>(4) Defendant K is a wholesale distributor of child pornography. Defendant L is a retail-level dealer who purchases child pornography from Defendant K and resells it, but otherwise operates independently of Defendant K. Similarly, Defendant M is a retail-level dealer who purchases child pornography from Defendant K and resells it, but otherwise operates independently of Defendant K. Defendants L and M are aware of each other’s criminal activity but operate independently. Defendant N is Defendant K’s assistant who recruits customers for Defendant K and frequently supervises the deliveries to Defendant K’s customers. Each defendant is convicted of a count charging conspiracy to distribute child pornography. Defendant K is accountable under subsection (a)(1)(A) for the entire quantity of child pornography sold to Defendants L and M. Defendant N also is accountable for the entire quantity sold to those defendants under subsection (a)(1)(B) because the entire quantity was within the scope of his jointly undertaken criminal activity and reasonably foreseeable. Defendant L is accountable under subsection (a)(1)(A) only for the quantity of child pornography that he purchased from Defendant K because the scope of his jointly undertaken criminal activity is limited to that amount. For the same reason, Defendant M is accountable under subsection (a)(1)(A) only for the quantity of child pornography that he purchased from Defendant K.</p>
<p>(5) Defendant O knows about her boyfriend’s ongoing drug-trafficking activity, but agrees to participate on only one occasion by making a delivery for him at his request when he was ill. Defendant O is accountable under subsection (a)(1)(A) for the drug quantity involved on that one occasion. Defendant O is not accountable for the other drug sales made by her boyfriend because those sales were not in furtherance of her jointly undertaken criminal activity (<em>i.e.</em>, the one delivery).</p>
<p>(6) Defendant P is a street-level drug dealer who knows of other street-level drug dealers in the same geographic area who sell the same type of drug as he sells. Defendant P and the other dealers share a common source of supply, but otherwise operate independently. Defendant P is not accountable for the quantities of drugs sold by the other street-level drug dealers because he is not engaged in a jointly undertaken criminal activity with them. In contrast, Defendant Q, another street-level drug dealer, pools his resources and profits with four other street-level drug dealers. Defendant Q is engaged in a jointly undertaken criminal activity and, therefore, he is accountable under subsection (a)(1)(B) for the quantities of drugs sold by the four other dealers during the course of his joint undertaking with them because those sales were in furtherance of the jointly undertaken criminal activity and reasonably foreseeable in connection with that criminal activity.</p>
<p>(7) Defendant R recruits Defendant S to distribute 500 grams of cocaine. Defendant S knows that Defendant R is the prime figure in a conspiracy involved in importing much larger quantities of cocaine. As long as Defendant S’s agreement and conduct is limited to the distribution of the 500 grams, Defendant S is accountable only for that 500 gram amount (under subsection (a)(1)(A)), rather than the much larger quantity imported by Defendant R.</p>
<p>(8) Defendants T, U, V, and W are hired by a supplier to backpack a quantity of marihuana across the border from Mexico into the United States. Defendants T, U, V, and W receive their individual shipments from the supplier at the same time and coordinate their importation efforts by walking across the border together for mutual assistance and protection. Each defendant is accountable for the aggregate quantity of marihuana transported by the four defendants. The four defendants engaged in a jointly undertaken criminal activity, the object of which was the importation of the four backpacks containing marihuana (subsection (a)(1)(B)), and aided and abetted each other’s actions (subsection (a)(1)(A)) in carrying out the jointly undertaken criminal activity. In contrast, if Defendants T, U, V, and W were hired individually, transported their individual shipments at different times, and otherwise operated independently, each defendant would be accountable only for the quantity of marihuana he personally transported (subsection (a)(1)(A)). As this example illustrates, in cases involving contraband (including controlled substances), the scope of the jointly undertaken criminal activity (and thus the accountability of the defendant for the contraband that was the object of that jointly undertaken activity) may depend upon whether, in the particular circumstances, the nature of the offense is more appropriately viewed as one jointly undertaken criminal activity or as a number of separate criminal activities.&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §1B1.3 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended in Note 3 (formerly Note 2) by deleting the first sentence as follows:</p>
<p>&quot;‘Such acts and omissions that were part of the same course of conduct or common scheme or plan as the offense of conviction,’ as used in subsection (a)(2), refers to acts and omissions committed or aided and abetted by the defendant, or for which the defendant would be otherwise accountable, that were part of the same course of conduct or common scheme or plan as the offense of conviction.&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §1B1.3 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended in Note 6 (formerly Note 5) in the first paragraph by deleting:</p>
<p>&quot;For example, in §2K1.5, subsection (b)(1) applies ‘If the defendant is convicted under 49 U.S.C. § 1472(l)(2).’&quot;,</p>
<p>and inserting in lieu thereof:</p>
<p>&quot;For example, in §2S1.1, subsection (a)(1) applies if the defendant ‘is convicted under 18 U.S.C. § 1956(a)(1)(A), (a)(2)(A), or (a)(3)(A).’&quot;;</p>
<p>and in the second paragraph by deleting:</p>
<p>&quot;For example, §2K1.5(b)(1) (which is applicable only if the defendant is convicted under 49 U.S.C. § 1472(l)(2)) would be applied in determining the offense level under §2X3.1 (Accessory After the Fact) where the defendant was convicted of accessory after the fact to a violation of 49 U.S.C. § 1472(l)(2).&quot;,</p>
<p>and inserting in lieu thereof:</p>
<p>&quot;For example, §2S1.1(a)(1) (which is applicable only if the defendant is convicted under 18 U.S.C. § 1956(a)(1)(A), (a)(2)(A), or (a)(3)(A)) would be applied in determining the offense level under §2X3.1 (Accessory After the Fact) where the defendant was convicted of accessory after the fact to a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1956(a)(1)(A), (a)(2)(A), or (a)(3)(A).&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §1B1.3 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended by inserting the following additional notes:</p>
<p>&quot;9. ‘Common scheme or plan’ and ‘same course of conduct’ are two closely-related concepts.</p>
<p>(A) <em>Common scheme or plan</em>. For two or more offenses to constitute part of a common scheme or plan, they must be substantially connected to each other by at least one common factor, such as common victims, common accomplices, common purpose, or similar <em>modus</em> <em>operandi</em>. For example, the conduct of five defendants who together defrauded a group of investors by computer manipulations that unlawfully transferred funds over an eighteen-month period would qualify as a common scheme or plan on the basis of any of the above listed factors; <em>i.e.</em>, the commonality of victims (the same investors were defrauded on an ongoing basis), commonality of offenders (the conduct constituted an ongoing conspiracy), commonality of purpose (to defraud the group of investors), or similarity of <em>modus</em> <em>operandi</em> (the same or similar computer manipulations were used to execute the scheme).</p>
<p>(B) <em>Same course of conduct</em>. Offenses that do not qualify as part of a common scheme or plan may nonetheless qualify as part of the same course of conduct if they are sufficiently connected or related to each other as to warrant the conclusion that they are part of a single episode, spree, or ongoing series of offenses. Factors that are appropriate to the determination of whether offenses are sufficiently connected or related to each other to be considered as part of the same course of conduct include the degree of similarity of the offenses and the time interval between the offenses. The nature of the offenses may also be a relevant consideration (<em>e.g.</em>, a defendant’s failure to file tax returns in three consecutive years appropriately would be considered as part of the same course of conduct because such returns are only required at yearly intervals).</p>
<p>10. In the case of solicitation, misprision, or accessory after the fact, the conduct for which the defendant is accountable includes all conduct relevant to determining the offense level for the underlying offense that was known, or reasonably should have been known, by the defendant.&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This amendment clarifies and more fully illustrates the operation of this guideline.

For example, a defendant convicted of possession of a firearm by a felon, to which §2K2.1 (Unlawful Receipt, Possession, or Transportation of Firearms or Ammunition; Prohibited Transactions Involving Firearms or Ammunition) applies, is found to have used that firearm in the commission of a robbery. The cross reference at §2K2.1(c) directs that the robbery offense guideline be used.

<p>&quot;Although this guideline, consistent with the general structure of these guidelines, affects only the determination of the guideline range, the policy of the Commission is that where a defendant as a result of a cooperation agreement with the government to assist in the investigation or prosecution of other offenders reveals information that implicates him in unlawful conduct not already known to the government, such defendant should not be subject to an increased sentence by virtue of that cooperation where the government agreed that the information revealed would not be used for such purpose.&quot;,</p>
<p>and inserting in lieu thereof:</p>
<p>&quot;Although the guideline itself affects only the determination of the guideline range, the policy of the Commission, as a corollary, is that information prohibited from being used to determine the applicable guideline range shall not be used to increase the defendant’s sentence above the applicable guideline range by upward departure. In contrast, subsection (b)(5) provides that consideration of such information is appropriate in determining whether, and to what extent, a downward departure is warranted pursuant to a government motion under §5K1.1 (Substantial Assistance to Authorities); <em>e.g.</em>, a court may refuse to depart below the applicable guideline range on the basis of such information.&quot;.</p>

<p>The Commentary to §1B1.8 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended in Note 5 in the second sentence by deleting &quot;repeats&quot; and inserting in lieu thereof &quot;provides&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This amendment clarifies the operation of this guideline. Information protected by this guideline may not be used to determine the applicable guideline range. An upward departure on the basis of such information would be contrary to the Commission’s policy (and, consequently, would be appealable under 18 U.S.C. § 3742(a)(2) and (3). <em>See</em> <em>Williams v. United States</em>, 112 S.Ct. 1112 (1992)). In contrast, the use of information covered by this guideline is appropriate in considering whether, and to what extent, a downward departure under §5K1.1 (Substantial Assistance to Authorities) is appropriate. In addition, this amendment makes minor editorial improvements.</p>

Similarly, for example, if an offense involved a kidnapping during which a participant attempted to murder the victim under circumstances that would have constituted first degree murder had death occurred, the offense referenced under subsection (b)(7) would be the offense of first degree murder.&quot;.</p>

<p>1. If the defendant is convicted of a conspiracy that includes transactions in controlled substances in addition to those that are the subject of substantive counts of conviction, each conspiracy transaction shall be included with those of the substantive counts of conviction to determine scale. If the defendant is convicted of an offense involving negotiation to traffic in a controlled substance, the weight under negotiation in an uncompleted distribution shall be used to calculate the applicable amount. However, where the court finds that the defendant did not intend to produce and was not reasonably capable of producing the negotiated amount, the court shall exclude from the guideline calculation the amount that it finds the defendant did not intend to produce and was not reasonably capable of producing. If the defendant is convicted of conspiracy, <em>see</em> Application Note 1 to §1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct).</p>
<p>2. Where there is no drug seizure or the amount seized does not reflect the scale of the offense, the sentencing judge shall approximate the quantity of the controlled substance. In making this determination, the judge may consider, for example, the price generally obtained for the controlled substance, financial or other records, similar transactions in controlled substances by the defendant, and the size or capability of any laboratory involved.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> Prior to this amendment, §2L1.1 provided the same offense level for a defendant who smuggles, transports, or harbors 1, 5, 25, 50, or any number of unlawful aliens. The inclusion of specific offense characteristic (b)(2) in §2L1.1 in the guidelines as initially promulgated in April 1987 was intended to conform the guidelines to the offense level indicated by past practices data for &quot;ongoing criminal conduct.&quot; However, further study has convinced the Commission that the specific offense characteristic &quot;prior conviction for the same or similar offense&quot; is not a good proxy for such conduct. Moreover, the inclusion of a prior criminal record variable in the offense guideline is inconsistent with the general treatment of prior record as a separate dimension in the guidelines.</p>
<p>This amendment addresses these issues by providing an enhancement in the guideline for the number of aliens smuggled, transported, or harbored as a more direct measure of the scope of the offense. Consistent with the Commission’s general approach throughout the guidelines, the offense level increases gradually with the number of aliens. It should be noted that §3B1.1 (Aggravating Role) generally provides an additional increase of 2, 3, or 4 levels for organizers, managers, and supervisors in large-scale cases. The enhancement in this amendment pertaining to the number of aliens is designed to work in conjunction with the operation of the role enhancements from §3B1.1. Sections 2L2.1 and 2L2.3 are amended to follow the same structure.</p>
<p>In addition, this amendment expands the titles of §§2L2.1 and 2L2.2, and the statutory provisions to these sections, to include additional statutes appropriately covered by these guidelines.</p>

<p>&quot;<em>Application Notes</em>:</p>
<p>1. ‘For pecuniary gain’ means for receipt of, or in anticipation of receipt of, anything of value, whether monetary or in goods or services. Thus, offenses committed for pecuniary gain include both monetary and barter transactions. Similarly, activities designed to increase gross revenue are considered to be committed for pecuniary gain.</p>
<p>2. The acquisition of fish, wildlife, or plants for display to the public, whether for a fee or donation and whether by an individual or an organization, including a governmental entity, a private non-profit organization, or a private for-profit organization, shall be considered to involve a ‘commercial purpose.’</p>
<p>3. For purposes of subsection (b)(2), the quarantine requirements include those set forth in 9 C.F.R. Part 92, and 7 C.F.R. Chapter III. State quarantine laws are included as well.</p>
<p>4. When information is reasonably available, ‘market value’ under subsection (b)(3)(A) shall be based on the fair-market retail price. Where the fair-market retail price is difficult to ascertain, the court may make a reasonable estimate using any reliable information, such as the reasonable replacement or restitution cost or the acquisition and preservation (<em>e.g.</em>, taxidermy) cost. Market value,</p>
<p>however, shall not be based on measurement of aesthetic loss (so called ‘contingent valuation’ methods).</p>
<p>5. If the offense involved the destruction of a substantial quantity of fish, wildlife, or plants, and the seriousness of the offense is not adequately measured by the market value, an upward departure may be warranted.&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §2Q2.1 captioned &quot;Background&quot; is amended by deleting the last two sentences as follows:</p>
<p>&quot;Enhancements are provided where the offense involved a commercial purpose, and where the fish, wildlife, or plants were not quarantined as required by law. An additional enhancement is provided where the market value of the species exceeded $2,000 or the offense involved a quantity of fish, wildlife, or plants that was substantial in relation either to the population of the species or to a discrete subpopulation of the species.&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This amendment is designed to strengthen the deterrent effect of the sanctions for violations covered by this guideline. The amendment expands the specific offense characteristic in subsection (b)(1) to cover categories of offenses that appear to be equally serious to those committed for a commercial purpose. In addition, the amendment expands the specific offense characteristic in subsection (b)(2) to cover other comparable types of risk of harm. Furthermore, the amendment modifies the specific offense characteristic in subsection (b)(3) to better encompass the types of cases that the Commission intended to cover.</p>

<p>1. Particular attention should be given to those items for which entry is prohibited, limited, or restricted. Especially when such items are harmful or protective quotas are in effect, the duties evaded on such items may not adequately reflect the harm to society or protected industries resulting from their importation.

<p>&quot;However, where the defendant has received mitigation by virtue of being convicted of an offense significantly less serious than his actual criminal conduct, <em>e.g.</em>, the defendant is convicted of unlawful possession of a controlled substance but his actual conduct involved drug trafficking, a further reduction in the offense level under §3B1.2 (Mitigating Role) ordinarily is not warranted because the defendant is not substantially less culpable than a defendant whose only conduct involved the less serious offense.&quot;.</p>

If a defendant has received a lower offense level by virtue of being convicted of an offense significantly less serious than warranted by his actual criminal conduct, a reduction for a mitigating role under this section ordinarily is not warranted because such defendant is not substantially less culpable than a defendant whose only conduct involved the less serious offense. For example, if a defendant whose actual conduct involved a minimal role in the distribution of 25 grams of cocaine (an offense having a Chapter Two offense level of 14 under §2D1.1) is convicted of simple possession of cocaine (an offense having a Chapter Two offense level of 6 under §2D2.1), no reduction for a mitigating role is warranted because the defendant is not substantially less culpable than a defendant whose only conduct involved the simple possession of cocaine.&quot;.</p>

The timeliness of the defendant’s acceptance of responsibility is a consideration under both subsections, and is context specific. In general, the conduct qualifying for a decrease in offense level under subsection (b)(1) or (2) will occur particularly early in the case.

Such a defendant has accepted responsibility in a way that ensures the certainty of his just punishment in a timely manner, thereby appropriately meriting an additional reduction. Subsection (b) does not apply, however, to a defendant whose offense level is level 15 or lower prior to application of subsection (a). At offense level 15 or lower, the reduction in the guideline range provided by a 2-level decrease in offense level under subsection (a) (which is a greater proportional reduction in the guideline range than at higher offense levels due to the structure of the Sentencing Table) is adequate for the court to take into account the factors set forth in subsection (b) within the applicable guideline range.&quot;.</p>

In such a case, a decision above the guideline range for a defendant with a Category VI criminal history may be warranted. However, this provision is not symmetrical. The lower limit of the range for a Category I criminal history is set for a first offender with the lowest risk of recidivism. Therefore, a departure below the lower limit of the guideline range for a Category I criminal history on the basis of the adequacy of criminal history cannot be appropriate.&quot;,</p>
<p>and inserting in lieu thereof:</p>
<p>&quot;The Commission contemplates that there may, on occasion, be a case of an egregious, serious criminal record in which even the guideline range for Criminal History Category VI is not adequate to reflect the seriousness of the defendant’s criminal history. In such a case, a departure above the guideline range for a defendant with Criminal History Category VI may be warranted. In determining whether an upward departure from Criminal History Category VI is warranted, the court should consider that the nature of the prior offenses rather than simply their number is often more indicative of the seriousness of the defendant’s criminal record. For example, a defendant with five prior sentences for very large-scale fraud offenses may have 15 criminal history points, within the range of points typical for Criminal History Category VI, yet have a substantially more serious criminal history overall because of the nature of the prior offenses. On the other hand, a defendant with nine prior 60-day jail sentences for offenses such as petty larceny, prostitution, or possession of gambling slips has a higher number of criminal history points (18 points) than the typical Criminal History Category VI defendant, but not necessarily a more serious criminal history overall. Where the court determines that the extent and nature of the defendant’s criminal history, taken together, are sufficient to warrant an upward departure from Criminal History Category VI, the court should structure the departure by moving incrementally down the sentencing table to the next higher offense level in Criminal History Category VI until it finds a guideline range appropriate to the case.</p>
<p>However, this provision is not symmetrical. The lower limit of the range for Criminal History Category I is set for a first offender with the lowest risk of recidivism. Therefore, a departure below the lower limit of the guideline range for Criminal History Category I on the basis of the adequacy of criminal history cannot be appropriate.&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This amendment provides additional guidance concerning upward departure from Criminal History Category VI on the basis of adequacy of criminal history category, and makes minor editorial changes.</p>

<p>The Commentary to §4B1.2 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended by deleting the text of Note 2 as follows:</p>
<p>&quot;‘Crime of violence’ includes murder, manslaughter, kidnapping, aggravated assault, forcible sex offenses, robbery, arson, extortion, extortionate extension of credit, and burglary of a dwelling. Other offenses are included where (A) that offense has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another, or (B) the conduct set forth (<em>i.e.</em>, expressly charged) in the count of which the defendant was convicted involved use of explosives (including any explosive material or destructive device) or, by its nature, presented a serious potential risk of physical injury to another. Under this section, the conduct of which the defendant was convicted is the focus of inquiry.</p>
<p>The term ‘crime of violence’ does not include the offense of unlawful possession of a firearm by a felon. Where the instant offense is the unlawful possession of a firearm by a felon, the specific offense characteristics of §2K2.1 (Unlawful Receipt, Possession, or Transportation of Firearms or Ammunition; Prohibited Transactions Involving Firearms or Ammunition) provide an increase in offense level if the defendant has one or more prior felony convictions for a crime of violence or controlled substance offense; and, if the defendant is sentenced under the provisions of 18 U.S.C. § 924(e), §4B1.4 (Armed Career Criminal) will apply.&quot;,</p>

<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This amendment conforms the definition of &quot;sustaining a conviction&quot; in §4B1.2 to the definition of &quot;convicted of an offense&quot; in §4A1.2. In addition, this amendment ratifies a previous amendment to the commentary to §4B1.2 (amendment 433, effective November 1, 1991) and corrects a clerical error in a reference in that commentary to §2K2.1. The previous amendment to the text of Application Note 2 clarified that application of §4B1.2 is governed by the offense of conviction, and that the offense of being a felon in possession of a firearm is not a crime of violence within the meaning of this guideline. As a clarifying and conforming change, the previous commentary amendment reflected Commission intent that the term &quot;crime of violence,&quot; as that term is used in §§4B1.1 and 4B1.2, be interpreted consistently with that term as used in other provisions of the Guidelines Manual. For example, §4B1.4, as promulgated by amendment 355, effective November 1, 1990, provides an increased offense level for a &quot;felon-in-possession&quot; defendant who is subject to an enhanced sentence under 18 U.S.C. § 924(e) and who used or possessed the firearm in connection with a crime of violence (§4B1.4(b)(3)(A)). This action to ratify a previous commentary amendment was taken because of concerns raised by <em>United States v. Stinson</em>, 957 F.2d 813 (11th Cir. 1992), in which the court stated it would not follow amendment 433 because the commentary amendment was not submitted to Congress.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;(b) If subsection (a) does not apply, and the undischarged term of imprisonment resulted from offense(s) that constituted part of the same course of conduct as the instant offense and have been fully taken into account in the determination of the offense level for the instant offense, or if the prior undischarged term of imprisonment resulted from a federal offense and was imposed pursuant to the Sentencing Reform Act, the sentence for the instant offense shall be imposed to result in a combined sentence equal to the total punishment that would have been imposed under §5G1.2 (Sentencing on Multiple Counts of Conviction) had all the sentences been imposed at the same time.&quot;,</p>

<p>The Commentary to §5G1.3 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended by deleting Notes 2-4 as follows:</p>
<p>&quot;2. Subsection (b) (which applies only if subsection (a) does not apply), applies in two situations. First, it applies if the sentence resulting in the undischarged term of imprisonment was a federal sentence imposed pursuant to the Sentencing Reform Act. In such cases, the court shall fashion a sentence equal to the total punishment that would have been imposed had both sentences been imposed at the same time. Second, it applies if the conduct resulting in the undischarged term of imprisonment was part of the same course of conduct as the instant offense and has been fully taken into account in determining the offense level for the instant offense (<em>e.g.</em>, where a defendant is prosecuted in both federal and state court for the same criminal conduct; or where a defendant is prosecuted in federal and state court for different criminal transactions that are part of the same course of conduct, such as two drug sales, but the conduct underlying both transactions is fully taken into account under §1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct) in determining the offense level for the instant offense).</p>
<p>3. When a sentence is imposed pursuant to subsection (b), the court should adjust for any term of imprisonment already served as a result of the conduct taken into account in determining the instant sentence (<em>e.g.</em>, if the appropriate total punishment determined under this subsection for all offenses is 30 months and the defendant has already served 10 months of the prior undischarged term of imprisonment, the court should impose a sentence of 20 months concurrent with the prior undischarged term).</p>
<p>4. Where the defendant is serving an unexpired term of imprisonment in circumstances other than those set forth in subsections (a) or (b), the court shall impose a consecutive sentence to the extent necessary to fashion a sentence resulting in incremental punishment for the multiple offenses. To the extent practicable, the court shall impose a sentence for the instant offense that results in a combined sentence that approximates the total punishment that would have been imposed under §5G1.2 (Sentencing on Multiple Counts of Conviction) had all of the offenses been federal offenses for which sentences were being imposed at the same time. Where the defendant is serving a term of imprisonment for a state offense, the information available may permit only a rough estimate of the total punishment that would have been imposed under the guidelines. It is not intended that the above methodology be applied in a manner that unduly complicates or prolongs the sentencing process. In fashioning an appropriate incremental punishment, the court should consider whether the offense was committed while the defendant was on bail or other release status from another offense. In such cases, a reasonable incremental penalty appropriately would include an additional enhancement equivalent to that provided in §2J1.7 (Commission of Offense While on Release).&quot;,</p>
<p>and inserting in lieu thereof:</p>
<p>&quot;2. Subsection (b) (which may apply only if subsection (a) does not apply), addresses cases in which the conduct resulting in the undischarged term of imprisonment has been fully taken into account under §1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct) in determining the offense level for the instant offense. This can occur, for example, where a defendant is prosecuted in both federal and state court, or in two or more federal jurisdictions, for the same criminal conduct or for different criminal transactions that were part of the same course of conduct.</p>
<p>When a sentence is imposed pursuant to subsection (b), the court should adjust for any term of imprisonment already served as a result of the conduct taken into account in determining the sentence for the instant offense. <em>Example</em>: The defendant has been convicted of a federal offense charging the sale of 40 grams of cocaine. Under §1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct), the defendant is held accountable for the sale of an additional 15 grams of cocaine that is part of the same course of conduct for which the defendant has been convicted and sentenced in state court (the defendant received a nine-month sentence of imprisonment, of which he has served six months at the time of sentencing on the instant federal offense). The guideline range applicable to the defendant is 10-16 months (Chapter Two offense level of 14 for sale of 55 grams of cocaine; 2-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility; final offense level of 12; Criminal History Category I). The court determines that a sentence of 13 months provides the appropriate total punishment. Because the defendant has already served six months on the related state charge, a sentence of seven months, imposed to run concurrently with the remainder of the defendant’s state sentence, achieves this result. For clarity, the court should note on the Judgment in a Criminal Case Order that the sentence imposed is not a departure from the guidelines because the defendant has been credited for guideline purposes under §5G1.3(b) with six months served in state custody.</p>
<p>3. Where the defendant is subject to an undischarged term of imprisonment in circumstances other than those set forth in subsections (a) or (b), subsection (c) applies and the court shall impose a consecutive sentence to the extent necessary to fashion a sentence resulting in a reasonable incremental punishment for the multiple offenses. In some circumstances, such incremental punishment can be achieved by the imposition of a sentence that is concurrent with the remainder of the unexpired term of imprisonment. In such cases, a consecutive sentence is not required. To the extent practicable, the court should consider a reasonable incremental penalty to be a sentence for the instant offense that results in a combined sentence of imprisonment that approximates the total punishment that would have been imposed under §5G1.2 (Sentencing on Multiple Counts of Conviction) had all of the offenses been federal offenses for which sentences were being imposed at the same time. It is recognized that this determination frequently will require an approximation. Where the defendant is serving a term of imprisonment for a state offense, the information available may permit only a rough estimate of the total punishment that would have been imposed under the guidelines. Where the offense resulting in the undischarged term of imprisonment is a federal offense for which a guideline determination has previously been made, the task will be somewhat more straightforward, although even in such cases a precise determination may not be possible.</p>
<p>It is not intended that the above methodology be applied in a manner that unduly complicates or prolongs the sentencing process. Additionally, this methodology does not, itself, require the court to depart from the guideline range established for the instant federal offense. Rather, this methodology is meant to assist the court in determining the appropriate sentence (<em>e.g.</em>, the appropriate point within the applicable guideline range, whether to order the sentence to run concurrently or consecutively to the undischarged term of imprisonment, or whether a departure is warranted). Generally, the court may achieve an appropriate sentence through its determination of an appropriate point within the applicable guideline range for the instant federal offense, combined with its determination of whether that sentence will run concurrently or consecutively to the undischarged term of imprisonment.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Illustrations of the Application of Subsection (c)</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(A) The guideline range applicable to the instant federal offense is 24-30 months. The court determines that a total punishment of 36 months’ imprisonment would appropriately reflect the instant federal offense and the offense resulting in the undischarged term of imprisonment. The undischarged term of imprisonment is an indeterminate sentence of imprisonment with a 60-month maximum. At the time of sentencing on the instant federal offense, the defendant has served ten months on the undischarged term of imprisonment. In this case, a sentence of 26 months’ imprisonment to be served concurrently with the remainder of the undischarged term of imprisonment would (1) be within the guideline range for the instant federal offense, and (2) achieve an appropriate total punishment (36 months).</p>
<p>(B) The applicable guideline range for the instant federal offense is 24-30 months. The court determines that a total punishment of 36 months’ imprisonment would appropriately reflect the instant federal offense and the offense resulting in the undischarged term of imprisonment. The undischarged term of imprisonment is a six-month determinate sentence. At the time of sentencing on the instant federal offense, the defendant has served three months on the undischarged term of imprisonment. In this case, a sentence of 30 months’ imprisonment to be served consecutively to the undischarged term of imprisonment would (1) be within the guideline range for the instant federal offense, and (2) achieve an appropriate total punishment (36 months).</p>
<p>(C) The applicable guideline range for the instant federal offense is 24-30 months. The court determines that a total punishment of 60 months’ imprisonment would appropriately reflect the instant federal offense and the offense resulting in the undischarged term of imprisonment. The undischarged term of imprisonment is a 12-month determinate sentence. In this case, a sentence of 30 months’ imprisonment to be served consecutively to the undischarged term of imprisonment would be the greatest sentence imposable without departure for the instant federal offense.</p>
<p>(D) The applicable guideline range for the instant federal offense is 24-30 months. The court determines that a total punishment of 36 months’ imprisonment would appropriately reflect the instant federal offense and the offense resulting in the undischarged term of imprisonment. The undischarged term of imprisonment is an indeterminate sentence with a 60-month maximum. At the time of sentencing on the instant federal offense, the defendant has served 22 months on the undischarged term of imprisonment. In this case, a sentence of 24 months to be served concurrently with the remainder of the undischarged term of imprisonment would be the lowest sentence imposable without departure for the instant federal offense.&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This amendment deletes the prong of §5G1.3(b) pertaining to the sentencing of a defendant subject to an undischarged term of imprisonment previously imposed pursuant to the Sentencing Reform Act because the Commission found a number of problems in implementation. Cases previously addressed by this prong henceforth will be addressed by subsection (c), which is designed to produce a similar result but requires less precise calculations. Consistent with the structure of the Guidelines Manual, subsection (c) is expressly designated a policy statement. In addition, this amendment provides additional commentary explaining, and providing examples of, the operation of this section.</p>

<p>Section 6B1.2(a) is amended by inserting the following additional paragraph at the end:</p>
<p>&quot;<em>Provided</em>, that a plea agreement that includes the dismissal of a charge or a plea agreement not to pursue a potential charge shall not preclude the conduct underlying such charge from being considered under the provisions of §1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct) in connection with the count(s) of which the defendant is convicted.&quot;.</p>

<p>&quot;should accept a recommended sentence or a plea agreement requiring imposition of a specific sentence only if the court is satisfied either that such sentence is an appropriate sentence within the applicable guideline range or, if not, that the sentence&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §6B1.2 is amended by inserting the following additional paragraphs at the end:</p>
<p>&quot; A defendant who enters a plea of guilty in a timely manner will enhance the likelihood of his receiving a reduction in offense level under §3E1.1 (Acceptance of Responsibility). Further reduction in offense level (or sentence) due to a plea agreement will tend to undermine the sentencing guidelines.</p>
<p>The second paragraph of subsection (a) provides that a plea agreement that includes the dismissal of a charge, or a plea agreement not to pursue a potential charge, shall not prevent the conduct underlying that charge from being considered under the provisions of §1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct) in connection with the count(s) of which the defendant is convicted. This paragraph prevents a plea agreement from restricting consideration of conduct that is within the scope of §1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct) in respect to the count(s) of which the defendant is convicted; it does not in any way expand or modify the scope of §1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct).&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This amendment clarifies that a plea agreement to dismiss a charge or not to pursue a potential charge does not insulate the conduct underlying such charge from the operation of §1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct) in respect to the count(s) of which the defendant is convicted.

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;(3) If the defendant is convicted of two offenses, the first committed before, and the second after, a revised edition of the Guidelines Manual became effective, the revised edition of the Guidelines Manual is to be applied to both offenses.&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §1B1.11 captioned &quot;Application Note&quot; is amended by inserting the following additional note:</p>
<p>&quot;2. Under subsection (b)(1), the last date of the offense of conviction is the controlling date for <em>ex</em> <em>post</em> <em>facto</em> purposes. For example, if the offense of conviction (<em>i.e.</em>, the conduct charged in the count of the indictment or information of which the defendant was convicted) was determined by the court to have been committed between October 15, 1991 and October 28, 1991, the date of October 28, 1991 is the controlling date for <em>ex</em> <em>post</em> <em>facto</em> purposes. This is true even if the defendant’s conduct relevant to the determination of the guideline range under §1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct) included an act that occurred on November 2, 1991 (after a revised Guideline Manual took effect).&quot;;</p>
<p>and in the caption by deleting &quot;Note&quot; and inserting in lieu thereof &quot;Notes&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §1B1.11 captioned &quot;Background&quot; is amended by inserting the following additional sentence as the first sentence of the first paragraph:</p>
<p>&quot;Subsections (a) and (b)(1) provide that the court should apply the Guidelines Manual in effect on the date the defendant is sentenced unless the court determines that doing so would violate the <em>ex</em> <em>post</em> <em>facto</em> clause in Article I, § 9 of the United States Constitution.&quot;;</p>
<p>and by inserting the following additional paragraphs at the end:</p>
<p>&quot; Subsection (b)(2) provides that the Guidelines Manual in effect on a particular date shall be applied in its entirety.</p>
<p>Subsection (b)(3) provides that where the defendant is convicted of two offenses, the first committed before, and the second after, a revised edition of the Guidelines Manual became effective, the revised edition of the Guidelines Manual is to be applied to both offenses, even if the revised edition results in an increased penalty for the first offense. Because the defendant completed the second offense after the amendment to the guidelines took effect, the <em>ex</em> <em>post</em> <em>facto</em> clause does not prevent determining the sentence for that count based on the amended guidelines. For example, if a defendant pleads guilty to a single count of embezzlement that occurred after the most recent edition of the Guidelines Manual became effective, the guideline range applicable in sentencing will encompass any relevant conduct (<em>e.g.</em>, related embezzlement offenses that may have occurred prior to the effective date of the guideline amendments) for the offense of conviction. The same would be true for a defendant convicted of two counts of embezzlement, one committed before the amendments were enacted, and the second after. In this example, the <em>ex</em> <em>post</em> <em>facto</em> clause would not bar application of the amended guideline to the first conviction; a contrary conclusion would mean that such defendant was subject to a lower guideline range than if convicted only of the second offense. Decisions from several appellate courts addressing the analogous situation of the constitutionality of counting pre-guidelines criminal activity as relevant conduct for a guidelines sentence support this approach. <em>See</em> <em>United States v. Ykema</em>, 887 F.2d 697 (6th Cir. 1989) (upholding inclusion of pre-November 1, 1987, drug quantities as relevant conduct for the count of conviction, noting that habitual offender statutes routinely augment punishment for an offense of conviction based on acts committed before a law is passed), <em>cert</em>. <em>denied</em>, 493 U.S. 1062 (1990); <em>United States v. Allen</em>, 886 F.2d 143 (8th Cir. 1989) (similar); <em>see</em> <em>also</em> <em>United States v. Cusack</em>, 901 F.2d 29 (4th Cir. 1990) (similar).</p>
<p>Moreover, the approach set forth in subsection (b)(3) should be followed regardless of whether the offenses of conviction are the type in which the conduct is grouped under §3D1.2(d). The <em>ex</em> <em>post</em> <em>facto</em> clause does not distinguish between groupable and nongroupable offenses, and unless that clause would be violated, Congress’ directive to apply the sentencing guidelines in effect at the time of sentencing must be followed. Under the guideline sentencing system, a single sentencing range is determined based on the defendant’s overall conduct, even if there are multiple counts of conviction (<em>see</em> §§3D1.1-3D1.5, 5G1.2). Thus, if a defendant is sentenced in January 1992 for a bank robbery committed in October 1988 and one committed in November 1991, the November 1991 Guidelines Manual should be used to determine a combined guideline range for both counts. <em>See</em> <em>generally</em> <em>United States v. Stephenson</em>, 921 F.2d 438 (2d Cir. 1990) (holding that the Sentencing Commission and Congress intended that the applicable version of the guidelines be applied as a ‘cohesive and integrated whole’ rather than in a piecemeal fashion).</p>
<p>Consequently, even in a complex case involving multiple counts that occurred under several different versions of the Guidelines Manual, it will not be necessary to compare more than two manuals to determine the applicable guideline range -- the manual in effect at the time the last offense of conviction was completed and the manual in effect at the time of sentencing.&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This amendment expands §1B1.11 to address what has become a frequently asked hotline question and troublesome application issue -- the application of amended guidelines to multiple count cases in which the effective date of guideline revision(s) occurs between the offenses of conviction. The issue has also produced litigation before several appellate courts. <em>See</em> <em>United States v. Castro</em>, 972 F.2d 1107 (9th Cir. 1992), <em>cert.</em> <em>denied</em>, 113 S. Ct. 1350 (1993); <em>United States v. Seligsohn</em>, 981 F.2d 1418 (3d Cir. 1992); <em>United States v. Hartzog</em>, 983 F.2d 604 (4th Cir. 1993). This amendment extends the Commission’s &quot;one book&quot; rule to multiple count cases and sets forth the rationale for this policy.</p>

{id: 476, content:"<p><strong>476.</strong> <strong>Amendment:</strong> The Commentary to §2A1.1 captioned &quot;Background&quot; is deleted as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;<em>Background</em>: The maximum penalty authorized by 18 U.S.C. § 1111 for first degree murder is death or life imprisonment. Whether a mandatory minimum term of life imprisonment is applicable to every defendant convicted of first degree murder under 18 U.S.C. § 1111 is a matter of statutory interpretation for the courts. The discussion in Application Note 1, <em>supra</em>, regarding circumstances in which a downward departure may be warranted is relevant in the event the penalty provisions of 18 U.S.C. § 1111 are construed to permit a sentence less than life imprisonment, or in the event the defendant is convicted under a statute that expressly authorizes a sentence of less than life imprisonment (<em>e.g.</em>, 18 U.S.C. §§ 2113(e), 2118(c)(2), 21 U.S.C. § 848(e)).</p>
<p>The maximum penalty authorized under 21 U.S.C. § 848(e) is death or life imprisonment. If a term of imprisonment is imposed, the statutorily required minimum term is twenty years.&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This amendment deletes commentary that highlighted the question of whether 18 U.S.C. § 1111 provides a mandatory minimum term of life imprisonment. Since this commentary was written, appellate courts uniformly have held that 18 U.S.C. § 1111 does provide a mandatory minimum term of life imprisonment. <em>See</em> <em>United States v. Sands</em>, 968 F.2d 1058 (10th Cir. 1992), <em>cert</em>. <em>denied</em>, 113 S. Ct. 987 (1993); <em>United States v. LaFleur</em>, 952 F.2d 1537 (9th Cir), <em>modfied</em> <em>and</em> <em>reh’g</em> <em>denied</em>, 971 F.2d 200 (9th Cir. 1991); <em>United States v. Gonzalez</em>, 922 F.2d 1044 (2d Cir.), <em>cert</em>. <em>denied</em>, 112 S. Ct. 660 (1991); <em>United States v. Donley</em>, 878 F.2d 735 (3d Cir. 1989), <em>cert</em>. <em>denied</em>, 494 U.S. 1058 (1990). In addition, this amendment deletes, as unnecessary, several sentences of commentary that merely recite statutory penalties.</p>

<p>&quot;(c) Cross Reference</p>
<p>(1) If a victim was killed under circumstances that would constitute murder under 18 U.S.C. § 1111 had such killing taken place within the territorial or maritime jurisdiction of the United States, apply §2A1.1 (First Degree Murder).&quot;.</p>
<p>Section 2A3.1(b)(2) is amended by deleting &quot;otherwise, (B) if the victim was under the age of sixteen&quot; and inserting in lieu thereof &quot;or (B) if the victim had attained the age of twelve years but had not attained the age of sixteen years&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §2A3.1 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended by inserting the following additional note:</p>
<p>&quot;5. If the defendant was convicted (A) of more than one act of criminal sexual abuse and the counts are grouped under §3D1.2 (Groups of Closely Related Counts), or (B) of only one such act but the court determines that the offense involved multiple acts of criminal sexual abuse of the same victim or different victims, an upward departure would be warranted.&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This amendment adds a cross reference to §2A3.1 to address the circumstance in which a victim is murdered during the offense. In addition, an editorial change in §2A3.1(b)(2) is made to conform the phraseology used in this subsection to that used elsewhere in the guidelines. This amendment also authorizes an upward departure where the offense involved multiple acts of criminal sexual abuse that do not result in an increase in offense level under the multiple count rules in Chapter Three, Part D.</p>

<p>1. ‘More than minimal planning,’ ‘firearm,’ and ‘destructive device’ are defined in the Commentary to §1B1.1 (Application Instructions).</p>
<p>2. Valuation of property is discussed in the Commentary to §2B1.1.</p>
<p>3. ‘Undelivered United States mail’ means mail that has not actually been received by the addressee or his agent (<em>e.g.</em>, it includes mail that is in the addressee’s mail box).</p>
<p>4. Subsection (b)(5), referring to an ‘organized scheme to receive stolen vehicles or vehicle parts,’ provides an alternative minimum measure of loss in the case of an ongoing, sophisticated operation such as an auto theft ring or ‘chop shop.’ ‘Vehicles’ refers to all forms of vehicles, including aircraft and watercraft. <em>See</em> Commentary to §2B1.1 (Larceny, Embezzlement, and Other Forms of Theft).</p>
<p><em>Background</em>: The treatment accorded receiving stolen property parallels that given theft. Persons who receive stolen property for resale receive a sentence enhancement because the amount of property is likely to underrepresent the scope of their criminality and the extent to which they encourage or facilitate other crimes.&quot;.</p>

<p>3. Subsection (b)(4) does not apply to possession of a dangerous weapon (including a firearm) that was stolen during the course of the offense.</p>
<p><em>Background</em>: The offense level for burglary is significantly higher than that for theft for low losses, but is approximately the same for very high losses. Weapon possession, but not use, is a specific offense characteristic because use of a weapon (including to threaten) ordinarily would make the offense robbery. Weapon use would be a ground for upward departure.&quot;.</p>

<p><em>Statutory Provisions</em>: 18 U.S.C. § 201(b)(3), (4).</p>
<p><em>Application Notes</em>:</p>
<p>1. ‘Substantial interference with the administration of justice’ includes a premature or improper termination of a felony investigation; an indictment, verdict, or any judicial determination based upon perjury, false testimony, or other false evidence; or the unnecessary expenditure of substantial governmental or court resources.</p>
<p>2. For offenses covered under this section, Chapter Three, Part C (Obstruction) does not apply, unless the defendant obstructed the investigation or trial of the witness bribery count.</p>
<p>3. In the event that the defendant is convicted under this section as well as for the underlying offense (<em>i.e.</em>, the offense with respect to which the bribery occurred), <em>see</em> the Commentary to Chapter Three, Part C (Obstruction), and to §3D1.2(c) (Groups of Closely Related Counts).</p>

</blockquote>
<p><em>Commentary</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Statutory Provision</em>: 18 U.S.C. § 844(h).</p>
<p><em>Application Notes</em>:</p>
<p>1. The statute requires a term of imprisonment imposed under this section to run consecutively to any other term of imprisonment.</p>
<p>2. Imposition of a term of supervised release is governed by the provisions of §5D1.1 (Imposition of a Term of Supervised Release).</p>
<p>3. Where a sentence under this section is imposed in conjunction with a sentence for an underlying offense, any specific offense characteristic for the use of fire or explosives is not to be applied in respect to the guideline for the underlying offense.</p>
<p>4. Subsection (b) sets forth special provisions concerning the imposition of fines. Where there is also a conviction for the underlying offense, a consolidated fine guideline is determined by the offense level that would have applied to the underlying offense absent a conviction under 18 U.S.C. § 844(h). This is required because the offense level for the underlying offense may be reduced in that any specific offense characteristic for use of fire or explosives would not be applied (<em>see</em> Application Note 3). The Commission has not established a fine guideline range for the unusual case in which there is no conviction for the underlying offense, although a fine is authorized under 18 U.S.C. § 3571.&quot;.</p>

<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This amendment deletes 25 offense guidelines by consolidating them with other offense guidelines that cover similar offense conduct and have identical or very similar base offense levels and adjustments. Consolidation of offense guidelines in this manner has a number of practical advantages: it shortens and simplifies the Guidelines Manual and reduces the likelihood of inconsistency in phraseology and definitions from section to section; it will reduce possible confusion and litigation as to which guideline applies to particular conduct; it will reduce the number of conforming amendments required whenever similar sections are amended; and it will aid the development of case law because cases involving similar or identical concepts and definitions can be referenced under one guideline rather than different guidelines.</p>

{id: 482, content:"<p><strong>482.</strong> <strong>Amendment:</strong> The Commentary to §2B1.1 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended in Note 2 by inserting the following additional sentence as the fourth sentence of the first paragraph:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Loss does not include the interest that could have been earned had the funds not been stolen.&quot;;</p>
<p>and by inserting the following additional paragraphs as the second and third paragraphs:</p>
<p>&quot;Where the offense involved making a fraudulent loan or credit card application, or other unlawful conduct involving a loan or credit card, the loss is to be determined under the principles set forth in the Commentary to §2F1.1 (Fraud and Deceit).</p>
<p>In certain cases, an offense may involve a series of transactions without a corresponding increase in loss. For example, a defendant may embezzle $5,000 from a bank and conceal this embezzlement by shifting this amount from one account to another in a series of nine transactions over a six-month period. In this example, the loss is $5,000 (the amount taken), not $45,000 (the sum of the nine transactions), because the additional transactions did not increase the actual or potential loss.&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §2B1.1 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended by deleting Note 3 as follows:</p>
<p>&quot;3. The loss need not be determined with precision, and may be inferred from any reasonably reliable information available, including the scope of the operation.&quot;,</p>
<p>and inserting in lieu thereof:</p>
<p>&quot;3. For the purposes of subsection (b)(1), the loss need not be determined with precision. The court need only make a reasonable estimate of the loss, given the available information. This estimate, for example, may be based upon the approximate number of victims and the average loss to each victim, or on more general factors such as the scope and duration of the offense.&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §2B5.3 is amended by inserting the following immediately before &quot;Background&quot;:</p>
<p>&quot;Application Note:</p>
<p>1. ‘Infringing items’ means the items that violate the copyright or trademark laws (not the legitimate items that are infringed upon).&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §2B6.1 captioned &quot;Application Note&quot; is amended in the caption by deleting &quot;Note&quot; and inserting in lieu thereof &quot;Notes&quot;; and by inserting the following additional Note:</p>
<p>&quot;2. The ‘corresponding number of levels from the table in §2F1.1 (Fraud and Deceit),’ as used in subsection (b)(1), refers to the number of levels corresponding to the retail value of the motor vehicles or parts involved.&quot;.</p>
<p>Section 2F1.1(b)(3) is amended by deleting &quot;or process&quot; and by inserting in lieu thereof &quot;, or process not addressed elsewhere in the guidelines&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §2F1.1 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended in Note 5 in the first sentence by inserting a comma immediately following &quot;decree&quot;; and by inserting the following additional sentence at the end:</p>
<p>&quot;This subsection does not apply to conduct addressed elsewhere in the guidelines; <em>e.g.</em>, a violation of a condition of release (addressed in §2J1.7 (Offense Committed While on Release)) or a violation of probation (addressed in §4A1.1 (Criminal History Category)).&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §2F1.1 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended in Note 7(b) in the second paragraph by inserting the following additional sentence at the end:</p>
<p>&quot;Where the loss determined above significantly understates or overstates the seriousness of the defendant’s conduct, an upward or downward departure may be warranted.&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §2F1.1 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended in Note 10 by deleting &quot;the primary&quot; and inserting in lieu thereof &quot;a primary&quot;; by inserting &quot;; or the fraud caused or risked reasonably foreseeable, substantial non-monetary harm&quot; immediately following &quot;was non-monetary&quot;; by deleting &quot;physical or psychological harm&quot; and inserting in lieu thereof &quot;reasonably foreseeable, physical or psychological harm or severe emotional trauma&quot;; by deleting the period immediately following &quot;institution&quot; and inserting in lieu thereof a semicolon; by inserting a new subdivision, immediately following subdivision (e), as follows:</p>
<p>&quot;(f) the offense involved the knowing endangerment of the solvency of one or more victims.&quot;;</p>
<p>and by inserting the following additional sentence at the end of the last paragraph:</p>
<p>&quot;In such cases, a downward departure may be warranted.&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §2F1.1 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended in Note 11 by deleting the last two sentences as follows:</p>
<p>&quot;The statutes provide for increased maximum terms of imprisonment for the use or possession of device-making equipment and the production or transfer of more than five identification documents or fifteen access devices. The court may find it appropriate to enhance the sentence for violations of these statutes in a manner similar to the treatment of analogous counterfeiting offenses under Part B of this Chapter.&quot;,</p>
<p>and inserting in lieu thereof:</p>
<p>&quot;Where the primary purpose of the offense involved the unlawful production, transfer, possession, or use of identification documents for the purpose of violating, or assisting another to violate, the laws relating to naturalization, citizenship, or legal resident status, apply §2L2.1 or §2L2.2, as appropriate, rather than §2F1.1. In the case of an offense involving false identification documents or access devices, an upward departure may be warranted where the actual loss does not adequately reflect the seriousness of the conduct.&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This amendment makes the definitions of loss in §§2B1.1 (Larceny, Embezzlement, and Other Forms of Theft) and 2F1.1 (Fraud and Deceit) more consistent. Although the term &quot;reasonably reliable information&quot; is deleted from §2B1.1 (there is no corresponding term in §2F1.1), no substantive change results because the reliability of the information considered in respect to all cases is already addressed in §6A1.3 (Resolution of Disputed Factors). In addition, this amendment provides additional guidance for the determination of loss in cases that are referenced to §2B1.1, but have loss characteristics closely resembling offenses referenced to §2F1.1, and in cases in which simply adding the amounts from a series of transactions does not reflect the amount taken or put at risk. This amendment also clarifies the meaning of the term &quot;infringing items&quot; in §2B5.3, and expressly provides that the reference in §2B6.1 to the table in §2F1.1 is to be applied using the retail value of the stolen parts. In addition, this amendment clarifies the operation of §2F1.1(b)(3) to avoid inappropriate double counting. Finally, this amendment revises the Commentary to §2F1.1 by expanding Application Note 10 to provide guidance in cases in which the monetary loss does not adequately reflect the seriousness of the offense, and by clarifying Application</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;21 U.S.C. § 841, except as expressly provided. Mixture or substance does not include materials that must be separated from the controlled substance before the controlled substance can be used. Examples of such materials include the fiberglass in a cocaine/fiberglass bonded suitcase, beeswax in a cocaine/beeswax statue, and waste water from an illicit laboratory used to manufacture a controlled substance. If such material cannot readily be separated from the mixture or substance that appropriately is counted in the Drug Quantity Table, the court may use any reasonable method to approximate the weight of the mixture or substance to be counted.</p>
<p>An upward departure nonetheless may be warranted when the mixture or substance counted in the Drug Quantity Table is combined with other, non-countable material in an unusually sophisticated manner in order to avoid detection.&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This amendment addresses an inter-circuit conflict regarding the meaning of the term &quot;mixture or substance,&quot; as used in §2D1.1 by expressly providing that this term does not include portions of a drug mixture that have to be separated from the controlled substance before the controlled substance can be used. This issue has arisen, subsequent to the United States Supreme Court decision in <em>Chapman v. United States</em>, 111 S. Ct. 1919 (1991), in two types of cases. The first type of case involves a controlled substance bonded to, or suspended in, another substance (<em>e.g.</em>, cocaine mixed with beeswax); however, the controlled substance is not usable until it is separated from the other substance. <em>See</em>, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>United States v. Mahecha-Onofre</em>, 936 F.2d 623 (1st Cir.), <em>cert</em>. <em>denied</em>, 112 S. Ct. 648 (1991); <em>United States v. Restrepo-Contreras</em>, 942 F.2d 96 (1st Cir. 1991), <em>cert</em>. <em>denied</em>, 112 S. Ct. 955 (1992). The second type of case involves the waste produced from an illicit laboratory used to manufacture a controlled substance or chemicals confiscated before the chemical processing of the controlled substance is completed. The waste product is typically water or chemicals used to either remove impurities or form a precipitate (the precipitate, in some cases, being the controlled substance). Typically, a small amount of controlled substance remains in the waste water; often this amount is too small to quantify and is listed as a trace amount (no weight given) in DEA reports. In these types of cases, the waste product is not consumable. The chemicals seized before the end of processing are also not usable in that form because further processing must take place before they can be used. <em>See</em>, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>United States v. Sherrod</em>, 964 F.2d 1501 (5th Cir.), <em>cert</em>. <em>denied</em> <em>sub</em> <em>nom</em>. <em>Cooper v. United States</em>, 113 S.

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;16. Where (A) the amount of the controlled substance for which the defendant is accountable under §1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct) results in a base offense level greater than 36, (B) the court finds that this offense level overrepresents the defendant’s culpability in the criminal activity, and (C) the defendant qualifies for a mitigating role adjustment under §3B1.2 (Mitigating Role), a downward departure may be warranted. The court may depart to a sentence no lower than the guideline range that would have resulted if the defendant’s Chapter Two offense level had been offense level 36. <em>Provided</em>, that a defendant is not eligible for a downward departure under this provision if the defendant:</p>
<p>(a) has one or more prior felony convictions for a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense as defined in §4B1.2 (Definitions of Terms Used in Section 4B1.1);</p>
<p>(b) qualifies for an adjustment under §3B1.3 (Abuse of Position of Trust or Use of Special Skill);</p>
<p>(c) possessed or induced another participant to use or possess a firearm in the offense;</p>
<p>(d) had decision-making authority;</p>
<p>(e) owned the controlled substance or financed any part of the offense; or</p>
<p>(f) sold the controlled substance or played a substantial part in negotiating the terms of the sale.</p>
<p><em>Example</em>: A defendant, who the court finds meets the criteria for a downward departure under this provision, has a Chapter Two offense level of 40, a 2-level reduction for a minor role from §3B1.2, and a 3-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility from §3E1.1. His final offense level is 35. If the defendant’s Chapter Two offense level had been 36, the 2-level reduction for a minor role and 3-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility would have resulted in a final offense level of 31. Therefore, under this provision, a downward departure not to exceed 4 levels (from level 35 to level 31) would be authorized.&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> Where a defendant’s base offense level is greater than level 36 and the defendant had a minimal or minor role in the offense (and meets certain other qualifications), the quantity of the controlled substance for which the defendant is held accountable under §1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct) may overrepresent the defendant’s culpability in the criminal activity. To address this issue, this amendment adds an application note to §2D1.1 that authorizes a downward departure in the specific circumstances described and sets forth the extent of a departure authorized on this basis.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;In the case of LSD on a carrier medium (<em>e.g.</em>, a sheet of blotter paper), do not use the weight of the LSD/carrier medium. Instead, treat each dose of LSD on the carrier medium as equal to 0.4 mg of LSD for the purposes of the Drug Quantity Table.&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §2D1.1 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended in note 11 by deleting the first entry in the &quot;Typical Weight Per Unit Table&quot; as follows:</p>
<p>&quot;LSD (Lysergic acid diethylamide) 0.05 mg&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §2D1.1 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended by inserting the following additional note:</p>
<p>&quot;18. LSD on a blotter paper carrier medium typically is marked so that the number of doses (‘hits’) per sheet readily can be determined. When this is not the case, it is to be presumed that each 1/4 inch by 1/4 inch section of the blotter paper is equal to one dose.</p>
<p>In the case of liquid LSD (LSD that has not been placed onto a carrier medium), using the weight of the LSD alone to calculate the offense level may not adequately reflect the seriousness of the offense. In such a case, an upward departure may be warranted.&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §2D1.1 captioned &quot;Background&quot; is amended by inserting the following paragraphs at the end:</p>
<p>&quot;Because the weights of LSD carrier media vary widely and typically far exceed the weight of the controlled substance itself, the Commission has determined that basing offense levels on the entire weight of the LSD and carrier medium would produce unwarranted disparity among offenses involving the same quantity of actual LSD (but different carrier weights), as well as sentences disproportionate to those for other, more dangerous controlled substances, such as PCP. Consequently, in cases involving LSD contained in a carrier medium, the Commission has established a weight per dose of 0.4 milligram for purposes of determining the base offense level.</p>
<p>The dosage weight of LSD selected exceeds the Drug Enforcement Administration’s standard dosage unit for LSD of 0.05 milligram (<em>i.e.</em>, the quantity of actual LSD per dose) in order to assign some weight to the carrier medium. Because LSD typically is marketed and consumed orally on a carrier medium, the inclusion of some weight attributable to the carrier medium recognizes (A) that offense levels for most other controlled substances are based upon the weight of the mixture containing the controlled substance without regard to purity, and (B) the decision in <em>Chapman v. United States</em>, 111 S. Ct. 1919 (1991) (holding that the term ‘mixture or substance’ in 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1) includes the carrier medium in which LSD is absorbed). At the same time, the weight per dose selected is less than the weight per dose that would equate the offense level for LSD on a carrier medium with that for the same number of doses of PCP, a controlled substance that comparative assessments indicate is more likely to induce violent acts and ancillary crime than is LSD. (Treating LSD on a carrier medium as weighing 0.5 milligram per dose would produce offense levels equivalent to those for PCP.) Thus, the approach decided upon by the Commission will harmonize offense levels for LSD offenses with those for other controlled substances and avoid an undue influence of varied carrier weight on the applicable offense level. Nonetheless, this approach does not override the applicability of ‘mixture or substance’ for the purpose of applying any mandatory minimum sentence (<em>see</em> <em>Chapman</em>; §5G1.1(b)).&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> The Commission has found that the weights of LSD carrier media vary widely and typically far exceed the weight of the controlled substance itself (<em>e.g.</em>, LSD is typically placed on blotter paper which generally weighs from 5 to 10 milligrams per dose; the weight of the LSD itself per dose is generally from 0.02 to 0.08 milligram; the Drug Enforcement Administration describes a standard dose of LSD as containing 0.05 milligram of LSD). As a result, basing the offense level on the entire weight of the LSD and carrier medium produces unwarranted disparity among offenses involving the same quantity of actual LSD but different carrier weights, as well as sentences that are disproportionate to those for other, more dangerous controlled substances, such as PCP, heroin, and cocaine. Under the guidelines prior to the amendment, for example, 100 grams of heroin or 500 grams of cocaine (weights that correspond to several thousand doses, the number depending upon the purity) result in the same offense level as 125 doses of LSD on blotter paper (which has an average weight of 8 milligrams per dose) or 1 dose of LSD on a sugar cube (2000 milligrams per dose).</p>
<p>Consequently, in cases involving LSD contained in a carrier medium, this amendment establishes a weight per dose of 0.4 milligram to be used for purposes of determining the base offense level. The dosage weight of LSD selected by the Commission exceeds the Drug Enforcement Administration’s standard dosage unit for LSD of 0.05 milligram (<em>i.e.</em>, the quantity of actual LSD per dose) in order to assign some weight to the carrier medium. Because LSD typically is marketed and consumed orally on a carrier medium, the inclusion of some weight attributable to the carrier medium recognizes (A) that offense levels for most other controlled substances are based upon the weight of the mixture containing the controlled substance without regard to purity, and (B) the decision in <em>Chapman v. United States</em>, 111 S. Ct. 1919 (1991) (holding that the term &quot;mixture or substance&quot; in 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1) includes the carrier medium in which LSD is absorbed). At the same time, the weight per dose selected is less than the weight per dose that would equate the offense level for LSD on a carrier medium with that for the same number of doses of PCP, a controlled substance that comparative assessments indicate is more likely to induce violent acts and ancillary crime than is LSD. Treating LSD on a carrier medium as weighing 0.5 milligram per dose would produce offense levels equivalent to those for PCP (for example, 2000 doses of LSD at 0.5 milligram per dose equals 1 gram of LSD -- corresponding to the lower limit of offense level 26; similarly, 2000 doses of PCP at 5 milligrams per dose, the standard amount of actual PCP in a dose, equals 10 grams of actual PCP -- corresponding to the lower limit of offense level 26). Thus, the approach decided upon by the Commission will harmonize offense levels for LSD offenses with those for other controlled substances and avoid an undue influence of varied carrier weight on the applicable offense level. Nonetheless, this approach does not override the definition of mixture or substance for purposes of applying any mandatory minimum sentence (<em>see</em> <em>Chapman</em>; §5G1.1(b)).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;<em>Provided</em>, that where the maximum of the guideline range from Chapter Five, Part A (Sentencing Table) determined by an offense level adjusted under the procedure described in the preceding paragraph, plus the term of imprisonment required under 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) or § 929(a), is less than the maximum of the guideline range that would apply to the underlying offense absent such adjustment, the procedure described in the preceding paragraph does not apply. Instead, the guideline range applicable to the underlying offense absent such adjustment is to be used after subtracting the term of imprisonment imposed under 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) or § 929(a) from both the minimum and maximum of such range.</p>
<p><em>Example</em>: A defendant, is to be sentenced under the robbery guideline; his unadjusted offense level from §2B3.1 is 30, including a 7-level enhancement for discharging a firearm; no Chapter Three adjustments are applicable; and his criminal history category is Category IV. His unadjusted guideline range from Chapter Five, Part A (Sentencing Table) is 135-168 months. This defendant has also been convicted under 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) arising from the possession of a weapon during the robbery, and therefore must be sentenced to an additional consecutive five-year term of imprisonment. The defendant’s adjusted guideline range, which takes into account the conviction under 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) by eliminating the 7-level weapon enhancement, is 70-87 months. Because the maximum of the defendant’s adjusted guideline range plus the five year consecutive sentence (87 months + 60 months = 147 months) is less than the maximum of the defendant’s unadjusted guideline range (168 months), the defendant is to be sentenced using the unadjusted guideline range after subtracting the 60 month sentence to be imposed under 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) from both the minimum and maximum of the unadjusted range (<em>e.g.</em>, 135 months - 60 months = 75 months; 168 months - 60 months = 108 months). A sentence imposed for the underlying offense using the guideline range determined in this manner (75-108 months) when combined with the consecutive sentence imposed under 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) or § 929(a), will produce the appropriate total term of imprisonment.&quot;,</p>
<p>and inserting in lieu thereof:</p>
<p>&quot;In a few cases, the offense level for the underlying offense determined under the preceding paragraph may result in a guideline range that, when combined with the mandatory consecutive sentence under 18 U.S.C. § 844(h), § 924(c), or § 929(a), produces a total maximum penalty that is less than the maximum of the guideline range that would have resulted had there not been a count of conviction under 18 U.S.C. § 844(h), § 924(c), or § 929(a) (<em>i.e.</em>, the guideline range that would have resulted if the enhancements for possession, use, or discharge of a firearm had been applied). In such a case, an upward departure may be warranted so that the conviction under 18 U.S.C. § 844(h), § 924(c), or § 929(a) does not result in a decrease in the total punishment. An upward departure under this paragraph shall not exceed the maximum of the guideline range that would have resulted had there not been a count of conviction under 18 U.S.C. § 844(h), § 924(c), or § 929(a).&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This amendment simplifies the operation of §2K2.4 in order to reduce erroneous application by deleting the proviso in Application Note 2 and, in lieu thereof, authorizing an upward departure in the unusual case in which the combined sentence for an underlying offense and a firearms or explosives offense (under 18 U.S.C. § 844(h), §924(c), or § 929(a)) is less than the maximum of the guideline range that would have resulted if there had been no additional conviction for the firearms or explosives offense.</p>

<p>(B) If the offense involved improperly claiming a deduction or an exemption, the tax loss shall be treated as equal to 28% of the amount of the improperly claimed deduction or exemption (34% if the taxpayer is a corporation) plus 100% of any false credits claimed against tax, unless a more accurate determination of the tax loss can be made.</p>
<p>(C) If the offense involved improperly claiming a deduction to provide a basis for tax evasion in the future, the tax loss shall be treated as equal to 28% of the amount of the improperly claimed deduction (34% if the taxpayer is a corporation) plus 100% of any false credits claimed against tax, unless a more accurate determination of the tax loss can be made.</p>
<p>(2) If the offense involved failure to file a tax return, the tax loss is the amount of tax that the taxpayer owed and did not pay.</p>
<p><em>Note</em>: If the offense involved failure to file a tax return, the tax loss shall be treated as equal to 20% of the gross income (25% if the taxpayer is a corporation) less any tax withheld or otherwise paid, unless a more accurate determination of the tax loss can be made.</p>
<p>(3) If the offense involved willful failure to pay tax, the tax loss is the amount of tax that the taxpayer owed and did not pay.</p>
<p>(4) If the offense involved improperly claiming a refund to which the claimant was not entitled, the tax loss is the amount of the claimed refund to which the claimant was not entitled.</p>
<p>(5) The tax loss is not reduced by any payment of the tax subsequent to the commission of the offense.&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §2T1.1 captioned &quot;Statutory Provision&quot; is amended by deleting &quot;Provision: 26 U.S.C. § 7201&quot; and inserting in lieu thereof &quot;Provisions: 26 U.S.C. §§ 7201, 7203 (other than a violation based upon 26 U.S.C. § 6050I), 7206 (other than a violation based upon 26 U.S.C. § 6050I or § 7206(2)), and 7207&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §2T1.1 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended by deleting Notes 1 and 4 as follows:</p>
<p>&quot;1. False statements in furtherance of the evasion (<em>see</em> §§2T1.3, 2T1.5, and 2T1.8) are considered part of the offense for purposes of this guideline.&quot;,</p>
<p>&quot;4. The guideline refers to §2T1.3 to provide an alternative minimum standard for the tax loss, which is based on a percentage of the dollar amounts of certain misstatements made in returns filed by the taxpayer. This alternative standard may be easier to determine, and should make irrelevant the issue of whether the taxpayer was entitled to offsetting adjustments that he failed to claim.&quot;;</p>
<p>and by renumbering the remaining notes accordingly.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §2T1.1 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended in Note 1 (formerly Note 2) by deleting &quot;For purposes of the guideline, the tax loss is the amount of tax that the taxpayer evaded or attempted to evade&quot; and inserting in lieu thereof &quot;‘Tax loss’ is defined in subsection (c)&quot;; by deleting &quot;deficiency&quot; and inserting in lieu thereof &quot;figures&quot;; and by inserting the following additional paragraphs at the end:</p>
<p>&quot;Notes under subsections (c)(1) and (c)(2) address certain situations in income tax cases in which the tax loss may not be reasonably ascertainable. In these situations, the ‘presumptions’ set forth are to be used unless the government or defense provides sufficient information for a more accurate assessment of the tax loss. In cases involving other types of taxes, the presumptions in the notes under subsections (c)(1) and (c)(2) do not apply.</p>
<p><em>Example 1</em>: A defendant files a tax return reporting income of $40,000 when his income was actually $90,000. Under Note (A) to subsection (c)(1), the tax loss is treated as $14,000 ($90,000 of actual gross income minus $40,000 of reported gross income = $50,000 x 28%) unless sufficient information is available to make a more accurate assessment of the tax loss.</p>
<p><em>Example 2</em>: A defendant files a tax return reporting income of $60,000 when his income was actually $130,000. In addition, the defendant claims $10,000 in false tax credits. Under Note (A) to subsection (c)(1), the tax loss is treated as $29,600 ($130,000 of actual gross income minus $60,000 of reported gross income = $70,000 x 28% = $19,600, plus $10,000 of false tax credits) unless sufficient information is available to make a more accurate assessment of the tax loss.</p>
<p><em>Example 3</em>: A defendant fails to file a tax return for a year in which his salary was $24,000, and $2,600 in income tax was withheld by his employer. Under the note to subsection (c)(2), the tax loss is treated as $2,200 ($24,000 of gross income x 20% = $4,800, minus $2,600 of tax withheld) unless sufficient information is available to make a more accurate assessment of the tax loss.</p>
<p>In determining the tax loss attributable to the offense, the court should use as many methods set forth in subsection (c) and this commentary as are necessary given the circumstances of the particular case. If none of the methods of determining the tax loss set forth fit the circumstances of the particular case, the court should use any method of determining the tax loss that appears appropriate to reasonably calculate the loss that would have resulted had the offense been successfully completed.&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §2T1.1 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended in Note 3 (formerly Note 5) by deleting &quot;or local&quot; and inserting in lieu thereof &quot;local, or foreign&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §2T1.1 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended in Note 4 (formerly Note 6) by deleting &quot;§2T1.1(b)(2)&quot; and inserting in lieu thereof &quot;subsection (b)(2)&quot;; by inserting a comma immediately following &quot;applied&quot;; and by inserting &quot;or fictitious entities&quot; immediately following &quot;shells&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §2T1.1 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended by inserting the following additional notes:</p>
<p>&quot;5. A ‘credit claimed against tax’ is an item that reduces the amount of tax directly. In contrast, a ‘deduction’ is an item that reduces the amount of taxable income.</p>
<p>6. ‘Gross income,’ for the purposes of this section, has the same meaning as it has in 26 U.S.C. § 61 and 26 C.F.R. § 1.61.</p>
<p>7. If the offense involves both individual and corporate tax returns, the tax loss is the aggregate tax loss from the offenses taken together.&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §2T1.1 captioned &quot;Background&quot; is amended by deleting:</p>
<p>&quot; This guideline relies most heavily on the amount of tax evaded because the chief interest protected by the statute is the collection of taxes. A greater evasion is obviously more harmful to the treasury, and more serious than a smaller one with otherwise similar characteristics. Furthermore, as the potential benefit from tax evasion increases, the sanction necessary to deter also increases.</p>
<p>The overlapping imprisonment ranges in the Sentencing Table are intended to minimize the significance of disputes. The consequence of an inexact estimate of the tax loss is never severe, even when the tax loss is near the boundary of a range. For example, although the difference between $39,999 and $40,001 results in a change from level 10 to level 11, any sentence of eight to twelve months would be within the guidelines regardless of the offense level determination made by the court. Indeed, any sentence between ten and twelve months would be within the guidelines for a tax loss ranging from $20,000 to $150,000. As a consequence, for all dollar amounts, the Sentencing Table affords the court consider­able latitude in evaluating other factors, even when the amount of the tax loss is uncer­tain.</p>
<p>Under pre-guidelines practice, roughly half of all tax evaders were sentenced to probation without imprison­ment, while the other half received sentences that required them to serve an average prison term of twelve months. This guideline is intended to reduce disparity in sentencing for tax evasion and to somewhat increase average sentence length. As a result, the number of purely probationary sentences will be reduced. The Commission believes that any additional costs of imprison­ment that may be incurred as a result of the increase in the average term of imprisonment for tax evasion are inconsequen­tial in relation to the potential increase in revenue. According to estimates current at the time this guideline was originally developed (1987), income taxes are underpaid by approximately $90 billion annually.</p>
<p>Although under pre-guidelines practice some large-scale evaders served as much as five years in prison, the average sentence length for defendants sentenced to a term of imprisonment did not increase rapidly with the amount of tax evaded. Thus, the average time served by those sen­tenced to a term of impris­onment for evading less than $10,000 in taxes was about nine months, while the corresponding figure for those evading over $100,000 in taxes was about sixteen months. Guideline sentences should result in small increases in the average length of imprison­ment for most tax cases that involve less than $100,000 in tax evaded. The increase is expected to be somewhat larger for cases involving more taxes.</p>
<p>Failure to report criminally derived income is included as a factor for deterrence purposes. Criminally derived income is generally difficult to establish, so that the tax loss in such cases will tend to be substantially understated. An enhancement for offenders who violate the tax laws as part of a pattern of criminal activity from which they derive a substantial portion of their income also serves to implement the mandate of 28 U.S.C. § 994(i)(2). Estimates from pre-guidelines practice were that, on average, the presence of this factor increased time served by the equivalent of 2 levels.</p>
<p>Although tax evasion always involves some planning, unusually sophisticated efforts to conceal the evasion decrease the likelihood of detection and therefore warrant an additional sanction for deterrence purposes. Analyses of pre-guidelines data for other frauds and property crimes showed that careful planning or sophistication generally resulted in an average increase of at least 2 levels.&quot;,</p>
<p>and inserting in lieu thereof:</p>

Tax offenses, in and of themselves, are serious offenses; however, a greater tax loss is obviously more harmful to the treasury and more serious than a smaller one with otherwise similar characteristics.

<p>Sections 2T1.2 and 2T1.3 are deleted in their entirety as follows:</p>
<p>&quot;§2T1.2. <em>Willful Failure To File Return, Supply Information, or Pay Tax</em></p>
<p>(a) Base Offense Level:</p>
<p>(1) 1 level less than the level from §2T4.1 (Tax Table) corresponding to the tax loss; or</p>
<p>(2) 5, if there is no tax loss.</p>
<p>For purposes of this guideline, ‘tax loss’ means the total amount of tax that the taxpayer owed and did not pay, but, in the event of a failure to file in any year, not less than 10 percent of the amount by which the taxpayer’s gross income for that year exceeded $20,000.</p>
<p>(b) Specific Offense Characteristics</p>
<p>(1) If the defendant failed to report or to correctly identify the source of income exceeding $10,000 in any year from criminal activity, increase by 2 levels. If the resulting offense level is less than level 12, increase to level 12.</p>
<p>(2) If sophis­ticated means were used to impede discovery of the nature or extent of the offense, increase by 2 levels.</p>
<p>(c) Cross Reference</p>
<p>(1) If the defendant is convicted of a willful violation of 26 U.S.C. § 6050I, apply §2S1.3 (Failure to Report Monetary Transactions) in lieu of this guideline.</p>

<p><em>Commentary</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Statutory Provision</em>: 26 U.S.C. § 7203 (other than a willful violation of 26 U.S.C. § 6050I).</p>
<p><em>Application Notes</em>:</p>
<p>1. ‘Criminal activity’ means any conduct constituting a criminal offense under federal, state, or local law.</p>
<p>2. ‘Sophisticated means,’ as used in §2T1.2(b)(2), includes conduct that is more complex or demonstrates greater intricacy or planning than a routine tax-evasion case. An enhancement would be applied, for example, where the defendant used offshore bank accounts or transactions through corporate shells.</p>
<p>3. In determining the total tax loss attributable to the offense (<em>see</em> §1B1.3(a)(2)), all conduct violating the tax laws should be considered as part of the same course of conduct or common scheme or plan unless the evidence demonstrates that the conduct is clearly unrelated. <em>See</em> Application Note 3 of the Commentary to §2T1.1.</p>
<p><em>Background</em>: Violations of 26 U.S.C. § 7203 are usually serious misdemeanors that are similar to tax evasion, except that there need be no affirmative act in support of the offense. They are rarely prosecuted unless the defendant also owed taxes that he failed to pay.</p>
<p>Because the conduct generally is tantamount to tax evasion, the guideline is similar to §2T1.1. Because the offense is a misde­meanor, the offense level has been set at one below the level corresponding to evasion of the same amount of taxes.</p>
<p>An alternative measure of the tax loss, 10 percent of gross income in excess of $20,000, has been provided because of the potential difficulty of determining the amount of tax the taxpayer owed. It is expected that this alternative measure generally will understate the amount of tax owed.</p>
<p>The intended impact of this guideline is to increase the average time served for this offense, and to increase significantly the number of violators who receive a term of imprisonment. Under pre-guidelines practice, the average time served for this offense was approximately 2.5 months, including those who were not sentenced to prison. Considering only those who did serve a term of imprisonment, the average term was about six to seven months.</p>
<p>§2T1.3. <em>Fraud and False Statements Under Penalty of Perjury</em></p>
<p>(a) Base Offense Level:</p>
<p>(1) Level from §2T4.1 (Tax Table) corresponding to the tax loss, if the offense was committed in order to facilitate evasion of a tax; or</p>
<p>(2) 6, otherwise.</p>
<p>For purposes of this guideline, the ‘tax loss’ is 28 percent of the amount by which the greater of gross income and taxable income was under­stated, plus 100 percent of the total amount of any false credits claimed against tax. If the taxpayer is a corporation, use 34 percent in lieu of 28 percent.</p>
<p>(b) Specific Offense Characteristics</p>
<p>(1) If the defendant failed to report or to correctly identify the source of income exceeding $10,000 in any year from criminal activity, increase by 2 levels. If the resulting offense level is less than level 12, increase to level 12.</p>
<p>(2) If sophis­ticated means were used to impede discovery of the nature or extent of the offense, increase by 2 levels.</p>

<p><em>Statutory Provision</em>: 26 U.S.C. § 7206, except § 7206(2). For additional statutory provision(s), <em>see</em> Appendix A (Statutory Index).</p>
<p><em>Application Notes</em>:</p>
<p>1. ‘Criminal activity’ means any conduct constituting a criminal offense under federal, state, or local law.</p>
<p>2. ‘Sophisticated means,’ as used in §2T1.3(b)(2), includes conduct that is more complex or demonstrates greater intricacy or planning than a routine tax-evasion case. An enhancement would be applied, for example, where the defendant used offshore bank accounts or transactions through corporate shells.</p>
<p>3. In determining the total tax loss attributable to the offense (<em>see</em> §1B1.3(a)(2)), all conduct violating the tax laws should be considered as part of the same course of conduct or common scheme or plan unless the evidence demonstrates that the conduct is clearly unrelated. <em>See</em> Application Note 3 of the Commentary to §2T1.1.</p>
<p>4. The amount by which the greater of gross income and taxable income was understated, plus 100 percent of the total amount of any false credits claimed against tax is calculated as follows: (1) determine the amount, if any, by which the gross income was understated; (2) determine the amount, if any, by which the taxable income was understated; and (3) determine the amount of any false credit(s) claimed (a tax ‘credit’ is an item that reduces the amount of tax directly; in contrast, a ‘deduction’ is an item that reduces the amount of taxable income). Use the amount determined under step (1) or (2), whichever is greater, plus any amount determined under step (3).</p>
<p><em>Background</em>: This guideline covers conduct that usually is analogous to tax evasion, although the elements differ. Accordingly, the offense is treated much like tax evasion.</p>
<p>Existence of a tax loss is not an element of these offenses. Furthermore, in instances where the defendant is setting the groundwork for evasion of a tax that is expected to become due in the future, he may make false statements that underreport income that as of the time of conviction may not yet have resulted in a tax loss. In order to gauge the seriousness of these offenses, the guidelines establish a rule for determining a ‘tax loss’ based on the nature and magnitude of the false statements made. Use of this approach also avoids complex problems of proof and invasion of privacy when returns of persons other than the defendant and co-defendants are involved.&quot;.</p>
<p>Section 2T1.4(a)(1) is amended by deleting &quot;resulting tax loss, if any&quot; and inserting in lieu thereof &quot;tax loss&quot;.</p>
<p>Section 2T1.4(a)(2) is amended by deleting &quot;otherwise&quot; and inserting in lieu thereof &quot;if there is no tax loss&quot;.</p>
<p>Section 2T1.4(a) is amended by deleting &quot;§2T1.3&quot; and inserting in lieu thereof &quot;§2T1.1&quot;.</p>

<p>Section 2T1.4(b)(2) is amended by deleting &quot;nature&quot; and inserting in lieu thereof &quot;existence&quot;.</p>
<p>Section 2T1.4(b) is amended by deleting:</p>
<p>&quot;(3) If the defendant was in the business of preparing or assisting in the preparation of tax returns, increase by 2 levels.&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §2T1.4 captioned &quot;Statutory Provision&quot; is amended by inserting &quot;(other than a violation based upon 26 U.S.C. § 6050I)&quot; immediately following &quot;§ 7206(2)&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §2T1.4 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended by deleting Notes 1, 3, and 4 as follows:</p>
<p>&quot;1. Subsection (b)(1) applies to persons who derive a substantial portion of their income through the promotion of tax fraud or tax evasion, <em>e.g.</em>, through promoting fraudulent tax shelters.&quot;,</p>
<p>&quot;3. Subsection (b)(3) applies to persons who regularly act as tax preparers or advisers for profit. Do not employ §3B1.3 (Abuse of Position of Trust or Use of Special Skill) if this adjustment applies. Subsection (b)(1) may also apply to such persons.</p>
<p>4. In certain instances, such as promotion of a tax shelter scheme, the defendant may advise other persons to violate their tax obligations through filing returns that find no support in the tax laws. If this type of conduct can be shown to have resul­ted in the filing of false returns (regardless of whether the princi­pals were aware of their falsity), the misstatements in all such returns will contribute to one aggregate ‘tax loss.’&quot;;</p>
<p>by renumbering Note 2 as Note 3; and by inserting the following as Notes 1 and 2:</p>
<p>&quot;1. For the general principles underlying the determination of tax loss, <em>see</em> §2T1.1(c) and Application Note 1 of the Commentary to §2T1.1 (Tax Evasion; Willful Failure to File Return, Supply Information, or Pay Tax; Fraudulent or False Returns, Statements, or Other Documents). In certain instances, such as promotion of a tax shelter scheme, the defendant may advise other persons to violate their tax obligations through filing returns that find no support in the tax laws. If this type of conduct can be shown to have resul­ted in the filing of false returns (regardless of whether the princi­pals were aware of their falsity), the misstatements in all such returns will contribute to one aggregate ‘tax loss.’</p>
<p>2. Subsection (b)(1) has two prongs. The first prong applies to persons who derive a substantial portion of their income through the promotion of tax schemes, <em>e.g.</em>, through promoting fraudulent tax shelters. The second prong applies to persons who regularly prepare or assist in the preparation of tax returns for profit. If an enhancement from this subsection applies, do not apply §3B1.3 (Abuse of Position of Trust or Use of Special Skill).&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §2T1.4 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended in Note 3 (formerly Note 2) by inserting &quot;or fictitious entities&quot; immediately following &quot;corporate shells&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §2T1.4 captioned &quot;Background&quot; is amended by deleting &quot;tax preparers and advisers&quot; and inserting in lieu thereof &quot;those in the business of preparing or assisting in the preparation of tax returns and those who make a business of promoting tax fraud&quot;; and by deleting &quot;§2T1.3&quot; and inserting in lieu thereof &quot;§2T1.1&quot;.</p>

<p><em>Commentary</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Statutory Provision</em>: 26 U.S.C. § 7207.</p>
<p><em>Background</em>: The offense is a misde­meanor. It is to be distinguished from 26 U.S.C. § 7206(1) (§2T1.3), which is a felony involving a false statement under penalty of perjury. The offense level has been set at 6 in order to give the sentencing judge considerable latitude because the conduct could be similar to tax evasion.&quot;.</p>

<p>The Commentary to §2T1.9 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended by inserting the following additional note:</p>
<p>&quot;4. Subsection (b)(2) provides an enhancement where the conduct was intended to encourage persons, other than the participants directly involved in the offense, to violate the tax laws (<em>e.g.</em>, an offense involving a ‘tax protest’ group that encourages persons to violate the tax laws, or an offense involving the marketing of fraudulent tax shelters or schemes).&quot;.</p>

<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This amendment consolidates §§2T1.1, 2T1.2, 2T1.3, and 2T1.5, thereby eliminating the confusion that has arisen in some cases regarding which guideline applies. In addition, by adopting a uniform definition of tax loss, this amendment eliminates the anomaly of using actual tax loss in some cases and an amount that differs from actual tax loss in others.

{id: 492, content:"<p><strong>492.</strong> <strong>Amendment:</strong> The Commentary to §3B1.3 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended by deleting Note 1 as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;1. The position of trust must have contributed in some substantial way to facilitating the crime and not merely have provided an opportunity that could as easily have been afforded to other persons. This adjustment, for example, would not apply to an embezzlement by an ordinary bank teller.&quot;,</p>
<p>and inserting in lieu thereof:</p>
<p>&quot;1. ‘Public or private trust’ refers to a position of public or private trust characterized by professional or managerial discretion (<em>i.e.</em>, substantial discretionary judgment that is ordinarily given considerable deference). Persons holding such positions ordinarily are subject to significantly less supervision than employees whose responsibilities are primarily non-discretionary in nature. For this enhancement to apply, the position of trust must have contributed in some significant way to facilitating the commission or concealment of the offense (<em>e.g.</em>, by making the detection of the offense or the defendant’s responsibility for the offense more difficult). This adjustment, for example, would apply in the case of an embezzlement of a client’s funds by an attorney serving as a guardian, a bank executive’s fraudulent loan scheme, or the criminal sexual abuse of a patient by a physician under the guise of an examination. This adjustment would not apply in the case of an embezzlement or theft by an ordinary bank teller or hotel clerk because such positions are not characterized by the above-described factors.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the preceding paragraph, because of the special nature of the United States mail an adjustment for an abuse of a position of trust will apply to any employee of the U.S. Postal Service who engages in the theft or destruction of undelivered United States mail.&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This amendment reformulates the definition of an abuse of position of trust to better distinguish cases warranting this enhancement.</p>

{id: 493, content:"<p><strong>493.</strong> <strong>Amendment:</strong> The Commentary to §4A1.2 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended in Note 1 by inserting the following additional sentence at the end of the first paragraph:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Conduct that is part of the instant offense means conduct that is relevant conduct to the instant offense under the provisions of §1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct).&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §4A1.2 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended in Note 6 in the first sentence of the first paragraph by inserting &quot;(A)&quot; immediately before &quot;have been reversed&quot;; by deleting the comma following &quot;law&quot;; and by inserting &quot;or (B) have been ruled constitutionally invalid in a prior case&quot; immediately before &quot;are not to be counted&quot;;</p>
<p>The Commentary to §4A1.2 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended in Note 6 by deleting the second sentence as follows:</p>
<p>&quot;Also, sentences resulting from convictions that a defendant shows to have been previously ruled constitutionally invalid are not to be counted.&quot;,</p>
<p>and inserting in lieu thereof:</p>
<p>&quot;With respect to the current sentencing proceeding, this guideline and commentary do not confer upon the defendant any right to attack collaterally a prior conviction or sentence beyond any such rights otherwise recognized in law (<em>e.g.</em>, 21 U.S.C. § 851 expressly provides that a defendant may collaterally attack certain prior convictions).&quot;;</p>
<p>and by beginning a new paragraph with the third sentence.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §4A1.2 captioned &quot;Background&quot; is amended by deleting the second paragraph as follows:</p>
<p>&quot;The Commission leaves for court determination the issue of whether a defendant may collaterally attack at sentencing a prior conviction.&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This amendment expressly provides that the term &quot;part of the instant offense&quot; in §4A1.2(a)(1) means relevant conduct as defined in §1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct) to avoid double counting and ensure consistency with other guideline provisions.</p>
<p>This amendment also clarifies the Commission’s intent with respect to whether §4A1.2 confers on defendants a right to attack prior convictions collaterally at sentencing, an issue on which the appellate courts have differed. <em>Compare</em>, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>United States v. Canales</em>, 960 F.2d 1311, 1316 (5th Cir. 1992) (Section 4A1.2 commentary indicates Commission intended to grant sentencing courts discretion to entertain initial defendant challenges to prior convictions); <em>United States v. Jacobetz</em>, 955 F.2d 786, 805 (2d Cir.) (similar), <em>cert</em>. <em>denied</em>, 113 S. Ct. 104 (1992); <em>United States v. Cornog</em>, 945 F.2d 1504, 1511 (11th Cir. 1991) (similar) <em>with</em> <em>United States v. Hewitt</em>, 942 F.2d 1270, 1276 (8th Cir. 1991) (commentary indicates defendants may only challenge use of prior convictions at sentencing by showing such conviction previously ruled invalid). This amendment addresses this inter-circuit conflict in interpreting the commentary by stating more clearly that the Commission does not intend to enlarge a defendant’s right to attack collaterally a prior conviction at the current sentencing proceeding beyond any right otherwise recognized in law.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Commentary to §5G1.3 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended by inserting the following additional note:</p>
<p>&quot;4. If the defendant was on federal or state probation, parole, or supervised release at the time of the instant offense, and has had such probation, parole, or supervised release revoked, the sentence for the instant offense should be imposed to be served consecutively to the term imposed for the violation of probation, parole, or supervised release in order to provide an incremental penalty for the violation of probation, parole, or supervised release (in accord with the policy expressed in §§7B1.3 and 7B1.4).&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This amendment adds an application note to §5G1.3 to provide guidance in the case of a defendant who was on federal or state probation, parole, or supervised release at the time of the instant federal offense and has had such term of supervision revoked prior to sentencing on the instant federal offense. In addition, this amendment corrects a mathematical error in an example.</p>

<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This amendment adds commentary to §6B1.2 recommending that the prosecuting attorney disclose to the defendant the facts and circumstances of the offense and offender characteristics then known to the prosecuting attorney that are relevant to the application of the guidelines in order to encourage plea negotiations that realistically reflect probable outcomes.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;A defendant’s relevant conduct does not include the conduct of members of a conspiracy prior to the defendant joining the conspiracy, even if the defendant knows of that conduct (<em>e.g.</em>, in the case of a defendant who joins an ongoing drug distribution conspiracy knowing that it had been selling two kilograms of cocaine per week, the cocaine sold prior to the defendant joining the conspiracy is not included as relevant conduct in determining the defendant’s offense level). The Commission does not foreclose the possibility that there may be some unusual set of circumstances in which the exclusion of such conduct may not adequately reflect the defendant’s culpability; in such a case, an upward departure may be warranted.&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §1B1.3 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended in Note 9(B) by deleting &quot;and the time interval between the offenses&quot; and inserting in lieu thereof:</p>
<p>&quot;, the regularity (repetitions) of the offenses, and the time interval between the offenses. When one of the above factors is absent, a stronger presence of at least one of the other factors is required. For example, where the conduct alleged to be relevant is relatively remote to the offense of conviction, a stronger showing of similarity or regularity is necessary to compensate for the absence of temporal proximity&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This amendment clarifies the operation of §1B1.3 with respect to the defendant’s accountability for the actions of other conspirators prior to the defendant joining the conspiracy. The amendment is in accord with the rule stated in recent caselaw. <em>See</em>, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>United States v. Carreon</em>, 11 F.3d 1225 (5th Cir. 1994); <em>United States v.

In addition, this amendment adds a well-phrased formulation, developed by the Ninth Circuit in <em>United States v. Hahn</em>, 960 F.2d 903 (9th Cir. 1992), addressing the circumstances in which multiple acts constitute the &quot;same course of conduct.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This amendment simplifies the operation of §1B1.10 by providing that, in determining an amended guideline range, the court will use only those amendments expressly designated as retroactive. In addition, this amendment deletes §1B1.10(c), a rather complex subsection, as an unnecessary restriction on the court’s consideration of a revised sentence, redesignates §1B1.10(d) as §1B1.10(c), and makes a number of minor clarifying revisions.

<p>&quot;19. In an extraordinary case, an upward departure above offense level 38 on the basis of drug quantity may be warranted. For example, an upward departure may be warranted where the quantity is at least ten times the minimum quantity required for level 38.&quot;.</p>

<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This amendment sets the upper limit of the Drug Quantity Table in §2D1.1 at level 38. The Commission has determined that the extension of the Drug Quantity Table above level 38 for quantity itself is not required to ensure adequate punishment given that organizers, leaders, managers, and supervisors of such offenses will receive a 4-, 3-, or 2-level enhancement for their role in the offense, and any participant will receive an additional 2-level enhancement if a dangerous weapon is possessed in the offense. The Commission, however, has not foreclosed the possibility of an upward departure above offense level 38 on the basis of drug quantity in an extraordinary case. In addition, this amendment corrects a typographical error in a statutory reference.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;‘Offense Statutory Maximum’ refers to the maximum term of imprisonment authorized for the offense of conviction that is a crime of violence or controlled substance offense.&quot;,</p>
<p>and inserting in lieu thereof:</p>
<p>&quot;‘Offense Statutory Maximum,’ for the purposes of this guideline, refers to the maximum term of imprisonment authorized for the offense of conviction that is a crime of violence or controlled substance offense, not including any increase in that maximum term under a sentencing enhancement provision that applies because of the defendant’s prior criminal record (such sentencing enhancement provisions are contained, for example, in 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(A), (b)(1)(B), (b)(1)(C), and (b)(1)(D)). For example, where the statutory maximum term of imprisonment under 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(C) is increased from twenty years to thirty years because the defendant has one or more qualifying prior drug convictions, the ‘Offense Statutory Maximum’ for the purposes of this guideline is twenty years and not thirty years.&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This amendment defines the term &quot;offense statutory maximum&quot; in §4B1.1 to mean the statutory maximum prior to any enhancement based on prior criminal record (<em>i.e.</em>, an enhancement of the statutory maximum sentence that itself was based upon the defendant’s prior criminal record will not be used in determining the alternative offense level under this guideline). This rule avoids unwarranted double counting as well as unwarranted disparity associated with variations in the exercise of prosecutorial discretion in seeking enhanced penalties based on prior convictions. It is noted that when the instruction to the Commission that underlies §4B1.1 (28 U.S.C. § 994(h)) was enacted by the Congress in 1984, the enhanced maximum sentences provided for recidivist drug offenders (<em>e.g.</em>, under 21 U.S.C. § 841) did not exist.</p>

<p>&quot;Note, however, that even in the case of a consecutive term of imprisonment imposed under subsection (a), any term of supervised release imposed is to run concurrently with any other term of supervised release imposed. <em>See</em> 18 U.S.C. § 3624(e).&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This amendment revises the Commentary to §5G1.2 to clarify that the Commission’s interpretation is that 18 U.S.C. § 3624(e) requires multiple terms of supervised release to run concurrently in all cases. This interpretation is in accord with the view stated in <em>United States v. Gullickson</em>, 982 F.2d 1231, 1236 (8th Cir. 1993). In contrast, two courts of appeals have cited the current commentary as supporting the view that, notwithstanding the language in 18 U.S.C. § 3624(e) stating that terms of supervised release run concurrently, a court may order that supervised release terms run consecutively under certain circumstances. <em>See</em> <em>United States v. Shorthouse</em>, 7 F.3d 149 (9th Cir. 1993); <em>United States v. Maxwell</em>, 966 F.2d 545, 551 (10th Cir. 1992).</p>

<p>&quot;An offender characteristic or other circumstance that is not ordinarily relevant in determining whether a sentence should be outside the applicable guideline range may be relevant to this determination if such characteristic or circumstance is present to an unusual degree and distinguishes the case from the ‘heartland’ cases covered by the guidelines in a way that is important to the statutory purposes of sentencing.&quot;.</p>
<p>Section 5K2.0 is amended by inserting the following commentary at the end:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&quot;<em>Commentary</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The last paragraph of this policy statement sets forth the conditions under which an offender characteristic or other circumstance that is not ordinarily relevant to a departure from the applicable guideline range may be relevant to this determination. The Commission does not foreclose the possibility of an extraordinary case that, because of a combination of such characteristics or circumstances, differs significantly from the ‘heartland’ cases covered by the guidelines in a way that is important to the statutory purposes of sentencing, even though none of the characteristics or circumstances individually distinguishes the case. However, the Commission believes that such cases will be extremely rare.</p>
<p>In the absence of a characteristic or circumstance that distinguishes a case as sufficiently atypical to warrant a sentence different from that called for under the guidelines, a sentence outside the guideline range is not authorized. <em>See</em> 18 U.S.C. § 3553(b). For example, dissatisfaction with the available sentencing range or a preference for a different sentence than that authorized by the guidelines is not an appropriate basis for a sentence outside the applicable guideline range.&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This amendment revises §5K2.0 and the Introductory Commentary to Chapter Five, Part H to provide guidance as to when an offender characteristic or other circumstance (or combination of such characteristics or circumstances) that is not ordinarily relevant to a determination of whether a sentence should be outside the applicable guideline range may be relevant to this determination.</p>

<p>&quot;5. If the defendant’s criminal history includes a prior sentence for conduct that is similar to the instant offense, an upward departure may be warranted.&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> Section 40111 of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 doubles the authorized maximum term of imprisonment for defendants convicted of sexual abuse offenses who have been convicted previously of aggravated sexual abuse, sexual abuse, or aggravated sexual contact (18 U.S.C. § 2247) and directs the Sentencing Commission to implement this provision by promulgating amendments, if appropriate, to the applicable sentencing guidelines. Although the Chapter Two sexual abuse guidelines do not provide for enhancement for repeat sex offenses, Chapter Four (Criminal History and Criminal Livelihood) does include a determination of the seriousness of the defendant’s criminal record based upon prior convictions (§4A1.1). Section 4B1.1 (Career Offender) also provides substantially enhanced penalties for offenders who engage in a crime of violence (including forcible sexual offenses) or controlled substance trafficking offense, having been sentenced previously on two or more occasions for offenses of either type. Moreover, §4A1.3 (Adequacy of Criminal History category) provides that an upward departure may be considered &quot;[i]f reliable information indicates that the criminal history category does not reflect the seriousness of the defendant’s past criminal conduct or the likelihood that the defendant will commit other crimes.&quot; This amendment strengthens the sexual offense guidelines by expressly listing as a basis for upward departure the fact that the defendant has a prior sentence for conduct similar to the instant sexual offense.</p>
<p>Section 40112 of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 directs the Commission to conduct a study and consider the adequacy of the guidelines for sexual offenses with respect to a number of factors. The provision also requires the preparation of a report to Congress analyzing federal rape sentences and obtaining comment from independent experts. <em>See</em> Report to Congress: Analysis of Penalties for Federal Rape Cases (March 13, 1995). The Commission found that, in general, the current guidelines provide appropriate penalties for these offenses. This amendment strengthens §2A3.1 (Criminal Sexual Abuse; Attempt to Commit Criminal Sexual Abuse) in one respect by expressly listing as a basis for an upward departure the fact that a victim was sexually abused by more than one participant.</p>

<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> Section 80001(b) of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 directs the Commission to promulgate guidelines and policy statements to implement section 80001(a) (providing an exception to otherwise applicable statutory minimum sentences for certain defendants convicted of specified drug offenses). Pursuant to this provision, the Commission promulgated §5C1.2 (Limitation on Applicability of Statutory Minimum Sentences in Certain Cases) as an emergency amendment, effective September 23, 1994. Under the terms of the congressionally-granted authority, this amendment is temporary unless repromulgated in the next amendment cycle under regularly applicable amendment procedures. <em>See</em> Pub. L. No. 100-182, § 21, set forth as an editorial note under 28 U.S.C. § 994. This amendment repromulgates §5C1.2, as set forth in the 1994 edition of the <em>Guidelines Manual</em>, with minor editorial changes.</p>
<p>In addition, this amendment adds a new subsection to §2D1.1 to implement this provision by providing a two-level decrease in offense level for cases meeting the criteria set forth in §5C1.2(1)-(5).</p>

{id: 516, content:"<p><strong>516.</strong> <strong>Amendment:</strong> Section 2D1.1(c) is amended in the fifth note immediately following the Drug Quantity Table by deleting the first sentence as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;In the case of an offense involving marihuana plants, if the offense involved (A) 50 or more marihuana plants, treat each plant as equivalent to 1 KG of marihuana; (B) fewer than 50 marihuana plants, treat each plant as equivalent to 100 G of marihuana.&quot;,</p>
<p>and by inserting in lieu thereof:</p>
<p>&quot;In the case of an offense involving marihuana plants, treat each plant, regardless of sex, as equivalent to 100 G of marihuana.&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §2D1.1 captioned &quot;Background&quot; is amended in the fourth paragraph by deleting the first three sentences as follows:</p>
<p>&quot;In cases involving fifty or more marihuana plants, an equivalency of one plant to one kilogram of marihuana is derived from the statutory penalty provisions of 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(A), (B), and (D). In cases involving fewer than fifty plants, the statute is silent as to the equivalency. For cases involving fewer than fifty plants, the Commission has adopted an equivalency of 100 grams per plant, or the actual weight of the usable marihuana, whichever is greater.&quot;,</p>
<p>and by inserting in lieu thereof:</p>
<p>&quot; For marihuana plants, the Commission has adopted an equivalency of 100 grams per plant, or the actual weight of the usable marihuana, whichever is greater.&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> For offenses involving 50 or more marihuana plants, the existing §2D1.1 (Unlawful Manufacturing, Importing, Exporting, or Trafficking; Attempt or Conspiracy) uses an equivalency of one plant = one kilogram of marihuana, reflecting the quantities associated with the five- and ten-year mandatory minimum penalties in 21 U.S.C. § 841. For offenses involving fewer than 50 marihuana plants, the guidelines use an equivalency of one plant = 100 grams of marihuana, unless the weight of the actual marihuana is greater. In actuality, a marihuana plant does not produce a yield of one kilogram of marihuana. The one plant = 100 grams of marihuana equivalency used by the Commission for offenses involving fewer than 50 marihuana plants was selected as a reasonable approximation of the actual average yield of marihuana plants taking into account (1) studies reporting the actual yield of marihuana plants (37.5 to 412 grams depending on growing conditions); (2) that all plants regardless of size are counted for guideline purposes while, in actuality, not all plants will produce useable marihuana (<em>e.g.</em>, some plants may die of disease before maturity, and when plants are grown outdoors some plants may be consumed by animals); and (3) that male plants, which are counted for guideline purposes, are frequently culled because they do not produce the same quality of marihuana as do female plants. To enhance fairness and consistency, this amendment adopts the equivalency of 100 grams per marihuana plant for all guideline determinations.</p>

<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This amendment modifies §2D1.1 (Unlawful Manufacturing, Importing, Exporting, or Trafficking; Attempt or Conspiracy) with respect to the determination of the offense levels for Schedule I and II Depressants and Schedule III, IV, and V controlled substances by applying the Drug Quantity Table according to the number of pills, capsules, or tablets rather than by the gross weight of the pills, capsules, or tablets. Schedule I and II Depressants and Schedule III, IV, and V substances are almost always in pill, capsule, or tablet form. The current guidelines use the total weight of the pill, capsule, or tablet containing the controlled substance. This method leads to anomalies because the weight of most pills is determined primarily by the filler rather than the controlled substance. Thus, heavy pills lead to higher offense levels even though there is little or no relationship between gross weight and the potency of the pill. Applying the Drug Quantity Table according to the number of pills will both simplify guideline application and more fairly assess the scale and seriousness of the offense.</p>

<p>&quot;Hashish, for the purposes of this guideline, means a resinous substance of cannabis that includes (i) one or more of the tetrahydrocannabinols (as listed in 21 C.F.R. § 1308.11(d)(25)), (ii) at least two of the following: cannabinol, cannabidiol, or cannabichromene, and (iii) fragments of plant material (such as cystolith fibers).</p>
<p>Hashish oil, for the purposes of this guideline, means a preparation of the soluble cannabinoids derived from cannabis that includes (i) one or more of the tetrahydrocannabinols (as listed in 21 C.F.R. § 1308.11(d)(25)), (ii) at least two of the following: cannabinol, cannabidiol, or cannabichromene, and (iii) is essentially free of plant material (<em>e.g.</em>, plant fragments). Typically, hashish oil is a viscous, dark colored oil, but it can vary from a dry resin to a colorless liquid.&quot;.</p>
<p>Section 2D1.1(c) is amended by inserting &quot;Notes to Drug Quantity Table:&quot; immediately following the asterisk at the beginning of the notes to the Drug Quantity Table; and by inserting a letter designation immediately before each note in alphabetical order beginning with &quot;(A)&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §2D1.1 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended in Note 1 by inserting the following additional paragraph at the end:</p>
<p>&quot;Similarly, in the case of marihuana having a moisture content that renders the marihuana unsuitable for consumption without drying (this might occur, for example, with a bale of rain-soaked marihuana or freshly harvested marihuana that had not been dried), an approximation of the weight of the marihuana without such excess moisture content is to be used.&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §2D1.1 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended in Note 8 by inserting the following additional paragraph at the end:</p>
<p>&quot;Note, however, that if an adjustment from subsection (b)(2)(B) applies, do not apply §3B1.3 (Abuse of Position of Trust or Use of Special Skill).&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §2D1.1 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended in Note 10 in the Drug Equivalency Table in the subdivision captioned &quot;Schedule I or II Opiates&quot; by inserting at the end:</p>
<p>&quot;1 gm of Levo-alpha-acetylmethadol (LAAM)= 3 kg of marihuana&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §2D1.1 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended in Note 10 in the Drug Equivalency Tables in the subdivision captioned &quot;Cocaine and Other Schedule I and II Stimulants&quot; by deleting:</p>
<p>&quot;1 gm of L-Methampheta­mine/Levo-methamphetam­ine/</p>
<p>L-Desoxyephed­rine = 40 gm of marihuana&quot;,</p>
<p>and inserting in lieu thereof:</p>
<p>&quot;1 gm of Khat = .01 gm of marihuana&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §2D1.1 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended in Note 12 by deleting:</p>
<p>&quot;In an offense involving negotiation to traffic in a controlled substance, the weight under negotiation in an uncompleted distribution shall be used to calculate the applicable amount. However, where the court finds that the defendant did not intend to produce and was not reasonably capable of producing the negotiated amount, the court shall exclude from the guideline calculation the amount that it finds the defendant did not intend to produce and was not reasonably capable of producing.&quot;,</p>
<p>and inserting in lieu thereof:</p>
<p>&quot;In an offense involving an agreement to sell a controlled substance, the agreed-upon quantity of the controlled substance shall be used to determine the offense level unless the sale is completed and the amount delivered more accurately reflects the scale of the offense. For example, a defendant agrees to sell 500 grams of cocaine, the transaction is completed by the delivery of the controlled substance - actually 480 grams of cocaine, and no further delivery is scheduled. In this example, the amount delivered more accurately reflects the scale of the offense. In contrast, in a reverse sting, the agreed-upon quantity of the controlled substance would more accurately reflect the scale of the offense because the amount actually delivered is controlled by the government, not by the defendant. If, however, the defendant establishes that he or she did not intend to provide, or was not reasonably capable of providing, the agreed-upon quantity of the controlled substance, the court shall exclude from the offense level determination the amount of controlled substance that the defendant establishes that he or she did not intend to provide or was not reasonably capable of providing.&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §2D1.1 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended by deleting Note 13 as follows:</p>
<p>&quot;13. If subsection (b)(2)(B) applies, do not apply §3B1.3 (Abuse of Position of Trust or Use of Special Skill).&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §2D1.1 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended by deleting Note 14 as follows:</p>
<p>&quot;14. D-lysergic acid, which is generally used to make LSD, is classified as a Schedule III controlled substance (to which §2D1.1 applies) and as a listed precursor (to which §2D1.11 applies). Where the defendant is convicted under 21 U.S.C. §§ 841(b)(1)(D) or 960(b)(4) of an offense involving d-lysergic acid, apply §2D1.1 or §2D1.11, whichever results in the greater offense level. <em>See</em> Application Note 5 in the Commentary to §1B1.1 (Application Instructions). Where the defendant is accountable for an offense involving the manufacture of LSD, <em>see</em> Application Note 12 above pertaining to the determination of the scale of the offense.&quot;,</p>
<p>and by renumbering the remaining notes accordingly.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §2D1.1 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended by inserting the following additional note:</p>
<p>&quot;18. For purposes of the guidelines, a ‘plant’ is an organism having leaves and a readily observable root formation (<em>e.g.</em>, a marihuana cutting having roots, a rootball, or root hairs is a marihuana plant).&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This is an eight-part amendment. First, this amendment adds definitions of hashish and hashish oil to §2D1.1 (Unlawful Manufacturing, Importing, Exporting, or Trafficking; Attempt or Conspiracy) in the notes following the Drug Quantity Table. These terms are not defined by statute or in the existing guidelines, leading to litigation as to which substances are to be classified as hashish or hashish oil, as opposed to marihuana. <em>See</em> <em>United States v. Gravelle</em>, 819 F. Supp. 1076 (S.D. Fla. 1993); <em>United States v. Schultz</em>, 810 F. Supp. 230 (S.D. Ohio 1992).</p>
<p>Second, this amendment clarifies the treatment of marihuana that has a moisture content sufficient to render it unusable without drying (<em>e.g.</em>, a bale of marihuana left in the rain or recently harvested marihuana that has not had time to dry). In such cases, using the weight of the wet marihuana can increase the offense level for a factor that bears no relationship to the scale of the offense or the marketable form of the marihuana. Prior to the effective date of the 1993 amendments, two circuits had approved weighing wet marihuana despite the fact that the marihuana was not in a usable form. <em>United States v. Pinedo-Montoya</em>, 966 F.2d 591 (10th Cir. 1992); <em>United States v. Garcia</em>, 925 F.2d 170 (7th Cir. 1991). Although Application Note 1 in the Commentary to §2D1.1, effective November 1, 1993 (pertaining to unusable parts of a mixture or substance) should produce the appropriate result because marihuana must be dried before being used, this type of case is sufficiently distinct to warrant a specific reference in this application note to ensure correct application of the guideline.</p>
<p>Third, this amendment simplifies the Commentary to §2D1.1 by consolidating application notes 8 and 13.</p>
<p>Fourth, this amendment deletes an outdated application note in the Commentary to §2D1.1 pertaining to the classification of d-lysergic acid as a listed precursor chemical.</p>
<p>Fifth, this amendment addresses the issue of what constitutes a marihuana plant. Several circuits have confronted the issue of when a cutting from a marihuana plant becomes a &quot;plant.&quot; The appellate courts generally have held that the term &quot;plant&quot; should be defined by &quot;its plain and ordinary dictionary meaning. . . . [A] marihuana ‘plant’ includes those cuttings accompanied by root balls.&quot; <em>United States v. Edge</em>, 989 F.2d 871, 878 (6th Cir. 1993) (quoting <em>United States v. Eves</em>, 932 F.2d 856, 860 (10th Cir. 1991), <em>appeal after remand</em>, 30 F.3d 134 (6th Cir. 1994)). <em>See</em> <em>also</em> <em>United States v. Malbrough</em>, 922 F.2d 458, 465 (8th Cir. 1990) (acquiescing in the district court’s apparent determination that certain marihuana cuttings that did not have their own &quot;root system&quot; should not be counted as plants), <em>cert</em>. <em>denied</em>, 501 S. Ct. 1258 (1991); <em>United States v. Carlisle</em>, 907 F.2d 94, 96 (9th Cir. 1990) (finding that cuttings were plants where each cutting had previous degrees of root formation not clearly erroneous); <em>United States v. Angell</em>, 794 F. Supp. 874, 875 (D. Minn. 1990) (refusing to count as plants marihuana cuttings that have no visible root structure), <em>aff’d in part and rev’d in part</em>, 11 F.3d 806 (8th Cir.), <em>cert</em>. <em>denied</em>, 114 S. Ct. 3747 (1994); <em>United States v. Fitol</em>, 733 F. Supp. 1312, 1316 (D. Minn. 1990) (&quot;individual cuttings, planted with the intent of growing full size plants, and which had grown roots, are ‘plants’ both within common parlance and within Section 841(b)&quot;); <em>United States v. Speltz</em>, 733 F. Supp. 1311, 1312 (D. Minn. 1990) (small marihuana plants, <em>e.g.</em>, cuttings with roots, are nonetheless still marihuana plants), <em>aff’d</em>, 938 F.2d 188 (8th Cir. 1991). Because this issue arises frequently, this amendment adds an application note to the Commentary of §2D1.1 setting forth the definition of a plant for guidelines purposes.</p>
<p>Sixth, this amendment provides equivalencies for two additional controlled substances: (1) khat, and (2) levo-alpha-acetylmethadol (LAAM) in the Drug Equivalency Tables in the Commentary to §2D1.1.</p>
<p>Seventh, this amendment deletes the distinction between d- and l-methamphetamine in the Drug Equivalency Tables in the Commentary to §2D1.1. L‑methamphetamine, which is a rather weak form of methamphetamine, is rarely seen and is not made intentionally, but rather results from a botched attempt to produce d-methamphetamine. Under this amendment, l‑methamphetamine would be treated the same as d-methamphetamine (<em>i.e.</em>, as if an attempt to manufacture or distribute d-methamphetamine). Currently, unless the methamphetamine is specifically tested to determine its form, litigation can result over whether the methamphetamine is l- methamphetamine or d-methamphetamine. In addition, there is another form of methamphetamine (dl-methamphetamine) that is not listed in the Drug Equivalency Table. The listing of l-methamphetamine as a separate form of methamphetamine has led to litigation as to how dl-methamphetamine should be treated. In <em>United States v. Carroll</em>, 6 F.3d 735 (11th Cir. 1993), <em>cert</em>. <em>denied</em>, 114 S. Ct. 1234 (1994), a case in which the Eleventh Circuit held that dl-methamphetamine should be treated as d-methamphetamine, the majority and dissenting opinions both point out the complexity engendered by the current distinction between d- and l- methamphetamine. Under this amendment, all forms of methamphetamine are treated alike, thereby simplifying guideline application.</p>
<p>Eighth, this amendment revises the Commentary to §2D1.1 to provide that in a case involving negotiation for a quantity of a controlled substance, the negotiated quantity is used to determine the offense level unless the completed transaction establishes a different quantity, or the defendant establishes that he or she was not reasonably capable of producing the negotiated amount or otherwise did not intend to produce that amount. Disputes over the interpretation of this application note have produced much litigation. <em>See</em>, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>United States v. Tillman</em>,8 F.3d 17 (11th Cir. 1993); <em>United States v. Smiley</em>, 997 F.2d 475 (8th Cir. 1993); <em>United States v. Barnes</em>, 993 F.2d 680 (9th Cir. 1993), <em>cert</em>. <em>denied</em>, 115 S. Ct. 96 (1994); <em>United States v. Rodriguez</em>, 975 F.2d 999 (3d Cir. 1992); <em>United States v. Christian</em>, 942 F.2d 363 (6th Cir. 1991), <em>cert</em>. <em>denied</em>, 502 U.S. 1045 (1992); <em>United States v. Richardson</em>, 939 F.2d 135 (4th Cir.), 502 U.S. 987 (1991); <em>United States v. Ruiz</em>, 932 F.2d 1174 (7th Cir.), <em>cert</em>. <em>denied</em>, 502 U.S. 849 (1991); <em>United States v. Bradley</em>, 917 F.2d 601 (1st Cir. 1990).</p>

<p>Section 2D1.11(d) is amended in the notes following the Chemical Quantity Table by deleting Note (A) as follows:</p>
<p>&quot;(A) If more than one listed precursor chemical is involved, use the Precursor Chemical Equivalency Table to determine the offense level.&quot;,</p>
<p>and inserting in lieu thereof:</p>
<p>&quot;(A) The List I Chemical Equivalency Table provides a method for combining different precursor chemicals to obtain a single offense level. In a case involving two or more list I chemicals used to manufacture different controlled substances or to manufacture one controlled substance by different manufacturing processes, convert each to its ephedrine equivalency from the table below, add the quantities, and use the Chemical Quantity Table to determine the base offense level. In a case involving two or more list I chemicals used together to manufacture a controlled substance in the same manufacturing process, use the quantity of the single list I chemical that results in the greatest base offense level.&quot;;</p>
<p>in Notes (B) and (C) by deleting &quot;listed essential&quot; wherever it appears and inserting in lieu thereof in each instance &quot;list II&quot;; in Note (C) by deleting &quot;listed precursor&quot; and inserting in lieu thereof &quot;list I&quot;; by deleting Note (D) as follows:</p>
<p>&quot;(D) The Precursor Chemical Equivalency Table provides a means for combining different listed precursor chemicals to obtain a single offense level. In cases involving multiple precursor chemicals, convert each to its ephedrine equivalency from the table below, add the quantities, and apply the Chemical Quantity Table to obtain the applicable offense level.&quot;,</p>
<p>and inserting in lieu thereof:</p>
<p>&quot;(D) In a case involving ephedrine tablets, use the weight of the ephedrine contained in the tablets, not the weight of the entire tablets, in calculating the base offense level.&quot;;</p>
<p>and by deleting &quot;PRECURSOR&quot; and inserting in lieu thereof &quot;(E) LIST I&quot;.</p>
<p>Section 2D1.11(d) is amended in the List I Chemical Equivalency Table (formerly the Precursor Chemical Equivalency Table) by inserting &quot;**&quot; immediately after each of the following substances: &quot;Ethylamine&quot;, &quot;N-Methylephedrine&quot;, &quot;N-Methylpseudoephedrine&quot;, &quot;Norpseudoephedrine&quot;, &quot;Phenylpropanolamine&quot;, &quot;Pseudoephedrine&quot;, and &quot;3,4‑Methylenedioxyphenyl‑2-propanone&quot;.</p>
<p>Section 2D1.11(d) is amended in the note following the List I Chemical Equivalency Table (formerly the Precursor Chemical Equivalency Table) designated by two asterisks by deleting &quot;both hydriodic acid and ephedrine&quot; and inserting in lieu thereof:</p>
<p>&quot;(A) hydriodic acid and one of the following: ephedrine, N-methylephedrine, N-methylpseudoephedrine, norpseudoephedrine, phenylpropanolamine, or pseudoephedrine; or (B) ethylamine and 3,4-methylenedioxyphenyl-2-propanone; or (C) benzaldehyde and nitroethane&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §2D1.11 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended in Note 3 by deleting &quot;3, 4 methylenedioxphenyl-2-propanone&quot; wherever it appears and inserting in lieu thereof in each instance &quot;methylamine&quot;; and by deleting &quot;LSD, PCP, and other Schedule I and II Hallucinogens&quot; and inserting in lieu thereof &quot;Cocaine and Other Schedule I and II Stimulants&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §2D1.11 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended by deleting:</p>
<p>&quot;4. Where there are multiple listed precursor chemicals, the quantities of all listed precursors are added together for purposes of determining the base offense level, except as expressly noted (<em>see</em> Note A to the Chemical Quantity Table). This reflects that only one listed precursor typically is used in a given manufacturing process. For example, in the case of an offense involving 300 grams of piperidine and 800 grams of benzyl cyanide, the piperidine is converted to 600 grams of ephedrine and the benzyl cyanide is converted to 800 grams of ephedrine, using the Precursor Chemical Equivalency Table, for a total of 1400 grams of ephedrine. Applying the Chemical Quantity Table to 1400 grams (1.4 kilograms) of ephedrine results in a base offense level of 22.&quot;,</p>
<p>and inserting in lieu thereof:</p>
<p>&quot;4. When two or more list I chemicals are used together in the same manufacturing process, calculate the offense level for each separately and use the quantity that results in the greatest base offense level. In any other case, the quantities should be added together (using the List I Chemical Equivalency Table) for the purpose of calculating the base offense level.</p>
<p><em>Examples</em>:</p>
<p>(a) The defendant was in possession of five kilograms of ephedrine and three kilograms of hydriodic acid. Ephedrine and hydriodic acid typically are used together in the same manufacturing process to manufacture methamphetamine. Therefore, the base offense level for each listed chemical is calculated separately and the list I chemical with the higher base offense level is used. Five kilograms of ephedrine result in a base offense level of 24; 300 grams of hydriodic acid result in a base offense level of 14. In this case, the base offense level would be 24.</p>
<p>(b) The defendant was in possession of five kilograms of ephedrine and two kilograms of phenylacetic acid. Although both of these chemicals are used to manufacture methamphetamine, they are not used together in the same manufacturing process. Therefore, the quantity of phenylacetic acid should be converted to an ephedrine equivalency using the List I Chemical Equivalency Table and then added to the quantity of ephedrine. In this case, the two kilograms of phenylacetic acid convert to two kilograms of ephedrine (<em>see</em> List I Chemical Equivalency Table), resulting in a total equivalency of seven kilograms of ephedrine.&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §2D1.11 is amended by deleting &quot;listed precursor&quot; wherever it appears and inserting in lieu thereof &quot;list I&quot;; and by deleting &quot;listed essential&quot; and inserting in lieu thereof in each instance &quot;list II&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §2D1.11 captioned &quot;Background&quot; is amended in the second sentence by deleting &quot;Listed precursor chemicals are critical to the formation of a controlled substance and&quot; and inserting in lieu thereof &quot;List I chemicals are important to the manufacture of a controlled substance and usually&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §2D1.11 captioned &quot;Background&quot; is amended by deleting the last sentence as follows:</p>
<p>&quot;Listed essential chemicals are generally solvents, catalysts, and reagents, and do not become part of the finished product.&quot;,</p>
<p>and inserting in lieu thereof:</p>
<p>&quot;List II chemicals are generally used as solvents, catalysts, and reagents.&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> The Domestic Chemical Diversion Act of 1993, Pub. L. 103-200, 107 Stat. 2333, changed the designations of the listed chemicals from &quot;listed precursor chemicals&quot; and &quot;listed essential chemicals&quot; to &quot;list I chemicals&quot; and &quot;list II chemicals,&quot; respectively. This amendment conforms §2D1.11 (Unlawfully Distributing, Importing, Exporting or Possessing a Listed Chemical; Attempt or Conspiracy) to these statutory changes.</p>
<p>The Act also adds pills containing ephedrine as a list I chemical. Ephedrine itself is a list I chemical under 21 U.S.C. § 802(34). Pills containing ephedrine previously were not covered by the statute and, thus, legally could be purchased &quot;over the counter.&quot; Purchases of these pills were sometimes made in large quantities and the pills crushed and processed to extract the ephedrine (which can be used to make methamphetamine). Unlike ephedrine, which is purchased from a chemical company and is virtually 100 percent pure, these tablets contain a substantially lower percentage of ephedrine (about 25 percent). To avoid unwarranted disparity, this amendment adds a note to §2D1.11 providing that the amount of actual ephedrine contained in a pill is to be used in determining the offense level.</p>
<p>In addition, the Act removes three chemicals from, and adds two others to, the listed chemicals controlled under the Controlled Substances Act. Two of the chemicals removed from the list are not currently listed in §2D1.11 because the Commission was aware that they are not used in the manufacture of any controlled substance. The third chemical removed from the list, d-lysergic acid, was listed both as a listed chemical in §2D1.11 and as a controlled substance in §2D1.1 (Unlawful Manufacturing, Importing, Exporting, or Trafficking; Attempt or Conspiracy). This amendment conforms §2D1.11 by deleting all references to d-lysergic acid. The two chemicals added as listed chemicals are benzaldehyde and nitroethane. Both of these chemicals are used to make methamphetamine. The base offense levels for listed chemicals in §2D1.11 are determined by reference to the most common controlled substance the chemical is used to manufacture; consequently, this amendment adds these chemicals to the Chemical Quantity Table based on information provided by the Drug Enforcement Administration regarding their use in the production of methamphetamine.</p>
<p>A number of the chemicals in the Chemical Quantity Table in §2D1.11 are used in the same process to make a controlled substance. A note at the end of the existing Precursor Chemical Equivalency Table addresses this situation for hydriodic acid and ephedrine. This amendment expands this note to cover other chemicals that similarly are used together.</p>
<p>In addition, this amendment corrects Application Note 3 of the Commentary to §2D1.11 with respect to an example of a listed chemical that is used with P2P to manufacture methamphetamine and a reference to a subdivision of the Drug Equivalency Tables in the Commentary to §2D1.1.</p>

{id: 520, content:"<p><strong>520.</strong> <strong>Amendment:</strong> Section 2D1.12(a) is amended by inserting &quot;(Apply the greater)&quot; immediately after &quot;Base Offense Level&quot;; and by deleting &quot;12&quot; and inserting in lieu thereof:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;(1) 12, if the defendant intended to manufacture a controlled substance or knew or believed the prohibited equipment was to be used to manufacture a controlled substance; or</p>
<p>(2) 9, if the defendant had reasonable cause to believe the prohibited equipment was to be used to manufacture a controlled substance.&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> The Domestic Chemical Diversion Act of 1993, Pub. L. 103-200, 107 Stat. 2333, broadens the prohibition in 21 U.S.C. § 843(a) to cover possessing, manufacturing, distributing, exporting, or importing three-neck, round-bottom flasks, tableting machines, encapsulating machines, or gelatin capsules having reasonable cause to believe they will be used to manufacture a controlled substance. Section 2D1.12 (Unlawful Possession, Manufacture, Distribution, or Importation of Prohibited Flask or Equipment; Attempt or Conspiracy) applies to this conduct. Consistent with the treatment of similar conduct under §§2D1.11(b)(2) and 2D1.13(b)(2), this amendment provides an alternative base offense level in §2D1.12 to address the case in which the defendant had reasonable cause to believe, but not actual knowledge or belief, that the equipment was to be used to manufacture a controlled substance.</p>

<p>&quot;<em>Introductory Commentary</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This subpart covers violations of civil rights statutes that typically penalize conduct involving death or bodily injury more severely than discriminatory or intimidating conduct not involving such injury.</p>
<p>The addition of two levels to the offense level applicable to the underlying offense in this subpart reflects the fact that the harm involved both the underlying conduct and activity intended to deprive a person of his civil rights. An added penalty is imposed on an offender who was a public official at the time of the offense to reflect the likely damage to public confidence in the integrity and fairness of government, and the added likely force of the threat because of the official’s involvement.&quot;.</p>

<p><em>Commentary</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Statutory Provision</em>: 18 U.S.C. § 241.</p>
<p><em>Application Notes</em>:</p>
<p>1. ‘Underlying offense,’ as used in this guideline, includes any offense under federal, state, or local law other than an offense that is itself covered under Chapter Two, Part H, Subpart 1, 2, or 4. For example, in the case of a conspiracy to interfere with a person’s civil rights (a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 241) that involved an aggravated assault (the use of force) to deny certain rights or benefits in furtherance of discrimination (a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 245), the underlying offense in respect to both the violation of 18 U.S.C. § 241 (to which §2H1.1 applies) and the violation of 18 U.S.C. § 245 (to which §2H1.3 applies) would be the aggravated assault.</p>
<p>‘2 plus the offense level applicable to any underlying offense’ means 2 levels above the offense level (base offense level plus any applicable specific offense characteristics and cross references) from the offense guideline in Chapter Two that most closely corresponds to the underlying offense. For example, if the underlying offense was second degree murder, which under §2A1.2 has an offense level of 33, ‘2 plus the offense level applicable to any underlying offense’ would be 33 + 2 = 35. If the underlying offense was assault, criminal sexual conduct, kidnapping, abduction or unlawful restraint, the offense level from the guideline for the most comparable offense in §§2A2.1-2A4.2 (Assault, Criminal Sexual Abuse, and Kidnapping, Abduction, or Unlawful Restraint) would first be determined, and 2 levels then would be added. If the underlying offense was damage to property by means of arson or an explosive device, the offense level from §2K1.4 (Arson; Property Damage By Use of Explosives) would first be determined and 2 levels would be added. If the offense was property damage by other means, the offense level from §2B1.3 (Property Damage or Destruction) would first be determined and 2 levels would be added. If the offense was a conspiracy or attempt to commit arson, ‘2 plus the offense level applicable to any underlying offense’ would be the offense level from the guideline applicable to a conspiracy or attempt to commit arson plus 2 levels.</p>
<p>In certain cases, the count of which the defendant is convicted may set forth conduct that constitutes more than one underlying offense (<em>e.g.</em>, two instances of assault, or one instance of assault and one instance of arson). In such cases, determine the offense level for the underlying offense by treating each underlying offense as if contained in a separate count of conviction. To determine which of the alternative base offense levels (<em>e.g.</em>, §2H1.1(a)(1) or (a)(2)) results in the greater offense level, apply Chapter Three, Parts A, B, C, and D to each alternative base offense level. Use whichever results in the greater offense level. Example: The defendant is convicted of one count of conspiracy to violate civil rights that included two level 12 underlying offenses (of a type not grouped together under Chapter Three, Part D). No adjustment from Chapter Three, Parts A, B, or C applies. The base offense level from §2H1.1(a)(1) is 15. The offense level for each underlying offense from §2H1.1(a)(2) is 14 (2 + 12). Under Chapter Three, Part D (Multiple Counts), the two level 14 underlying offenses result in a combined offense level of 16. This offense level is greater than the alternative base offense level of 15 under §2H1.1(a)(1). Therefore, the case is treated as if there were two counts, one for each underlying offense, with a base offense level under §2H1.1(a)(2) of 14 for each underlying offense.</p>
<p>2. Where the adjustment in §2H1.1(b)(1) is applied, do not apply §3B1.3 (Abuse of Position of Trust or Use of Special Skill).</p>
<p><em>Background</em>: This section applies to intimidating activity by various groups, including formally and informally organized groups as well as hate groups. The maximum term of imprisonment authorized by statute is ten years; except where death results, the maximum term of imprisonment authorized by statute is life imprisonment. The base offense level for this guideline assumes threatening or otherwise serious conduct.</p>
<p>§2H1.3. <em>Use of Force or Threat of Force to Deny Benefits or Rights in Furtherance of Discrimination; Damage to Religious Real Property</em></p>
<p>(a) Base Offense Level (Apply the greatest):</p>
<p>(1) 10, if no injury occurred; or</p>
<p>(2) 15, if injury occurred; or</p>
<p>(3) 2 plus the offense level applicable to any underlying offense.</p>
<p>(b) Specific Offense Characteristic</p>
<p>(1) If the defendant was a public official at the time of the offense, increase by 4 levels.</p>

<p><em>Application Notes</em>:</p>
<p>1. ‘2 plus the offense level applicable to any underlying offense’ is defined in the Commentary to §2H1.1.</p>
<p>2. ‘Injury’ means ‘bodily injury,’ ‘serious bodily injury,’ or ‘permanent or life-threatening bodily injury’ as defined in the Commentary to §1B1.1 (Application Instructions).</p>
<p>3. Where the adjustment in §2H1.3(b)(1) is applied, do not apply §3B1.3 (Abuse of Position of Trust or Use of Special Skill).</p>
<p>4. In the case of a violation of 42 U.S.C. § 3631, apply this guideline where the offense involved the threat or use of force. Otherwise, apply §2H1.5.</p>
<p><em>Background</em>: The statutes covered by this guideline provide federal protection for the exercise of civil rights in a variety of contexts (<em>e.g.</em>, voting, employment, public accommodations, etc.). The base offense level in §2H1.3(a) reflects that the threat or use of force is inherent in the offense. The maximum term of imprisonment authorized by statute is one year if no bodily injury results, ten years if bodily injury results, and life imprisonment if death results.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Statutory Provision</em>: 18 U.S.C. § 242.</p>
<p><em>Application Notes</em>:</p>
<p>1. ‘6 plus the offense level applicable to any underlying offense’ means 6 levels above the offense level for any underlying criminal conduct. See the discussion in the Commentary to §2H1.1.</p>
<p>2. Do not apply the adjustment from §3B1.3 (Abuse of Position of Trust or Use of Special Skill).</p>
<p><em>Background</em>: This maximum term of imprisonment authorized by 18 U.S.C. § 242 is one year if no bodily injury results, ten years if bodily injury results, and life imprisonment if death results. A base offense level of 10 is prescribed at §2H1.4(a)(1) providing a guideline sentence near the one-year statutory maximum for cases not resulting in death or bodily injury because of the compelling public interest in deterring and adequately punishing those who violate civil rights under color of law. The Commission intends to recommend that this one-year statutory maximum penalty be increased. An alternative base offense level is provided at §2H1.4(a)(2). The 6-level increase under subsection (a)(2) reflects the 2-level increase that is applied to other offenses covered in this Part plus a 4-level increase for the commission of the offense under actual or purported legal authority. This 4-level increase is inherent in the base offense level of 10 under subsection (a)(1).</p>
<p>Enhancement under §3B1.3 (Abuse of Position of Trust or Use of Special Skill) is inappropriate because the base offense level in §2H1.4(a) reflects that the abuse of actual or purported legal authority is inherent in the offense.</p>

</blockquote>
<p><em>Commentary</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Application Notes</em>:</p>
<p>1. This adjustment applies to offenses where an unusually vulnerable victim is made a target of criminal activity by the defendant. The adjustment would apply, for example, in a fraud case where the defendant marketed an ineffective cancer cure or in a robbery where the defendant selected a handicapped victim. But it would not apply in a case where the defendant sold fraudulent securities by mail to the general public and one of the victims happened to be senile. Similarly, for example, a bank teller is not an unusually vulnerable victim solely by virtue of the teller’s position in a bank.</p>
<p>2. Do not apply this adjustment if the offense guideline specifically incorporates this factor. For example, where the offense guideline provides an enhancement for the age of the victim, this guideline should not be applied unless the victim was unusually vulnerable for reasons unrelated to age.&quot;.</p>
<p>A replacement guideline with accompanying commentary is inserted as §3A1.1 (Hate Crime Motivation or Vulnerable Victim).</p>
<p>The Commentary to §2H4.1 captioned &quot;Application Note&quot; is amended in Note 1 by deleting &quot;2 plus the offense&quot; and inserting in lieu thereof &quot;Offense&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This is a five-part amendment. First, the amendment adds an additional subsection to §3A1.1 (Vulnerable Victim) to implement the directive contained in Section 280003 of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 by providing a three-level increase in the offense level for offenses that are &quot;hate crimes.&quot; Second, the amendment consolidates §§2H1.1 (Offenses Involving Individual Rights), 2H1.3 (Use of Force or Threat of Force to Deny Benefits or Rights in Furtherance of Discrimination; Damage to Religious Real Property), 2H1.4 (Interference with Civil Rights Under Color of Law), and 2H1.5 (Other Deprivations of Rights Benefits in Furtherance of Discrimination) into a revised §2H1.1 (Offenses Involving Individual Rights). This revised guideline provides greater consistency in offense levels for similar conduct, reflects the additional enhancement now contained in §3A1.1, and better reflects the seriousness of the underlying conduct. Third, the amendment references violations of 18 U.S.C. § 248 (the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act of 1994, Pub. L. 103-259, 108 Stat. 694) to the consolidated §2H1.1. Fourth, the amendment clarifies the operation of §3A1.1 with respect to a vulnerable victim. Fifth, the amendment addresses the directive to the Commission in section 240002 of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 (pertaining to elderly victims of crimes of violence).</p>
<p>Section 280003 of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 directs the Commission to provide a minimum enhancement of three levels for offenses that the finder of fact at trial determines are hate crimes. This directive also instructs the Commission to ensure that there is reasonable consistency with other guidelines and that duplicative punishments for the same offense are avoided. The congressional directive in section 280003 requires that the three-level hate crimes enhancement apply where &quot;the finder of fact at trial determines beyond a reasonable doubt&quot; that the offense of conviction was a hate crime. This amendment makes the enhancement applicable if either the finder of fact at trial or, in the case of a guilty or <em>nolo</em> <em>contendere</em> plea, the court at sentencing determines that the offense was a hate crime. By broadening the applicability of the congressionally mandated enhancement, this amendment will avoid unwarranted sentencing disparity based on the mode of conviction. The Commission’s general guideline promulgation authority, <em>see</em> 28 U.S.C. § 994, permits such a broadening of the enhancement.</p>
<p>The addition of a generally applicable Chapter Three hate crimes enhancement requires amendment of the civil rights offense guidelines to avoid duplicative punishments. In addition, to further the Commission’s goal of simplifying the operation of the guidelines, the proposed amendment consolidates the four current civil rights offense guidelines into one guideline and adjusts these guidelines to take into account the new enhancement under §3A1.1(a).</p>
<p>The Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act of 1994 makes it a crime to interfere with access to reproductive services or to interfere with certain religious activities. This Act criminalizes a broad array of conduct, from non-violent obstruction of the entrance to a clinic to murder. The amendment treats these violations in the same way as other offenses involving individual rights.</p>
<p>Section 240002 of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 directs the Commission to ensure that the guidelines provide sufficiently stringent penalties for crimes of violence against elderly victims. Upon review of the guidelines, the Commission determined that the penalties currently provided generally appear appropriate; however, this amendment strengthens the Commentary to §3A1.1 in one area by expressly providing a basis for an upward departure if both the current offense and a prior offense involved a vulnerable victim (including an elderly victim), regardless of the type of offense.</p>
<p>Finally, Section 250003 of the Violent Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 directs the Commission to review, and if necessary, amend the sentencing guidelines to ensure that victim-related adjustments for fraud offenses against older victims are adequate. Section 250003 also directs the Commission to study and report to the Congress on this issue. <em>See</em> Report to Congress: Adequacy of Penalties for Fraud Offenses Involving Elderly Victims (March 13, 1995). Although the Commission found that the current guidelines generally provided adequate penalties in these cases, it noted some inconsistency in the application of §3A1.1 regarding whether this adjustment required proof that the defendant had &quot;targeted the victim on account of the victim’s vulnerability.&quot; This amendment revises the Commentary of §3A1.1 to clarify application with respect to this issue.</p>

<p>&quot;3. A ‘firearm described in 26 U.S.C. § 5845(a)’ includes: (i) a shotgun having a barrel or barrels of less than 18 inches in length; a weapon made from a shotgun if such weapon as modified has an overall length of less than 26 inches or a barrel or barrels of less than 18 inches in length; a rifle having a barrel or barrels of less than 16 inches in length; or a weapon made from a rifle if such weapon as modified has an overall length of less than 26 inches or a barrel or barrels of less than 16 inches in length; (ii) a machinegun; (iii) a silencer; (iv) a destructive device; and (v) certain unusual weapons defined in 26 U.S.C. § 5845(e) (that are not conventional, unaltered handguns, rifles, or shotguns).

<p>&quot;12. If the defendant is convicted under 18 U.S.C. § 922(i), (j), or (k), or 26 U.S.C. § 5861(g) or (h) (offenses involving stolen firearms or ammunition), and is convicted of no other offense subject to this guideline, do not apply the adjustment in subsection (b)(4) because the base offense level itself takes such conduct into account.&quot;.</p>
<p>and inserting in lieu thereof:</p>

This is because the base offense level takes into account that the firearm or ammunition was stolen.</p>
<p>Similarly, if the only offense to which §2K2.1 applies is 18 U.S.C. § 922(k) (offenses involving an altered or obliterated serial number) and the base offense level is determined under subsection (a)(7), do not apply the adjustment in subsection (b)(4) unless the offense involved a stolen firearm or stolen ammunition. This is because the base offense level takes into account that the firearm had an altered or obliterated serial number.&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This is a five-part amendment. First, the amendment revises §2K2.1 (Unlawful Receipt, Possession, or Transportation of Firearms or Ammunition; Prohibited Transactions Involving Firearms or Ammunition) to provide increased offense levels for possession of a semiautomatic assault weapon that correspond to the offense levels currently provided for possession of machineguns and other firearms described in 26 U.S.C. § 5845(a). Second, the amendment addresses section 110201 of the Violent Crime Control Law Enforcement Act of 1994 by providing an offense level of six for the misdemeanor portion of 18 U.S.C. § 922(x)(1) (involving sale or transfer of a handgun or ammunition to a juvenile). For an offense under the felony portion of 18 U.S.C. § 922(x)(1) (involving the sale or transfer of a handgun or handgun ammunition to a juvenile knowing or having reasonable cause to believe that the handgun or ammunition was intended to be used in a crime), the enhancement in subsection (b)(5) will provide a minimum offense level of 18. Third, the amendment addresses section 110401 of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 by adding to the definition of a &quot;prohibited person&quot; in §2K2.1 a person under the court order described in that section of the Act. Fourth, the amendment provides an offense level of six for the misdemeanors set forth in 18 U.S.C. § 922 (s) and (t) (involving violations of the Brady Act). Fifth, the amendment clarifies that Application Note 12 in §2K2.1 applies only to cases in which the base offense level is determined under §2K2.1(a)(7).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;28 U.S.C. § 994(h) mandates that the Commission assure that certain ‘career’ offenders, as defined in the statute, receive a sentence of imprisonment ‘at or near the maximum term authorized.’ Section 4B1.1 implements this mandate. The legislative history of this provision suggests that the phrase ‘maximum term authorized’ should be construed as the maximum term authorized by statute. <em>See</em> S. Rep. 98-225, 98th Cong., 1st Sess. 175 (1983), 128 Cong. Rec. 26, 511-12 (1982) (text of ‘Career Criminals’ amendment by Senator Kennedy), 26, 515 (brief summary of amendment), 26, 517-18 (statement of Senator Kennedy).&quot;,</p>
<p>and inserting in lieu thereof:</p>
<p>&quot;Section 994(h) of Title 28, United States Code, mandates that the Commission assure that certain ‘career’ offenders receive a sentence of imprisonment ‘at or near the maximum term authorized.’ Section 4B1.1 implements this directive, with the definition of a career offender tracking in large part the criteria set forth in 28 U.S.C. § 994(h). However, in accord with its general guideline promulgation authority under 28 U.S.C. § 994(a)-(f), and its amendment authority under 28 U.S.C. § 994(o) and (p), the Commission has modified this definition in several respects to focus more precisely on the class of recidivist offenders for whom a lengthy term of imprisonment is appropriate and to avoid ‘unwarranted sentencing disparities among defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of similar criminal conduct . . . .’ 28 U.S.C. § 991(b)(1)(B). The Commission’s refinement of this definition over time is consistent with Congress’s choice of a directive to the Commission rather than a mandatory minimum sentencing statute (‘The [Senate Judiciary] Committee believes that such a directive to the Commission will be more effective; the guidelines development process can assure consistent and rational implementation for the Committee’s view that substantial prison terms should be imposed on repeat violent offenders and repeat drug traffickers.’ S. Rep. No. 225, 98th Cong., 1st Sess. 175 (1983)).</p>
<p>The legislative history of this provision suggests that the phrase ‘maximum term authorized’ should be construed as the maximum term authorized by statute. <em>See</em> S. Rep. No. 225, 98th Cong., 1st Sess. 175 (1983); 128 Cong. Rec. 26,511-12 (1982) (text of ‘Career Criminals’ amendment by Senator Kennedy); <em>id.</em> at 26,515 (brief summary of amendment); <em>id.</em> at 26,517-18 (statement of Senator Kennedy).&quot;.</p>
<p>Application Note 1 of the Commentary to §4B1.2 is repromulgated without change.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This amendment repromulgates Application Note 1 of the Commentary to §4B1.2 (Definition of Terms Used in Section 4B1.1) and inserts additional background commentary in §4B1.1 (Career Offender) explaining the Commission’s rationale and authority for its implementation of this guideline. The amendment responds to a decision by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in <em>United States v. Price</em>, 990 F.2d 1367 (D.C. Cir. 1993). In <em>Price</em>, the court invalidated application of the career offender guideline to a defendant convicted of a drug conspiracy because 28 U.S.C. § 994(h), which the Commission cites as the mandating authority for the career offender guideline, does not expressly refer to inchoate offenses. The court indicated that it did not foreclose Commission authority to include conspiracy offenses under the career offender guideline by drawing upon its broader guideline promulgation authority in 28 U.S.C. § 994(a). <em>See</em> <em>also</em> <em>United States v. Mendoza-Figueroa</em>, 28 F.3d 766 (8th Cir. 1994), <em>vacated</em> (Sept. 2, 1994); <em>United States v. Bellazerius</em>, 24 F.3d 698 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied</em>, 115 S. Ct. 375 (1994). Other circuits have rejected the <em>Price</em> analysis and upheld the Commission’s definition of &quot;controlled substance offense.&quot; For example, the Ninth Circuit considered the legislative history to 994(h) and determined that the Senate Report clearly indicated that 994(h) was not the sole enabling statute for the career offender guidelines. <em>United States v. Heim</em>, 15 F.3d 830 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied</em>, 115 S. Ct. 55 (1994). <em>See</em> <em>also</em> <em>United States v. Hightower</em>, 25 F.3d 182 (3d Cir.), <em>cert. denied</em>, 115 S.

<p>&quot;Under subsection (a), the court is required to impose a term of supervised release to follow imprisonment if a sentence of imprisonment of more than one year is imposed or if a term of supervised release is required by a specific statute. The court may depart from this guideline and not impose a term of supervised release if it determines that supervised release is neither required by statute nor required for any of the following reasons: (1) to protect the public welfare; (2) to enforce a financial condition; (3) to provide drug or alcohol treatment or testing; (4) to assist the reintegration of the defendant into the community; or (5) to accomplish any other sentencing purpose authorized by statute.&quot;.</p>

<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This amendment sets forth with greater specificity the circumstances under which the court may depart from the requirements of §5D1.1 (Imposition of a Term of Supervised Release) and impose no term of supervised release. In addition, the amendment deletes, as unnecessary, the requirement in §5D1.2 (Term of Supervised Release) of a term of supervised release of three to five years whenever a statute requires any term of supervised release. Instead, the amendment provides that, in the case of a statute requiring a term of supervised release, the length of the term of supervised release shall be determined by the class of felony of which the defendant was convicted, but shall not be less than any minimum term of supervised release required by statute.</p>

<p>The Commentary to §5E1.1 is amended by inserting the following immediately before &quot;Background&quot;:</p>
<p>&quot;<em>Application Note</em>:</p>
<p>1. In the case of a conviction under certain statutes, additional requirements regarding restitution apply. <em>See</em> 18 U.S.C. §§ 2248 and 2259 (applying to convictions under 18 U.S.C. §§ 2241-2258 for sexual-abuse offenses and sexual exploitation of minors); 18 U.S.C. § 2327 (applying to convictions under 18 U.S.C. §§ 1028-1029, 1341-1344 for telemarketing-fraud offenses); 18 U.S.C. § 2264 (applying to convictions under 18 U.S.C. §§ 2261-2262 for domestic-violence offenses). To the extent that any of the above-noted statutory provisions conflict with the provisions of this guideline, the applicable statutory provision shall control.&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> Section 40113 of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 requires &quot;mandatory&quot; restitution for offenses involving sexual abuse and sexual exploitation of children under 18 U.S.C. §§ 2241-2258. Sections 40221 and 250002 add similar &quot;mandatory&quot; restitution provisions for offenses involving domestic violence (18 U.S.C. § 2264) and telemarketing fraud (18 U.S.C. § 2327). These provisions also require that compliance with a restitution order be a condition of probation or supervised release, have broader definitions of loss than 18 U.S.C. § 3663, and apply &quot;notwithstanding section 3663, and in addition to any civil or criminal penalty authorized by law.&quot; This amendment adds commentary to §5E1.1 (Restitution) to alert courts to these statutory provisions.</p>
<p>In addition, this amendment conforms §5E1.1 to the redesignation of 49 U.S.C. § 1472(h), (i), (j), and (n) as 49 U.S.C. §§ 46312, 46502(a), (b), and 46504, and the redesignation of Rule 32(c)(2)(D) as Rule 32(b)(4)(D).</p>

{id: 531, content:"<p><strong>531.</strong> <strong>Amendment:</strong> Chapter Five, Part K, Subpart Two is amended by inserting an additional policy statement as §5K2.17 (High-Capacity, Semiautomatic Firearms).</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This amendment addresses the directive in section 110501 of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 to provide an appropriate enhancement for a crime of violence or drug trafficking crime if a semiautomatic firearm is involved.</p>
<p>According to data reviewed by the Commission, semiautomatic firearms are used in 50-70 percent of offenses involving a firearm. Thus, offenses involving a semiautomatic firearm represent the typical or &quot;heartland&quot; case under the guidelines. Consequently, the firearms enhancements in the guidelines for crimes of violence and drug trafficking can be considered to take into account the fact that firearms involved in these offenses typically are semiautomatic. Moreover, the &quot;firepower&quot; or &quot;dangerousness&quot; of semiautomatic firearms, compared to other types of firearms, varies substantially with caliber and magazine capacity. For example, a .25 caliber, six-shot semiautomatic pistol is not considered as having as much firepower as a .38 caliber, six-shot revolver or a .357 magnum, six-shot revolver. A nine-millimeter semiautomatic pistol fires a somewhat more powerful cartridge than a .38 caliber revolver and a somewhat less powerful cartridge than a .357 magnum revolver. But some nine-millimeter semiautomatic pistols hold from 14-18 cartridges, compared to six cartridges for a revolver. A high magazine capacity, nine-millimeter semiautomatic pistol can be said to have significantly more firepower than a revolver because it can fire a significantly larger number of shots without reloading.</p>
<p>If harm actually results (<em>e.g.</em>, death or bodily injury), the guidelines generally take that harm into account directly. Consequently, in considering any distinction between semiautomatic firearms and other firearms, the issue is whether there is any significant difference in the risk of harm. The difference in the risk of harm also varies widely with the circumstances of the offense. For example, in a robbery at very close range, the difference in the likelihood of death or bodily injury between a revolver and semiautomatic pistol would seem to be small. In contrast, in a drive-by shooting the greater firepower of a semiautomatic weapon likely would have a more significant effect on the likelihood of death or injury.</p>
<p>After considering the above factors, the Commission determined that the most appropriate approach at this time was to provide a specific basis for an upward departure when a high-capacity semiautomatic firearm is possessed in connection with a crime of violence or drug trafficking offense, thereby allowing the courts the flexibility to take this factor into account as appropriate in the circumstances of the particular case.</p>

{id: 532, content:"<p><strong>532.</strong> <strong>Amendment:</strong> Chapter Five, Part K, Subpart Two is amended by inserting an additional policy statement as §5K1.18 (Violent Street Gangs).</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This amendment expressly provides a basis for an upward departure in the case of a defendant subject to a statutorily enhanced maximum penalty under 18 U.S.C. § 521 (pertaining to criminal street gangs), as enacted by section 150000 of the Violent Crime and Law Enforcement Act of 1994.</p>

{id: 533, content:"<p><strong>533.</strong> <strong>Amendment:</strong> Section 7B1.3(g)(2) is amended by deleting &quot;the defendant may, to the extent permitted by law, be ordered to recommence supervised release upon release from imprisonment&quot; and inserting in lieu thereof:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;the court may include a requirement that the defendant be placed on a term of supervised release upon release from imprisonment. The length of such a term of supervised release shall not exceed the term of supervised release authorized by statute for the offense that resulted in the original term of supervised release, less any term of imprisonment that was imposed upon revocation of supervised release. 18 U.S.C. § 3583(h)&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §7B1.3 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended in Note 2 by deleting:</p>
<p>&quot;. This statute, however, neither expressly authorizes nor precludes a court from ordering that a term of supervised release recommence after revocation. Under §7B1.3(g)(2), the court may order, to the extent permitted by law, the recommencement of a supervised release term following revocation&quot;,</p>
<p>and inserting in lieu thereof:</p>
<p>&quot;, (g)-(i). Under 18 U.S.C. § 3583(h) (effective September 13, 1994), the court, in the case of revocation of supervised release and imposition of less than the maximum imposable term of imprisonment, may order an additional period of supervised release to follow imprisonment&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §7B1.3 captioned &quot;Application Notes is amended by deleting:</p>
<p>&quot;3. Subsection (c) provides for the use of certain alternatives to imprisonment upon revocation. It is to be noted, however, that a court may decide that not every alternative is authorized by statute in every circumstance. For example, in <em>United States v. Behnezhad</em>, 907 F.2d 896 (9th Cir. 1990), the Ninth Circuit held that where a term of supervised release was revoked there was no statutory authority to impose a further term of supervised release. Under this decision, in the case of a revocation of a term of supervised release, an alternative that is contingent upon imposition of a further term of supervised release (<em>e.g.</em>, a period of imprisonment followed by a period of community confinement or detention as a condition of supervised release) cannot be implemented. The Commission has transmitted to the Congress a proposal for a statutory amendment to address this issue.&quot;;</p>
<p>and by renumbering the remaining notes accordingly.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §7B1.4 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended by deleting:</p>
<p>&quot;5. Under 18 U.S.C. § 3565(a), upon a finding that a defendant violated a condition of probation by being in possession of a controlled substance, the court is required ‘to revoke the sentence of probation and sentence the defendant to not less than one-third of the original sentence.’ Under 18 U.S.C. § 3583(g), upon a finding that a defendant violated a condition of supervised release by being in possession of a controlled substance, the court is required ‘to terminate supervised release and sentence the defendant to serve in prison not less than one-third of the term of supervised release.’ The Commission leaves to the court the determination of whether evidence of drug usage established solely by laboratory analysis constitutes ‘possession of a controlled substance’ as set forth in 18 U.S.C. §§ 3565(a) and 3583(g).</p>
<p>6. Under 18 U.S.C. § 3565(b), upon a finding that a defendant violated a condition of probation by the actual possession of a firearm, the court is required ‘to revoke the sentence of probation and impose any other sentence that was available ... at the time of initial sentencing.’&quot;,</p>
<p>and inserting in lieu thereof:</p>
<p>&quot;5. Upon a finding that a defendant violated a condition of probation or supervised release by being in possession of a controlled substance or firearm or by refusing to comply with a condition requiring drug testing, the court is required to revoke probation or supervised release and impose a sentence that includes a term of imprisonment. 18 U.S.C. §§ 3565(b), 3583(g).</p>
<p>6. In the case of a defendant who fails a drug test, the court shall consider whether the availability of appropriate substance abuse programs, or a defendant’s current or past participation in such programs, warrants an exception from the requirement of mandatory revocation and imprisonment under 18 U.S.C. §§ 3565(b) and 3583(g). 18 U.S.C. §§ 3563(a), 3583(d).&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> Section 110505 of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 amends 18 U.S.C. § 3583(e)(3) by specifying that a defendant whose supervised release term is revoked may not be required to serve more than five years in prison if the offense that resulted in the term of supervised release is a Class A felony. The provision also amends section 3583(g) by eliminating the mandatory re-imprisonment period of at least one-third of the term of supervised release if the defendant possesses a controlled substance. Additionally, the provision requires the courts to revoke probation or supervised release and impose a sentence that includes a term of imprisonment if the defendant is found to be in possession of a firearm, or refuses to participate in drug testing. Finally, the provision expressly authorizes the court to order an additional, limited period of supervision following revocation of supervised release and re-imprisonment.</p>
<p>Section 20414 of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 makes mandatory a condition of probation requiring that the defendant refrain from any unlawful use of a controlled substance. 18 U.S.C. § 3563(a)(4). The section also establishes a condition that the defendant, with certain exceptions, submit to periodic drug tests. The existing mandatory condition of probation requiring the defendant not to possess a controlled substance remains unchanged. 18 U.S.C. § 3563(a)(3). Similar requirements are made with respect to conditions of supervised release. 18 U.S.C. § 3583(d).</p>
<p>Section 110506 of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 mandates revocation of probation and imposition of a term of imprisonment if the defendant violates probation by possessing a controlled substance or a firearm, or by refusing to comply with drug testing. 18 U.S.C. § 3565(b). It does not require revocation in the case of use of a controlled substance (although use presumptively may establish possession). No minimum term of imprisonment is required other than a sentence that includes a &quot;term of imprisonment&quot; consistent with the sentencing guidelines and revocation policy statements. Similar requirements are set forth in 18 U.S.C. § 3583(g) with respect to conditions of supervised release.</p>
<p>Section 20414 permits &quot;an exception in accordance with United States Sentencing Commission guidelines&quot; from the mandatory revocation provisions of section 3565(b), &quot;when considering any action against a defendant who fails a drug test administered in accordance with [section 3563(a)(4)].&quot; The exception from the mandatory revocation provisions appears limited to a defendant who fails the test and does not appear to apply to a defendant who refuses to take the test.</p>
<p>This amendment conforms §§7B1.3 (Revocation of Probation or Supervised Release) and 7B1.4 (Term of Imprisonment) to these revised statutory provisions.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;(c) (Policy Statement) In any other case, the sentence for the instant offense shall be imposed to run consecutively to the prior undischarged term of imprisonment to the extent necessary to achieve a reasonable incremental punishment for the instant offense.&quot;,</p>
<p>and inserting in lieu thereof:</p>
<p>&quot;(c) (Policy Statement) In any other case, the sentence for the instant offense may be imposed to run concurrently, partially concurrently, or consecutively to the prior undischarged term of imprisonment to achieve a reasonable punishment for the instant offense.&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §5G1.3 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended in Note 1 by inserting &quot;<em>Consecutive sentence - subsection (a) cases</em>.&quot; immediately before &quot;Under&quot;; and by deleting &quot;where the instant offense (or any part thereof)&quot; and inserting in lieu thereof &quot;when the instant offense&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §5G1.3 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended by deleting:</p>
<p>&quot;2. Subsection (b) (which may apply only if subsection (a) does not apply), addresses cases in which the conduct resulting in the undischarged term of imprisonment has been fully taken into account under §1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct) in determining the offense level for the instant offense. This can occur, for example, where a defendant is prosecuted in both federal and state court, or in two or more federal jurisdictions, for the same criminal conduct or for different criminal transactions that were part of the same course of conduct.</p>
<p>When a sentence is imposed pursuant to subsection (b), the court should adjust for any term of imprisonment already served as a result of the conduct taken into account in determining the sentence for the instant offense. <em>Example</em>: The defendant has been convicted of a federal offense charging the sale of 30 grams of cocaine. Under §1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct), the defendant is held accountable for the sale of an additional 15 grams of cocaine that is part of the same course of conduct for which the defendant has been convicted and sentenced in state court (the defendant received a nine-month sentence of imprisonment, of which he has served six months at the time of sentencing on the instant federal offense). The guideline range applicable to the defendant is 10-16 months (Chapter Two offense level of 14 for sale of 45 grams of cocaine; 2-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility; final offense level of 12; Criminal History Category I). The court determines that a sentence of 13 months provides the appropriate total punishment. Because the defendant has already served six months on the related state charge, a sentence of seven months, imposed to run concurrently with the remainder of the defendant’s state sentence, achieves this result. For clarity, the court should note on the Judgment in a Criminal Case Order that the sentence imposed is not a departure from the guidelines because the defendant has been credited for guideline purposes under §5G1.3(b) with six months served in state custody.</p>
<p>3. Where the defendant is subject to an undischarged term of imprisonment in circumstances other than those set forth in subsections (a) or (b), subsection (c) applies and the court shall impose a consecutive sentence to the extent necessary to fashion a sentence resulting in a reasonable incremental punishment for the multiple offenses. In some circumstances, such incremental punishment can be achieved by the imposition of a sentence that is concurrent with the remainder of the unexpired term of imprisonment. In such cases, a consecutive sentence is not required. To the extent practicable, the court should consider a reasonable incremental penalty to be a sentence for the instant offense that results in a combined sentence of imprisonment that approximates the total punishment that would have been imposed under §5G1.2 (Sentencing on Multiple Counts of Conviction) had all of the offenses been federal offenses for which sentences were being imposed at the same time. It is recognized that this determination frequently will require an approximation. Where the defendant is serving a term of imprisonment for a state offense, the information available may permit only a rough estimate of the total punishment that would have been imposed under the guidelines. Where the offense resulting in the undischarged term of imprisonment is a federal offense for which a guideline determination has previously been made, the task will be somewhat more straightforward, although even in such cases a precise determination may not be possible.</p>
<p>It is not intended that the above methodology be applied in a manner that unduly complicates or prolongs the sentencing process. Additionally, this methodology does not, itself, require the court to depart from the guideline range established for the instant federal offense. Rather, this methodology is meant to assist the court in determining the appropriate sentence (<em>e.g.</em>, the appropriate point within the applicable guideline range, whether to order the sentence to run concurrently or consecutively to the undischarged term of imprisonment, or whether a departure is warranted). Generally, the court may achieve an appropriate sentence through its determination of an appropriate point within the applicable guideline range for the instant federal offense, combined with its determination of whether that sentence will run concurrently or consecutively to the undischarged term of imprisonment.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Illustrations of the Application of Subsection (c)</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(A) The guideline range applicable to the instant federal offense is 24-30 months. The court determines that a total punishment of 36 months’ imprisonment would appropriately reflect the instant federal offense and the offense resulting in the undischarged term of imprisonment. The undischarged term of imprisonment is an indeterminate sentence of imprisonment with a 60-month maximum. At the time of sentencing on the instant federal offense, the defendant has served ten months on the undischarged term of imprisonment. In this case, a sentence of 26 months’ imprisonment to be served concurrently with the remainder of the undischarged term of imprisonment would (1) be within the guideline range for the instant federal offense, and (2) achieve an appropriate total punishment (36 months).</p>
<p>(B) The applicable guideline range for the instant federal offense is 24-30 months. The court determines that a total punishment of 36 months’ imprisonment would appropriately reflect the instant federal offense and the offense resulting in the undischarged term of imprisonment. The undischarged term of imprisonment is a six-month determinate sentence. At the time of sentencing on the instant federal offense, the defendant has served three months on the undischarged term of imprisonment. In this case, a sentence of 30 months’ imprisonment to be served consecutively to the undischarged term of imprisonment would (1) be within the guideline range for the instant federal offense, and (2) achieve an appropriate total punishment (36 months).</p>
<p>(C) The applicable guideline range for the instant federal offense is 24-30 months. The court determines that a total punishment of 60 months’ imprisonment would appropriately reflect the instant federal offense and the offense resulting in the undischarged term of imprisonment. The undischarged term of imprisonment is a 12-month determinate sentence. In this case, a sentence of 30 months’ imprisonment to be served consecutively to the undischarged term of imprisonment would be the greatest sentence imposable without departure for the instant federal offense.</p>
<p>(D) The applicable guideline range for the instant federal offense is 24-30 months. The court determines that a total punishment of 36 months’ imprisonment would appropriately reflect the instant federal offense and the offense resulting in the undischarged term of imprisonment. The undischarged term of imprisonment is an indeterminate sentence with a 60-month maximum. At the time of sentencing on the instant federal offense, the defendant has served 22 months on the undischarged term of imprisonment. In this case, a sentence of 24 months to be served concurrently with the remainder of the undischarged term of imprisonment would be the lowest sentence imposable without departure for the instant federal offense.</p>
<p>4. If the defendant was on federal or state probation, parole, or supervised release at the time of the instant offense, and has had such probation, parole, or supervised release revoked, the sentence for the instant offense should be imposed to be served consecutively to the term imposed for the violation of probation, parole, or supervised release in order to provide an incremental penalty for the violation of probation, parole, or supervised release (in accord with the policy expressed in §§7B1.3 and 7B1.4)&quot;,</p>
<p>and inserting in lieu thereof:</p>
<p>&quot;2. <em>Adjusted concurrent sentence - subsection (b) cases</em>. When a sentence is imposed pursuant to subsection (b), the court should adjust the sentence for any period of imprisonment already served as a result of the conduct taken into account in determining the guideline range for the instant offense if the court determines that period of imprisonment will not be credited to the federal sentence by the Bureau of Prisons. <em>Example</em>: The defendant is convicted of a federal offense charging the sale of 30 grams of cocaine. Under §1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct), the defendant is held accountable for the sale of an additional 15 grams of cocaine, an offense for which the defendant has been convicted and sentenced in state court. The defendant received a nine-month sentence of imprisonment for the state offense and has served six months on that sentence at the time of sentencing on the instant federal offense. The guideline range applicable to the defendant is 10-16 months (Chapter Two offense level of 14 for sale of 45 grams of cocaine; 2-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility; final offense level of 12; Criminal History Category I). The court determines that a sentence of 13 months provides the appropriate total punishment. Because the defendant has already served six months on the related state charge as of the date of sentencing on the instant federal offense, a sentence of seven months, imposed to run concurrently with the three months remaining on the defendant’s state sentence, achieves this result. For clarity, the court should note on the Judgment in a Criminal Case Order that the sentence imposed is not a departure from the guideline range because the defendant has been credited for guideline purposes under §5G1.3(b) with six months served in state custody that will not be credited to the federal sentence under 18 U.S.C. § 3585(b).</p>
<p>3. <em>Concurrent or consecutive sentence - subsection (c) cases</em>. In circumstances not covered under subsection (a) or (b), subsection (c) applies. Under this subsection, the court may impose a sentence concurrently, partially concurrently, or consecutively. To achieve a reasonable punishment and avoid unwarranted disparity, the court should consider the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. § 3584 (referencing 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)) and be cognizant of:</p>
<p>(a) the type (<em>e.g.</em>, determinate, indeterminate/parolable) and length of the prior undischarged sentence;</p>
<p>(b) the time served on the undischarged sentence and the time likely to be served before release;</p>
<p>(c) the fact that the prior undischarged sentence may have been imposed in state court rather than federal court, or at a different time before the same or different federal court; and</p>
<p>(d) any other circumstance relevant to the determination of an appropriate sentence for the instant offense.</p>
<p>4. <em>Partially concurrent sentence</em>. In some cases under subsection (c), a partially concurrent sentence may achieve most appropriately the desired result. To impose a partially concurrent sentence, the court may provide in the Judgment in a Criminal Case Order that the sentence for the instant offense shall commence (A) when the defendant is released from the prior undischarged sentence, or (B) on a specified date, whichever is earlier. This order provides for a fully consecutive sentence if the defendant is released on the undischarged term of imprisonment on or before the date specified in the order, and a partially concurrent sentence if the defendant is not released on the undischarged term of imprisonment by that date.</p>
<p>5. <em>Complex situations</em>. Occasionally, the court may be faced with a complex case in which a defendant may be subject to multiple undischarged terms of imprisonment that seemingly call for the application of different rules. In such a case, the court may exercise its discretion in accordance with subsection (c) to fashion a sentence of appropriate length and structure it to run in any appropriate manner to achieve a reasonable punishment for the instant offense.</p>
<p>6. <em>Revocations</em>. If the defendant was on federal or state probation, parole, or supervised release at the time of the instant offense, and has had such probation, parole, or supervised release revoked, the sentence for the instant offense should be imposed to run consecutively to the term imposed for the violation of probation, parole, or supervised release in order to provide an incremental penalty for the violation of probation, parole, or supervised release. <em>See</em> §7B1.3 (Revocation of Probation or Supervised Release) (setting forth a policy that any imprisonment penalty imposed for violating probation or supervised release should be consecutive to any sentence of imprisonment being served or subsequently imposed).&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §5G1.3 captioned &quot;Background&quot; is amended by deleting:</p>
<p>&quot;This guideline provides direction to the court when a term of imprisonment is imposed on a defendant who is already subject to an undischarged term of imprisonment. <em>See</em> 18 U.S.C. § 3584. Except in the cases in which subsection (a) applies, this guideline is intended to result in an appropriate incremental punishment for the instant offense that most nearly approximates the sentence that would have been imposed had all the sentences been imposed at the same time.&quot;,</p>
<p>and inserting in lieu thereof:</p>
<p>&quot;In a case in which a defendant is subject to an undischarged sentence of imprisonment, the court generally has authority to impose an imprisonment sentence on the current offense to run concurrently with or consecutively to the prior undischarged term. 18 U.S.C. § 3584(a). Exercise of that authority, however, is predicated on the court’s consideration of the factors listed in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a), including any applicable guidelines or policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This is a two-part amendment. First, this amendment clarifies the application of subsections (a) and (b) of this guideline. Second, in circumstances covered by the policy statement in subsection (c), this amendment affords the sentencing court additional flexibility to impose, as appropriate, a consecutive, concurrent, or partially concurrent sentence in order to achieve a reasonable punishment for the instant offense.</p>
<p>Authority to impose a partially concurrent sentence is found in the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 (SRA). In enacting 28 U.S.C. § 994(l)(1), Congress contemplated that 18 U.S.C. § 3584 would allow imposition of partially concurrent sentences, in addition to fully concurrent or consecutive sentences. (&quot;It is the Committee’s intent that, to the extent feasible, the sentences for each of the multiple offenses be determined separately and the degree to which they should overlap be specified.&quot;) S. Rep. No. 225, 98th Cong., 1st Sess. 177 (1983). Without the ability to fashion such a sentence, the instruction to the Commission in 28 U.S.C. § 994(l)(1) to provide a reasonable incremental penalty for additional offenses could not be implemented successfully in certain situations, particularly when the defendant’s release date on an undischarged term of imprisonment cannot be determined readily in advance (<em>e.g.</em>, in the case of an indeterminate sentence subject to parole release).</p>
<p>Prior to the SRA, only the Bureau of Prisons had the authority to commence a federal sentence prior to the defendant’s release from imprisonment on a state sentence. <em>See</em>, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>United States v. Segal</em>, 549 F.2d 1293, 1301 (9th Cir. 1977). SRA legislative history pertaining to 18 U.S.C. § 3584 indicates that this new section was intended to authorize imposition of a federal prison sentence to run concurrently or consecutively to a state prison sentence. &quot;This . . . [section 3584] changes the law that now applies to a person sentenced for a Federal offense who is already serving a term of imprisonment for a state offense.&quot; S. Rep. No. 225, <em>supra</em> at 127. &quot;Thus, it is intended that this provision be construed contrary to the holding in <em>United States v. Segal</em>. . .&quot; <em>Id</em>. (at 127 n.314). <em>See</em> <em>United States v. Hardesty</em>, 958 F.2d 910, 914 (stating that, under section 3584, &quot;Congress has expressly granted federal judges the discretion to impose a sentence concurrent to a state prison term&quot;), <em>aff’d</em> <em>en</em> <em>banc</em>, 977 F.2d 1347 (9th Cir. 1992).</p>

<p>5. If the defendant sexually exploited or abused a minor at any time, whether or not such sexual abuse occurred during the course of the offense, an upward departure may be warranted. In determining the extent of such a departure, the court should take into consideration the offense levels provided in §§2A3.1, 2A3.2, and 2A3.4 most commensurate with the defendant’s conduct, as well as whether the defendant has received an enhancement under subsection (b)(4) on account of such conduct.&quot;.</p>
<p>Section 2G2.4(a) is amended by deleting &quot;13&quot; and inserting in lieu thereof &quot;15&quot;.</p>
<p>Section 2G2.4(b) is amended by inserting after subdivision (2) the following additional subdivision:</p>
<p>&quot;(3) If the defendant’s possession of the material resulted from the defendant’s use of a computer, increase by 2 levels.&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This is a four-part amendment. First, the amendment implements the congressional directives in section 2 of the Sex Crimes Against Children Prevention Act of 1995, Pub. L. 104-71, 109 Stat. 774, by providing a two-level enhancement above the currently prescribed offense level for offenses involving the sexual exploitation of minors. The two-level enhancement is provided in the base offense levels under §§2G2.1, 2G2.2, and 2G2.4.</p>
<p>Second, the amendment implements the congressional directive in section 3 of the above-noted Act by providing a two-level enhancement for offenses involving the sexual exploitation of a minor if a computer was used to transmit certain notices or advertisements of material involving minors engaged in sexually explicit conduct or to transport or ship that material. The enhancement in §2G2.2(b)(5) applies to the transmission of the material or of the notice or advertisement of the material. The enhancement in §2G2.4(b)(3) applies only if the defendant’s possession of the material resulted from the defendant’s use of a computer. In addition to these congressionally directed enhancements, the amendment adds a two-level enhancement under §2G2.1(b)(3) if a computer was used to solicit participation in sexually explicit conduct by or with a minor for the purpose of producing sexually explicit material.</p>
<p>Third, the amendment revises the Commentary to §2G2.2 to consolidate the definitions applicable to this guideline in the first application note and address several additional issues. The amendment revises the definition of &quot;pattern of activity involving the sexual abuse or exploitation of a minor&quot; to clarify that &quot;sexual abuse or exploitation,&quot; for purposes of §2G2.2(b)(4), requires that the defendant personally had participated in such conduct. The amendment defines &quot;sexual abuse or exploitation&quot; to mean conduct constituting criminal sexual abuse, sexual exploitation, or abusive sexual contact and to exclude trafficking in child pornography. These revisions are consistent with <em>United States v. Chapman</em>, 60 F.3d 894 (1st Cir. 1995) and <em>United States v. Ketcham</em>, 80 F.3d 789 (3d Cir. 1996), both of which held that the defendant’s transportation or distribution of child pornography is not sexual exploitation within the meaning of the &quot;pattern of activity&quot; enhancement in §2G2.2(b)(4). In addition, the amendment clarifies that the &quot;pattern of activity&quot; may include acts of sexual abuse or exploitation that were not committed during the course of the offense or that did not result in a conviction. This revision responds in part to the holding in <em>Chapman</em>, 60 F.3d at 901, that the &quot;pattern of activity&quot; enhancement is inapplicable to past sexual abuse or exploitation unrelated to the offense of conviction. The amended language expressly provides that such conduct may be considered. Accordingly, the conduct considered for purposes of the &quot;pattern of activity&quot; enhancement is broader than the scope of relevant conduct typically considered under §1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct). In addition, the amendment provides that an upward departure may be warranted if the defendant (1) did not engage in a &quot;pattern of activity&quot; but nevertheless abused a minor at any time, or (2) engaged in a &quot;pattern of activity&quot; but the enhancement does not adequately reflect the seriousness of the sexual abuse or exploitation. In addition, the amendment clarifies that prior convictions counted as part of the &quot;pattern of activity&quot; also may be counted as part of the defendant’s criminal history under Chapter Four, if those convictions meet the criteria set forth in the relevant guidelines of that chapter.</p>
<p>Fourth, the amendment makes the &quot;Statutory Provisions&quot; in the Commentary to §§2G2.1 and 2G2.2 more comprehensive by adding 18 U.S.C. § 2258(a) and (b) to the list of statutory provisions covered by those guidelines.</p>

<p><em>Statutory Provisions</em>: 8 U.S.C. § 1328; 18 U.S.C. §§ 2421, 2422.</p>
<p><em>Application Notes</em>:</p>
<p>1. The base offense level assumes that the offense was committed for profit. In the infrequent case where the defendant did not commit the offense for profit and the offense did not involve physical force or coercion, the Commission recommends a downward departure of 8 levels.</p>
<p>2. The enhancement for physical force, or coercion, anticipates no bodily injury. If bodily injury results, an upward departure may be warranted. <em>See</em> Chapter Five, Part K (Departures).</p>
<p>3. ‘Coercion,’ as used in this guideline, includes any form of conduct that negates the voluntariness of the behavior of the person transported. This factor would apply, for example, where the ability of the person being transported to appraise or control conduct was substantially impaired by drugs or alcohol. In the case of transportation involving an adult, rather than a minor, this characteristic generally will not apply where the alcohol or drug was voluntarily taken.</p>
<p>4. For the purposes of §3B1.1 (Aggravating Role), the persons transported are considered participants only if they assisted in the unlawful transportation of others.</p>
<p>5. For the purposes of Chapter Three, Part D (Multiple Counts), each person transported is to be treated as a separate victim. Consequently, multiple counts involving the transportation of different persons are not to be grouped together under §3D1.2 (Groups of Closely Related Counts). Special instruction (c)(1) directs that if the relevant conduct of an offense of conviction includes more than one person being transported, whether specifically cited in the count of conviction or not, each such person shall be treated as if contained in a separate count of conviction.</p>
<p>§2G1.2. <em>Transportation of a Minor for the Purpose of Prostitution or Prohibited Sexual Conduct</em></p>
<p>(a) Base Offense Level: 16</p>
<p>(b) Specific Offense Characteristics</p>
<p>(1) If the offense involved the use of physical force, or coercion by threats or drugs or in any manner, increase by 4 levels.</p>
<p>(2) If the offense involved the transportation of a minor under the age of twelve years, increase by 4 levels.</p>
<p>(3) If the offense involved the transportation of a minor at least twelve years of age but under the age of sixteen years, increase by 2 levels.</p>
<p>(4) If the defendant was a parent, relative, or legal guardian of the minor involved in the offense, or if the minor was otherwise in the custody, care, or supervisory control of the defendant, increase by 2 levels.</p>
<p>(c) Cross References</p>
<p>(1) If the offense involved causing, transporting, permitting, or offering or seeking by notice or advertisement, a minor to engage in sexually explicit conduct for the purpose of producing a visual depiction of such conduct, apply §2G2.1 (Sexually Exploiting a Minor by Production of Sexually Explicit Visual or Printed Material; Custodian Permitting Minor to Engage in Sexually Explicit Conduct; Advertisement for Minors to Engage in Production).</p>
<p>(2) If the offense involved criminal sexual abuse, attempted criminal sexual abuse, or assault with intent to commit criminal sexual abuse, apply §2A3.1 (Criminal Sexual Abuse; Attempt to Commit Criminal Sexual Abuse).</p>
<p>(3) If neither subsection (c)(1) nor (c)(2) is applicable, and the offense did not involve transportation for the purpose of prostitution, apply §2A3.2 (Criminal Sexual Abuse of a Minor or Attempt to Commit Such Acts) or §2A3.4 (Abusive Sexual Contact or Attempt to Commit Abusive Sexual Contact), as appropriate.</p>
<p>(d) Special Instruction</p>
<p>(1) If the offense involved the transportation of more than one person, Chapter Three, Part D (Multiple Counts) shall be applied as if the transportation of each person had been contained in a separate count of conviction.</p>

<p><em>Commentary</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Statutory Provisions</em>: 8 U.S.C. § 1328; 18 U.S.C. §§ 2421, 2422, 2423.</p>
<p><em>Application Notes</em>:</p>
<p>1. For the purposes of Chapter Three, Part D (Multiple Counts), each person transported is to be treated as a separate victim. Consequently, multiple counts involving the transportation of different persons are not to be grouped together under §3D1.2 (Groups of Closely Related Counts). Special instruction (d)(1) directs that if the relevant conduct of an offense of conviction includes more than one person being transported, whether specifically cited in the count of conviction or not, each such person shall be treated as if contained in a separate count of conviction.</p>
<p>2. The enhancement for physical force, or coercion, anticipates no bodily injury. If bodily injury results, an upward departure may be warranted. <em>See</em> Chapter Five, Part K (Departures).</p>
<p>3. ‘Coercion,’ as used in this guideline, includes any form of conduct that negates the voluntariness of the behavior of the person transported. This factor would apply, for example, where the ability of the person being transported to appraise or control conduct was substantially impaired by drugs or alcohol.</p>
<p>4. ‘Sexually explicit conduct,’ as used in this guideline, has the meaning set forth in 18 U.S.C. § 2256.</p>
<p>5. Subsection (b)(4) is intended to have broad application and includes offenses involving a minor entrusted to the defendant, whether temporarily or permanently. For example, teachers, day care providers, baby-sitters, or other temporary caretakers are among those who would be subject to this enhancement. In determining whether to apply this adjustment, the court should look to the actual relationship that existed between the defendant and the child and not simply to the legal status of the defendant-child relationship.</p>
<p>6. If the adjustment in subsection (b)(4) applies, do not apply §3B1.3 (Abuse of Position of Trust or Use of Special Skill).</p>
<p>7. The cross reference in subsection (c)(1) is to be construed broadly to include all instances where the offense involved employing, using, persuading, inducing, enticing, coercing, transporting, permitting, or offering or seeking by notice or advertisement, a minor to engage in sexually explicit conduct for the purpose of producing any visual depiction of such conduct.&quot;.</p>
<p>A replacement guideline with accompanying commentary is inserted as §2G1.1 (Promoting Prostitution or Prohibited Sexual Conduct).</p>
<p>Chapter 1, Part A, Subpart 4(b) is amended in the fourth paragraph by deleting:</p>
<p>&quot;For example, the Commentary to §2G1.1 (Transportation for the Purpose of Prostitution or Prohibited Sexual Conduct) recommends a downward departure of eight levels where a commercial purpose was not involved.&quot;.</p>
<p>Section 3D1.2(d) is amended in the third paragraph by deleting &quot;2G1.2,&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This is a three-part amendment. First, this amendment consolidates §§2G1.1 (Transportation for the Purpose of Prostitution or Prohibited Sexual Conduct) and 2G1.2 (Transportation of a Minor for the Purpose of Prostitution or Prohibited Sexual Conduct) in furtherance of the Commission’s goal of simplifying the operation of the guidelines. The enhancement pertaining to the age of the victim in subsection (b)(2) is increased by two levels to reflect the two-level higher base offense level of former §2G1.2. The consolidated offense guideline incorporates the cross references of §2G1.2, provides a definition of the term &quot;victim,&quot; and clarifies that the guideline covers offenses under 18 U.S.C. § 2423(a), but not 18 U.S.C. § 2423(b) (a statutory provision referenced in Appendix A to §§2A3.1, 2A3.2, and 2A3.3).</p>
<p>Second, this amendment implements the congressional directive in section 4 of the Sex Crimes Against Children Prevention Act of 1995, Pub. L. 104-71, 109 Stat. 774, by providing a three-level increase in the enhancement for offenses involving the transportation of minors with intent to engage in prostitution or other prohibited sexual conduct. This three-level increase is provided in the specific offense characteristic pertaining to the age of the victim in subsection (b)(2) and is in addition to the two-level increase in this enhancement described in the first part of this amendment.</p>
<p>Third, this amendment addresses 18 U.S.C. § 2422(b), a new offense created by section 508 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, Pub. L. 104-104, 110 Stat. 56. That offense makes it unlawful, in interstate or foreign commerce, including through the mail, or within the special maritime or territorial jurisdiction of the United States, to knowingly persuade, induce, entice, or coerce an individual under the age of 18 years to engage in prostitution or other prohibited sexual conduct. The amendment brings this new offense within the scope of the consolidated guideline. As revised, the guideline is broadly applicable to offenses that involve &quot;promoting prostitution or prohibited sexual conduct.&quot; That term is defined to encompass conduct covered by the new Telecommunications Act offense as well as conduct previously covered by the guideline; <em>i.e.</em>, transporting a person, or inducing a person to travel, for the purpose of prostitution or other prohibited sexual conduct.</p>

<p>6. Reckless conduct to which the adjustment from subsection (b)(5) applies includes a wide variety of conduct (<em>e.g.</em>, transporting persons in the trunk or engine compartment of a motor vehicle, carrying substantially more passengers than the rated capacity of a motor vehicle or vessel, or harboring persons in a crowded, dangerous, or inhumane condition). If subsection (b)(5) applies solely on the basis of conduct related to fleeing from a law enforcement officer, do not apply an adjustment from §3C1.2 (Reckless Endangerment During Flight). Additionally, do not apply the adjustment in subsection (b)(5) if the only reckless conduct that created a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury is conduct for which the defendant received an enhancement under subsection (b)(4).&quot;.</p>

<p>&quot;and any applicable Chapter Three adjustments). Although the offense guideline that results in the greater offense level under Chapter Two will most frequently result in the greater final offense level, this will not always be the case. If, for example, a role or abuse of trust adjustment applies to the cross-referenced offense guideline, but not to the guideline initially applied, the greater Chapter Two offense level may not necessarily result in a greater final offense level.&quot;,</p>
<p>and inserting in lieu thereof:</p>
<p>&quot;, unless the offense guideline expressly provides for consideration of both the Chapter Two offense level and applicable Chapter Three adjustments. For situations in which a comparison involving both Chapters Two and Three is necessary, <em>see</em> the Commentary to §§2C1.1 (Offering, Giving, Soliciting, or Receiving a Bribe); 2C1.7 (Fraud Involving Deprivation of the Intangible Right to the Honest Services of Public Officials); 2E1.1 (Unlawful Conduct Relating to Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations); and 2E1.2 (Interstate or Foreign Travel or Transportation in Aid of a Racketeering Enterprise).&quot;.</p>

<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This amendment simplifies the guidelines by restricting the cross-reference comparison to the Chapter Two offense levels, unless a different procedure is expressly specified. With respect to §§2C1.1, 2C1.7, 2E1.1, and 2E1.2, the amendment, and an express provision in each of these guidelines, provide a different procedure because these guidelines are the only four offense guidelines in which the inclusion of Chapter Three adjustments in the comparison is likely to make a difference.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Section 1B1.10(b) is amended by deleting &quot;sentence&quot; in both instances and inserting in lieu thereof &quot;the term of imprisonment&quot;; and by inserting &quot;, except that in no event may the reduced term of imprisonment be less than the term of imprisonment the defendant has already served&quot; after &quot;sentenced&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §1B1.10 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended by inserting after Note 2 the following additional notes:</p>
<p>&quot;3. Under subsection (b), the amended guideline range and the term of imprisonment already served by the defendant limit the extent to which an eligible defendant’s sentence may be reduced under 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2). When the original sentence represented a downward departure, a comparable reduction below the amended guideline range may be appropriate; however, in no case shall the term of imprisonment be reduced below time served. Subject to these limitations, the sentencing court has the discretion to determine whether, and to what extent, to reduce a term of imprisonment under this section.</p>
<p>4. Only a term of imprisonment imposed as part of the original sentence is authorized to be reduced under this section. This section does not authorize a reduction in the term of imprisonment imposed upon revocation of supervised release.</p>
<p>5. If the limitation in subsection (b) relating to time already served precludes a reduction in the term of imprisonment to the extent the court determines otherwise would have been appropriate as a result of the amended guideline range, the court may consider any such reduction that it was unable to grant in connection with any motion for early termination of a term of supervised release under 18 U.S.C. § 3583(e)(1). However, the fact that a defendant may have served a longer term of imprisonment than the court determines would have been appropriate in view of the amended guideline range shall not, without more, provide a basis for early termination of supervised release. Rather, the court should take into account the totality of circumstances relevant to a decision to terminate supervised release, including the term of supervised release that would have been appropriate in connection with a sentence under the amended guideline range.&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §1B1.10 captioned &quot;Background&quot; is amended in the third paragraph by inserting &quot;to determine an amended guideline range under subsection (b)&quot; after &quot;retroactively&quot;; and by inserting before the fourth paragraph the following additional paragraph:</p>
<p>&quot;The listing of an amendment in subsection (c) reflects policy determinations by the Commission that a reduced guideline range is sufficient to achieve the purposes of sentencing and that, in the sound discretion of the court, a reduction in the term of imprisonment may be appropriate for previously sentenced, qualified defendants. The authorization of such a discretionary reduction does not otherwise affect the lawfulness of a previously imposed sentence, does not authorize a reduction in any other component of the sentence, and does not entitle a defendant to a reduced term of imprisonment as a matter of right.&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This amendment makes a number of substantive and clarifying changes in the policy statement relating to retroactive application of an amendment that reduces a guideline range. The amendment provides that, in exercising discretion to reduce the term of imprisonment of an incarcerated defendant, a court may not reduce the term of imprisonment below time served (or, put differently, grant a greater reduction in imprisonment than the imprisonment time remaining to be served). In those cases in which the combination of time already served and this limitation preclude a defendant from receiving the full reduction the court would be inclined to grant as a result of an amended guideline range, the amended commentary instructs that the court may weigh the equities of such a situation in connection with a separate motion for early termination of supervised release under 18 U.S.C. § 3583(e)(1). The amendment also makes clear that, contrary to the holding in <em>United States v. Etherton</em>, 101 F.3d 80 (9th Cir. 1996), a reduction in the term of imprisonment imposed upon revocation of supervised release is not authorized by the policy statement. Finally, the amendment makes a number of changes in the title and text of the policy statement to improve the precision of the language, adds commentary emphasizing court discretion in applying amendments that the Commission has listed for possible retroactive application, and adds background commentary more fully describing the legal consequences flowing from a Commission decision to list an amendment for possible retroactive application.</p>

<p><em>Commentary</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Statutory Provisions</em>: 18 U.S.C. §§ 2261-2262.</p>
<p><em>Application Notes</em>:</p>
<p>1. For purposes of this guideline—</p>
<p>‘Bodily injury’ and ‘dangerous weapon’ are defined in the Commentary to §1B1.1 (Application Instructions).</p>
<p>‘Pattern of activity involving stalking, threatening, harassing, or assaulting the same victim’ means any combination of two or more separate instances of stalking, threatening, harassing, or assaulting the same victim, whether or not such conduct resulted in a conviction. For example, a single instance of stalking accompanied by a separate instance of threatening, harassing, or assaulting the same victim constitutes a pattern of activity for purposes of this guideline.</p>
<p>‘Stalking’ means traveling with the intent to injure or harass another person and, in the course of, or as a result of, such travel, placing the person in reasonable fear of death or serious bodily injury to the person or the person’s immediate family. <em>See</em> 18 U.S.C. § 2261A. ‘Immediate family’ has the meaning set forth in 18 U.S.C. § 115(c)(2).</p>
<p>2. Subsection (b)(1) provides for a two-level or four-level enhancement based on the degree to which the offense involved aggravating factors listed in that subsection. If the offense involved aggravating factors more serious than the factors listed in subsection (b)(1), the cross reference in subsection (c) most likely will apply, if the resulting offense level is greater, because the more serious conduct will be covered by another offense guideline from Chapter Two, Part A. For example, §2A2.2 (Aggravated Assault) most likely would apply pursuant to subsection (c) if the offense involved assaultive conduct in which injury more serious than bodily injury occurred or if a dangerous weapon was used rather than merely possessed.</p>
<p>3. In determining whether subsection (b)(1)(D) applies, the court shall consider, under the totality of the circumstances, any conduct that occurred prior to or during the offense; however, conduct that occurred prior to the offense must be substantially and directly connected to the offense. For example, if a defendant engaged in several acts of stalking the same victim over a period of years (including acts that occurred prior to the offense), then for purposes of determining whether subsection (b)(1)(D) applies, the court shall look to the totality of the circumstances, considering only those prior acts of stalking the victim that have a substantial and direct connection to the offense.</p>
<p>Prior convictions taken into account under subsection (b)(1)(D) are also counted for purposes of determining criminal history points pursuant to Chapter Four, Part A (Criminal History).</p>
<p>4. For purposes of Chapter Three, Part D (Multiple Counts), multiple counts involving stalking, threatening, or harassing the same victim are grouped together (and with counts of other offenses involving the same victim that are covered by this guideline) under §3D1.2 (Groups of Closely Related Counts). For example, if the defendant is convicted of two counts of stalking the defendant’s ex-spouse under 18 U.S.C. § 2261A and one count of interstate domestic violence involving an assault of the ex-spouse under 18 U.S.C. § 2261, the stalking counts would be grouped together with the interstate domestic violence count. This grouping procedure avoids unwarranted ‘double counting’ with the enhancement in subsection (b)(1)(D) (for multiple acts of stalking, threatening, harassing, or assaulting the same victim) and recognizes that the stalking and interstate domestic violence counts are sufficiently related to warrant grouping.</p>
<p>Multiple counts that are cross referenced to another offense guideline pursuant to subsection (c) are to be grouped together if §3D1.2 would require grouping of those counts under that offense guideline. Similarly, multiple counts cross referenced pursuant to subsection (c) are not to be grouped together if §3D1.2 would preclude grouping of the counts under that offense guideline. For example, if the defendant is convicted of multiple counts of threatening an ex-spouse in violation of a court protection order under 18 U.S.C. § 2262 and the counts are cross referenced to §2A6.1 (Threatening or Harassing Communications), the counts would group together because Application Note 2 of §2A6.1 specifically requires grouping. In contrast, if the defendant is convicted of multiple counts of assaulting the ex-spouse in violation of a court protection order under 18 U.S.C. § 2262 and the counts are cross referenced to §2A2.2 (Aggravated Assault), the counts probably would not group together inasmuch as §3D1.2(d) specifically precludes grouping of counts covered by §2A2.2 and no other provision of §3D1.2 would likely apply to require grouping.</p>
<p>Multiple counts involving different victims are not to be grouped under §3D1.2.</p>
<p>5. If the defendant received an enhancement under subsection (b)(1) but that enhancement does not adequately reflect the extent or seriousness of the conduct involved, an upward departure may be warranted. For example, an upward departure may be warranted if the defendant stalked the victim on many occasions over a prolonged period of time.&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This is a five-part amendment. First, this amendment addresses the new offense of interstate stalking, 18 U.S.C. § 2261A, which was enacted as section 1069 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1997, Pub. L. 104–201, 110 Stat. 2422. That offense makes it unlawful to travel across a state line or within federal jurisdiction with the intent to injure or harass another person and, in the course of, or as a result of, such travel, to place that person in reasonable fear of death or serious bodily injury to that person or that person’s immediate family.</p>
<p>The amendment adds a new guideline, §2A6.2 (Stalking or Domestic Violence), to cover the stalking offense. The new guideline provides for a base offense level of 14 and an enhancement for the presence of one or more aggravating factors that are often part of a stalking offense, including the violation of a court protection order and the presence of a pattern of stalking, harassing, threatening, or assaultive conduct. The new guideline also provides for a cross reference to other Chapter Two guidelines if the offense involved more serious conduct, such as aggravated assault or kidnapping, that would produce a greater offense level. In addition, the new guideline permits the consideration of prior stalking, harassing, threatening, or assaultive conduct if that conduct is directly and substantially related to the offense.</p>
<p>The new guideline also incorporates the definitions of “bodily injury” and “dangerous weapon” found in §1B1.1 (Application Instructions). The definition of bodily injury found in the guidelines differs from the definition of bodily injury in 18 U.S.C. § 2266 that is applicable to interstate stalking and interstate domestic violence offenses. The definition of “bodily injury” in 18 U.S.C. § 2266 explicitly includes sexual abuse, but the guideline definition of “bodily injury” does not. However, the Commission is fully aware that criminal sexual abuse often is part of a domestic violence offense under 18 U.S.C. §§ 2261 and 2262 and may be part of a stalking offense under 18 U.S.C. § 2261A. It is the view of the Commission that the new guideline provides an adequate mechanism for taking into account the occurrence of criminal sexual abuse in any of these offenses. This is because the guideline definition of “serious bodily injury” in §1B1.1 deems serious bodily injury -- a more serious gradient of bodily injury -- to have occurred if the offense involved conduct constituting criminal sexual abuse under 18 U.S.C. § 2241 or § 2242 or any similar offense under state law. Under the new guideline, any offense that involved criminal sexual abuse almost certainly will be subject to the cross reference to another offense guideline and to the rule deeming such conduct to be serious bodily injury (for purposes of applying a serious bodily injury enhancement in that other guideline to the offense). Therefore, in all likelihood, the sentence will be enhanced for the occurrence of criminal sexual abuse because the case will be cross referenced to another guideline that enhances for serious bodily injury.</p>
<p>Second, the amendment changes the manner in which the offenses of interstate domestic violence, 18 U.S.C. § 2261, and interstate violation of a protection order, 18 U.S.C. § 2262, are treated under the guidelines. Instead of being referenced to the guidelines that may cover underlying conduct, the amendment brings those offenses under the ambit of the new guideline, §2A6.2. This change recognizes that the aggravating factors accounted for in the new guideline often are present in these offenses as well.</p>
<p>Third, the amendment adds an enhancement to §2A2.2 (Aggravated Assault), if the offense involved the violation of a court protection order, to ensure an appropriately severe offense level for stalking, domestic violence, and other cases that are sentenced under the aggravated assault guideline and involve this factor.</p>
<p>Fourth, the amendment addresses several new harassing telecommunications offenses, 47 U.S.C. § 223(a)(1)(C)-(E), which were enacted in section 502 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, Pub. L. 104–104, 110 Stat. 56. Those offenses make it unlawful to make a telephone call or utilize a telecommunications device, whether or not conversation or communication ensues, without disclosing one’s identity and with the intent to annoy, abuse, threaten, or harass any person at the called number or who receives the communication; make or cause the telephone of another to repeatedly or continuously ring, with the intent to harass any person at the called number; or make repeated telephone calls or repeatedly initiate conversation with a telecommunications device, during which conversation or communication ensues, solely to harass any person at the called number or who receives the communication.</p>
<p>The amendment incorporates these new offenses into §2A6.1 (Threatening Communications). Recognizing that these offenses carry only a two-year maximum term of imprisonment, the amendment provides an alternative offense level of 6 (as compared to 12), if the defendant is convicted of any of these offenses and there was no threat to injure a person or property. The amendment also adds enhancements if the offense involved more than two threats or the violation of a court protection order.</p>
<p>Fifth, this amendment addresses a circuit conflict regarding the enhancement in §2A6.1 that provides a 6-level increase if the offense involved any conduct evidencing an intent to carry out a threat. Specifically, the conflict is whether or not conduct which occurred prior to the making of the threat can evidence an intent to carry out the threat. <em>Compare</em> <em>United States v. Hornick</em>, 942 F.2d 105 (2d Cir. 1991) (“a person cannot take action that will constitute proof of his intent to carry out a threat until after the threat has been made”) <em>cert</em>. <em>denied</em>, 502 U.S. 1061 (1992) <em>with</em> <em>United States v. Taylor</em>, 88 F.3d 938 (11th Cir. 1996) (“the essential inquiry for §2A6.1(b)(1) is whether the facts of the case, taken as a whole, establish a sufficiently direct connection between the defendant’s pre-threat conduct and his threat”); <em>United States v. Sullivan</em>, 75 F.3d 297 (7th Cir. 1996)(same); <em>United States v. Gary</em>, 18 F.3d 1123 (4th Cir.) (same), <em>cert</em>. <em>denied</em> 513 U.S. 844 (1994); <em>United States v. Hines</em>, 26 F.3d 1469 (9th Cir. 1994)(same).</p>
<p>The amendment essentially adopts the Eleventh Circuit’s view by adding an application note to both §§2A6.1 and 2A6.2 to provide that conduct which occurred prior to the offense shall be considered in determining specified enhancements in those guidelines if the prior conduct is substantially and directly connected to the offense.</p>

<p>&quot;Conversely, the base offense level does not reflect the possibility that the defendant may create a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury to another person in the course of fleeing from a law enforcement official (although an offense under 18 U.S.C. § 758 for fleeing or evading a law enforcement checkpoint at high speed will often, but not always, involve the creation of that risk). If the defendant creates that risk and no higher guideline adjustment is applicable for the conduct creating the risk, apply §3C1.2 (Reckless Endangerment During Flight).&quot;.</p>

<p>The Commentary to §2D1.1 captioned “Background” is amended in the second paragraph by inserting as the last sentence “Where necessary, this scheme has been modified in response to specific congressional directives to the Commission.”.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This multi-part amendment responds to the Comprehensive Methamphetamine Control Act of 1996, Pub. L. 104-237, 110 Stat. 3099, including the directives to the Commission in sections 301 and 303 of that Act. First, as directed by section 301 of the Act, the amendment increases penalties for methamphetamine trafficking offenses. This penalty increase is accomplished by reducing by one-half the quantity of a mixture or substance containing methamphetamine corresponding to each offense level in the Drug Quantity Table. This part of the amendment makes no change, however, in the quantities of methamphetamine (actual) (<em>i.e.</em>, &quot;pure&quot; methamphetamine) and &quot;Ice&quot; methamphetamine that correspond to the various offense levels. The Commission has arrived at these particular changes after careful analysis of recent sentencing data, including its own intensive study of methamphetamine offenses, information provided by the Strategic Intelligence Section of the Drug Enforcement Administration concerning recent methamphetamine trafficking levels, dosage unit size, price, and drug quantity, and a variety of other information.</p>
<p>Second, in response to the directive in section 303 of the Act, this amendment provides an enhancement of two levels, with an invited upward departure in more extreme cases, for environmental violations occurring in association with an illicit manufacturing or other drug trafficking offense.</p>
<p>Third, in response to evidence of a recent, substantial increase in the importation of methamphetamine and precursor chemicals used to manufacture methamphetamine, the amendment provides an enhancement of two levels directed at such activity. An exception to this enhancement is provided for defendants who have a mitigating role in the offense under §3B1.2 (Mitigating Role).</p>

<p>7. ‘Aggravated felony,’ as used in subsection (b)(2), means murder; any illicit trafficking in any controlled substance (as defined in 21 U.S.C. § 802), including any drug trafficking crime as defined in 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(2); any illicit trafficking in any firearms or destructive devices as defined in 18 U.S.C. § 921; any offense described in 18 U.S.C. § 1956 (relating to laundering of monetary instruments); any crime of violence (as defined in 18 U.S.C. § 16, not including a purely political offense) for which the term of imprisonment imposed (regardless of any suspension of such imprisonment) is at least five years; or any attempt or conspiracy to commit any such act. The term ‘aggravated felony’ applies to offenses described in the previous sentence whether in violation of federal or state law and also applies to offenses described in the previous sentence in violation of foreign law for which the term of imprisonment was completed within the previous 15 years. <em>See</em> 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43).&quot;.</p>

Section 321 of the Act adds to the definition of &quot;aggravated felony&quot; crimes of rape and sexual abuse of a minor, as well as any crime of violence for which the term of imprisonment is at least one year. This amendment conforms the definition of &quot;aggravated felony&quot; in the guidelines with the amended definition in the Immigration and Nationality Act.</p>

<p>&quot;For purposes of subsection (b), ‘victim’ includes any person who is a victim of the offense of conviction and any conduct for which the defendant is accountable under §1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct).&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This amendment addresses a circuit court conflict regarding whether &quot;victim of the offense&quot; in §3A1.1 (Hate Crime Motivation or Vulnerable Victim) refers only to a victim of the defendant’s offense of conviction or, more broadly, to a victim of any relevant conduct. The amendment adopts the majority appellate view, which holds that a sentencing court should consider the defendant’s relevant conduct when determining whether the vulnerable victim enhancement applies. <em>See</em>, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>United States v. Haggard</em>, 41 F.3d 1320, 1326 (9th Cir. 1994) (proper to consider harm caused to victims beyond the defendant’s offense of conviction); <em>United States v.

<p>This amendment also clarifies a possible ambiguity regarding the scope of conduct to be considered when applying the hate crime motivation enhancement in §3A1.1(a). Consistent with Congress’s intent to punish a defendant whose primary objective in committing the hate crime was to harm a member of a particular class of individuals, this amendment clarifies that the enhancement in subsection (a) is limited to victims of the defendant’s offense of conviction.</p>

The offense level for that group of closely related counts will be the offense level for the underlying offense increased by the 2-level adjustment specified by this section, or the offense level for the obstruction offense, whichever is greater.&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §3C1.1 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended by redesignating Note 7 as Note 8; and by inserting the following as new Note 7:</p>
<p>&quot;7. Where the defendant is convicted both of the obstruction offense and the underlying offense (the offense with respect to which the obstructive conduct occurred), the count for the obstruction offense will be grouped with the count for the underlying offense under subsection (c) of §3D1.2 (Groups of Closely Related Counts). The offense level for that group of closely related counts will be the offense level for the underlying offense increased by the 2-level adjustment specified by this section, or the offense level for the obstruction offense, whichever is greater.&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This amendment addresses a circuit court conflict regarding the meaning of the last sentence of Application Note 1 in §3C1.1. The issue is whether that sentence requires the use of a heightened standard of proof when the court applies an enhancement for perjury. <em>Compare</em> <em>United States v. Montague</em>, 40 F.3d 1251 (D.C. Cir. 1994) (applying the clear and convincing standard) <em>with</em> <em>United States v. Zajac</em>, 62 F.3d 145 (6th Cir.) (applying the preponderance of the evidence standard), <em>cert</em>. <em>denied</em> 116 S. Ct. 681 (1995). The amendment changes the last sentence of Application Note 1 so that it no longer suggests the use of a heightened standard of proof. Instead, it clarifies that the court should be mindful that not all inaccurate testimony or statements reflect a willful attempt to obstruct justice.</p>
<p>The amendment also (A) modifies subdivision (i) of Application Note 3 in §3C1.1 to make the language more precise; (B) in response to concerns expressed in a Seventh Circuit opinion, clarifies the meaning of the phrase &quot;absent a separate count of conviction&quot; by adding an additional sentence at the end of Application Note 4, <em>see</em> <em>United States v. Giacometti</em>, 28 F.3d 698 (7th Cir. 1994); and (C) clarifies that the guidance in the last two sentences of Application Note 6 applies to a broader set of cases than the cases described in the first two sentences of Application Note 6.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Commentary to §4B1.1 captioned &quot;Background&quot; is amended by deleting:</p>
<p>&quot;The legislative history of this provision suggests that the phrase ‘maximum term authorized’ should be construed as the maximum term authorized by statute. <em>See</em> S. Rep. No. 225, 98th Cong., 1st Sess. 175 (1983); 128 Cong. Rec. 26,511-12 (1982) (text of ‘Career Criminals’ amendment by Senator Kennedy); <em>id.</em> at 26,515 (brief summary of amendment); <em>id.</em> at 26,517-18 (statement of Senator Kennedy).&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This amendment responds to <em>United States v. LaBonte</em>, 520 U.S. 751. In <em>LaBonte</em>, the Supreme Court held that the way in which the Commission defined &quot;maximum term authorized&quot;, for purposes of fulfilling the requirement under 28 U.S.C. § 994(h) to specify sentences for certain categories of career offenders at or near the maximum term authorized for those offenders, is inconsistent with § 994(h)’s plain and unambiguous language and is therefore invalid. The Commission defined &quot;maximum term authorized&quot; to mean the maximum term authorized for the offense of conviction not including any sentencing enhancement provisions that apply because of the defendant’s prior criminal record. The Supreme Court held that under § 994’s plain and unambiguous language, &quot;maximum term authorized&quot; must be read to include all applicable statutory sentencing enhancements. The proposed amendment makes a straightforward change to the commentary to §4B1.1, the career offender guideline, to reflect the <em>LaBonte</em> decision. Specifically, the definition of &quot;maximum term authorized&quot; is proposed to be changed to reflect that the &quot;maximum term authorized&quot; includes all sentencing enhancements that apply because of the defendant’s prior criminal record.</p>

<p>and by inserting at the end the following new paragraphs:</p>
<p>&quot;‘Crime of violence’ includes murder, manslaughter, kidnapping, aggravated assault, forcible sex offenses, robbery, arson, extortion, extortionate extension of credit, and burglary of a dwelling. Other offenses are included as ‘crimes of violence’ if (A) that offense has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another, or (B) the conduct set forth (<em>i.e.</em>, expressly charged) in the count of which the defendant was convicted involved use of explosives (including any explosive material or destructive device) or, by its nature, presented a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.</p>
<p>‘Crime of violence’ does not include the offense of unlawful possession of a firearm by a felon. Where the instant offense of conviction is the unlawful possession of a firearm by a felon, §2K2.1 (Unlawful Receipt, Possession, or Transportation of Firearms or Ammunition; Prohibited Transactions Involving Firearms or Ammunition) provides an increase in offense level if the defendant had one or more prior felony convictions for a crime of violence or controlled substance offense; and, if the defendant is sentenced under the provisions of 18 U.S.C. § 924(e), §4B1.4 (Armed Career Criminal) will apply.</p>
<p>Unlawfully possessing a listed chemical with intent to manufacture a controlled substance (21 U.S.C. § 841(d)(1)) is a ‘controlled substance offense.’</p>
<p>Unlawfully possessing a prohibited flask or equipment with intent to manufacture a controlled substance (21 U.S.C. § 843(a)(6)) is a ‘controlled substance offense.’</p>
<p>Maintaining any place for the purpose of facilitating a drug offense (21 U.S.C. § 856) is a ‘controlled substance offense’ if the offense of conviction established that the underlying offense (the offense facilitated) was a ‘controlled substance offense.’</p>
<p>Using a communications facility in committing, causing, or facilitating a drug offense (21 U.S.C. § 843(b)) is a ‘controlled substance offense’ if the offense of conviction established that the underlying offense (the offense committed, caused, or facilitated) was a ‘controlled substance offense.’</p>
<p>Possessing a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence or drug offense (18 U.S.C. § 924(c)) is a ‘crime of violence’ or ‘controlled substance offense’ if the offense of conviction established that the underlying offense (the offense during and in relation to which the firearm was carried or possessed) was a ‘crime of violence’ or ‘controlled substance offense.’ (Note that if the defendant also was convicted of the underlying offense, the two convictions will be treated as related cases under §4A1.2 (Definitions and Instruction for Computing Criminal History)).</p>
<p>‘Prior felony conviction’ means a prior adult federal or state conviction for an offense punishable by death or imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, regardless of whether such offense is specifically designated as a felony and regardless of the actual sentence imposed. A conviction for an offense committed at age eighteen or older is an adult conviction. A conviction for an offense committed prior to age eighteen is an adult conviction if it is classified as an adult conviction under the laws of the jurisdiction in which the defendant was convicted (<em>e.g.</em>, a federal conviction for an offense committed prior to the defendant’s eighteenth birthday is an adult conviction if the defendant was expressly proceeded against as an adult).&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §4B1.2 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended by deleting Notes 2 and 3 as follows:</p>
<p>&quot;2. ‘Crime of violence’ includes murder, manslaughter, kidnapping, aggravated assault, forcible sex offenses, robbery, arson, extortion, extortionate extension of credit, and burglary of a dwelling. Other offenses are included where (A) that offense has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another, or (B) the conduct set forth (<em>i.e.</em>, expressly charged) in the count of which the defendant was convicted involved use of explosives (including any explosive material or destructive device) or, by its nature, presented a serious potential risk of physical injury to another. Under this section, the conduct of which the defendant was convicted is the focus of inquiry.</p>
<p>The term ‘crime of violence’ does not include the offense of unlawful possession of a firearm by a felon. Where the instant offense of conviction is the unlawful possession of a firearm by a felon, §2K2.1 (Unlawful Receipt, Possession, or Transportation of Firearms or Ammunition; Prohibited Transactions Involving Firearms or Ammunition) provides an increase in offense level if the defendant has one or more prior felony convictions for a crime of violence or controlled substance offense; and, if the defendant is sentenced under the provisions of 18 U.S.C. § 924(e), §4B1.4 (Armed Career Criminal) will apply.</p>
<p>3. ‘Prior felony conviction’ means a prior adult federal or state conviction for an offense punishable by death or imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, regardless of whether such offense is specifically designated as a felony and regardless of the actual sentence imposed. A conviction for an offense committed at age eighteen or older is an adult conviction. A conviction for an offense committed prior to age eighteen is an adult conviction if it is classified as an adult conviction under the laws of the jurisdiction in which the defendant was convicted (<em>e.g.</em>, a federal conviction for an offense committed prior to the defendant’s eighteenth birthday is an adult conviction if the defendant was expressly proceeded against as an adult).&quot;;</p>
<p>and by inserting after Note 1 the following new Note 2:</p>
<p>&quot;2. Section 4B1.1 (Career Offender) expressly provides that the instant and prior offenses must be crimes of violence or controlled substance offenses of which the defendant was convicted. Therefore, in determining whether an offense is a crime of violence or controlled substance for the purposes of §4B1.1 (Career Offender), the offense of conviction (<em>i.e.</em>, the conduct of which the defendant was convicted) is the focus of inquiry.&quot;.</p>

<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This amendment addresses a circuit court conflict regarding whether the offenses of possessing a listed chemical with intent to manufacture a controlled substance or possessing a prohibited flask or equipment with intent to manufacture a controlled substance are &quot;controlled substance offenses&quot; under the career offender guideline. <em>Compare</em> <em>United States v. Calverley</em>, 11 F.3d 505 (5th Cir. 1993) (possession of a listed chemical with intent to manufacture a controlled substance is a controlled substance offense under §4B1.2) <em>with</em> <em>United States v. Wagner</em>, 994 F.2d 1467, 1475 (10th Cir. 1993) (possession of a listed chemical with intent to manufacture a controlled substance is not a controlled substance offense). This amendment makes each of these offenses a &quot;controlled substance offense&quot; under the career offender guideline. This decision is based on the Commission’s view that there is such a close connection between possession of a listed chemical or prohibited flask or equipment with intent to manufacture a controlled substance and actually manufacturing a controlled substance that the former offenses are fairly considered as controlled substance trafficking offenses.</p>
<p>The amendment also clarifies that certain other offenses are &quot;crimes of violence&quot; or &quot;controlled substance offenses&quot; if the offense of conviction established that the underlying offense was a &quot;crime of violence&quot; or &quot;controlled substance offense.&quot; <em>See</em> <em>United States v. Baker</em>, 16 F.3d 854 (8th Cir. 1994); <em>United States v. Vea-Gonzalez</em>, 999 F.2d 1326 (9th Cir. 1993), <em>effectively overruled on other grounds by</em> <em>Custis v. United States</em>, 114 S.Ct. 1732 (1994). Additionally, the amendment makes the following nonsubstantive changes to §4B1.2 to improve the internal consistency of the guidelines: (A) adding the phrase &quot;punishable by a term of imprisonment of more than one year, that prohibits&quot; in subsection (2) to make it consistent with subsection (1); and (B) conforming the second paragraph of Application Note 2 of §4B1.2 to the language of §§2K1.3 and 2K2.1.</p>

<p>(b) The following ‘special’ conditions of probation and supervised release (14-24) are either recommended or required by law under the circumstances described, or may be appropriate in a particular case:</p>
<p>(14) <em>Possession of Weapons</em></p>
<p>If the instant conviction is for a felony, or if the defendant was previously convicted of a felony or used a firearm or other dangerous weapon in the course of the instant offense, it is recommended that the court impose a condition prohibiting the defendant from possessing a firearm or other dangerous weapon.</p>
<p>(15) <em>Restitution</em></p>
<p>If the court imposes an order of restitution, it is recommended that the court impose a condition requiring the defendant to make payment of restitution or adhere to a court ordered installment schedule for payment of restitution. <em>See</em> §5E1.1 (Restitution).</p>
<p>(16) <em>Fines</em></p>
<p>If the court imposes a fine, it is recommended that the court impose a condition requiring the defendant to pay the fine or adhere to a court ordered installment schedule for payment of the fine.</p>
<p>(17) <em>Debt Obligations</em></p>
<p>If an installment schedule of payment of restitution or fines is imposed, it is recommended that the court impose a condition prohibiting the defendant from incurring new credit charges or opening additional lines of credit without approval of the probation officer unless the defendant is in compliance with the payment schedule.</p>
<p>(18) <em>Access to Financial Information</em></p>
<p>If the court imposes an order of restitution, forfeiture, or notice to victims, or orders the defendant to pay a fine, it is recommended that the court impose a condition requiring the defendant to provide the probation officer access to any requested financial information.</p>
<p>(19) <em>Community Confinement</em></p>

<p>(24) <em>Mental Health Program Participation</em></p>
<p>If the court has reason to believe that the defendant is in need of psychological or psychiatric treatment, it is recommended that the court impose a condition requiring that the defendant participate in a mental health program approved by the United States Probation Office.</p>
<p>(25) <em>Curfew</em></p>
<p>If the court concludes that restricting the defendant to his place of residence during evening and nighttime hours is necessary to provide just punishment for the offense, to protect the public from crimes that the defendant might commit during those hours, or to assist in the rehabilitation of the defendant, a condition of curfew is recommended. Electronic monitoring may be used as a means of surveillance to ensure compliance with a curfew order.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Commentary</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Application Note</em>:</p>
<p>1. Home detention, as defined by §5F1.2, may only be used as a substitute for imprisonment. <em>See</em> §5C1.1 (Imposition of a Term of Imprisonment). Under home detention, the defendant, with specified exceptions, is restricted to his place of residence during all non-working hours. Curfew, which limits the defendant to his place of residence during evening and nighttime hours, is less restrictive than home detention and may be imposed as a condition of probation whether or not imprisonment could have been ordered.&quot;.</p>

<p><em>Commentary</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Background</em>: This section applies to conditions of supervised release. The conditions generally recommended for supervised release are those recommended for probation. See §5B1.4. A broader form of the condition required under 18 U.S.C. § 3563(a)(3) (pertaining to possession of controlled substances) is set forth as recommended condition (7) at §5B1.4 (Recommended Conditions of Probation and Supervised Release).&quot;.</p>

<p>The Commentary to §2X5.1 captioned &quot;Application Note&quot; is amended in Note 1 by deleting: &quot;§5B1.4 (Recommended Conditions of Probation and Supervised Release);&quot;.</p>
<p>Section 5H1.3 is amended by deleting &quot;recommended condition (24) at §5B1.4 (Recommended Conditions of Probation and Supervised Release)&quot; and inserting in lieu thereof &quot;§§5B1.3(d)(5) and 5D1.3(d)(5)&quot;.</p>
<p>Section 5H1.4 is amended in the second paragraph by deleting &quot;recommended condition (23) at §5B1.4 (Recommended Conditions of Probation and Supervised Release)&quot; and inserting in lieu thereof &quot;§5D1.3(d)(4)&quot;; and in the third paragraph by deleting &quot;recommended condition (23) at §5B1.4 (Recommended Conditions of Probation and Supervised Release)&quot; and inserting in lieu thereof &quot;§5B1.3(d)(4)&quot;.</p>
<p>Section 8D1.3(a) is amended by deleting &quot;shall&quot; immediately after &quot;organization&quot;.</p>
<p>Section 8D1.3(b) is amended by deleting &quot;a fine, restitution, or community service,&quot; and inserting in lieu thereof &quot;(1) restitution, (2) notice to victims of the offense pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3555, or (3) an order requiring the organization to reside, or refrain from residing, in a specified place or area,&quot;;</p>
<p>and by adding at the end:</p>
<p>&quot;<em>Note</em>: Section 3563(a)(2) of Title 18, United States Code, provides that, absent unusual circumstances, a defendant convicted of a felony shall abide by at least one of the conditions set forth in 18 U.S.C. § 3563(b)(2), (b)(3), and (b)(13). Before the enactment of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, those conditions were a fine ((b)(2)), an order of restitution ((b)(3)), and community service ((b)(13)). Whether or not the change was intended, the Act deleted the fine condition and renumbered the restitution and community service conditions in 18 U.S.C. § 3563(b), but failed to make a corresponding change in the referenced paragraphs under 18 U.S.C. § 3563(a)(2). Accordingly, the conditions now referenced are restitution ((b)(2)), notice to victims pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3555 ((b)(3)), and an order that the defendant reside, or refrain from residing, in a specified place or area ((b)(13)).&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> The purposes of this amendment are twofold. First, the amendment revises the pertinent guidelines to reflect statutorily required conditions of probation and supervised release added by Section 203 of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, Pub. L. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1227, and other laws. Second, the amendment revises §§5B1.3 (Conditions of Probation), 5B1.4 (Recommended Conditions of Probation and Supervised Release), and 5D1.3 (Conditions of Supervised Release) so as to better distinguish among the statutorily required, standard, and special conditions of probation and supervised release. Section 5B1.4 has been eliminated. Provisions of §5B1.4 relating to recommended conditions of probation have been incorporated into §5B1.3, and provisions of §5B1.4 relating to recommended conditions of supervised release have been incorporated into §5D1.3.</p>

A defendant who qualifies under §5C1.2 (Applicability of Statutory Minimum Sentence in Certain Cases) is not subject to any statutory minimum sentence of supervised release. <em>See</em> 18 U.S.C. § 3553(f). In such a case, the term of supervised release shall be determined under subsection (a).</p>
<p>2. Upon motion of the Government, a defendant who has provided substantial assistance in the investigation or prosecution of another person who has committed an offense may be sentenced to a term of supervised release that is less than any minimum required by statute or the guidelines. <em>See</em> 18 U.S.C. § 3553(e), §5K1.1 (Substantial Assistance to Authorities).&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §5C1.2 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended by inserting after Note 8 the following additional note:</p>
<p>&quot;9. A defendant who meets the criteria under this section is exempt from any otherwise applicable statutory minimum sentence of imprisonment and statutory minimum term of supervised release.&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This amendment amends §5D1.2 (Term of Supervised Release) to make clear that a defendant who qualifies under the &quot;safety valve&quot; (§5C1.2, 18 U.S.C. § 3553(f)), or who is the beneficiary of a Government substantial assistance motion under 18 U.S.C. § 3553(e), is not subject to any statutory minimum term of supervised release. This issue has arisen in a number of hotline calls. This amendment also clarifies that the requirement in subsection (a), with respect to the length of a term of supervised release, is subject to the requirement in subsection (b) that the term be not less than any statutorily required term of supervised release.</p>

<p><em>Commentary</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Application Note</em>:</p>
<p>1. In the case of a conviction under certain statutes, additional requirements regarding restitution apply. <em>See</em> 18 U.S.C. §§ 2248 and 2259 (applying to convictions under 18 U.S.C. §§ 2241-2258 for sexual-abuse offenses and sexual exploitation of minors); 18 U.S.C. § 2327 (applying to convictions under 18 U.S.C. §§ 1028-1029, 1341-1344 for telemarketing-fraud offenses); 18 U.S.C. § 2264 (applying to convictions under 18 U.S.C. §§ 2261-2262 for domestic-violence offenses). To the extent that any of the above-noted statutory provisions conflict with the provisions of this guideline, the applicable statutory provision shall control.</p>
<p><em>Background</em>: Section 3553(a)(7) of Title 18 requires the court, ‘in determining the particular sentence to be imposed,’ to consider ‘the need to provide restitution to any victims of the offense.’ Section 3556 of Title 18 authorizes the court to impose restitution in accordance with 18 U.S.C. §§ 3663 and 3664, which authorize restitution for violations of Title 18 or 49 U.S.C. § 46312, § 46502, or § 46504. For other offenses, restitution may be imposed as a condition of probation or supervised release. <em>See</em> 18 U.S.C. § 3563(b)(3) <em>as amended by</em> Section 7110 of Pub. L. No. 100-690 (1988).</p>
<p>A court’s authority to decline to order restitution is limited. Subsection (a)(1) of this guideline requires the court to order restitution for offenses under Title 18, United States Code, or 49 U.S.C. § 46312, § 46502, or § 46504, unless full restitution has already been made or ‘the court determines that the complication and prolongation of the sentencing process resulting from the fashioning of an order of restitution . . . outweighs the need to provide restitution to any victims.’ 18 U.S.C. § 3663(d). The legislative history of 18 U.S.C. § 3579, the precursor of 18 U.S.C. § 3663, states that even ‘[i]n those unusual cases where the precise amount owed is difficult to determine, the section authorizes the court to reach an expeditious, reasonable determination of appropriate restitution by resolving uncertainties with a view toward achieving fairness to the victim.’ S. Rep. No. 532, 97th Cong., 2d Sess. 31, reprinted in 1982 U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Ad. News 2515, 2537. If the court does not order restitution, or orders only partial restitution, it must state its reasons for doing so. 18 U.S.C. § 3553(c). Subsection (a)(2) provides for restitution as a condition of probation or supervised release for offenses not set forth in Title 18, United States Code, or 49 U.S.C. § 46312, § 46502, or § 46504.</p>
<p>In determining whether to impose an order of restitution, and the amount of restitution, the court shall consider the amount of loss the victim suffered as a result of the offense, the financial resources of the defendant, the financial needs of the defendant and his dependents, and other factors the court deems appropriate. 18 U.S.C. § 3664(a).</p>
<p>Pursuant to Rule 32(b)(4)(D), Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the probation officer’s presentence investigation report must contain a victim impact statement. That report must contain information about the financial impact on the victim and the defendant’s financial condition. The sentencing judge may base findings on the presentence report or other testimony or evidence supported by a preponderance of the evidence. 18 U.S.C. § 3664(d).</p>
<p>Unless the court orders otherwise, restitution must be made immediately. 18 U.S.C. § 3663(f)(3). The court may permit the defendant to make restitution within a specified period or in specified installments, provided that the last installment is paid not later than the expiration of probation, five years after the end of the defendant’s term of imprisonment, or in any other case five years after the date of sentencing. 18 U.S.C. § 3663(f)(1) and (2). The restitution order should specify the manner in which, and the persons to whom, payment is to be made.&quot;.</p>

<p>Chapter Eight, Part B, Subpart 1 is amended by deleting §8B1.1 in its entirety as follows:</p>

<p>(a) The court shall --</p>

<p>(2) if a restitution order would be authorized under 18 U.S.C. §§ 3663-3664, except for the fact that the offense of conviction is not an offense set forth in Title 18, United States Code, or 49 U.S.C. § 1472(h), (i), (j), or (n), sentence the organization to probation with a condition requiring restitution.</p>
<p>(b) <em>Provided</em>, that the provisions of subsection (a) do not apply when the organization has made full restitution, or to the extent the court determines that the complication and prolongation of the sentencing process resulting from the fashioning of a restitution requirement outweighs the need to provide restitution to any victims through the criminal process.</p>

<p><em>Commentary</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Background</em>: This guideline provides for restitution either as a sentence under 18 U.S.C. §§ 3663-3664 or as a condition of probation.&quot;.</p>
<p>A replacement guideline with accompanying commentary is inserted as §8B1.1 (Restitution - Organizations).</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This amendment conforms the provisions of §§5E1.1 and 8B1.1 to section 204 of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, Pub. L. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1227, which includes procedures for payment of full restitution to a victim of the offense. The amendment also implements the directive to the Commission in section 205 of the Act to issue guidelines to assist courts in determining an appropriate amount of &quot;community restitution&quot; when the defendant is convicted of certain drug offenses and there is no identifiable victim of the offense. As a starting point, the Commission has elected to issue a guideline that permits broad court discretion to determine an amount of community restitution not exceeding the fine imposed. Over time, the Commission intends to evaluate and refine this guideline in light of sentencing experience.</p>

<p>Section 5E1.2(c)(1) is amended by inserting &quot;guideline&quot; after &quot;fine&quot;.</p>
<p>Section 5E1.2(c)(2) is amended by inserting &quot;guideline&quot; after &quot;fine&quot;.</p>

<p>&quot;(7) the expected costs to the government of any term of probation, or term of imprisonment and term of supervised release imposed; and&quot;.</p>
<p>Section 5E1.2 is amended by deleting &quot;(e)&quot;; by redesignating subsections (f), (g), and (h) as subsections (e), (f), and (g) respectively; and by deleting:</p>
<p>&quot;(i) Notwithstanding of the provisions of subsection (c) of this section, but subject to the provisions of subsection (f) herein, the court shall impose an additional fine amount that is at least sufficient to pay the costs to the government of any imprisonment, probation, or supervised release ordered.&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §5E1.2 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended in Note 6 by deleting &quot;§5E1.2&quot; and inserting in lieu thereof &quot;this section&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §5E1.2 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended in Note 7 by deleting:</p>
<p>&quot;Subsection (i) provides for an additional fine sufficient to pay the costs of any imprisonment, probation, or supervised release ordered, subject to the defendant’s ability to pay as prescribed in subsection (f). In making a determination as to the amount of any fine to be imposed under this provision,&quot;</p>
<p>and inserting in lieu thereof &quot;In considering subsection (d)(7),&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This amendment indirectly addresses a circuit court conflict regarding whether a court may impose a fine for costs of imprisonment and/or supervision when it has not imposed any punitive fine. <em>Compare</em>, <em>United States v. Labat</em>, 915 F.2d 603 (10th Cir. 1990)(requiring imposition of punitive fine before costs of imprisonment fine can be imposed) <em>with</em> <em>United States v. Sellers</em>, 42 F.3d 116 (2d Cir. 1994)(not requiring imposition of punitive fine before ordering costs of imprisonment fine), <em>cert</em>. <em>denied</em>, 116 S.Ct. 93 (1995).</p>
<p>Recognizing that a fine for costs of imprisonment and/or supervision is not statutorily required and rarely is imposed, the Commission has elected to dispense with the requirement that courts determine a separate, additional fine for such costs. Instead, the amendment provides that the court shall take such costs into consideration in determining the appropriate amount of a punitive fine.</p>
<p>Because, under the amended procedure, it no longer will be necessary to determine a separate fine increment for costs associated with implementing the sentence, the issue on which the circuit courts have differed should not arise. This procedure also should substantially simplify fine calculations, thereby allowing court and probation officer resources to be used more efficiently and productively.</p>

<p>and inserting the following:</p>
<p>&quot;(1) If the offense involved sophisticated concealment, increase by 2 levels.&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §2T3.1 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended by adding at the end the following new note:</p>
<p>&quot;3. For purposes of subsection (b)(1), ‘sophisticated concealment’ means especially complex or especially intricate offense conduct in which deliberate steps are taken to make the offense, or its extent, difficult to detect. Conduct such as hiding assets or transactions, or both, through the use of fictitious entities, corporate shells, or offshore bank accounts ordinarily indicates sophisticated concealment.&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This amendment has three purposes: (1) to provide an increase for fraud offenses that use mass-marketing to carry out the fraud; (2) to provide an increase for fraud offenses that involve conduct, such as sophisticated concealment, that makes it difficult for law enforcement authorities to discover the offense or apprehend the offender; and (3) to clarify and conform an existing enhancement that provides an increase for tax offenses that similarly involve sophisticated concealment.</p>
<p>First, this amendment adds a two-level enhancement in the fraud guideline for offenses that are committed through mass-marketing. The Commission identified mass-marketing as a central component of telemarketing fraud and also determined that there were other fraudulent schemes that relied on mass-marketing to perpetrate the offense (for example, Internet fraud). Accordingly, rather than provide a limited enhancement for telemarketing fraud only, the Commission determined that a generally applicable specific offense characteristic in the fraud guideline would better provide consistent and proportionate sentencing increases for similar types of fraud, while also ensuring increased sentences for persons who engage in mass-marketed telemarketing fraud.</p>
<p>Second, this amendment provides an increase for fraud offenses that involve conduct, such as sophisticated concealment, that makes it difficult for law enforcement authorities to discover the offense or apprehend the offenders. The new enhancement provides a two-level increase and a &quot;floor&quot; offense level of level 12 in the fraud guideline and replaces the current enhancement for &quot;the use of foreign bank accounts or transactions to conceal the true nature or extent of fraudulent conduct.&quot; There are three alternative provisions to the enhancement. The first two prongs address conduct that the Commission has been informed often relates to telemarketing fraud, although the conduct also may occur in connection with fraudulent schemes perpetrated by other means. Specifically, the Commission has been informed that fraudulent telemarketers increasingly are conducting their operations from Canada and other locations outside the United States. Additionally, testimony offered at a Commission hearing on telemarketing fraud indicated that telemarketers often relocate their schemes to other jurisdictions once they know or suspect that enforcement authorities have discovered the scheme. Both types of conduct are specifically covered by the new enhancement. The third prong provides an increase if any offense covered by the fraud guideline otherwise involves sophisticated concealment. This prong addresses cases in which deliberate steps are taken to make the offense, or its extent, difficult to detect.</p>
<p>Third, this amendment provides a two-level enhancement for conduct related to sophisticated concealment of a tax offense. The primary purpose of this amendment is to conform the language of the current enhancement for “sophisticated means” in the tax guidelines to the essentially equivalent language of the new sophisticated concealment enhancement provided in the fraud guideline. Additionally, the amendment resolves a circuit conflict regarding whether the enhancement applies based on the personal conduct of the defendant or the overall offense conduct for which the defendant is accountable. Consistent with the usual relevant conduct rules, application of this new enhancement for sophisticated concealment accordingly is based on the overall offense conduct for which the defendant is accountable.</p>

<p>The Commentary to §2K2.1 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended in Note 12 in the first paragraph by striking &quot;924(j) or (k), or 26 U.S.C. § 5861(g) or (h)&quot; and inserting &quot;924 (l) or (m)&quot;; and in the second paragraph by striking &quot;only&quot; after &quot;if the&quot;; and by inserting &quot;or 26 U.S.C. § 5861(g) or (h)&quot; after &quot;922(k)&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This amendment has three purposes: (1) to change the definition of &quot;prohibited person&quot; in the firearms guideline so that it includes a person convicted of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence; (2) to provide the same base offense levels for both a prohibited person and a person who is convicted under 18 U.S.C. § 922(d) of transferring a firearm to a prohibited person; and (3) to make several technical and conforming changes to the firearms guideline.</p>
<p>The first part of the amendment amends Application Note 6 of §2K2.1 (Unlawful Receipt, Possession, or Transportation of Firearms or Ammunition; Prohibited Transactions Involving Firearms or Ammunition) to include a person convicted of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence within the scope of &quot;prohibited person&quot; for purposes of that guideline. It also defines &quot;misdemeanor crime of domestic violence&quot; by reference to the new statutory definition of that term in 18 U.S.C. § 921(a).</p>
<p>This part of the amendment addresses section 658 of the Treasury, Postal Service, and General Government Appropriations Act, Pub. L. 104–208, 110 Stat. 3009 (1996) (contained in the Omnibus Consolidated Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 1997). Section 658 amended 18 U.S.C. § 922(d) to prohibit the sale of a firearm or ammunition to a person who has been convicted in any court of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence. It also amended 18 U.S.C. § 922(g) to prohibit a person who has been convicted in any court of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence from transporting or receiving a firearm or ammunition. Section 922(s)(3)(B)(i), which lists the information a person not licensed under 18 U.S.C. § 923 must include in a statement to the handgun importer, manufacturer, or dealer, was amended to require certification that the person to whom the gun is transferred was not convicted in any court of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence. Section 658 also amended 18 U.S.C. § 921(a) to define &quot;misdemeanor crime of domestic violence&quot;.</p>
<p>Violations of 18 U.S.C. § 922(d) and (g) are covered by §2K2.1. The new provisions at § 922(d) (sale of a firearm to a &quot;prohibited person&quot;) and § 922(g) (transporting, possession, and receipt of a firearm by a &quot;prohibited person&quot;) affect Application Note 6 of §2K2.1, which defines &quot;prohibited person&quot;. This part of the amendment conforms Application Note 6 of §2K2.1 to the new statutory provisions.</p>
<p>The second part of this amendment increases the base offense level for a defendant who is convicted under 18 U.S.C. § 922(d), which prohibits the transfer of a firearm to a prohibited person. Specifically, this part amends the two alternative base offense levels that pertain to prohibited persons in the firearms guideline in order to make those offense levels applicable to the person who transfers the firearm to the prohibited person. A person who is convicted under 18 U.S.C. § 922(d) has been shown beyond a reasonable doubt either to have known, or to have had reasonable cause to believe, that the transferee was a prohibited person.</p>
<p>The third part of this amendment makes two technical and conforming changes in Application Note 12 of §2K2.1. First, the amendment corrects statutory references to 18 U.S.C. § 924(j) and (k), which were added as a result of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, Pub. L. 103–322, 108 Stat. 1796 (1994). In the Economic Espionage Act of 1996, Pub. L. 104–294, 110 Stat. 3488 (1996), Congress again amended 18 U.S.C. § 924 and redesignated the provisions as subsections (l) and (m). The amendment conforms Application Note 12 to that redesignation. Second, the amendment corrects the misplacement of the reference to 26 U.S.C. § 5861(g) and (h).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Otherwise, in the case of a conviction on both the underlying offense and the failure to appear, the failure to appear is treated under §3C1.1 (Obstructing or Impeding the Administration of Justice) as an obstruction of the underlying offense; and the failure to appear count and the count(s) for the underlying offense are grouped together under §3D1.2(c). Note that although 18 U.S.C. § 3146(b)(2) does not require a sentence of imprisonment on a failure to appear count, it does require that any sentence of imprisonment on a failure to appear count be imposed consecutively to any other sentence of imprisonment. Therefore, in such cases, the combined sentence must be constructed to provide a ‘total punishment’ that satisfies the requirements both of §5G1.2 (Sentencing on Multiple Counts of Conviction) and 18 U.S.C. § 3146(b)(2). For example, where the combined applicable guideline range for both counts is 30-37 months and the court determines a ‘total punishment’ of 36 months is appropriate, a sentence of thirty months for the underlying offense plus a consecutive six months sentence for the failure to appear count would satisfy these requirements.&quot;,</p>
<p>and inserting the following as the new second paragraph:</p>
<p>&quot;In the case of a conviction on both the underlying offense and the failure to appear, the failure to appear is treated under §3C1.1 (Obstructing or Impeding the Administration of Justice) as an obstruction of the underlying offense, and the failure to appear count and the count or counts for the underlying offense are grouped together under §3D1.2(c). (Note that 18 U.S.C. § 3146(b)(2) does not require a sentence of imprisonment on a failure to appear count, although if a sentence of imprisonment on the failure to appear count is imposed, the statute requires that the sentence be imposed to run consecutively to any other sentence of imprisonment. Therefore, unlike a count in which the statute mandates both a minimum and a consecutive sentence of imprisonment, the grouping rules of §§3D1.1-3D1.5 apply. <em>See</em> §3D1.1(b), comment. (n.1), and §3D1.2, comment. (n.1).) The combined sentence will then be constructed to provide a ‘total punishment’ that satisfies the requirements both of §5G1.2 (Sentencing on Multiple Counts of Conviction) and 18 U.S.C. § 3146(b)(2). For example, if the combined applicable guideline range for both counts is 30-37 months and the court determines that a ‘total punishment’ of 36 months is appropriate, a sentence of 30 months for the underlying offense plus a consecutive six months’ sentence for the failure to appear count would satisfy these requirements. (Note that the combination of this instruction and increasing the offense level for the obstructive, failure to appear conduct has the effect of ensuring an incremental, consecutive punishment for the failure to appear count, as required by 18 U.S.C. § 3146(b)(2).)&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §2J1.6 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended by redesignating Note 4 as Note 5; and by inserting the following as new Note 4:</p>
<p>&quot;4. If a defendant is convicted of both the underlying offense and the failure to appear count, and the defendant committed additional acts of obstructive behavior (<em>e.g.</em>, perjury) during the investigation, prosecution, or sentencing of the instant offense, an upward departure may be warranted. The upward departure will ensure an enhanced sentence for obstructive conduct for which no adjustment under §3C1.1 (Obstruction of Justice) is made because of the operation of the rules set out in Application Note 3.&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §2P1.2 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended in Note 2 by striking &quot; <em>as amended</em>,&quot; after &quot;18 U.S.C. § 1791(c),&quot;; and by inserting &quot;by the inmate&quot; after &quot;served&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §2P1.2 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended in Note 2 by inserting before the first paragraph the following:</p>
<p>&quot;In a case in which the defendant is convicted of the underlying offense and an offense involving providing or possessing a controlled substance in prison, group the offenses together under §3D1.2(c). (Note that 18 U.S.C. § 1791(b) does not require a sentence of imprisonment, although if a sentence of imprisonment is imposed on a count involving providing or possessing a controlled substance in prison, section 1791(c) requires that the sentence be imposed to run consecutively to any other sentence of imprisonment for the controlled substance. Therefore, unlike a count in which the statute mandates both a minimum and a consecutive sentence of imprisonment, the grouping rules of §§3D1.1-3D1.5 apply. <em>See</em> §3D1.1(b), comment. (n.1), and §3D1.2, comment. (n.1).) The combined sentence will then be constructed to provide a ‘total punishment’ that satisfies the requirements both of §5G1.2 (Sentencing on Multiple Counts of Conviction) and 18 U.S.C. § 1791(c). For example, if the combined applicable guideline range for both counts is 30-37 months and the court determines a ‘total punishment’ of 36 months is appropriate, a sentence of 30 months for the underlying offense plus a consecutive six months’ sentence for the providing or possessing a controlled substance in prison count would satisfy these requirements.&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §3C1.1 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended in Note 6 by striking &quot;Where&quot; and inserting &quot;If&quot;; and by striking &quot;where&quot; both places it appears and inserting &quot;if&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §3C1.1 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended in Note 7 in the first sentence by striking &quot;Where&quot; and inserting &quot;If&quot;; by striking &quot;both of the&quot; and inserting &quot;both of an&quot;; by inserting &quot;<em>(e.g.</em>, 18 U.S.C. § 3146 (Penalty for failure to appear); 18 U.S.C. § 1621 (Perjury generally))&quot; after &quot;obstruction offense&quot; the first place it appears; and by striking &quot;the underlying&quot; the first place it appears and inserting &quot;an underlying&quot;.</p>
<p>Section 3D1.1(b) is amended by striking the first sentence in its entirety as follows:</p>
<p>&quot;Any count for which the statute mandates imposition of a consecutive sentence is excluded from the operation of §§3D1.2-3D1.5.&quot;,</p>
<p>and inserting the following:</p>
<p>&quot;Exclude from the application of §§3D1.2-3D1.5 any count for which the statute (1) specifies a term of imprisonment to be imposed; and (2) requires that such term of imprisonment be imposed to run consecutively to any other term of imprisonment.&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §3D1.1 captioned &quot;Application Note&quot; is amended by striking Note 1 in its entirety as follows:</p>
<p>&quot;1. Counts for which a statute mandates imposition of a consecutive sentence are excepted from application of the multiple count rules. Convictions on such counts are not used in the determination of a combined offense level under this Part, but may affect the offense level for other counts. A conviction for 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) (use of firearm in commission of a crime of violence) provides a common example. In the case of a conviction under</p>
<p>18 U.S.C. § 924(c), the specific offense characteristic for weapon use in the primary offense is to be disregarded to avoid double counting. <em>See</em> Commentary to §2K2.4 (Use of Firearm, Armor-Piercing Ammunition, or Explosive During or in Relation to Certain Crimes). <em>Example</em>: The defendant is convicted of one count of bank robbery (18 U.S.C. § 2113), and one count of use of a firearm in the commission of a crime of violence (18 U.S.C. § 924(c)). The two counts are not grouped together, and the offense level for the bank robbery count is computed without application of an enhancement for weapon possession or use. The mandatory five-year sentence on the weapon-use count runs consecutively, as required by law. <em>See</em> §5G1.2(a).&quot;,</p>
<p>and inserting the following:</p>
<p>&quot;1. Subsection (b) applies if a statute (A) specifies a term of imprisonment to be imposed; and (B) requires that such term of imprisonment be imposed to run consecutively to any other term of imprisonment. <em>See</em>, <em>e.g.</em>, 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) (requiring mandatory term of five years to run consecutively). The multiple count rules set out under this Part do not apply to a count of conviction covered by subsection (b). However, a count covered by subsection (b) may affect the offense level determination for other counts. For example, a defendant is convicted of one count of bank robbery (18 U.S.C. § 2113), and one count of use of a firearm in the commission of a crime of violence (18 U.S.C. § 924(c)). The two counts are not grouped together pursuant to this guideline, and, to avoid unwarranted double counting, the offense level for the bank robbery count under §2B3.1 (Robbery) is computed without application of the enhancement for weapon possession or use as otherwise required by subsection (b)(2) of that guideline. Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 924(c), the mandatory five-year sentence on the weapon-use count runs consecutively to the guideline sentence imposed on the bank robbery count. <em>See</em> §5G1.2(a).</p>
<p>Unless specifically instructed, subsection (b) does not apply when imposing a sentence under a statute that requires the imposition of a consecutive term of imprisonment only if a term of imprisonment is imposed (<em>i.e.</em>, the statute does not otherwise require a term of imprisonment to be imposed). <em>See</em>, <em>e.g.</em>, 18 U.S.C. § 3146 (Penalty for failure to appear); 18 U.S.C. § 924(a)(4) (regarding penalty for 18 U.S.C. § 922(q) (possession or discharge of a firearm in a school zone)); 18 U.S.C. § 1791(c) (penalty for providing or possessing a controlled substance in prison). Accordingly, the multiple count rules set out under this Part do apply to a count of conviction under this type of statute.&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §3D1.2 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended in Note 1 in the third sentence by striking &quot;mandates imposition of a consecutive sentence&quot; and inserting &quot;(A) specifies a term of imprisonment to be imposed; and (B) requires that such term of imprisonment be imposed to run consecutively to any other term of imprisonment&quot;; and by inserting &quot;; <em>id.</em>, comment. (n.1)&quot; after &quot;§3D1.1(b)&quot;.</p>
<p>Section 5G1.2(a) is amended by striking &quot;mandates a consecutive sentence&quot; and inserting &quot;(1) specifies a term of imprisonment to be imposed; and (2) requires that such term of imprisonment be imposed to run consecutively to any other term of imprisonment&quot;; and by inserting &quot;by that statute&quot; after &quot;determined&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §5G1.2 is amended in the last paragraph by striking the first three sentences as follows:</p>
<p>&quot;Counts for which a statute mandates a consecutive sentence, such as counts charging the use of a firearm in a violent crime (18 U.S.C. § 924(c)) are treated separately. The sentence imposed on such a count is the sentence indicated for the particular offense of conviction. That sentence then runs consecutively to the sentences imposed on the other counts.&quot;,</p>
<p>and inserting the following:</p>
<p>&quot;Subsection (a) applies if a statute (1) specifies a term of imprisonment to be imposed; and (2) requires that such term of imprisonment be imposed to run consecutively to any other term of imprisonment. <em>See</em>, <em>e.g.</em>, 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) (requiring mandatory term of five years to run consecutively to any other term of imprisonment). The term of years to be imposed consecutively is determined by the statute of conviction, and is independent of a guideline sentence on any other count.&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §5G1.2 is amended in the last paragraph in the fourth sentence by inserting &quot;, <em>e.g.</em>,&quot; after &quot;<em>See</em>&quot;; and by adding at the end the following new sentence:</p>
<p>&quot;Subsection (a) also applies in certain other instances in which an independently determined and consecutive sentence is required. <em>See</em>, <em>e.g.</em>, Application Note 3 of the Commentary to §2J1.6 (Failure to Appear by Defendant), relating to failure to appear for service of sentence.&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> The purpose of this amendment is to clarify how several guideline provisions, including those on grouping multiple counts of conviction, work together to ensure an incremental, consecutive penalty for a failure to appear count. This amendment addresses a circuit conflict regarding whether the guideline procedure of grouping the failure to appear count of conviction with the count of conviction for the underlying offense violates the statutory mandate of imposing a consecutive sentence. <em>Compare</em> <em>United States v. Agoro</em>, 996 F.2d 1288 (1st Cir. 1993) (grouping rules apply), <em>and</em> <em>United States v. Flores</em>, No. 93-3771, 1994 WL 163766 (6th Cir. May 2, 1994) (unpublished) (same), <em>with</em> <em>United States v. Packer</em>, 70 F.3d 357 (5th Cir. 1995) (grouping rules defeat statutory purposes of 18 U.S.C. § 3146), <em>cert. denied</em>, 117 S. Ct. 75 (1996). The amendment maintains the current grouping rules for failure to appear and obstruction of justice, but addresses internal inconsistencies among different guidelines and explains how the guideline provisions work together to ensure an incremental, consecutive penalty for the failure to appear count. Specifically, the amendment (1) more clearly distinguishes between statutes that require imposition of a consecutive term of imprisonment only if imprisonment is imposed (<em>e.g.</em>, 18 U.S.C. § 3146 (Penalty for failure to appear); 18 U.S.C. § 1791(b), (c) (Penalty for providing or possessing contraband in prison)), and statutes that require both a minimum term of imprisonment and a consecutive sentence (<em>e.g.</em>, 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) (Use of a firearm in relation to crime of violence or drug trafficking offense)); (2) states that the method outlined for determining a sentence for failure to appear and similar statutes ensures an incremental, consecutive punishment; (3) adds an upward departure provision if offense conduct involves multiple obstructive acts; (4) makes conforming changes in §2P1.2 (Providing or Possessing Contraband in Prison) because the relevant statute, 18 U.S.C. § 1791, is similar to 18 U.S.C. § 3146; and (5) makes conforming changes in §§3C1.1, 3D1.1, 3D1.2, and 5G1.2.</p>

<p>&quot;2. This adjustment also applies in a case in which the defendant provides sufficient indicia to the victim that the defendant legitimately holds a position of private or public trust when, in fact, the defendant does not. For example, the adjustment applies in the case of a defendant who (A) perpetrates a financial fraud by leading an investor to believe the defendant is a legitimate investment broker; or (B) perpetrates a fraud by representing falsely to a patient or employer that the defendant is a licensed physician. In making the misrepresentation, the defendant assumes a position of trust, relative to the victim, that provides the defendant with the same opportunity to commit a difficult-to-detect crime that the defendant would have had if the position were held legitimately.&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §3B1.3 captioned &quot;Background&quot; is amended by inserting after the first sentence the following:</p>
<p>&quot;The adjustment also applies to persons who provide sufficient indicia to the victim that they legitimately hold a position of public or private trust when, in fact, they do not.&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> The purpose of this amendment is to establish that the two-level increase for abuse of a position of trust applies to a defendant who is an imposter, as well as to a person who legitimately holds and abuses a position of trust. This amendment resolves a circuit conflict on that issue. <em>Compare</em> <em>United States v. Gill</em>, 99 F.3d 484 (1st Cir. 1996) (adjustment applied to defendant who posed as licensed psychologist), <em>and</em> <em>United States v. Queen</em>, 4 F.3d 925 (10th Cir. 1993) (adjustment applied to defendant who posed as financial broker), <em>cert. denied</em>, 510 U.S. 1182 (1994), <em>with</em> <em>United States v. Echevarria</em>, 33 F.3d 175 (2d Cir. 1994) (defendant who poses as physician does not occupy a position of trust). The amendment adopts the majority appellate view and provides that the abuse of position of trust adjustment applies to an imposter who pretends to hold a position of trust when in fact he does not. The Commission has determined that, particularly from the perspective of the crime victim, an imposter who falsely assumes and takes advantage of a position of trust is as culpable and deserving of increased punishment as is a defendant who abuses an actual position of trust.</p>

<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> The purpose of this amendment is to clarify what the term &quot;instant offense&quot; means in the obstruction of justice guideline, §3C1.1. This amendment resolves a circuit conflict on the issue of whether the adjustment applies to obstructions that occur in cases closely related to the defendant’s case or only those specifically related to the offense of which the defendant convicted. <em>Compare</em> <em>United States v. Powell</em>, 113 F.3d 464 (3d Cir.) (adjustment applies if defendant attempts to impede the prosecution of a co-defendant who is charged with the same offense for which defendant was convicted), <em>cert. denied</em>, 118 S.

Partee</em>, 31 F.3d 529 (7th Cir. 1994) (same). The amendment, which adopts the majority view, instructs that the obstruction must relate either to the defendant’s offense of conviction (including any relevant conduct) or to a closely related case. The amendment also clarifies the temporal element of the obstruction guideline (<em>i.e.</em>, that the obstructive conduct must occur during the investigation, prosecution, or sentencing of the defendant’s offense of conviction).</p>

<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> The purpose of this amendment is to establish that lying to a probation officer about drug use while released on bail does not warrant an obstruction of justice adjustment under §3C1.1.

If a departure is warranted, the extent of the departure should reflect the extent to which the reduced mental capacity contributed to the commission of the offense.</p>
<p><em>Commentary</em></p>
<p><em>Application Note</em>:</p>
<p>1. For purposes of this policy statement—</p>
<p>‘Significantly reduced mental capacity’ means the defendant, although convicted, has a significantly impaired ability to (A) understand the wrongfulness of the behavior comprising the offense or to exercise the power of reason; or (B) control behavior that the defendant knows is wrongful.&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> The purpose of this amendment is to allow (except under certain circumstances) a diminished capacity departure if there is sufficient evidence that the defendant committed the offense while suffering from a significantly reduced mental capacity. This amendment addresses a circuit conflict regarding whether the diminished capacity departure is precluded if the defendant committed a &quot;crime of violence&quot; as that term is defined in the career offender guideline. <em>Compare</em> <em>United States v. Poff</em>, 926 F.2d 588 (7th Cir.) (en banc) (definition of &quot;non-violent offense&quot; necessarily excludes a crime of violence), <em>cert. denied</em>, 502 U.S. 827 (1991), <em>United States v. Maddalena</em>, 893 F.2d 815 (6th Cir. 1989) (same), <em>United States v. Mayotte</em>, 76 F.3d 887 (8th Cir. 1996) (same), <em>United States v. Borrayo</em>, 898 F.2d 91 (9th Cir. 1989) (same), <em>and</em> <em>United States v. Dailey</em>, 24 F.3d 1323 (11th Cir. 1994) (same), <em>with</em> <em>United States v. Chatman</em>, 986 F.2d 1446 (D.C. Cir. 1993) (court must consider all the facts and circumstances to determine whether offense was non-violent; terms are not mutually exclusive), <em>United States v. Weddle</em>, 30 F.3d 532 (4th Cir. 1994) (same), <em>and</em> <em>United States v. Askari</em>, 140 F. 3d 536 (3d Cir. 1998) (<em>en banc</em>) (&quot;non-violent offenses&quot; are those that do not involve a reasonable perception that force against persons may be used in committing the offense), <em>abrogating</em> <em>United States v. Rosen</em>, 896 F.2d 789 (3d Cir. 1990) (non-violent offense means the opposite of crime of violence). The amendment replaces the current policy statement with a new provision that essentially represents a compromise approach to the circuit conflict. The new policy statement allows a diminished capacity departure if there is sufficient evidence that the defendant committed the offense while suffering from a significantly reduced mental capacity, except under the following three circumstances: (1) the significantly reduced mental capacity was caused by the voluntary use of drugs or other intoxicants; (2) the facts and circumstances of the defendant’s offense indicate a need to protect the public because the offense involved actual violence or a serious threat of violence; or (3) the defendant’s criminal history indicates a need to incarcerate the defendant to protect the public. The amendment also adds an application note that defines &quot;significantly reduced mental capacity&quot; in accord with the decision in <em>United States v. McBroom</em>, 124 F.3d 533 (3d Cir. 1997). The <em>McBroom</em> court concluded that &quot;significantly reduced mental capacity&quot; included both cognitive impairments (<em>i.e.</em>, an inability to understand the wrongfulness of the conduct or to exercise the power of reason) and volitional impairments (<em>i.e.</em>, an inability to control behavior that the person knows is wrongful). The application note specifically includes both types of impairments in the definition of &quot;significantly reduced mental capacity&quot;.</p>

<p>If (A) the defendant and the United States entered into a stipulation of deportation pursuant to section 238(c)(5) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. § 1228(c)(5)); or (B) in the absence of a stipulation of deportation, if, after notice and hearing pursuant to such section, the Attorney General demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that the alien is deportable -- a condition ordering deportation by a United States district court or a United States magistrate judge.&quot;.</p>
<p>Section 5D1.3(e)(5) is amended by striking &quot;to provide just punishment for the offense,&quot;.</p>
<p>Section 5B1.3(c) is amended by inserting &quot;(Policy Statement)&quot; before &quot;The following&quot;.</p>
<p>Section 5B1.3(d) is amended by inserting &quot;(Policy Statement)&quot; before &quot;The following&quot;.</p>
<p>Section 5B1.3(e) is amended in the title by adding &quot;(Policy Statement)&quot; at the end.</p>
<p>Section 5D1.3(c) is amended by inserting &quot;(Policy Statement)&quot; before &quot;The following&quot;.</p>
<p>Section 5D1.3(d) is amended by inserting &quot;(Policy Statement)&quot; before &quot;The following&quot;.</p>
<p>Section 5D1.3(e) is amended in the title by adding &quot;(Policy Statement)&quot; at the end.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> The purpose of this amendment is to make several technical and conforming changes to the guidelines relating to conditions of probation and supervised release. The amendment has three parts. First, the amendment adds to §§5B1.3 and 5D1.3 a condition of probation and supervised release regarding deportation, in response to section 374 of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, Pub. L 104–208, 110 Stat. 3009 (1996). That section amended 18 U.S.C. § 3563(b) to add a new discretionary condition of probation with respect to deportation. Second, this amendment deletes the reference in the supervised release guideline to &quot;just punishment&quot; as a reason for the imposition of curfew as a condition of supervised release. The need to provide &quot;just punishment&quot; is not included in 18 U.S.C. § 3583(c) as a permissible factor to be considered in imposing a term of supervised release. Third, this amendment amends the guidelines pertaining to conditions of probation and supervised release to indicate that discretionary (as opposed to mandatory) conditions are advisory policy statements of the Commission, not binding guidelines.</p>

<p>The Commentary to §5K2.0 is amended by inserting before the first paragraph the following:</p>
<p>&quot; The United States Supreme Court has determined that, in reviewing a district court’s decision to depart from the guidelines, appellate courts are to apply an abuse of discretion standard, because the decision to depart embodies the traditional exercise of discretion by the sentencing court. <em>Koon v. United States</em>, 116 S. Ct. 2035 (1996). Furthermore, ‘[b]efore a departure is permitted, certain aspects of the case must be found unusual enough for it to fall outside the heartland of cases in the Guideline. To resolve this question, the district court must make a refined assessment of the many facts bearing on the outcome, informed by its vantage point and day-to-day experience in criminal sentencing. Whether a given factor is present to a degree not adequately considered by the Commission, or whether a discouraged factor nonetheless justifies departure because it is present in some unusual or exceptional way, are matters determined in large part by comparison with the facts of other Guidelines cases. District Courts have an institutional advantage over appellate courts in making these sorts of determinations, especially as they see so many more Guidelines cases than appellate courts do.’ <em>Id.</em> at 2046-47.&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> The purpose of this amendment is to reference specifically in the general departure policy statement the United States Supreme Court’s decision in <em>United States v. Koon</em>, 116 S. Ct. 2035 (1996). This amendment (1) incorporates the principal holding and key analytical points from the <em>Koon</em> decision into the general departure policy statement, §5K2.0; (2) deletes language inconsistent with the holding of <em>Koon</em>; and (3) makes minor, non-substantive changes that improve the precision of the language of §5K2.0.</p>

<p>The Commentary to §2F1.1 captioned &quot;Application Notes &quot;, as amended by Amendment 577, is further amended by striking Application Note 14 and all that follows through the end of the Application Notes as follows:</p>
<p>&quot;14. For purposes of subsection (b)(5)(B), ‘United States’ means each of the 50 states, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the United States Virgin Islands, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, and American Samoa.</p>
<p>For purposes of subsection (b)(5)(C), ‘sophisticated concealment’ means especially complex or especially intricate offense conduct in which deliberate steps are taken to make the offense, or its extent, difficult to detect. Conduct such as hiding assets or transactions, or both, through the use of fictitious entities, corporate shells, or offshore bank accounts ordinarily indicates sophisticated concealment.</p>
<p>15. ‘Financial institution,’ as used in this guideline, is defined to include any institution described in 18 U.S.C. §§ 20, 656, 657, 1005-1007, and 1014; any state or foreign bank, trust company, credit union, insurance company, investment company, mutual fund, savings (building and loan) association, union or employee pension fund; any health, medical or hospital insurance association; brokers and dealers registered, or required to be registered, with the Securities and Exchange Commission; futures commodity merchants and commodity pool operators registered, or required to be registered, with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission; and any similar entity, whether or not insured by the federal government. ‘Union or employee pension fund’ and ‘any health, medical, or hospital insurance association,’ as used above, primarily include large pension funds that serve many individuals (<em>e.g.</em>, pension funds of large national and international organizations, unions, and corporations doing substantial interstate business), and associations that undertake to provide pension, disability, or other benefits (<em>e.g.</em>, medical or hospitalization insurance) to large numbers of persons.</p>
<p>16. An offense shall be deemed to have ‘substantially jeopardized the safety and soundness of a financial institution’ if, as a consequence of the offense, the institution became insolvent; substantially reduced benefits to pensioners or insureds; was unable on demand to refund fully any deposit, payment, or investment; was so depleted of its assets as to be forced to merge with another institution in order to continue active operations; or was placed in substantial jeopardy of any of the above.</p>
<p>17. ‘The defendant derived more than $1,000,000 in gross receipts from the offense,’ as used in subsection (b)(7)(B), generally means that the gross receipts to the defendant individually, rather than to all participants, exceeded $1,000,000. ‘Gross receipts from the offense’ includes all property, real or personal, tangible or intangible, which is obtained directly or indirectly as a result of such offense. <em>See</em> 18 U.S.C. § 982(a)(4).</p>
<p>18. If the defendant is convicted under 18 U.S.C. § 225 (relating to a continuing financial crimes enterprise), the offense level is that applicable to the underlying series of offenses comprising the ‘continuing financial crimes enterprise.’</p>
<p>19. If subsection (b)(7)(A) or (B) applies, there shall be a rebuttable presumption that the offense involved ‘more than minimal planning.’</p>
<p>20. ‘Mass-marketing,’ as used in subsection (b)(7), means a plan, program, promotion, or campaign that is conducted through solicitation by telephone, mail, the Internet, or other means to induce a large number of persons to (A) purchase goods or services; (B) participate in a contest or sweepstakes; or (C) invest for financial profit. The enhancement would apply, for example, if the defendant conducted or participated in a telemarketing campaign that solicited a large number of individuals to purchase fraudulent life insurance policies.&quot;,</p>
<p>and inserting the following:</p>
<p>&quot;15. For purposes of subsection (b)(5)(B), ‘United States’ means each of the 50 states, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the United States Virgin Islands, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, and American Samoa.</p>
<p>For purposes of subsection (b)(5)(C), ‘sophisticated means’ means especially complex or especially intricate offense conduct pertaining to the execution or concealment of an offense. For example, in a telemarketing scheme, locating the main office of the scheme in one jurisdiction but locating soliciting operations in another jurisdiction would ordinarily indicate sophisticated means. Conduct such as hiding assets or transactions, or both, through the use of fictitious entities, corporate shells, or offshore bank accounts also ordinarily would indicate sophisticated means.</p>
<p>The enhancement for sophisticated means under subsection (b)(5)(C) requires conduct that is significantly more complex or intricate than the conduct that may form the basis for an enhancement for more than minimal planning under subsection (b)(2)(A).</p>
<p>If the conduct that forms the basis for an enhancement under subsection (b)(5) is the only conduct that forms the basis for an adjustment under §3C1.1 (Obstruction of Justice), do not apply an adjustment under §3C1.1.</p>
<p>16. ‘Financial institution,’ as used in this guideline, is defined to include any institution described in 18 U.S.C. §§ 20, 656, 657, 1005-1007, and 1014; any state or foreign bank, trust company, credit union, insurance company, investment company, mutual fund, savings (building and loan) association, union or employee pension fund; any health, medical or hospital insurance association; brokers and dealers registered, or required to be registered, with the Securities and Exchange Commission; futures commodity merchants and commodity pool operators registered, or required to be registered, with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission; and any similar entity, whether or not insured by the federal government. ‘Union or employee pension fund’ and ‘any health, medical, or hospital insurance association,’ as used above, primarily include large pension funds that serve many individuals (<em>e.g.</em>, pension funds of large national and international organizations, unions, and corporations doing substantial interstate business), and associations that undertake to provide pension, disability, or other benefits (<em>e.g.</em>, medical or hospitalization insurance) to large numbers of persons.</p>
<p>17. An offense shall be deemed to have ‘substantially jeopardized the safety and soundness of a financial institution’ if, as a consequence of the offense, the institution became insolvent; substantially reduced benefits to pensioners or insureds; was unable on demand to refund fully any deposit, payment, or investment; was so depleted of its assets as to be forced to merge with another institution in order to continue active operations; or was placed in substantial jeopardy of any of the above.</p>
<p>18. ‘The defendant derived more than $1,000,000 in gross receipts from the offense,’ as used in subsection (b)(7)(B), generally means that the gross receipts to the defendant individually, rather than to all participants, exceeded $1,000,000. ‘Gross receipts from the offense’ includes all property, real or personal, tangible or intangible, which is obtained directly or indirectly as a result of such offense. <em>See</em> 18 U.S.C. § 982(a)(4).</p>
<p>19. If the defendant is convicted under 18 U.S.C. § 225 (relating to a continuing financial crimes enterprise), the offense level is that applicable to the underlying series of offenses comprising the ‘continuing financial crimes enterprise.’</p>

<p>The Commentary to §2F1.1 captioned &quot;Application Notes &quot;, as amended by Amendment 577, is further amended by redesignating Notes 3 through 13 as Notes 4 through 14, respectively; and by inserting after Note 2 the following new Note 3:</p>
<p>&quot;3. ‘Mass-marketing,’ as used in subsection (b)(3), means a plan, program, promotion, or campaign that is conducted through solicitation by telephone, mail, the Internet, or other means to induce a large number of persons to (A) purchase goods or services; (B) participate in a contest or sweepstakes; or (C) invest for financial profit. The enhancement would apply, for example, if the defendant conducted or participated in a telemarketing campaign that solicited a large number of individuals to purchase fraudulent life insurance policies.&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §2F1.1 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended in Note 1 by striking &quot;§2F1.1(b)(3)&quot; and inserting &quot;§2F1.1(b)(4)&quot;; in redesignated Note 5 (formerly Note 4), by striking &quot;(b)(3)(A)&quot; and inserting &quot;(b)(4)(A)&quot;; and in redesignated Note 6 (formerly Note 5), by striking &quot;(b)(3)(B)&quot; and inserting &quot;(b)(4)(B)&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §2F1.1 captioned &quot; Background &quot; is amended by inserting after the fifth paragraph the following new paragraph:</p>
<p>&quot; Subsection (b)(5) implements, in a broader form, the instruction to the Commission in section 6(c)(2) of Public Law 105-184.&quot;.</p>
<p>Section 3A1.1 is amended by striking subsection (b) in its entirety as follows:</p>
<p>&quot;(b) If the defendant knew or should have known that a victim of the offense was unusually vulnerable due to age, physical or mental condition, or that a victim was otherwise particularly susceptible to the criminal conduct, increase by 2 levels.&quot;,</p>
<p>and inserting:</p>
<p>&quot;(b) (1) If the defendant knew or should have known that a victim of the offense was a vulnerable victim, increase by 2 levels.</p>
<p>(2) If (A) subdivision (1) applies; and (B) the offense involved a large number of vulnerable victims, increase the offense level determined under subdivision (1) by 2 additional levels.&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §3A1.1 captioned &quot;Application Notes &quot; is amended in Note 2 in the first paragraph by striking &quot;‘victim’ includes any person&quot; before &quot;who is&quot; and inserting &quot;‘vulnerable victim’ means a person (A)&quot;; and by inserting after &quot;(Relevant Conduct)&quot; the following:</p>
<p>&quot;; and (B) who is unusually vulnerable due to age, physical or mental condition, or who is otherwise particularly susceptible to the criminal conduct &quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §3A1.1 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended in Note 2 in the second paragraph by striking &quot;where&quot; each place it appears and inserting &quot;in which&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §3A1.1 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended in Note 2 in the third paragraph by striking &quot;offense guideline specifically incorporates this factor&quot; and inserting &quot;factor that makes the person a vulnerable victim is incorporated in the offense guideline&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §3A1.1 captioned &quot;Background&quot; is amended by adding at the end the following additional paragraph:</p>
<p>&quot; Subsection (b)(2) implements, in a broader form, the instruction to the Commission in section 6(c)(3) of Public Law 105-184.&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §2B5.1 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended in Note 1 by inserting &quot;United States &quot; before &quot;Virgin Islands &quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This amendment implements, in a broader form, the directives to the Commission in section 6 of the Telemarketing Fraud Prevention Act of 1998, Pub. L. 105–184 (&quot;the Act&quot;).</p>
<p>The Act directs the Commission to provide for &quot;substantially increased penalties&quot; for telemarketing frauds. It also more specifically requires that the guidelines provide &quot;an additional appropriate sentencing enhancement, if the offense involved sophisticated means, including but not limited to sophisticated concealment efforts, such as perpetrating the offense from outside the United States,&quot; and &quot;an additional appropriate sentencing enhancement for cases in which a large number of vulnerable victims, including but not limited to [telemarketing fraud victims over age 55], are affected by a fraudulent scheme or schemes.&quot;</p>
<p>This amendment responds to the directives by building upon the amendments to the fraud guideline, §2F1.1, that were submitted to Congress on May 1, 1998. (<em>See</em> amendment 577, <em>supra</em>.) Those amendments added a specific offense characteristic for &quot;mass-marketing,&quot; which is defined to include telemarketing, and a specific offense characteristic for sophisticated concealment.</p>
<p>This amendment broadens the &quot;sophisticated concealment&quot; enhancement to cover &quot;sophisticated means&quot; of executing or concealing a fraud offense. In addition, the amendment increases the enhancement under the vulnerable victim guideline, §3A1.1, for offenses that impact a large number of vulnerable victims.</p>
<p>This amendment also makes a conforming amendment to §2B5.1 in the definition of &quot;United States&quot;.</p>
<p>In designing enhancements that may apply more broadly than the Act’s above-stated directives minimally require, the Commission acts consistently with other directives in the Act (<em>e.g.</em>, section 6(c)(4) (requiring the Commission to ensure that its implementing amendments are reasonably consistent with other relevant directives to the Commission and other parts of the sentencing guidelines)) and with its basic mandate in sections 991 and 994 of title 28, United States Code (<em>e.g.</em>, 28 U.S.C. § 991(b)(1)(B)) (requiring sentencing policies that avoid unwarranted disparities among similarly situated defendants)).</p>

<p>The Commentary to §2J1.1 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended in Note 2 in the third sentence by inserting &quot;(a)(1) and to any offense under 18 U.S.C. § 228(a)(2) and (3)&quot; after “228&quot;; and in the fourth sentence by inserting &quot;(a)(1)&quot; after &quot;228&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This is a two-part amendment. First, this amendment amends the commentary in the contempt guideline, §2J1.1, pertaining to offenses under 18 U.S.C. § 228 involving the willful failure to pay court-ordered child support. The commentary notes that the contempt guideline applies to second and subsequent offenses under 18 U.S.C. § 228 because a first offense is a Class B misdemeanor not covered by the guidelines.</p>
<p>However, in the Deadbeat Parents Punishment Act of 1998, Pub. L. 105–187, Congress amended 18 U.S.C. § 228 to add two new violations of that section (found at 18 U.S.C. § 228(a)(2) and (3)) and to make even the first offense under those new violations a felony that would be subject to the guidelines. Accordingly, the commentary in the contempt guideline is amended to reflect that it is only the first offense under a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 228(a)(1) that is not covered by the guideline.</p>
<p>Second, this amendment updates and corrects the background commentary of §2C1.4, the guideline that covers offenses involving unlawful compensation for federal employees and bank officials. Currently the background commentary states that 18 U.S.C. § 209 (involving the unlawful supplementation of the salary of various federal employees) and 18 U.S.C. §1909 (prohibiting bank examiners from performing any service for compensation for banks or bank officials) both are misdemeanors for which the maximum term of imprisonment is one year. In fact, however, as a result of enacted legislation, the maximum term of imprisonment for violations of 18 U.S.C. § 209 is now five years if the conduct is willful.</p>
<p>The amendment deletes the sentence of the commentary that describes the maximum term of imprisonment for these offenses.</p>

<p>The Electronic Communications Act of 1986 prohibits the interception of satellite transmission for purposes of direct or indirect commercial advantage or private financial gain. Such violations are similar to copyright offenses and are therefore covered by this guideline.&quot;.</p>

The Act directs the Commission to ensure that the applicable guideline range for intellectual property offenses (including offenses set forth at section 506(a) of title 17, United States Code, and sections 2319, 2319A, and 2320 of title 18, United States Code) is &quot;sufficiently stringent to deter such a crime.&quot; It also more specifically requires that the guidelines &quot;provide for consideration of the retail value and quantity of the items with respect to which the intellectual property offense was committed.&quot;</p>
<p>The amendment responds to the directives, first, by making changes to the monetary calculation found in the copyright and trademark infringement guideline, §2B5.3. In addition, the amendment makes a number of other modifications to the infringement guideline, including the addition of several mitigating and aggravating factors, as further means of providing just and proportionate punishment while also seeking to achieve sufficient deterrence.</p>
<p>The monetary calculation in §2B5.3(b)(1), similar to the loss enhancement in the theft and fraud guidelines, serves as an approximation of the pecuniary harm caused by the offense and is a principal factor in determining the offense level for intellectual property offenses. Prior to this amendment, the monetary calculation for all intellectual property crimes was based on the retail value of the infringing item multiplied by the quantity of infringing items. In response to the directive, the Commission refashioned this enhancement so as to use the retail value of the infringed item, multiplied by the number of infringing items, as a means of approximating the pecuniary harm for cases in which that calculation is believed most likely to provide a reasonable estimate of the resulting harm. Use of that calculation is believed to provide a reasonable approximation for those classes of infringement cases in which it is highly likely that the sale of an infringing item results in a displaced sale of the legitimate, infringed item. The amendment also requires that the retail value of the infringed item, multiplied by the number of infringing items, be used in certain other cases for reasons of practicality.</p>
<p>However, based upon a review of cases sentenced under the former §2B5.3 over two years, the Commission further determined that using the above formula likely would overstate substantially the pecuniary harm caused to copyright and trademark owners in some cases currently sentenced under the guideline. For those cases, a one-to-one correlation between the sale of infringing items and the displaced sale of legitimate, infringed items is unlikely because the inferior quality of the infringing item and/or the greatly discounted price at which it is sold suggests that many purchasers of infringing items would not, or could not, have purchased the infringed item in the absence of the availability of the infringing item. The Commission therefore determined that, for these latter classes of cases (referred to in Application Note 2(B)), the retail value of the infringing item, multiplied by the number of those items, provides a more reasonable approximation of lost revenues to the copyright or trademark owner, and hence, of the pecuniary harm resulting from the offense.</p>
<p>This amendment also increases the base offense level from level 6 to level 8. The two-level increase in the base offense level brings the infringement guideline more in line with offense levels that would pertain under the fraud guideline, §2F1.1, assuming applicability under that guideline of the two-level enhancement for more than minimal planning. Based on a review of cases sentenced under the infringement guideline, if a more than minimal planning enhancement did exist in that guideline, it would apply in the vast majority of such cases because they involve this kind of aggravating conduct. Rather than provide a separate enhancement within the revised guideline for &quot;more than minimal planning&quot; conduct, the Commission determined that the infringement guideline should incorporate this type of conduct into the base offense level.</p>
<p>This amendment also provides an enhancement of two levels, and a minimum offense level of level 12, if the offense involved the manufacture, importation, or uploading of infringing items. The Commission determined that defendants who engage in such conduct are more culpable than other intellectual property offenders because they place infringing items into the stream of commerce, thereby enabling others to infringe the copyright or trademark. A review of cases sentenced under the guideline indicated applicability of this enhancement to approximately two-thirds of the cases.</p>
<p>This amendment also provides a two-level downward adjustment (but not less than offense level 8) if the offense was not committed for commercial advantage or private financial gain. This adjustment reflects the fact that the Act establishes lower statutory penalties for offenses that were not committed for commercial advantage or private financial gain.</p>
<p>This amendment also provides an enhancement of two levels, and a minimum offense level of level 13, if the offense involved the conscious or reckless risk of serious bodily injury or possession of a dangerous weapon in connection with the offense. Testimony received by the Commission indicated that the conscious or reckless risk of serious bodily injury may occur in some cases involving counterfeit consumer products. The Commission determined that this kind of aggravating conduct in connection with infringement cases should be treated under the guidelines in the same way it is treated in connection with fraud cases; therefore, this enhancement is consistent with an identical provision in the fraud guideline.</p>
<p>The amendment also contains an application note expressly providing that the adjustment in §3B1.3 (Abuse of Position of Trust or Use of Special Skill) will apply if the defendant de-encrypted or otherwise circumvented a technological security measure to gain initial access to an infringed item. As stated in the background commentary to §3B1.3, persons who use such a special skill to facilitate or commit a crime generally are viewed as more culpable.</p>
<p>Finally, this amendment contains two encouraged upward departure provisions. The Commission received public comment that indicated that infringement may cause substantial harm to the reputation of the copyright or trademark owner that is not accounted for in the monetary calculation. Public comment also indicated that some copyright and trademark offenses are committed in connection with, or in furtherance of, the criminal activities of certain organized crime enterprises. The amendment invites the court to consider an appropriate upward departure if either of these aggravating circumstances are present.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;(a) Determine, pursuant to §1B1.2 (Applicable Guidelines), the offense guideline section from Chapter Two (Offense Conduct) applicable to the offense of conviction. <em>See</em> §1B1.2.&quot;.</p>
<p>Section 1B1.2(a) is amended by striking &quot;most&quot; each place it appears; by striking &quot;Provided, however&quot; and inserting &quot;However&quot;; and by adding at the end the following:</p>
<p>&quot;Refer to the Statutory Index (Appendix A) to determine the Chapter Two offense guideline, referenced in the Statutory Index for the offense of conviction. If the offense involved a conspiracy, attempt, or solicitation, refer to §2X1.1 (Attempt, Solicitation, or Conspiracy) as well as the guideline referenced in the Statutory Index for the substantive offense. For statutory provisions not listed in the Statutory Index, use the most analogous guideline. <em>See</em> §2X5.1 (Other Offenses). The guidelines do not apply to any count of conviction that is a Class B or C misdemeanor or an infraction. <em>See</em> §1B1.9 (Class B or C Misdemeanors and Infractions).&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §1B1.2 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended by striking the first paragraph of Note 1 and inserting the following:</p>
<p>&quot;This section provides the basic rules for determining the guidelines applicable to the offense conduct under Chapter Two (Offense Conduct). The court is to use the Chapter Two guideline section referenced in the Statutory Index (Appendix A) for the offense of conviction. However, (A) in the case of a plea agreement containing a stipulation that specifically establishes a more serious offense than the offense of conviction, the Chapter Two offense guideline section applicable to the stipulated offense is to be used; and (B) for statutory provisions not listed in the Statutory Index, the most analogous guideline, determined pursuant to §2X5.1 (Other Offenses), is to be used.</p>
<p>In the case of a particular statute that proscribes only a single type of criminal conduct, the offense of conviction and the conduct proscribed by the statute will coincide, and the Statutory Index will specify only one offense guideline for that offense of conviction. In the case of a particular statute that proscribes a variety of conduct that might constitute the subject of different offense guidelines, the Statutory Index may specify more than one offense guideline for that particular statute, and the court will determine which of the referenced guideline sections is most appropriate for the offense conduct charged in the count of which the defendant was convicted. If the offense involved a conspiracy, attempt, or solicitation, refer to §2X1.1 (Attempt, Solicitation, or Conspiracy) as well as the guideline referenced in the Statutory Index for the substantive offense. For statutory provisions not listed in the Statutory Index, the most analogous guideline is to be used. <em>See</em> §2X5.1 (Other Offenses).&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §1B1.2 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended by striking Note 3 in its entirety; and by redesignating Notes 4 and 5 as Notes 3 and 4, respectively.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §2D1.2 captioned &quot;Application Note&quot; is amended in Note 1 by striking &quot;Where&quot; and inserting the following:</p>
<p>&quot;This guideline applies only in a case in which the defendant is convicted of a statutory violation of drug trafficking in a protected location or involving an underage or pregnant individual (including an attempt or conspiracy to commit such a violation) or in a case in which the defendant stipulated to such a statutory violation. <em>See</em> §1B1.2(a). In a case involving such a conviction but in which&quot;.</p>
<p>Appendix A (Statutory Index) is amended by striking the entire text of the &quot;Introduction&quot; and inserting the following:</p>
<p>&quot;This index specifies the offense guideline section(s) in Chapter Two (Offense Conduct) applicable to the statute of conviction. If more than one guideline section is referenced for the particular statute, use the guideline most appropriate for the offense conduct charged in the count of which the defendant was convicted. For the rules governing the determination of the offense guideline section(s) from Chapter Two, and for any exceptions to those rules, <em>see</em> §1B1.2 (Applicable Guidelines).&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §2H1.1 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended in Note 1 in the second paragraph by striking &quot;Application Note 5&quot; and inserting &quot;Application Note 4&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This amendment addresses a circuit conflict regarding whether the enhanced penalties in §2D1.2 (Drug Offenses Occurring Near Protected Locations or Involving Underage or Pregnant Individuals) apply only in a case in which the defendant was convicted of an offense referenced to that guideline or, alternatively, in any case in which the defendant’s relevant conduct included drug sales in a protected location or involving a protected individual. <em>Compare</em> <em>United States v. Chandler</em>, 125 F.3d 892, 897-98 (5th Cir. 1997) (&quot;First, utilizing the Statutory Index located in Appendix A, the court determines the offense guideline section ‘most applicable to the offense of conviction.’&quot; Once the appropriate guideline is identified, a court can take relevant conduct into account only as it relates to factors set forth in that guideline); <em>United States v. Locklear</em>, 24 F.3d 641 (4th Cir. 1994) (finding that §2D1.2 does not apply to convictions under 21 U.S.C. § 841 based on the fact that the commentary to §2D1.2 lists as the &quot;Statutory Provisions&quot; to which it is applicable 21 U.S.C. §§ 859, 860, and 861, but not § 841. &quot;[S]ection 2D1.2 is intended not to identify a specific offense characteristic which would, where applicable, increase the offense level over the base level assigned by §2D1.1, but rather to define the base offense level for violations of 21 U.S.C. §§ 859, 860 and 861.&quot;); <em>United States v. Saavedra</em>, 148 F.3d 1311 (11th Cir. 1998) (defendant’s uncharged but relevant conduct is actually irrelevant to determining the sentencing guideline applicable to the defendant’s offense; such conduct is properly considered only after the applicable guideline has been selected when the court is analyzing the various sentencing considerations within the guideline chosen, such as the base offense level, specific offense characteristics, and any cross references), <em>with</em> <em>United States v. Clay</em>, 117 F.3d 317 (6th Cir.), <em>cert</em>. <em>denied</em>, 118 S. Ct. 395 (1997) (applying §2D1.2 to defendant convicted only of possession with intent to distribute under 21 U.S.C. § 841 but not convicted of any statute referenced to §2D1.2 based on underlying facts indicating defendant involved a juvenile in drug sales); <em>United States v. Oppedahl</em>, 998 F.2d 584 (8th Cir. 1993) (applying §2D1.2 to defendant convicted of conspiracy to distribute and possess with intent to distribute based on fact that defendant’s relevant conduct involved distribution within 1,000 feet of a school); <em>United States v. Robles</em>, 814 F. Supp. 1249 (E.D. Pa), <em>aff’d</em> (unpub.), 8 F.3d 814 (3d Cir. 1993) (looking to relevant conduct to determine appropriate guideline).</p>
<p>In promulgating this amendment, the Commission also was aware of case law that raises a similar issue regarding selection of a Chapter Two (Offense Conduct) guideline, different from that referenced in the Statutory Index (Appendix A), based on factors other than the conduct charged in the offense of conviction. <em>See</em> <em>United States v. Smith</em>, 186 F.3d 290 (3d Cir. 1999) (determining that §2F1.1 (Fraud and Deceit) was most appropriate guideline rather than the listed guideline of §2S1.1 (Laundering of Monetary Instruments)); <em>United States v. Brunson</em>, 882 F. 2d 151, 157 (5th Cir. 1989) (&quot;It is not completely clear to us under what circumstances the Commission contemplated deviation from the suggested guidelines for an ‘atypical’ case.&quot;).</p>
<p>The amendment modifies §§1B1.1(a), 1B1.2(a), and the Statutory Index’s introductory commentary to clarify the inter-relationship among these provisions. The clarification is intended to emphasize that the sentencing court must apply the offense guideline referenced in the Statutory Index for the statute of conviction unless the case falls within the limited &quot;stipulation&quot; exception set forth in §1B1.2(a). Therefore, in order for the enhanced penalties in §2D1.2 to apply, the defendant must be convicted of an offense referenced to §2D1.2, rather than simply have engaged in conduct described by that guideline. Furthermore, the amendment deletes Application Note 3 of §1B1.2 (Applicable Guidelines), which provided that in many instances it would be appropriate for the court to consider the actual conduct of the offender, even if such conduct did not constitute an element of the offense. This application note describes a consideration that is more appropriate when applying §1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct), and its current placement in §1B1.2 apparently has caused confusion in applying that guideline’s principles to determine the offense conduct guideline in Chapter Two most appropriate for the offense of conviction. In particular, the note has been used by some courts to permit a court to decline to use the offense guideline referenced in the Statutory Index in cases that were allegedly &quot;atypical&quot; or &quot;outside the heartland.&quot; <em>See</em> <em>United States v. Smith</em>, <em>supra</em>.</p>

<p>&quot;‘Prohibited sexual conduct’ (A) means any sexual activity for which a person can be charged with a criminal offense; (B) includes the production of child pornography; and (C) does not include trafficking in, or possession of, child pornography. ‘Child pornography’ has the meaning given that term in 18 U.S.C. § 2256(8).&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §2A3.1 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended by redesignating Notes 4 through 6 as Notes 5 through 7, respectively; and by inserting after Note 3 the following:</p>
<p>&quot;4. The enhancement in subsection (b)(6)(A) applies in cases involving the misrepresentation of a participant’s identity to (A) persuade, induce, entice, or coerce a minor to engage in prohibited sexual conduct; or (B) facilitate transportation or travel, by a minor or a participant, to engage in prohibited sexual conduct. Subsection (b)(6)(A) is intended to apply only to misrepresentations made directly to a minor or to a person who exercises custody, care, or supervisory control of the minor.

Subsection (b)(6)(B) is intended to apply only to the use of a computer or an Internet-access device to communicate directly with a minor or with a person who exercises custody, care, or supervisory control of the minor. Accordingly, the enhancement would not apply to the use of a computer or an Internet-access device to obtain airline tickets for the minor from an airline’s Internet site.&quot;.</p>

<p><em>Application Notes</em>:</p>
<p>1. For purposes of this guideline—</p>
<p>‘Participant’ has the meaning given that term in Application Note 1 of §3B1.1 (Aggravating Role).</p>
<p>‘Prohibited sexual conduct’ has the meaning given that term in Application Note 1 of §2A3.1 (Criminal Sexual Abuse; Attempt to Commit Criminal Sexual Abuse).</p>
<p>‘Victim’ means (A) an individual who, except as provided in subdivision (B), had not attained the age of 16 years; or (B) an undercover law enforcement officer who represented to a participant that the officer had not attained the age of 16 years.</p>
<p>2. If the defendant committed the criminal sexual act in furtherance of a commercial scheme such as pandering, transporting persons for the purpose of prostitution, or the production of pornography, an upward departure may be warranted. <em>See</em> Chapter Five, Part K (Departures).</p>
<p>3. Subsection (b)(1) is intended to have broad application and is to be applied whenever the victim is entrusted to the defendant, whether temporarily or permanently. For example, teachers, day care providers, baby-sitters, or other temporary caretakers are among those who would be subject to this enhancement. In determining whether to apply this enhancement, the court should look to the actual relationship that existed between the defendant and the victim and not simply to the legal status of the defendant-victim relationship.</p>
<p>4. If the enhancement in subsection (b)(1) applies, do not apply subsection (b)(2) or §3B1.3 (Abuse of Position of Trust or Use of Special Skill).</p>
<p>5. The enhancement in subsection (b)(2)(A) applies in cases involving the misrepresentation of a participant’s identity to (A) persuade, induce, entice, or coerce the victim to engage in prohibited sexual conduct; or (B) facilitate transportation or travel, by the victim or a participant, to engage in prohibited sexual conduct. Subsection (b)(2)(A) is intended to apply only to misrepresentations made directly to the victim or to a person who exercises custody, care, or supervisory control of the victim. Accordingly, the enhancement in subsection (b)(2)(A) would not apply to a misrepresentation made by a participant to an airline representative in the course of making travel arrangements for the victim.</p>
<p>The misrepresentation to which the enhancement in subsection (b)(2)(A) may apply includes misrepresentation of a participant’s name, age, occupation, gender, or status, as long as the misrepresentation was made with the intent to (A) persuade, induce, entice, or coerce the victim to engage in prohibited sexual conduct; or (B) facilitate transportation or travel, by the victim or a participant, to engage in prohibited sexual conduct. Accordingly, use of a computer screen name, without such intent, would not be a sufficient basis for application of the enhancement.</p>
<p>In determining whether subsection (b)(2)(B) applies, the court should closely consider the facts of the case to determine whether a participant’s influence over the victim compromised the voluntariness of the victim’s behavior.</p>
<p>In a case in which a participant is at least 10 years older than the victim, there shall be a rebuttable presumption, for purposes of subsection (b)(2)(B), that such participant unduly influenced the victim to engage in prohibited sexual conduct. In such a case, some degree of undue influence can be presumed because of the substantial difference in age between the participant and the victim.</p>
<p>If the victim was threatened or placed in fear, the cross reference in subsection (c)(1) will apply.</p>
<p>6. Subsection (b)(3) provides an enhancement if a computer or an Internet-access device was used to (A) persuade, induce, entice, coerce the victim to engage in prohibited sexual conduct; or (B) facilitate transportation or travel, by the victim or a participant, to engage in prohibited sexual conduct. Subsection (b)(3) is intended to apply only to the use of a computer or an Internet-access device to communicate directly with the victim or with a person who exercises custody, care, or supervisory control of the victim. Accordingly, the enhancement would not apply to the use of a computer or an Internet-access device to obtain airline tickets for the victim from an airline’s Internet site.</p>
<p>7. Subsection (c)(1) provides a cross reference to §2A3.1 (Criminal Sexual Abuse; Attempt to Commit Criminal Sexual Abuse) if the offense involved criminal sexual abuse or attempt to commit criminal sexual abuse, as defined in 18 U.S.C. § 2241 or § 2242. For example, the cross reference to §2A3.1 shall apply if (A) the victim had not attained the age of 12 years (<em>see</em> 18 U.S.C. § 2241(c)); (B) the victim had attained the age of 12 years but not attained the age of 16 years, and was placed in fear of death, serious bodily injury, or kidnaping (<em>see</em> 18 U.S.C. § 2241(a),(c)); or (C) the victim was threatened or placed in fear other than fear of death, serious bodily injury, or kidnaping (<em>see</em> 18 U.S.C. § 2242(1)).</p>
<p>8. If the defendant’s criminal history includes a prior sentence for conduct that is similar to the instant offense, an upward departure may be warranted.</p>
<p><em>Background</em>: This section applies to offenses involving the criminal sexual abuse of an individual who had not attained the age of 16 years. While this section applies to consensual sexual acts prosecuted under 18 U.S.C. § 2243(a) that would be lawful but for the age of the victim, it also applies to cases, prosecuted under 18 U.S.C. § 2243(a) or chapter 117 of title 18, United States Code, in which a participant took active measure(s) to unduly influence the victim to engage in prohibited sexual conduct and, thus, the voluntariness of the victim’s behavior was compromised. A two-level enhancement is provided in subsection (b)(2) for such cases. It is assumed that at least a four-year age difference exists between the victim and the defendant, as specified in 18 U.S.C. § 2243(a). A two-level enhancement is provided in subsection (b)(1) for a defendant who victimizes a minor under his supervision or care. However, if the victim had not attained the age of 12 years, §2A3.1 (Criminal Sexual Abuse; Attempt to Commit Criminal Sexual Abuse) will apply, regardless of the ‘consent’ of the victim.&quot;.</p>
<p>Section 2A3.3 is amended by inserting after subsection (a) the following:</p>
<p>&quot;(b) Specific Offense Characteristics</p>
<p>(1) If the offense involved the knowing misrepresentation of a participant’s identity to (A) persuade, induce, entice, or coerce a minor to engage in prohibited sexual conduct; or (B) facilitate transportation or travel, by a minor or a participant, to engage in prohibited sexual conduct, increase by 2 levels.</p>
<p>(2) If a computer or an Internet-access device was used to (A) persuade, induce, entice, or coerce a minor to engage in prohibited sexual conduct; or (B) facilitate transportation or travel, by a minor or a participant, to engage in prohibited sexual conduct, increase by 2 levels.&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §2A3.3 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended by striking Note 1 in its entirety and inserting the following:</p>
<p>&quot;1. For purposes of this guideline—</p>
<p>‘Minor’ means an individual who had not attained the age of 18 years.</p>
<p>‘Participant’ has the meaning given that term in Application Note 1 of the Commentary to §3B1.1 (Aggravating Role).</p>
<p>‘Prohibited sexual conduct’ has the meaning given that term in Application Note 1 of the Commentary to §2A3.1 (Criminal Sexual Abuse; Attempt to Commit Criminal Sexual Abuse).</p>
<p>‘Ward’ means a person in official detention under the custodial, supervisory, or disciplinary authority of the defendant.&quot;;</p>
<p>by redesignating Note 2 as Note 4; and by inserting after Note 1 the following:</p>
<p>&quot;2. The enhancement in subsection (b)(1) applies in cases involving the misrepresentation of a participant’s identity to (A) persuade, induce, entice, or coerce a minor to engage in prohibited sexual conduct; or (B) facilitate transportation or travel, by a minor or a participant, to engage in prohibited sexual conduct. Subsection (b)(1) is intended to apply only to misrepresentations made directly to a minor or to a person who exercises custody, care, or supervisory control of the minor. Accordingly, the enhancement in subsection (b)(1) would not apply to a misrepresentation made by a participant to an airline representative in the course of making travel arrangements for the minor.</p>
<p>The misrepresentation to which the enhancement in subsection (b)(1) may apply includes misrepresentation of a participant’s name, age, occupation, gender, or status, as long as the misrepresentation was made with the intent to (A) persuade, induce, entice, or coerce a minor to engage in prohibited sexual conduct; or (B) facilitate transportation or travel, by a minor or a participant, to engage in prohibited sexual conduct. Accordingly, use of a computer screen name, without such intent, would not be a sufficient basis for application of the enhancement.</p>
<p>3. Subsection (b)(2) provides an enhancement if a computer or an Internet-access device was used to (A) persuade, induce, entice, or coerce a minor to engage in prohibited sexual conduct; or (B) facilitate transportation or travel, by a minor or a participant, to engage in prohibited sexual conduct. Subsection (b)(2) is intended to apply only to the use of a computer or an Internet-access device to communicate directly with a minor or with a person who exercises custody, care, or supervisory control of the minor. Accordingly, the enhancement would not apply to the use of a computer or an Internet-access device to obtain airline tickets for the minor from an airline’s Internet site.&quot;.</p>
<p>Section 2A3.4(b) is amended by adding at the end the following:</p>
<p>&quot;(4) If the offense involved the knowing misrepresentation of a participant’s identity to (A) persuade, induce, entice, or coerce a minor to engage in prohibited sexual conduct; or (B) facilitate transportation or travel, by a minor or a participant, to engage in prohibited sexual conduct, increase by 2 levels.</p>
<p>(5) If a computer or an Internet-access device was used to (A) persuade, induce, entice, or coerce a minor to engage in prohibited sexual conduct; or (B) facilitate transportation or travel, by a minor or a participant, to engage in prohibited sexual conduct, increase by 2 levels.&quot;.</p>
<p>Section 2A3.4(c)(2) is amended by inserting &quot;Under the Age of Sixteen Years&quot; before &quot;(Statutory Rape)&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §2A3.4 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended by redesignating Note 5 as Note 8; by redesignating Notes 1 through 4 as Notes 2 through 5, respectively; by inserting before redesignated Note 2 (formerly Note 1) the following:</p>
<p>&quot;1. For purposes of this guideline—</p>
<p>‘Minor’ means an individual who had not attained the age of 18 years.</p>
<p>‘Participant’ has the meaning given that term in Application Note 1 of the Commentary to §3B1.1 (Aggravating Role).</p>
<p>‘Prohibited sexual conduct’ has the meaning given that term in Application Note 1 of the Commentary to §2A3.1 (Criminal Sexual Abuse; Attempt to Commit Criminal Sexual Abuse).&quot;;</p>
<p>and by adding after redesignated Note 5 (formerly Note 4), the following:</p>
<p>&quot;6. The enhancement in subsection (b)(4) applies in cases involving the misrepresentation of a participant’s identity to (A) persuade, induce, entice, or coerce a minor to engage in prohibited sexual conduct; or (B) facilitate transportation or travel, by a minor or a participant, to engage in prohibited sexual conduct. Subsection (b)(4) is intended to apply only to misrepresentations made directly to a minor or to a person who exercises custody, care, or supervisory control of the minor. Accordingly, the enhancement in subsection (b)(4) would not apply to a misrepresentation made by a participant to an airline representative in the course of making travel arrangements for the minor.</p>
<p>The misrepresentation to which the enhancement in subsection (b)(4) may apply includes misrepresentation of a participant’s name, age, occupation, gender, or status, as long as the misrepresentation was made with the intent to (A) persuade, induce, entice, or coerce a minor to engage in prohibited sexual conduct; or (B) facilitate transportation or travel, by a minor or a participant, to engage in prohibited sexual conduct. Accordingly, use of a computer screen name, without such intent, would not be a sufficient basis for application of the enhancement.</p>
<p>7. Subsection (b)(5) provides an enhancement if a computer or an Internet-access device was used to (A) persuade, induce, entice, or coerce a minor to engage in prohibited sexual conduct; or (B) facilitate transportation or travel, by a minor or a participant, to engage in prohibited sexual conduct. Subsection (b)(5) is intended to apply only to the use of a computer or an Internet-access device to communicate directly with a minor or with a person who exercises custody, care, or supervisory control of the minor. Accordingly, the enhancement would not apply to the use of a computer or an Internet-access device to obtain airline tickets for the minor from an airline’s Internet site.&quot;.</p>
<p>Chapter Two, Part G, Subpart One is amended by striking the text of the title to Subpart One in its entirety and inserting the following:</p>
<p>&quot;PROMOTING PROSTITUTION OR PROHIBITED SEXUAL CONDUCT&quot;;</p>
<p>and by striking §2G1.1 in its entirety and inserting the following:</p>
<p>&quot;§2G1.1. <em>Promoting Prostitution or Prohibited Sexual Conduct</em></p>
<p>(a) Base Offense Level:</p>
<p>(1) 19, if the offense involved a minor; or</p>
<p>(2) 14, otherwise.</p>
<p>(b) Specific Offense Characteristics</p>
<p>(1) If the offense involved (A) prostitution; and (B) the use of physical force, or coercion by threats or drugs or in any manner, increase by 4 levels.</p>
<p>(2) If the offense involved a victim who had (A) not attained the age of 12 years, increase by 4 levels; or (B) attained the age of 12 years but not attained the age of 16 years, increase by 2 levels.</p>
<p>(3) If subsection (b)(2) applies; and—</p>
<p>(A) the defendant was a parent, relative, or legal guardian of the victim; or</p>
<p>(B) the victim was otherwise in the custody, care, or supervisory control of the defendant,</p>
<p>increase by 2 levels.</p>
<p>(4) If subsection (b)(3) does not apply; and—</p>
<p>(A) the offense involved the knowing misrepresentation of a participant’s identity to persuade, induce, entice, coerce, or facilitate the travel of, a minor to engage in prostitution; or</p>
<p>(B) a participant otherwise unduly influenced a minor to engage in prostitution,</p>
<p>increase by 2 levels.</p>
<p>(5) If a computer or an Internet-access device was used to (A) persuade, induce, entice, coerce, or facilitate the travel of, a minor to engage in prostitution; or (B) entice, encourage, offer, or solicit a person to engage in prohibited sexual conduct with a minor, increase by 2 levels.</p>
<p>(c) Cross References</p>
<p>(1) If the offense involved causing, transporting, permitting, or offering or seeking by notice or advertisement, a person less than 18 years of age to engage in sexually explicit conduct for the purpose of producing a visual depiction of such conduct, apply §2G2.1 (Sexually Exploiting a Minor by Production of Sexually Explicit Visual or Printed Material; Custodian Permitting Minor to Engage in Sexually Explicit Conduct; Advertisement for Minors to Engage in Production).</p>
<p>(2) If the offense involved criminal sexual abuse, attempted criminal sexual abuse, or assault with intent to commit criminal sexual abuse, apply §2A3.1 (Criminal Sexual Abuse; Attempt to Commit Criminal Sexual Abuse). If the offense involved criminal sexual abuse of a minor who had not attained the age of 12 years, §2A3.1 shall apply, regardless of the ‘consent’ of the victim.</p>
<p>(3) If the offense did not involve promoting prostitution, and neither subsection (c)(1) nor (c)(2) is applicable, apply §2A3.2 (Criminal Sexual Abuse of a Minor Under the Age of Sixteen Years (Statutory Rape) or Attempt to Commit Such Acts) or §2A3.4 (Abusive Sexual Contact or Attempt to Commit Abusive Sexual Contact), as appropriate.</p>
<p>(d) Special Instruction</p>
<p>(1) If the offense involved more than one victim, Chapter Three, Part D (Multiple Counts) shall be applied as if the promoting of prostitution or prohibited sexual conduct in respect to each victim had been contained in a separate count of conviction.</p>
<p><em>Commentary</em></p>
<p><em>Statutory Provisions</em>: 8 U.S.C. § 1328; 18 U.S.C. §§ 2421, 2422, 2423(a), 2425.</p>
<p><em>Application Notes</em>:</p>
<p>1. For purposes of this guideline—</p>
<p>‘Minor’ means an individual who had not attained the age of 18 years.</p>
<p>‘Participant’ has the meaning given that term in Application Note 1 of §3B1.1 (Aggravating Role).</p>
<p>‘Prohibited sexual conduct’ has the meaning given that term in Application Note 1 of §2A3.1 (Criminal Sexual Abuse; Attempt to Commit Criminal Sexual Abuse).</p>
<p>‘Promoting prostitution’ means persuading, inducing, enticing, or coercing a person to engage in prostitution, or to travel to engage in, prostitution.</p>
<p>‘Victim’ means a person transported, persuaded, induced, enticed, or coerced to engage in, or travel for the purpose of engaging in, prostitution or prohibited sexual conduct, whether or not the person consented to the prostitution or prohibited sexual conduct. Accordingly, ‘victim’ may include an undercover law enforcement officer.</p>
<p>2. Subsection (b)(1) provides an enhancement for physical force, or coercion, that occurs as part of a prostitution offense and anticipates no bodily injury. If bodily injury results, an upward departure may be warranted. <em>See</em> Chapter Five, Part K (Departures). For purposes of subsection (b)(1), ‘coercion’ includes any form of conduct that negates the voluntariness of the behavior of the victim. This enhancement would apply, for example, in a case in which the ability of the victim to appraise or control conduct was substantially impaired by drugs or alcohol. In the case of an adult victim, rather than a victim less than 18 years of age, this characteristic generally will not apply if the drug or alcohol was voluntarily taken.</p>
<p>3. For the purposes of §3B1.1 (Aggravating Role), a victim, as defined in this guideline, is considered a participant only if that victim assisted in the promoting of prostitution or prohibited sexual conduct in respect to another victim.</p>
<p>4. For the purposes of Chapter Three, Part D (Multiple Counts), each person transported, persuaded, induced, enticed, or coerced to engage in, or travel to engage in, prostitution or prohibited sexual conduct is to be treated as a separate victim. Consequently, multiple counts involving more than one victim are not to be grouped together under §3D1.2 (Groups of Closely-Related Counts). In addition, subsection (d)(1) directs that if the relevant conduct of an offense of conviction includes the promoting of prostitution or prohibited sexual conduct in respect to more than one victim, whether specifically cited in the count of conviction, each such victim shall be treated as if contained in a separate count of conviction.</p>
<p>5. Subsection (b)(3) is intended to have broad application and includes offenses involving a victim less than 18 years of age entrusted to the defendant, whether temporarily or permanently. For example, teachers, day care providers, baby-sitters, or other temporary caretakers are among those who would be subject to this enhancement. In determining whether to apply this enhancement, the court should look to the actual relationship that existed between the defendant and the victim and not simply to the legal status of the defendant-victim relationship.</p>
<p>6. If the enhancement in subsection (b)(3) applies, do not apply subsection (b)(4) or §3B1.3 (Abuse of Position of Trust or Use of Special Skill).</p>
<p>7. The enhancement in subsection (b)(4)(A) applies in cases involving the misrepresentation of a participant’s identity to persuade, induce, entice, coerce, or facilitate the travel of, a minor to engage in prostitution. Subsection (b)(4)(A) is intended to apply only to misrepresentations made directly to a minor or to a person who exercises custody, care, or supervisory control of the minor. Accordingly, the enhancement in subsection (b)(4)(A) would not apply to a misrepresentation made by a participant to an airline representative in the course of making travel arrangements for the minor.</p>
<p>The misrepresentation to which the enhancement in subsection (b)(4)(A) may apply includes misrepresentation of a participant’s name, age, occupation, gender, or status, as long as the misrepresentation was made with the intent to persuade, induce, entice, coerce, or facilitate the travel of, a minor to engage in prostitution. Accordingly, use of a computer screen name, without such intent, would not be a sufficient basis for application of the enhancement.</p>
<p>In determining whether subsection (b)(4)(B) applies, the court should closely consider the facts of the case to determine whether a participant’s influence over the minor compromised the voluntariness of the minor’s behavior.</p>
<p>In a case in which a participant is at least 10 years older than the minor, there shall be a rebuttable presumption, for purposes of subsection (b)(4)(B), that such participant unduly influenced the minor to engage in prostitution. In such a case, some degree of undue influence can be presumed because of the substantial difference in age between the participant and the minor.</p>
<p>8. Subsection (b)(5) provides an enhancement if a computer or an Internet-access device was used to (A) persuade, induce, entice, coerce, or facilitate the travel of, a minor to engage in prostitution; or (B) entice, encourage, offer, or solicit a person to engage in prohibited sexual conduct with a minor. Subsection (b)(5)(A) is intended to apply only to the use of a computer or an Internet-access device to communicate directly with a minor or with a person who exercises custody, care, or supervisory control of the minor. Accordingly, the enhancement in subsection (b)(5)(A) would not apply to the use of a computer or an Internet-access device to obtain airline tickets for the minor from an airline’s Internet site.</p>
<p>9. The cross reference in subsection (c)(1) is to be construed broadly to include all instances in which the offense involved employing, using, persuading, inducing, enticing, coercing, transporting, permitting, or offering or seeking by notice or advertisement, a person less than 18 years of age to engage in sexually explicit conduct for the purpose of producing any visual depiction of such conduct. For purposes of subsection (c)(1), ‘sexually explicit conduct’ has the meaning given that term in 18 U.S.C. § 2256.</p>
<p>10. Subsection (c)(2) provides a cross reference to §2A3.1 (Criminal Sexual Abuse; Attempt to Commit Criminal Sexual Abuse) if the offense involved criminal sexual abuse or attempt to commit criminal sexual abuse, as defined in 18 U.S.C. § 2241 or § 2242. For example, the cross reference to §2A3.1 shall apply if the offense involved criminal sexual abuse; and (A) the victim had not attained the age of 12 years (<em>see</em> 18 U.S.C. § 2241(c)); (B) the victim had attained the age of 12 years but had not attained the age of 16 years, and was placed in fear of death, serious bodily injury, or kidnaping (<em>see</em> 18 U.S.C. § 2241(a),(c)); or (C) the victim was threatened or placed in fear other than fear of death, serious bodily injury, or kidnaping (<em>see</em> 18 U.S.C. § 2242(1)).</p>
<p>11. The cross reference in subsection (c)(3) addresses the case in which the offense did not involve promoting prostitution, neither subsection (c)(1) nor (c)(2) is applicable, and the offense involved prohibited sexual conduct other than the conduct covered by subsection (c)(1) or (c)(2). In such case, the guideline for the underlying prohibited sexual conduct is to be used; <em>i.e.</em>, §2A3.2 (Criminal Sexual Abuse of a Minor Under the Age of Sixteen Years (Statutory Rape) or Attempt to Commit Such Acts) or §2A3.4 (Abusive Sexual Contact or Attempt to Commit Abusive Sexual Contact).</p>
<p><em>Background</em>: This guideline covers offenses under chapter 117 of title 18, United States Code. Those offenses involve promoting prostitution or prohibited sexual conduct through a variety of means. Offenses that involve promoting prostitution under chapter 117 of such title are sentenced under this guideline, unless other prohibited sexual conduct occurs as part of the prostitution offense, in which case one of the cross references would apply. Offenses under chapter 117 of such title that do not involve promoting prostitution are to be sentenced under §2G2.1 (Sexually Exploiting a Minor by Production of Sexually Explicit Visual or Printed Material; Custodian Permitting Minor to Engage in Sexually Explicit Conduct; Advertisement for Minors to Engage in Production), §2A3.1 (Criminal Sexual Abuse; Attempt to Commit Criminal Sexual Abuse), §2A3.2 (Criminal Sexual Abuse of a Minor Under the Age of Sixteen Years (Statutory Rape) or Attempt to Commit Such Acts) or §2A3.4 (Abusive Sexual Contact or Attempt to Commit Abusive Sexual Contact), as appropriate, pursuant to the cross references provided in subsection (c).&quot;.</p>
<p>Section 2G2.1(b) is amended by striking subdivision (3) in its entirety and inserting the following:</p>
<p>&quot;(3) If, for the purpose of producing sexually explicit material, the offense involved (A) the knowing misrepresentation of a participant’s identity to persuade, induce, entice, coerce, or facilitate the travel of, a minor to engage sexually explicit conduct; or (B) the use of a computer or an Internet-access device to (i) persuade, induce, entice, coerce, or facilitate the travel of, a minor to engage in sexually explicit conduct, or to otherwise solicit participation by a minor in such conduct; or (ii) solicit participation with a minor in sexually explicit conduct, increase by 2 levels.&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §2G2.1 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended by redesignating Notes 1 through 3 as Notes 2 through 4, respectively; by inserting before redesignated Note 2 (formerly Note 1) the following:</p>
<p>&quot;1. For purposes of this guideline, ‘minor’ means an individual who had not attained the age of 18 years.&quot;;</p>
<p>and by adding at the end the following:</p>
<p>&quot;5. The enhancement in subsection (b)(3)(A) applies in cases involving the misrepresentation of a participant’s identity to persuade, induce, entice, coerce, or facilitate the travel of, a minor to engage in sexually explicit conduct for the purpose of producing sexually explicit material. Subsection (b)(3)(A) is intended to apply only to misrepresentations made directly to a minor or to a person who exercises custody, care, or supervisory control of the minor. Accordingly, the enhancement in subsection (b)(3)(A) would not apply to a misrepresentation made by a participant to an airline representative in the course of making travel arrangements for the minor.</p>
<p>The misrepresentation to which the enhancement in subsection (b)(3)(A) may apply includes misrepresentation of a participant’s name, age, occupation, gender, or status, as long as the misrepresentation was made with the intent to persuade, induce, entice, coerce, or facilitate the travel of, a minor to engage in sexually explicit conduct for the purpose of producing sexually explicit material. Accordingly, use of a computer screen name, without such intent, would not be a sufficient basis for application of the enhancement.</p>
<p>Subsection (b)(3)(B)(i) provides an enhancement if a computer or an Internet-access device was used to persuade, induce, entice, coerce, or facilitate the travel of, a minor to engage in sexually explicit conduct for the purpose of producing sexually explicit material or otherwise to solicit participation by a minor in such conduct for such purpose. Subsection (b)(3)(B)(i) is intended to apply only to the use of a computer or an Internet-access device to communicate directly with a minor or with a person who exercises custody, care, or supervisory control of the minor. Accordingly, the enhancement would not apply to the use of a computer or an Internet-access device to obtain airline tickets for the minor from an airline’s Internet site.&quot;.</p>
<p>Section 2G2.2(b) is amended by striking subdivision (2) in its entirety and inserting the following:</p>
<p>&quot;(2) (Apply the Greatest) If the offense involved:</p>
<p>(A) Distribution for pecuniary gain, increase by the number of levels from the table in §2F1.1 (Fraud and Deceit) corresponding to the retail value of the material, but by not less than 5 levels.</p>
<p>(B) Distribution for the receipt, or expectation of receipt, of a thing of value, but not for pecuniary gain, increase by 5 levels.</p>
<p>(C) Distribution to a minor, increase by 5 levels.</p>
<p>(D) Distribution to a minor that was intended to persuade, induce, entice, coerce, or facilitate the travel of, the minor to engage in prohibited sexual conduct, increase by 7 levels.</p>
<p>(E) Distribution other than distribution described in subdivisions (A) through (D), increase by 2 levels.&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §2G2.2 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended by striking Note 1 in its entirety and inserting the following:</p>
<p>&quot;1. For purposes of this guideline—</p>
<p>‘Distribution’ means any act, including production, transportation, and possession with intent to distribute, related to the transfer of material involving the sexual exploitation of a minor.</p>
<p>‘Distribution for pecuniary gain’ means distribution for profit.</p>
<p>‘Distribution for the receipt, or expectation of receipt, of a thing of value, but not for pecuniary gain’ means any transaction, including bartering or other in-kind transaction, that is conducted for a thing of value, but not for profit. ‘Thing of value’ means anything of valuable consideration. For example, in a case involving the bartering of child pornographic material, the ‘thing of value’ is the child pornographic material received in exchange for other child pornographic material bartered in consideration for the material received.</p>
<p>‘Distribution to a minor’ means the knowing distribution to an individual who is a minor at the time of the offense, knowing or believing the individual is a minor at that time.</p>
<p>‘Minor’ means an individual who had not attained the age of 18 years.</p>
<p>‘Pattern of activity involving the sexual abuse or exploitation of a minor’ means any combination of two or more separate instances of the sexual abuse or sexual exploitation of a minor by the defendant, whether or not the abuse or exploitation (A) occurred during the course of the offense; (B) involved the same or different victims; or (C) resulted in a conviction for such conduct.</p>
<p>‘Prohibited sexual conduct’ has the meaning given that term in Application Note 1 of the Commentary to §2A3.1 (Criminal Sexual Abuse; Attempt to Commit Criminal Sexual Abuse).</p>
<p>‘Sexual abuse or exploitation’ means conduct constituting criminal sexual abuse of a minor, sexual exploitation of a minor, abusive sexual contact of a minor, any similar offense under state law, or an attempt or conspiracy to commit any of the above offenses. ‘Sexual abuse or exploitation’ does not include trafficking in material relating to the sexual abuse or exploitation of a minor.</p>
<p>‘Sexually explicit conduct’ has the meaning given that term in 18 U.S.C. § 2256.&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §2G2.4 is amended by adding at the end the following:</p>
<p>&quot;<em>Application Notes</em>:</p>
<p>1. For purposes of this guideline—</p>
<p>‘Minor’ means an individual who had not attained the age of 18 years.</p>
<p>‘Visual depiction’ means any visual depiction described in 18 U.S.C. § 2256(5) and (8).</p>
<p>2. For purposes of subsection (b)(2), a file that (A) contains a visual depiction; and (B) is stored on a magnetic, optical, digital, other electronic, or other storage medium or device, shall be considered to be one item.</p>
<p>If the offense involved a large number of visual depictions, an upward departure may be warranted, regardless of whether subsection (b)(2) applies.&quot;.</p>
<p>Section 2G3.1 is amended in the title by adding at the end &quot;; Transferring Obscene Matter to a Minor&quot;.</p>
<p>Section 2G3.1(b) is amended by striking subdivision (1) in its entirety and inserting the following:</p>
<p>&quot;(1) (Apply the Greatest) If the offense involved:</p>
<p>(A) Distribution for pecuniary gain, increase by the number of levels from the table in §2F1.1 (Fraud and Deceit) corresponding to the retail value of the material, but by not less than 5 levels.</p>
<p>(B) Distribution for the receipt, or expectation of receipt, of a thing of value, but not for pecuniary gain, increase by 5 levels.</p>
<p>(C) Distribution to a minor, increase by 5 levels.</p>
<p>(D) Distribution to a minor that was intended to persuade, induce, entice, coerce, or facilitate the travel of, the minor to engage in prohibited sexual conduct, increase by 7 levels.</p>
<p>(E) Distribution other than distribution described in subdivisions (A) through (D), increase by 2 levels.&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §2G3.1 captioned &quot;Statutory Provisions&quot; is amended by inserting &quot;, 1470&quot; after &quot;1466&quot;.</p>

<p>‘Distribution for the receipt, or expectation of receipt, of a thing of value, but not for pecuniary gain’ means any transaction, including bartering or other in-kind transaction, that is conducted for a thing of value, but not for profit. ‘Thing of value’ means anything of valuable consideration.</p>
<p>‘Distribution to a minor’ means the knowing distribution to an individual who is a minor at the time of the offense, knowing or believing the individual is a minor at that time.</p>
<p>‘Minor’ means an individual who had not attained the age of 16 years.</p>

<p>The Commentary to §2G3.2 captioned &quot;Background&quot; is amended by inserting &quot;; Transferring Obscene Matter to a Minor&quot; after &quot;Transporting Obscene Matter&quot;.</p>
<p>Appendix A (Statutory Index) is amended by inserting after the line referenced to &quot;18 U.S.C. § 1468&quot; the following new line:</p>
<p>&quot;18 U.S.C. § 1470 2G3.1&quot;;</p>
<p>and by inserting after the line referenced to &quot;18 U.S.C. § 2423(b)&quot; the following new line:</p>
<p>&quot;18 U.S.C. § 2425 2G1.1&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This is a six-part amendment. The amendment is promulgated primarily in response to the Protection of Children from Sexual Predators Act of 1998, Pub. L. 105–314 (the &quot;Act&quot;), which contained several directives to the Commission.</p>
<p>First, the amendment addresses the Act’s directives to provide enhancements to the guidelines covering aggravated sexual abuse, sexual abuse, and sexual abuse of a minor if (1) the defendant used a computer with the intent to persuade, induce, entice, coerce, or facilitate the transport of a minor to engage in any prohibited sexual activity; and (2) the defendant knowingly misrepresented the defendant’s actual identity with the intent to persuade, induce, entice, coerce, or facilitate the transport of a minor to engage in any prohibited sexual conduct. The legislative history of the Act indicates congressional intent to ensure that persons who misrepresent themselves to a minor, or use computers or Internet-access devices to locate and gain access to a minor, are severely punished.</p>
<p>In response to these directives, the amendment provides separate, cumulative two-level enhancements in the sexual abuse guidelines, §§2A3.2 (Criminal Sexual Abuse of a Minor Under the Age of Sixteen Years (Statutory Rape) or Attempt to Commit Such Acts), 2A3.3 (Criminal Sexual Abuse of a Ward), and 2A3.4 (Abusive Sexual Contact), and in §2G1.1 (Promoting Prostitution or Prohibited Sexual Conduct) for (1) the use of a computer or Internet-access device with the intent to persuade, induce, entice, coerce, or facilitate the transport of a minor to engage in any prohibited sexual conduct; and (2) misrepresentation of a criminally responsible person’s identity with such an intent. The Commission has determined that, for offenses sentenced under these guidelines, the use of a computer or Internet-access device and the misrepresentation of identity represent separate, additional harms and increase the culpability of a defendant or criminal participant who engages, or attempts to engage, in such conduct. With respect to §§2A3.1 (Criminal Sexual Abuse; Attempt to Commit Criminal Sexual Abuse) and 2G2.1 (Sexually Exploiting a Minor by Production of Sexually Explicit Visual or Printed Material), the amendment treats these two types of aggravating conduct as alternative triggers for one enhancement. In these guidelines, the substantially higher base offense levels and other specific offense characteristics provide alternative guideline mechanisms to account, at least in part, for these harms and the defendant’s increased culpability. Accordingly, the Commission determined that, in these guidelines, a single, two-level increase for the use of a computer or misrepresentation adequately addresses the increased seriousness of these offenses.</p>
<p>Second, this amendment responds to the directive in the Act to provide a sentencing enhancement for offenses under chapter 117 of title 18, United States Code (relating to the transportation of minors for illegal sexual activity), while ensuring that the sentences, guidelines, and policy statements for offenders convicted of such offenses are appropriately severe and reasonably consistent with the other relevant directives and the relevant existing guidelines. In furtherance of this directive, the Commission initiated a comprehensive examination of §§2A3.2 and 2G1.1, the guidelines under which most cases prosecuted under such chapter are sentenced. The Commission intends to continue its comprehensive review of these guidelines and other guidelines that cover chapter 117 offenses in the next amendment cycle.</p>
<p>The amendment implements the directive to provide an enhancement for chapter 117 offenses, in part, through the enhancements provided in §§2A3.2 and 2G1.1 for misrepresentation of identity and use of a computer to facilitate such offenses. In addition, the amendment provides an alternative basis for a sentencing enhancement if a participant otherwise unduly influenced the victim to engage in prohibited sexual conduct. Despite the fact that §2A3.2 nominally applies to consensual sexual acts with a person who had not attained the age of 16 years, Commission data indicated that many of the cases sentenced under §2A3.2, directly or via a cross reference from §2G1.1, involve some aspect of undue influence over the victim on the part of the defendant or other criminally responsible person. Analysis of these cases revealed conduct such as coercion, enticement, or other forms of undue influence by the defendant that compromised the voluntariness of the victim’s behavior and, accordingly, increased the defendant’s culpability for the crime. This prong of the new enhancement is designed to allow courts to consider closely the facts of the individual case. Furthermore, a rebuttable presumption is created that the offense involved undue influence if a participant was at least 10 years older than the victim. Data reviewed by the Commission suggested that such a presumption is appropriate because persons who are much older than a minor are frequently in a position to manipulate the minor due to increased knowledge, influence, and resources.</p>
<p>As a result of the Commission’s comprehensive assessment of §§2A3.2 and 2G1.1, the amendment also makes several other modifications to these guidelines. The amendment provides, in §2A3.2, an alternative base offense level of level 18 if the offense involved a violation of chapter 117 of title 18, United States Code. This alternative base offense level more fully implements a directive in the Sex Crimes Against Children Prevention Act of 1995, Pub. L. 104–71, to provide at least a three-level increase for offenses under 18 U.S.C. § 2423(a) involving the transportation of minors for prostitution or other prohibited sexual conduct. However, the amendment also provides for a three-level decrease if a defendant receives the higher alternative base offense level of level 18 and none of certain listed aggravating specific offense characteristics apply. This reduction recognizes that not all defendants convicted under chapter 117 have necessarily engaged in a more aggravated form of statutory rape conduct. The amendment also adds several definitions to §2A3.2, including clarifying that &quot;victim&quot; includes an undercover police officer who represents to the perpetrator of the offense that the officer was under the age of 16 years. This change was made to ensure that offenders who are apprehended in an undercover operation are appropriately punished. In §2G1.1, the amendment reallocates, without substantive change, five offense levels from subsection (b)(2) to the base offense level, for offenses involving a minor. Section 2G1.1(b)(1) also is amended to clarify that the offense must have involved prostitution in order for the enhancement for coercion, threats, or drugs to apply. The amendment also clarifies that, in §§2A3.2(c)(1) and 2G1.1(c)(2), the cross reference to §2A3.1 shall apply if the offense involved criminal sexual abuse of a minor under the age of 12 years, regardless of the &quot;consent&quot; of the victim. Review of Commission data indicated that the cross reference to §2A3.1 currently is not being applied in many cases in which the offense conduct suggests it should. In both §§2A3.2 and 2G1.1, the amendment also precludes application of the new enhancement for misrepresentation of identity and/or undue influence if the victim is in the custody, care, or supervisory control of the defendant.</p>
<p>Third, the amendment addresses the directive in the Act to clarify that the term &quot;distribution of pornography&quot; applies to the distribution of pornography for both monetary remuneration and a non-pecuniary interest. In response to the directive, the amendment modifies the enhancement in §2G2.2 (Trafficking in Material Involving the Sexual Exploitation of a Minor), relating to the distribution of child pornographic material, as well as a similar enhancement in §2G3.1 (Importing, Mailing, or Transporting Obscene Matter; Transferring Obscene Matter to a Minor), relating to the distribution of obscene material. For each of these enhancements, the amendment (1) modifies the definition of &quot;distribution&quot; to mean any act, including production, transportation, and possession with intent to distribute, related to the transfer of the material, regardless of whether it was for pecuniary gain; and (2) provides for varying levels of enhancement depending upon the purpose and audience of the distribution. These varying levels are intended to respond to increased congressional concerns, as indicated in the legislative history of the Act, that pedophiles, including those who use the Internet, are using child pornographic and obscene material to desensitize children to sexual activity, to convince children that sexual activity involving children is normal, and to entice children to engage in sexual activity.</p>
<p>Fourth, the amendment clarifies the meaning of the term &quot;item&quot; in subsection (b)(2) of §2G2.4 (Possession of Materials Depicting a Minor Engaged in Sexually Explicit Conduct). That subsection provides a two-level enhancement if the offense involved possession of ten or more items of child pornography. The amendment adopts the holding of all circuits that have addressed the matter that a computer file qualifies as an item for purposes of the enhancement. The amendment also provides for an invited upward departure if the offense involves a large number of visual depictions of child pornography, regardless of the number of &quot;items&quot; involved. This provision invites courts to depart upward in cases in which a particular item, such as a book or a computer file, contains an unusually large number of pornographic images involving children.</p>
<p>Fifth, the amendment addresses the new offense of transferring obscene matter to a minor, codified at 18 U.S.C. § 1470, by referencing the offense in the Statutory Index (Appendix A) to §2G3.1.</p>
<p>Sixth, the amendment addresses the new offense of prohibiting the knowing transmittal of identifying information about minors for criminal sexual purposes, codified at 18 U.S.C. § 2425, by referencing the new offense in the Statutory Index to §2G1.1.</p>

<p><em>Commentary</em></p>
<p><em>Statutory Provisions</em>: 17 U.S.C. § 506(a); 18 U.S.C. §§ 2318-2320, 2511. For additional statutory provision(s), <em>see</em> Appendix A (Statutory Index).</p>
<p><em>Application Notes</em>:</p>
<p>1. <em>Definitions</em>.—For purposes of this guideline:</p>
<p>‘Commercial advantage or private financial gain’ means the receipt, or expectation of receipt, of anything of value, including other protected works.</p>
<p>‘Infringed item’ means the copyrighted or trademarked item with respect to which the crime against intellectual property was committed.</p>
<p>‘Infringing item’ means the item that violates the copyright or trademark laws.</p>
<p>‘Uploading’ means making an infringing item available on the Internet or a similar electronic bulletin board with the intent to enable other persons to download or otherwise copy, or have access to, the infringing item.</p>
<p>2. <em>Determination of Infringement Amount</em>.—This note applies to the determination of the infringement amount for purposes of subsection (b)(1).</p>
<p>(A) <em>Use of Retail Value of Infringed Item</em>.—The infringement amount is the retail value of the infringed item, multiplied by the number of infringing items, in a case involving any of the following:</p>
<p>(i) The infringing item (I) is, or appears to a reasonably informed purchaser to be, identical or substantially equivalent to the infringed item; or (II) is a digital or electronic reproduction of the infringed item.</p>
<p>(ii) The retail price of the infringing item is not less than 75% of the retail price of the infringed item.</p>
<p>(iii) The retail value of the infringing item is difficult or impossible to determine without unduly complicating or prolonging the sentencing proceeding.</p>
<p>(iv) The offense involves the illegal interception of a satellite cable transmission in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2511. (In a case involving such an offense, the ‘retail value of the infringed item’ is the price the user of the transmission would have paid to lawfully receive that transmission, and the ‘infringed item’ is the satellite transmission rather than the intercepting device.)</p>
<p>(v) The retail value of the infringed item provides a more accurate assessment of the pecuniary harm to the copyright or trademark owner than does the retail value of the infringing item.</p>
<p>(B) <em>Use of Retail Value of Infringing Item</em>.—The infringement amount is the retail value of the infringing item, multiplied by the number of infringing items, in any case not covered by subdivision (A) of this Application Note, including a case involving the unlawful recording of a musical performance in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2319A.</p>
<p>(C) <em>Retail Value Defined</em>.—For purposes of this Application Note, the ‘retail value’ of an infringed item or an infringing item is the retail price of that item in the market in which it is sold.</p>
<p>(D) <em>Determination of Infringement Amount in Cases Involving a Variety of Infringing Items</em>.—In a case involving a variety of infringing items, the infringement amount is the sum of all calculations made for those items under subdivisions (A) and (B) of this Application Note. For example, if the defendant sold both counterfeit videotapes that are identical in quality to the infringed videotapes and obviously inferior counterfeit handbags, the infringement amount, for purposes of subsection (b)(1), is the sum of the infringement amount calculated with respect to the counterfeit videotapes under subdivision (A)(i) (<em>i.e.</em>, the quantity of the infringing videotapes multiplied by the retail value of the infringed videotapes) and the infringement amount calculated with respect to the counterfeit handbags under subdivision (B) (<em>i.e.</em>, the quantity of the infringing handbags multiplied by the retail value of the infringing handbags).</p>
<p>3. <em>Uploading</em>.—With respect to uploading, subsection (b)(2) applies only to uploading with the intent to enable other persons to download or otherwise copy, or have access to, the infringing item. For example, this subsection applies in the case of illegally uploading copyrighted software to an Internet site, but it does not apply in the case of downloading or installing that software on a hard drive on the defendant’s personal computer.</p>
<p>4. <em>Application of §3B1.3</em>.—If the defendant de-encrypted or otherwise circumvented a technological security measure to gain initial access to an infringed item, an adjustment under §3B1.3 (Abuse of Position of Trust or Use of Special Skill) shall apply.</p>
<p>5. <em>Upward Departure Considerations</em>.—If the offense level determined under this guideline substantially understates the seriousness of the offense, an upward departure may be warranted. The following is a non-exhaustive list of factors that the court may consider in determining whether an upward departure may be warranted:</p>
<p>(A) The offense involved substantial harm to the reputation of the copyright or trademark owner.</p>
<p>(B) The offense was committed in connection with, or in furtherance of, the criminal activities of a national, or international, organized criminal enterprise.</p>
<p><em>Background</em>: This guideline treats copyright and trademark violations much like theft and fraud. Similar to the sentences for theft and fraud offenses, the sentences for defendants convicted of intellectual property offenses should reflect the nature and magnitude of the pecuniary harm caused by their crimes. Accordingly, similar to the loss enhancement in the theft and fraud guidelines, the infringement amount in subsection (b)(1) serves as a principal factor in determining the offense level for intellectual property offenses.</p>
<p>Subsection (b)(1) implements section 2(g) of the No Electronic Theft (NET) Act of 1997, Pub. L. 105–147, by using the retail value of the infringed item, multiplied by the number of infringing items, to determine the pecuniary harm for cases in which use of the retail value of the infringed item is a reasonable estimate of that harm. For cases referred to in Application Note 2(B), the Commission determined that use of the retail value of the infringed item would overstate the pecuniary harm or otherwise be inappropriate. In these types of cases, use of the retail value of the infringing item, multiplied by the number of those items, is a more reasonable estimate of the resulting pecuniary harm.</p>
<p>Section 2511 of title 18, United States Code, as amended by the Electronic Communications Act of 1986, prohibits the interception of satellite transmission for purposes of direct or indirect commercial advantage or private financial gain. Such violations are similar to copyright offenses and are therefore covered by this guideline.&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This amendment is in response to section 2(g) of the No Electronic Theft (NET) Act of 1997, Pub. L. 105–147 (&quot;the Act&quot;). The Act directs the Commission to ensure that the applicable guideline range for intellectual property offenses (including offenses set forth at section 506(a) of title 17, United States Code, and sections 2319, 2319A, and 2320 of title 18, United States Code) is &quot;sufficiently stringent to deter such a crime.&quot; It also more specifically requires that the guidelines &quot;provide for consideration of the retail value and quantity of the items with respect to which the intellectual property offense was committed.&quot;</p>
<p>The amendment responds to the directives by making changes to the monetary calculation found in §2B5.3 (Criminal Infringement of Copyright or Trademark). In addition, the amendment makes a number of other modifications to the infringement guideline, including the addition of several mitigating and aggravating factors, as further means of providing just and proportionate punishment while also seeking to achieve sufficient deterrence.</p>
<p>The monetary calculation in §2B5.3(b)(1), similar to the loss enhancement in the theft and fraud guidelines, serves as an approximation of the pecuniary harm caused by the offense and is a principal factor in determining the offense level for intellectual property offenses. Prior to this amendment, the monetary calculation for all intellectual property crimes was based on the retail value of the infringing item multiplied by the quantity of infringing items. In response to the directive, the Commission refashioned this enhancement so as to use the retail value of the infringed item, multiplied by the number of infringing items, as a means of approximating the pecuniary harm for cases in which that calculation is believed most likely to provide a reasonable estimate of the resulting harm. Use of that calculation is believed to provide a reasonable approximation for those classes of infringement cases in which it is highly likely that the sale of an infringing item results in a displaced sale of the legitimate, infringed item. The amendment also requires that the retail value of the infringed item, multiplied by the number of infringing items, be used in certain other cases for reasons of practicality.</p>
<p>However, based upon a review of cases sentenced under the former §2B5.3 over two years, the Commission further determined that using the above formula likely would overstate substantially the pecuniary harm caused to copyright and trademark owners in some cases currently sentenced under the guideline. For those cases, a one-to-one correlation between the sale of infringing items and the displaced sale of legitimate, infringed items is unlikely because the inferior quality of the infringing item and/or the greatly discounted price at which it is sold suggests that many purchasers of infringing items would not, or could not, have purchased the infringed item in the absence of the availability of the infringing item. The Commission therefore determined that, for these latter classes of cases (referred to in Application Note 2(B)), the retail value of the infringing item, multiplied by the number of those items, provides a more reasonable approximation of lost revenues to the copyright or trademark owner, and hence, of the pecuniary harm resulting from the offense.</p>
<p>This amendment also increases the base offense level from level 6 to level 8. The two-level increase in the base offense level brings the infringement guideline more in line with offense levels that would pertain under §2F1.1 (Fraud and Deceit), assuming applicability under that guideline of the two-level enhancement for more than minimal planning. Based on a review of cases sentenced under the infringement guideline, if a more than minimal planning enhancement did exist in that guideline, it would apply in the vast majority of such cases because they involve this kind of aggravating conduct. Rather than provide a separate enhancement within the revised guideline for &quot;more than minimal planning&quot; conduct, the Commission determined that the infringement guideline should incorporate this type of conduct into the base offense level.</p>
<p>This amendment also provides an enhancement of two levels, and a minimum offense level of level 12, if the offense involved the manufacture, importation, or uploading of infringing items. The Commission determined that defendants who engage in such conduct are more culpable than other intellectual property offenders because they place infringing items into the stream of commerce, thereby enabling others to infringe the copyright or trademark. A review of cases sentenced under the guideline indicated applicability of this enhancement to approximately two-thirds of the cases.</p>
<p>This amendment also provides a two-level downward adjustment (but to a resulting offense level that is not less than offense level 8) if the offense was not committed for commercial advantage or private financial gain. This adjustment reflects the fact that the Act establishes lower statutory penalties for offenses that were not committed for commercial advantage or private financial gain.</p>
<p>This amendment also provides an enhancement of two levels, and a minimum offense level of level 13, if the offense involved the conscious or reckless risk of serious bodily injury or possession of a dangerous weapon in connection with the offense. Testimony received by the Commission indicated that the conscious or reckless risk of serious bodily injury may occur in some cases involving counterfeit consumer products. The Commission determined that this kind of aggravating conduct in connection with infringement cases should be treated under the guidelines in the same way it is treated in connection with fraud cases; therefore, this enhancement is consistent with an identical provision in the fraud guideline.</p>
<p>The amendment also contains an application note expressly providing that the adjustment in §3B1.3 (Abuse of Position of Trust or Use of Special Skill) shall apply if the defendant de-encrypted or otherwise circumvented a technological security measure to gain initial access to an infringed item. As stated in the background commentary to §3B1.3, persons who use such a special skill to facilitate or commit a crime generally are viewed as more culpable.</p>
<p>Finally, this amendment contains two encouraged upward departure provisions. The Commission received public comment that indicated that infringement may cause substantial harm to the reputation of the copyright or trademark owner that is not accounted for in the monetary calculation. Public comment also indicated that some copyright and trademark offenses are committed in connection with, or in furtherance of, the criminal activities of certain organized crime enterprises. The amendment invites the court to consider an appropriate upward departure if either of these aggravating circumstances are present.</p>
<p>Pursuant to the emergency amendment authority of the Act, this amendment previously was promulgated as a temporary measure effective May 1, 2000. (<em>See</em> Amendment 590, <em>supra</em>).</p>

This amendment conforms methamphetamine (actual) penalties, as specified in the Drug Quantity Table in §2D1.1 (Unlawful Manufacturing, Importing, Exporting, or Trafficking), to the more stringent mandatory minimums established by the Act. In taking this action, the Commission follows the approach set forth in the original guidelines for the other principal controlled substances for which mandatory minimum penalties have been established by Congress. No change was made in the guideline penalties for methamphetamine mixture offenses because those penalties already corresponded to the mandatory minimum penalties as amended by the Act. <em>See</em> USSC <em>Guidelines</em> <em>Manual</em> Appendix C, Amendment 555, effective November 1, 1997.</p>

{id: 595, content:"<p><strong>595.</strong> <strong>Amendment:</strong> Sections 2B5.1, 2F1.1, and 3A1.1, effective November 1, 1998 (<em>see</em> Amendment 587, <em>supra</em>), are repromulgated without change.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This amendment implements, in a broader form, the directives to the Commission in section 6 of the Telemarketing Fraud Prevention Act of 1998, Pub. L. 105–184 (&quot;the Act&quot;).</p>
<p>The Act directs the Commission to provide for &quot;substantially increased penalties&quot; for telemarketing frauds. It also more specifically requires that the guidelines provide &quot;an additional appropriate sentencing enhancement, if the offense involved sophisticated means, including but not limited to sophisticated concealment efforts, such as perpetrating the offense from outside the United States,&quot; and &quot;an additional appropriate sentencing enhancement for cases in which a large number of vulnerable victims, including but not limited to [telemarketing fraud victims over age 55], are affected by a fraudulent scheme or schemes.&quot;</p>
<p>This amendment responds to the directives by building upon the amendments to the fraud guideline, §2F1.1 (Fraud and Deceit), that were submitted to Congress on May 1, 1998. (<em>See</em> Amendment 577, <em>supra</em>). Those amendments added a specific offense characteristic for &quot;mass-marketing,&quot; which is defined to include telemarketing, and a specific offense characteristic for sophisticated concealment.</p>
<p>This amendment broadens the &quot;sophisticated concealment&quot; enhancement to cover &quot;sophisticated means&quot; of executing or concealing a fraud offense. In addition, the amendment increases the enhancement under §3A1.1 (Hate Crime Motivation or Vulnerable Victim), for offenses that impact a large number of vulnerable victims.</p>
<p>This amendment also makes a conforming amendment to §2B5.1 in the definition of &quot;United States&quot;.</p>
<p>In designing enhancements that may apply more broadly than the Act’s above-stated directives minimally require, the Commission acts consistently with other directives in the Act (<em>e.g.</em>, section 6(c)(4) (requiring the Commission to ensure that its implementing amendments are reasonably consistent with other relevant directives to the Commission and other parts of the sentencing guidelines)) and with its basic mandate in sections 991 and 994 of title 28, United States Code (<em>e.g.</em>, 28 U.S.C. § 991(b)(1)(B)) (requiring sentencing policies that avoid unwarranted disparities among similarly situated defendants)).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;If the offense involved making a fraudulent loan or credit card application, or other unlawful conduct involving a loan, a counterfeit access device, or an unauthorized access device, the loss is to be determined in accordance with the Commentary to §2F1.1 (Fraud and Deceit). For example, in accordance with Application Note 17 of the Commentary to §2F1.1, in a case involving an unauthorized access device (such as a stolen credit card), loss includes any unauthorized charge(s) made with the access device. In such a case, the loss shall be not less than $500 per unauthorized access device. For purposes of this application note, ‘counterfeit access device’ and ‘unauthorized access device’ have the meaning given those terms in 18 U.S.C. § 1029(e)(2) and (e)(3), respectively.&quot;.</p>
<p>Section 2F1.1, as amended by Amendment 595 (<em>see</em> <em>supra</em>), is further amended by redesignating subsections (b)(5) through (b)(7) as subsections (b)(6) through (b)(8), respectively; and by inserting after subsection (b)(4) the following:</p>
<p>&quot;(5) If the offense involved—</p>
<p>(A) the possession or use of any device-making equipment;</p>
<p>(B) the production or trafficking of any unauthorized access device or counterfeit access device; or</p>
<p>(C) (i) the unauthorized transfer or use of any means of identification unlawfully to produce or obtain any other means of identification; or (ii) the possession of 5 or more means of identification that unlawfully were produced from another means of identification or obtained by the use of another means of identification,</p>
<p>increase by 2 levels. If the resulting offense level is less than level 12, increase to level 12.&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §2F1.1 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot;, as amended by Amendment 595 (<em>see</em> <em>supra</em>), is further amended in Note 12 in the first sentence by striking &quot;fraudulent identification documents and&quot;; by striking the second sentence in its entirety; in the third sentence, by striking &quot;the case of an offense involving false identification documents or access devices,&quot; and inserting &quot;such a case,&quot;; and by adding at the end the following paragraph:</p>
<p>&quot;Offenses involving identification documents, false identification documents, and means of identification, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1028, also are covered by this guideline. If the primary purpose of the offense was to violate, or assist another to violate, the law pertaining to naturalization, citizenship, or legal resident status, apply §2L2.1 (Trafficking in a Document Relating to Naturalization) or §2L2.2 (Fraudulently Acquiring Documents Relating to Naturalization), as appropriate, rather than §2F1.1.&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §2F1.1 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot;, as amended by Amendment 595 (<em>see</em> <em>supra</em>), is further amended by redesignating Notes 15 through 20 as Notes 18 through 23, respectively; and by inserting after Note 14 the following:</p>
<p>&quot;15. For purposes of subsection (b)(5)—</p>
<p>‘Counterfeit access device’ (A) has the meaning given that term in 18 U.S.C. § 1029(e)(2); and (B) also includes a telecommunications instrument that has been modified or altered to obtain unauthorized use of telecommunications service. ‘Telecommunications service’ has the meaning given that term in 18 U.S.C. § 1029(e)(9).</p>
<p>‘Device-making equipment’ (A) has the meaning given that term in 18 U.S.C. § 1029(e)(6); and (B) also includes (i) any hardware or software that has been configured as described in 18 U.S.C. § 1029(a)(9); and (ii) a scanning receiver referred to in 18 U.S.C. § 1029(a)(8). ‘Scanning receiver’ has the meaning given that term in 18 U.S.C. § 1029(e)(8).</p>
<p>‘Means of identification’ has the meaning given that term in 18 U.S.C. § 1028(d)(3), except that such means of identification shall be of an actual (<em>i.e.</em>, not fictitious) individual other than the defendant or a person for whose conduct the defendant is accountable under §1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct).</p>
<p>‘Produce’ includes manufacture, design, alter, authenticate, duplicate, or assemble. ‘Production’ includes manufacture, design, alteration, authentication, duplication, or assembly.</p>
<p>‘Unauthorized access device’ has the meaning given that term in 18 U.S.C. § 1029(e)(3).</p>
<p>16. Subsection (b)(5)(C)(i) applies in a case in which a means of identification of an individual other than the defendant (or a person for whose conduct the defendant is accountable under §1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct)) is used without that individual’s authorization unlawfully to produce or obtain another means of identification.</p>
<p>Examples of conduct to which this subsection should apply are as follows:</p>
<p>(A) A defendant obtains an individual’s name and social security number from a source (<em>e.g.</em>, from a piece of mail taken from the individual’s mailbox) and obtains a bank loan in that individual’s name. In this example, the account number of the bank loan is the other means of identification that has been obtained unlawfully.</p>
<p>(B) A defendant obtains an individual’s name and address from a source (<em>e.g.</em>, from a driver’s license in a stolen wallet) and applies for, obtains, and subsequently uses a credit card in that individual’s name. In this example, the credit card is the other means of identification that has been obtained unlawfully.</p>
<p>Examples of conduct to which subsection (b)(5)(C)(i) should not apply are as follows:</p>
<p>(A) A defendant uses a credit card from a stolen wallet only to make a purchase. In such a case, the defendant has not used the stolen credit card to obtain another means of identification.</p>
<p>(B) A defendant forges another individual’s signature to cash a stolen check. Forging another individual’s signature is not producing another means of identification.</p>
<p>Subsection (b)(5)(C)(ii) applies in any case in which the offense involved the possession of 5 or more means of identification that unlawfully were produced or obtained, regardless of the number of individuals in whose name (or other identifying information) the means of identification were so produced or so obtained.</p>
<p>In a case involving unlawfully produced or unlawfully obtained means of identification, an upward departure may be warranted if the offense level does not adequately address the seriousness of the offense. Examples may include the following:</p>
<p>(A) The offense caused substantial harm to the victim’s reputation or credit record, or the victim suffered a substantial inconvenience related to repairing the victim’s reputation or a damaged credit record.</p>
<p>(B) An individual whose means of identification the defendant used to obtain unlawful means of identification is erroneously arrested or denied a job because an arrest record has been made in the individual’s name.</p>
<p>(C) The defendant produced or obtained numerous means of identification with respect to one individual and essentially assumed that individual’s identity.</p>
<p>17. In a case involving any counterfeit access device or unauthorized access device, loss includes any unauthorized charges made with the counterfeit access device or unauthorized access device. In any such case, loss shall be not less than $500 per access device. However, if the unauthorized access device is a means of telecommunications access that identifies a specific telecommunications instrument or telecommunications account (including an electronic serial number/mobile identification number (ESN/MIN) pair), and that means was only possessed, and not used, during the commission of the offense, loss shall be not less than $100 per unused means. For purposes of this application note, ‘counterfeit access device’ and ‘unauthorized access device’ have the meaning given those terms in Application Note 15.&quot;.</p>

<p>The Commentary to §2F1.1 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot;, as amended by Amendment 595 (<em>see</em> <em>supra</em>), is further amended by striking redesignated Note 23 (formerly Note 20), in its entirety and inserting the following:</p>
<p>&quot;23. If subsection (b)(5), subsection (b)(8)(A), or subsection (b)(8)(B) applies, there shall be a rebuttable presumption that the offense also involved more than minimal planning for purposes of subsection (b)(2).</p>
<p>If the conduct that forms the basis for an enhancement under subsection (b)(5) is the only conduct that forms the basis of an enhancement under subsection (b)(6), do not apply an enhancement under subsection (b)(6).&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §2F1.1 captioned &quot;Background&quot;, as amended by Amendment 595 (<em>see</em> <em>supra</em>), is further amended by striking the sixth paragraph and all that follows through the end of the &quot;Background&quot; and inserting the following:</p>
<p>&quot; Subsections (b)(5)(A) and(B) implement the instruction to the Commission in section 4 of the Wireless Telephone Protection Act, Public Law 105–172.</p>
<p>Subsection (b)(5)(C) implements the directive to the Commission in section 4 of the Identity Theft and Assumption Deterrence Act of 1998, Public Law 105–318. This subsection focuses principally on an aggravated form of identity theft known as ‘affirmative identity theft’ or ‘breeding,’ in which a defendant uses another individual’s name, social security number, or some other form of identification (the ‘means of identification’) to ‘breed’ (<em>i.e.</em>, produce or obtain) new or additional forms of identification. Because 18 U.S.C. § 1028(d) broadly defines ‘means of identification,’ the new or additional forms of identification can include items such as a driver’s license, a credit card, or a bank loan. This subsection provides a minimum offense level of level 12, in part, because of the seriousness of the offense. The minimum offense level accounts for the fact that the means of identification that were ‘bred’ (<em>i.e.</em>, produced or obtained) often are within the defendant’s exclusive control, making it difficult for the individual victim to detect that the victim’s identity has been ‘stolen.’ Generally, the victim does not become aware of the offense until certain harms have already occurred (<em>e.g.</em>, a damaged credit rating or inability to obtain a loan). The minimum offense level also accounts for the non-monetary harm associated with these types of offenses, much of which may be difficult or impossible to quantify (<em>e.g.</em>, harm to the individual’s reputation or credit rating, inconvenience, and other difficulties resulting from the offense). The legislative history of the Identity Theft and Assumption Deterrence Act of 1998 indicates that Congress was especially concerned with providing increased punishment for this type of harm.</p>
<p>Subsection (b)(6) implements, in a broader form, the instruction to the Commission in section 6(c)(2) of Public Law 105–184.</p>
<p>Subsection (b)(7)(B) implements, in a broader form, the instruction to the Commission in section 110512 of Public Law 103–322.</p>
<p>Subsection (b)(8)(A) implements, in a broader form, the instruction to the Commission in section 961(m) of Public Law 101–73.</p>
<p>Subsection (b)(8)(B) implements the instruction to the Commission in section 2507 of Public Law 101–647.</p>
<p>Subsection (c) implements the instruction to the Commission in section 805(c) of Public Law 104–132.&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This is a five-part amendment. First, this amendment provides a two-level increase and a minimum offense level of level 12 for offenses involving (1) the possession or use of equipment that is used to manufacture access devices; (2) the production of, or trafficking in, unauthorized and counterfeit access devices, such as stolen credit cards and cloned wireless telephones; or (3) affirmative identity theft (<em>i.e.</em>, unlawfully producing from any means of identification any other means of identification). Affirmative identity theft, referred to in the research and analysis conducted by the Commission as the &quot;breeding&quot; of identification means, will result in an enhanced penalty in any case in which there is a transfer or use of another person’s means of identification unlawfully to produce or &quot;breed&quot; additional means of identification, or in which there is the possession of five or more means of identification that were unlawfully produced.</p>
<p>Second, this amendment provides a rebuttable presumption that the offense involved more than minimal planning, and it contains a rule to avoid &quot;double counting&quot; between the existing enhancement for &quot;sophisticated means&quot; based on the same conduct.</p>
<p>Third, the amendment provides a revised minimum loss rule for offenses involving counterfeit or unauthorized access devices. Specifically, this rule requires that a minimum loss amount of $500 per access device be used when calculating the loss involved in the offense. However, for offenses that involve only the possession, and not the use, of a means of telecommunications access that identifies a specific telecommunications instrument or telecommunications account (<em>e.g.</em>, an ESN/MIN pair used to obtain telecommunications service in a wireless telephone), the rule provides a minimum loss amount of $100 per unused means.</p>
<p>Fourth, this amendment provides an encouraged upward departure if the offense level does not adequately reflect the seriousness of the offense conduct. Examples of cases in which a departure may be warranted include those in which (1) an identity theft caused substantial harm to the victim’s reputation or credit record; (2) an individual is arrested, or is denied a job, because of a misidentification that results from an identity theft; or (3) a defendant essentially assumed the victim’s identity.</p>
<p>Fifth, this amendment incorporates the statutory definitions of 18 U.S.C. §§ 1028 and 1029, although it also broadens the definitions of &quot;counterfeit access device&quot; and &quot;device-making equipment&quot; for guideline purposes.</p>
<p>This amendment responds to the directives to the Commission contained in section 4 of the Identity Theft and Assumption Deterrence Act of 1998, Pub. L. 105–318(b)(1) (&quot;ITADA&quot;) and section 2 of the Wireless Telephone Protection Act, Pub. L. 105–172 (&quot;WTPA&quot;). For the reasons discussed below and because of the overlap in some of the statutory definitions in the ITADA and the WTPA (particularly &quot;access device,&quot; &quot;telecommunication identifying information,&quot; and &quot;means of identification&quot;), enhancements have been consolidated into a single guideline amendment.</p>
<p>The ITADA and the WTPA directed the Commission to &quot;review and amend the Federal sentencing guidelines and the policy statements of the Commission&quot; to provide appropriate punishment for identity theft offenses under 18 U.S.C. § 1028 and for offenses under 18 U.S.C. § 1029 related to the cloning of wireless telephones.</p>
<p>The WTPA directed the Commission to review, among other factors, &quot;the range of conduct covered by&quot; cloning offenses. Although cloned telephones may be possessed and used in connection with a variety of offenses, the Commission determined that the possession or use of a cloned phone does not necessarily increase the seriousness of the underlying offense. However, the Commission decided that offenders who manufacture or distribute cloned telephones are more culpable than offenders who only possess them. Accordingly, the new enhancements at §2F1.1(b)(5)(A) and (B) recognize that such offenders warrant greater punishment. However, to ensure that the guidelines apply consistently to similarly serious conduct regardless of the technology employed, this amendment provides for a broader enhancement that applies to the manufacture or distribution of any access device, including a cloned telephone.</p>
<p>The ITADA directed the Commission to assess certain specific factors in its consideration of appropriate penalties for identity theft, including: the number of victims; the harm to a victim’s reputation and inconvenience caused by the offense; the number of means of identification, identification documents, or false identification documents involved in the offense; the range of offense conduct; and, the adequacy of the value of loss to an individual victim as a measure for establishing penalties.</p>
<p>In conducting research pursuant to the ITADA, the Commission learned that identity theft, as defined broadly under the new statutory provisions at 18 U.S.C. §§ 1028(a)(7) and 1028(d)(3), occurs along a continuum of offense conduct. The most basic type of identity theft occurs when a thief steals a wallet and uses a stolen credit card to make a purchase or forges a signature to cash a stolen check. However, after analyzing the legislative history of the ITADA and Commission data, the Commission determined that the more aggravated and sophisticated forms of identity theft, about which Congress seemed particularly concerned, should be the focus of enhanced punishment under the guidelines. Such offense conduct, which generally occurs within the context of financial and credit account take-overs, involves affirmative activity to generate or &quot;breed&quot; another level of identification means without the knowledge of the individual victim whose identification means are misused, purloined, or &quot;taken over&quot;. This activity is considered more sophisticated because of the additional steps the perpetrator takes to &quot;breed&quot; additional means of identification in order to conceal and continue the fraudulent conduct. Such sophisticated conduct makes detection by both the individual and institutional victims much more difficult. It also has the potential to increase harm, both monetary and non-monetary, to the individual victims (about whom Congress was particularly concerned in enacting the ITADA), and can result in substantial disruption of record-keeping by governmental agencies and private financial institutions upon which the stream of commerce depends. Thus, the Commission determined that this aggravated offense conduct, in contrast to the most basic forms of identity theft, merits enhanced punishment.</p>
<p>Accordingly, amended section §2F1.1(b)(5)(C) recognizes that the conduct of generating or &quot;breeding&quot; identification means warrants substantial additional penalties. The minimum offense level of level 12 accounts for the fact that the defendant in an identity theft case typically has exclusive control over the &quot;bred&quot; means of identification, making it difficult for the individual victim to detect that the victim’s identity has been stolen until substantial harms (<em>e.g.</em>, a damaged credit rating) have occurred. The minimum offense level also accounts for the non-monetary harms associated with identity theft (<em>e.g.</em>, harm to reputation or credit rating), which typically are difficult to quantify. However, for cases in which the nature and scope of the harm to an individual victim is so egregious that the two-level enhancement and minimum offense level provide insufficient punishment, the amendment invites an upward departure.</p>
<p>The WTPA directed the Commission to review &quot;the extent to which the value of the loss caused by the offenses. . . is an adequate measure for establishing penalties. . . .&quot; The amendment provides a minimum loss rule in §2F1.1 that extends to all access devices, not just to cloned wireless telephones. In so doing, similar fraud cases will be treated similarly regardless of the technology or type of access device used in the offense. Additionally, the Commission’s research and data supported increasing the minimum loss amount, previously provided only in §2B1.1 (Larceny, Embezzlement, and Other Forms of Theft), from $100 to $500 per access device. However, the data were insufficient to support using this increased amount in cases that involve only the possession, and not the use, of means of telecommunications access that identify a specific telecommunications instrument or account (<em>e.g.</em>, ESN/MIN pairs of wireless telephones). (An example of such a case is a defendant who possesses a list of ESN/MIN pairs but has not used any of those pairs to clone wireless telephones.) For such cases, the Commission decided that the minimum loss amount should be $100 per unused means.</p>

<p>The Commentary to §2F1.1 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot;, as amended by Amendment 595 (<em>see</em> <em>supra</em>), is further amended by striking Note 6 in its entirety and inserting the following:</p>
<p>&quot;6. Subsection (b)(4)(C) provides an enhancement if the defendant commits a fraud in contravention of a prior, official judicial or administrative warning, in the form of an order, injunction, decree, or process, to take or not to take a specified action. A defendant who does not comply with such a prior, official judicial or administrative warning demonstrates aggravated criminal intent and deserves additional punishment. If it is established that an entity the defendant controlled was a party to the prior proceeding that resulted in the official judicial or administrative action, and the defendant had knowledge of that prior decree or order, this enhancement applies even if the defendant was not a specifically named party in that prior case. For example, a defendant whose business previously was enjoined from selling a dangerous product, but who nonetheless engaged in fraudulent conduct to sell the product, is subject to this enhancement. This enhancement does not apply if the same conduct resulted in an enhancement pursuant to a provision found elsewhere in the guidelines (<em>e.g.</em>, a violation of a condition of release addressed in §2J1.7 (Commission of Offense While on Release) or a violation of probation addressed in §4A1.1 (Criminal History Category)).</p>
<p>If the conduct that forms the basis for an enhancement under (b)(4)(B) or (C) is the only conduct that forms the basis for an adjustment under §3C1.1 (Obstruction of Justice), do not apply an adjustment under §3C1.1.&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §2F1.1 captioned &quot;Background&quot;, as amended by Amendment 595 (<em>see</em> <em>supra</em>), is further amended by striking the fourth sentence of the fourth paragraph and inserting the following:</p>
<p>&quot;The commission of a fraud in the course of a bankruptcy proceeding subjects the defendant to an enhanced sentence because that fraudulent conduct undermines the bankruptcy process as well as harms others with an interest in the bankruptcy estate.&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> The amendment was prompted by the circuit conflict regarding whether the enhancement in §2F1.1 (Fraud and Deceit) for &quot;violation of any judicial or administrative order, injunction, decree, or process&quot; applies to false statements made during bankruptcy proceedings. <em>Compare</em> <em>United States v. Saacks</em>, 131 F.3d 540 (5th Cir. 1997) (bankruptcy fraud implicates the violation of a judicial or administrative order or process within the meaning of the enhancement; <em>United States v. Michalek</em>, 54 F.3d 325 (7th Cir. 1995) (bankruptcy fraud is a &quot;special procedure&quot;; it is a violation of a specific adjudicatory process); <em>United States v. Lloyd</em>, 947 F.2d 339 (8th Cir. 1991) (knowing concealment of assets in bankruptcy fraud violates &quot;judicial process&quot;); <em>United States v. Welch</em>, 103 F.3d 906 (9th Cir. 1996) (<em>same</em>); <em>United States v. Messner</em>, 107 F.3d 1448 (10th Cir. 1997) (<em>same</em>); <em>United States v. Bellew</em>, 35 F.3d 518 (11th Cir. 1994) (knowing concealment of assets during bankruptcy proceedings qualifies as a violation of a &quot;judicial order&quot;), <em>with</em> <em>United States v. Shadduck</em>, 112 F.3d 523 (1st Cir. 1997) (falsely filling out bankruptcy forms does not violate judicial process since the debtor is not accorded a position of trust). <em>See</em> <em>also</em> <em>United States v. Carrozella</em>, 105 F. 3d 796 (2d Cir. 1997) (district court erred in enhancing the sentence for violation of judicial process in the case of a defendant who filed false accounts in probate court).</p>
<p>The majority of circuits have held that the current enhancement applies to a defendant who conceals assets in a bankruptcy case because the conduct violates a judicial order or violates judicial process. Commission data indicate that, in fiscal year 1998, 41 defendants received an increase for either &quot;violation of a judicial order . . . or misrepresentation of a charitable organization.&quot; The data did not distinguish between the two parts of the enhancement.</p>
<p>This amendment creates a separate and distinct basis for a two-level enhancement under the fraud guideline for a misrepresentation or false statement made in the course of a bankruptcy proceeding. Additionally, the existing enhancement and its accompanying commentary are modified to make clear that, in order for the enhancement to apply in a fraud case not involving a bankruptcy proceeding, there must be a false statement in violation of a specific, prior order. Therefore, any case involving a bankruptcy fraud will result in a two-level enhancement, but in the case of a non-bankruptcy fraud, the enhancement will apply only if a defendant was given prior notice of a particular action. The Commission has decided to treat bankruptcy fraud more severely because of its adverse impact on the bankruptcy judicial process and because of the additional harm and seriousness involved in such conduct. <em>See</em> <em>United States v. Saacks</em>, 131 F.3d 540, 543</p>
<p>(5<sup>th</sup> Cir. 1997) (noting that bankruptcy fraud is more serious than &quot;the most pedestrian federal fraud offense&quot;).</p>

{id: 598, content:"<p><strong>598.</strong> <strong>Amendment:</strong> Section 2K2.4 is amended by striking subsection (a) in its entirety and inserting the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;(a) If the defendant, whether or not convicted of another crime, was convicted of violating:</p>
<p>(1) Section 844(h) of title 18, United States Code, the guideline sentence is the term of imprisonment required by statute.</p>
<p>(2) Section 924(c) or section 929(a) of title 18, United States Code, the guideline sentence is the minimum term of imprisonment required by statute.&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §2K2.4 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended by striking Note 1 in its entirety and inserting the following:</p>
<p>&quot;1. Section 844(h) of title 18, United State Code, provides a mandatory term of imprisonment of 10 years (or 20 years for the second or subsequent offense). Sections 924(c) and 929(a) of title 18, United States Code, provide mandatory minimum terms of imprisonment (<em>e.g.</em>, not less than five years). Subsection (a) reflects this distinction. Accordingly, the guideline sentence for a defendant convicted under 18 U.S.C. § 844(h) is the term required by the statute, and the guideline sentence for a defendant convicted under 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) or § 929(a) is the minimum term required by the relevant statute. Each of 18 U.S.C. §§ 844(h), 924(c), and 929(a) requires a term of imprisonment imposed under this section to run consecutively to any other term of imprisonment.</p>
<p>A sentence above the minimum term required by 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) or § 929(a) is an upward departure from the guideline sentence. A departure may be warranted, for example, to reflect the seriousness of the defendant’s criminal history, particularly in a case in which the defendant is convicted of an 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) or § 929(a) offense and has at least two prior felony convictions for a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense that would have resulted in application of §4B1.1 (Career Offender) if that guideline applied to these offenses. <em>See</em> Application Note 3.&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §2K2.4 captioned &quot;Background&quot; is amended by striking the first sentence in its entirety and inserting the following:</p>
<p>&quot;Section 844(h) of title 18, United States Code, provides a mandatory term of imprisonment. Sections 924(c) and 929(a) of title 18, United States Code, provide mandatory minimum terms of imprisonment. A sentence imposed pursuant to any of these statutes must be imposed to run consecutively to any other term of imprisonment.&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §3D1.1 captioned &quot;Application Note&quot; is amended in Note 1 in the second sentence by striking &quot;mandatory term of five years&quot; and inserting &quot;mandatory minimum terms of imprisonment, based on the conduct involved,&quot;; and in the seventh sentence by inserting &quot;minimum&quot; after &quot;mandatory&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §5G1.2 is amended in the second sentence of the last paragraph by striking &quot;mandatory term of five years&quot; and inserting &quot;mandatory minimum terms of imprisonment, based on the conduct involved,&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This amendment revises §2K2.4 (Use of Firearm, Armor-Piercing Ammunition, or Explosive During or in Relation to Certain Crimes) to (1) clarify how the minimum, consecutive terms of imprisonment mandated by the statutes indexed to this guideline should be treated for purposes of guideline application; and (2) specify guideline sentences, for all statutes indexed to §2K2.4, that comply with the Commission’s mandate in 28 U.S.C. § 994(b)(2) (requiring guideline sentencing ranges in which the maximum shall not exceed the minimum by more than the greater of 25 percent or six months). The Act to Throttle the Criminal Use of Guns, Pub. L. 105–386, changed the penalty provisions in 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) from fixed terms of years to ranges of &quot;not less than&quot; various terms of years. This effectively establishes mandatory minimum terms of imprisonment with implicit maximum terms of life. Section 929(a) of title 18, United States Code, contains similar provisions. Section 2K2.4 continues to provide that, in both cases, the term of imprisonment imposed under the statute should be determined independently of the usual guideline application rules and the sentence imposed should run consecutively to any other term of imprisonment. <em>See</em> §5G1.2(a). However, §2K2.4 previously stated that the term of imprisonment was that &quot;required by statute.&quot; Because two of the statutes indexed to the guideline now provide for terms of a range of years, questions arose as to whether any sentence within the statutorily authorized range complied with the guidelines.</p>
<p>The amendment clarifies that the guideline sentence is the minimum term required by the statute of conviction, that a term greater than this minimum is an upward departure and should be imposed using the normal standards and procedures that apply to departures from the guideline range, and that such upward departures are invited under certain circumstances. <em>See</em> 18 U.S.C. § 3553(b). For example, career offenders who are convicted both of an offense under 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) and of an underlying crime of violence or drug trafficking typically will receive lengthy guideline sentences. This amendment modifies Application Note 1 of §2K2.4 to encourage an upward departure in the unusual circumstance in which an offender is convicted only of 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) and would have qualified as a career offender if that guideline applied to such convictions, or in other unusual circumstances in which the sentence in a particular case does not adequately reflect the seriousness of the defendant’s criminal history. Because 18 U.S.C. § 844(h) still provides for fixed terms of imprisonment, the amendment differentiates it from the two statutes that provide for terms of a range of years.</p>
<p>The amendment also contains technical and conforming changes: §§3D1.1 (Procedure for Determining Offense Level on Multiple Counts) and 5G1.2 (Sentencing on Multiple Counts</p>
<p>of Conviction) are revised to reflect a change to the penalty provision of 18 U.S.C. § 924(c).</p>

{id: 599, content:"<p><strong>599.</strong> <strong>Amendment:</strong> The Commentary to §2K2.4 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended in Note 2 in the second paragraph by striking &quot;paragraph&quot; after &quot;preceding&quot; and inserting &quot;paragraphs&quot;; and by striking the first paragraph in its entirety and inserting the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;If a sentence under this guideline is imposed in conjunction with a sentence for an underlying offense, do not apply any specific offense characteristic for possession, brandishing, use, or discharge of an explosive or firearm when determining the sentence for the underlying offense. A sentence under this guideline accounts for any explosive or weapon enhancement for the underlying offense of conviction, including any such enhancement that would apply based on conduct for which the defendant is accountable under §1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct). Do not apply any weapon enhancement in the guideline for the underlying offense, for example, if (A) a co-defendant, as part of the jointly undertaken criminal activity, possessed a firearm different from the one for which the defendant was convicted under 18 U.S.C. § 924(c); or (B) in an ongoing drug trafficking offense, the defendant possessed a firearm other than the one for which the defendant was convicted under 18 U.S.C. § 924(c). However, if a defendant is convicted of two armed bank robberies, but is convicted under 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) in connection with only one of the robberies, a weapon enhancement would apply to the bank robbery which was not the basis for the 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) conviction.</p>
<p>If the explosive or weapon that was possessed, brandished, used, or discharged in the course of the underlying offense also results in a conviction that would subject the defendant to an enhancement under §2K1.3(b)(3) (pertaining to possession of explosive material in connection with another felony offense) or §2K2.1(b)(5) (pertaining to possession of any firearm or ammunition in connection with another felony offense), do not apply that enhancement. A sentence under this guideline accounts for the conduct covered by these enhancements because of the relatedness of that conduct to the conduct that forms the basis for the conviction under 18 U.S.C. § 844(h), § 924(c) or § 929(a). For example, if in addition to a conviction for an underlying offense of armed bank robbery, the defendant was convicted of being a felon in possession under 18 U.S.C. § 922(g), the enhancement under §2K2.1(b)(5) would not apply.&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §2K2.4 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot;, as amended by Amendment 600 (<em>see</em> <em>supra</em>), is further amended in Note 5 (formerly Note 4) in the third sentence by inserting &quot;brandishing,&quot; after &quot;possession,&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §2K2.4 captioned &quot;Background&quot; is amended in the second sentence by inserting &quot;brandishing,&quot; after &quot;use,&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This amendment expands the commentary in Application Note 2 of §2K2.4 (Use of Firearm, Armor-Piercing Ammunition, or Explosive During or in Relation to Certain Crimes) to clarify under what circumstances defendants sentenced for violations of 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) in conjunction with convictions for other offenses may receive weapon enhancements contained in the guidelines for those other offenses. The amendment directs that no guideline weapon enhancement should be applied when determining the sentence for the crime of violence or drug trafficking offense underlying the 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) conviction, nor for any conduct with respect to that offense for which the defendant is accountable under §1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct). Guideline weapon enhancements may be applied, however, when determining the sentence for counts of conviction outside the scope of relevant conduct for the underlying offense (<em>e.g</em>., a conviction for a second armed bank robbery for which no 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) conviction was obtained).</p>
<p>For similar reasons, this amendment also expands the application note to clarify that offenders who receive a sentence under §2K2.4 should not receive enhancements under §2K1.3(b)(3) (pertaining to explosive material connected with another offense), or §2K2.1(b)(5) (pertaining to firearms or ammunition possessed, used, or transferred in connection with another offense) with respect to any weapon, ammunition, or explosive connected to the offense underlying the count of conviction sentenced under §2K2.4.</p>
<p>The purposes of this amendment are to (1) avoid unwarranted disparity and duplicative punishment; and (2) conform application of guideline weapon enhancements with general guideline principles. The relevant application note to §2K2.4 previously stated that if a sentence was imposed under §2K2.4 in conjunction with a sentence for &quot;an underlying offense,&quot; no weapon enhancement should be applied with respect to the guideline for the underlying offense. Some courts interpreted &quot;underlying offense&quot; narrowly to mean only the &quot;crime of violence&quot; or &quot;drug trafficking offense&quot; that forms the basis for the 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) conviction. <em>See,</em> <em>e.g.</em>, <em>United States v. Flennory</em>,145 F.3d 1264, 1268-69 (11<sup>th</sup> Cir. 1998), <em>cert</em>. <em>denied</em>, 119 S.Ct. 1130 (1999). <em>But</em> <em>see</em> <em>United States v. Smith</em>, 196 F.3d 676, 679-82 (6<sup>th</sup> Cir. 1999) (a conviction under 18 U.S.C. § 922(g) qualifies as an &quot;underlying offense,&quot; and thus, application of the enhancement in §2K2.1(b)(5) was impermissible double-counting). In other cases, offenders have received both the mandated statutory penalty and a guideline weapon enhancement in circumstances in which the guidelines generally would require a single weapon enhancement. <em>See</em> <em>United States v. Gonzalez</em>, 183 F.3d 1315, 1325-26 (11<sup>th</sup> Cir.), <em>cert</em>. <em>denied</em>, 120 S.Ct. 996 (2000) (both statutory and guideline increases may be imposed if defendant and accomplice used different weapons as part of a joint undertaking); <em>United States v. Willett</em>, 90 F.3d 404, 407-08 (9<sup>th</sup> Cir. 1996) (not double counting to apply both increases for separate weapons possessed by defendant). <em>But</em> <em>see</em> <em>United States v. Knobloch</em>, 131 F.3d 366, 372 (3d Cir. 1996) (error to apply guideline enhancement in addition to statutory penalty &quot;even if the section 924(c)(1) sentence is for a different weapon than the weapon upon which the enhancement is predicated.&quot;).</p>
<p>The amendment clarifies application of the commentary, consistent with the definition of &quot;offense&quot; found in §1B1.1 (Application Note 1(<em>l</em>)) and with general guideline principles. It addresses disparate application arising from conflicting interpretations of the current guideline in different courts, and is intended to avoid the duplicative punishment that results when sentences are increased under both the statutes and the guidelines for substantially the same harm.</p>
<p>Finally, Application Notes 2 and 4 and the Background Commentary of §2K2.4 are revised to reflect changes to 18 U.S.C. § 924(c), made by the Act to Throttle the Criminal Use of Guns, Pub. L. 105–386, with respect to &quot;brandishing&quot; a firearm.</p>

<p>&quot;3. Do not apply Chapter Three (Adjustments) and Chapter Four (Criminal History and Criminal Livelihood) to any offense sentenced under this guideline. Such offenses are excluded from application of these chapters because the guideline sentence for each offense is determined only by the relevant statute. <em>See</em> §§3D1.1 (Procedure for Determining Offense Level on Multiple Counts) and 5G1.2 (Sentencing on Multiple Counts of Conviction).&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §4B1.2 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended in Note 1 by striking &quot;Possessing a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence&quot; and all that follows through the end of the first sentence and inserting the following:</p>
<p>&quot;A prior conviction for violating 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) or § 929(a) is a ‘prior felony conviction’ for purposes of applying §4B1.1 (Career Offender) if the prior offense of conviction established that the underlying offense was a ‘crime of violence’ or ‘controlled substance offense.’&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §4B1.2 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended by redesignating Notes 2 and 3 as Notes 3 and 4, respectively; and by inserting after Note 1 the following:</p>
<p>&quot;2. The guideline sentence for a conviction under 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) or § 929(a) is determined only by the statute and is imposed independently of any other sentence. <em>See</em> §§2K2.4 (Use of Firearm, Armor-Piercing Ammunition, or Explosive During or in Relation to Certain Crimes), 3D1.1 (Procedure for Determining Offense Level on Multiple Counts), and subsection (a) of §5G1.2 (Sentencing on Multiple Counts of Conviction). Accordingly, do not apply this guideline if the only offense of conviction is for violating 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) or § 929(a). For provisions pertaining to an upward departure from the guideline sentence for a conviction under 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) or § 929(a), <em>see</em> Application Note 1 of §2K2.4.&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This amendment revises §§2K2.4 (Use of Firearm, Armor-Piercing Ammunition, or Explosive During or in Relation to Certain Crimes) and 4B1.2 (Definitions of Terms Used in Section 4B1.1) to clarify guideline application for offenders convicted under 18 U.S.C. §§ 924(c) and 929(a) who might also qualify as career offenders under the rules and definitions provided in §§4B1.1 (Career Offender) and 4B1.2. This amendment preserves the <em>status</em> <em>quo</em> as it existed prior to the statutory changes to 18 U.S.C. § 924(c), made by the Act to Throttle the Criminal Use of Guns, Pub. L. 105–386, that established a statutory maximum of life for all violations of the statute.</p>
<p>This amendment adds a new Application Note 3 to §2K2.4 directing courts not to apply Chapter Three (Adjustments) or Chapter Four (Criminal History and Criminal Livelihood) to any offense sentenced under §2K2.4. This effectively prohibits the use of 18 U.S.C.</p>

<p>§ 924(c) will continue to qualify as &quot;prior felony convictions&quot; under the career offender guideline in most circumstances.</p>

<p>The Commentary to §1B1.1 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended in Note 1 by striking subdivision (d) in its entirety and inserting the following:</p>
<p>&quot;(d) ‘Dangerous weapon’ means (i) an instrument capable of inflicting death or serious bodily injury; or (ii) an object that is not an instrument capable of inflicting death or serious bodily injury but (I) closely resembles such an instrument; or (II) the defendant used the object in a manner that created the impression that the object was such an instrument (<em>e.g</em>. a defendant wrapped a hand in a towel during a bank robbery to create the appearance of a gun).&quot;.</p>

<p>The Commentary to §2B3.1 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended by striking Note 2 in its entirety and inserting the following:</p>
<p>&quot;2. Consistent with Application Note 1(d)(ii) of §1B1.1 (Application Instructions), an object shall be considered to be a dangerous weapon for purposes of subsection (b)(2)(E) if (A) the object closely resembles an instrument capable of inflicting death or serious bodily injury; or (B) the defendant used the object in a manner that created the impression that the object was an instrument capable of inflicting death or serious bodily injury (<em>e.g.</em>, a defendant wrapped a hand in a towel during a bank robbery to create the appearance of a gun).&quot;.</p>
<p>Section 2B3.2(b)(3) is amended by striking &quot;displayed,&quot; each place it appears.</p>
<p>Section 2E2.1(b)(1)(C) is amended by striking &quot;, displayed&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This amendment conforms the guideline definition of &quot;brandish&quot; found at Application Note 1(c) of §1B1.1 (Application Instructions) to a statutory definition, which was added by the Act to Throttle the Criminal Use of Guns, Pub. L. 105–386, and is codified at 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(4). The purposes of this amendment are to (1) avoid confusion that can be caused by different guideline and statutory definitions of identical terms; and (2) increase punishment in some circumstances for persons who &quot;make the presence of the weapon known to another person, in order to intimidate that person,&quot; regardless of whether the weapon is visible. As was the case prior to this amendment, the guideline definition of &quot;brandish&quot; applies to all dangerous weapons and not only to firearms.</p>
<p>The definition of &quot;dangerous weapon&quot; in Application Note 1(d) of §1B1.1 also is amended to clarify under what circumstances an object that is not an actual, dangerous weapon should be treated as one for purposes of guideline application. The amendment is in accord with the decisions in <em>United States v. Shores</em>, 966 F.2d 1383 (11<sup>th</sup> Cir. 1992) (toy gun carried but never used by a defendant qualifies as a dangerous weapon because of its potential, if it were used, to arouse fear in victims and dangerous reactions by police or security personnel) and <em>United States v. Dixon</em>, 982 F.2d 116 (3<sup>rd</sup> Cir. 1992) (hand wrapped in a towel qualifies as a dangerous weapon if the defendant’s actions created the impression that the defendant possessed a dangerous weapon).</p>
<p>The amendment also deletes the term &quot;displayed&quot; wherever it appears in the <em>Guidelines Manual</em> in an enhancement with &quot;brandished.&quot; Because &quot;brandished&quot; applies in any case in which &quot;all or part of the weapon was displayed,&quot; the Commission determined the inclusion of &quot;displayed&quot; in these enhancements is redundant. This part of the amendment is not intended to make a substantive change in the guidelines.</p>

<p>Chapter Five, Part K, Subpart 2, is amended by inserting at the end the following:</p>
<p>&quot;§5K2.19. <em>Post-Sentencing Rehabilitative Efforts</em> (Policy Statement)</p>
<p>Post-sentencing rehabilitative efforts, even if exceptional, undertaken by a defendant after imposition of a term of imprisonment for the instant offense are not an appropriate basis for a downward departure when resentencing the defendant for that offense. (Such efforts may provide a basis for early termination of supervised release under 18 U.S.C. § 3583(e)(1).)</p>
<p><em>Commentary</em></p>
<p><em>Background</em>: The Commission has determined that post-sentencing rehabilitative measures should not provide a basis for downward departure when resentencing a defendant initially sentenced to a term of imprisonment because such a departure would (1) be inconsistent with the policies established by Congress under 18 U.S.C. § 3624(b) and other statutory provisions for reducing the time to be served by an imprisoned person; and (2) inequitably benefit only those who gain the opportunity to be resentenced <em>de</em> <em>novo</em>.&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This amendment was prompted by the circuit conflict regarding whether sentencing courts may consider an offender’s post-offense rehabilitative efforts while in prison or on probation as a basis for downward departure at resentencing following an appeal. <em>Compare</em> <em>United States v. Rhodes</em>, 145 F.3d 1375, 1379 (D.C. Cir. 1998) (post-conviction rehabilitation is not a prohibited factor and, therefore, sentencing courts may consider it as a possible ground for downward departure at resentencing); <em>United States v. Bradstreet</em>, 207 F.3d 76 (1<sup>st</sup> Cir. 2000); <em>United States v. Core</em>, 125 F.3d 74, 75 (2d Cir. 1997) (&quot;We find nothing in the pertinent statutes or the Sentencing Guidelines that prevents a sentencing judge from considering post-conviction rehabilitation in prison as a basis for departure if resentencing becomes necessary.&quot;) <em>cert</em>. <em>denied</em>, 118 S. Ct. 735 (1998); <em>United States v. Sally</em>,116 F.3d 76, 80 (3d Cir. 1997) (holding that &quot;post-offense rehabilitations efforts, including those which occur post-conviction, may constitute a sufficient factor warranting a downward departure&quot;); <em>United States v. Rudolph</em>, 190 F.3d 720, 723 (6th Cir. 1999); <em>United States v. Green</em>, 152 F.3d 1202, 1207 (9th Cir. 1998) (<em>same</em>), <em>with</em> <em>United States v. Sims</em>, 174 F.3d 911 (8th Cir. 1999) (district court lacks authority at resentencing following an appeal to depart on ground of post-conviction rehabilitation which occurred after the original sentencing; refuses to extend holding regarding departures for post-offense rehabilitation to conduct that occurs in prison; departure based on post-conviction conduct infringes on statutory authority of the Bureau of Prisons to grant good-time credits). In <em>Sims</em>, the Eighth Circuit concluded that a rule allowing a departure at resentencing based on post-sentencing rehabilitation would result in unwarranted disparity because resentencing would be a fortuitous event benefitting only some defendants; would reinstate a parole-like system; and would interfere with the authority of the Bureau of Prisons to award good-time credits. <em>See</em> <em>Sims</em>, 174 F.3d at 912-13; <em>Rhodes</em>, 145 F.3d at 1384 (Silberman, J., dissenting).</p>
<p>The Commission determined that post-sentencing rehabilitative efforts should not provide a basis for a downward departure when resentencing a defendant initially sentenced to a term of imprisonment because such a departure would (1) be inconsistent with policies established by Congress under the Sentencing Reform Act, including the provisions of 18 U.S.C. § 3624(b) for reducing the time to be served by an imprisoned person; and (2) inequitably benefit only those few who gain the opportunity to be resentenced <em>de</em> <em>novo</em>, while others, whose rehabilitative efforts may have been more substantial, could not benefit simply because they chose not to appeal or appealed unsuccessfully. Additionally, prohibition on downward departure for post-sentencing rehabilitative efforts is consistent with Commission policies expressed in §1B1.10 (Reduction in Term of Imprisonment as a Result of Amended Guideline Range). This amendment does not restrict departures based on extraordinary post-offense rehabilitative efforts prior to sentencing. Such departures</p>
<p>have been allowed by every circuit that has ruled on the matter post-<em>Koon</em>. <em>See</em> <em>e.g.</em>, <em>United States v. Brock</em>, 108 F.3d 31 (4<sup>th</sup> Cir. 1997).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;*Note: Although the Commission had not addressed ‘single acts of aberrant behavior’ at the time the Introduction to the <em>Guidelines</em> <em>Manual</em> originally was</p>
<p>written, it subsequently addressed the issue in Amendment 603, effective November 1, 2000. (<em>See</em> Supplement to Appendix C, Amendment 603.)&quot;.</p>
<p>Chapter Five, Part K, Subpart 2, as amended by Amendment 602 (<em>see</em> <em>supra</em>), is further amended by adding at the end the following:</p>
<p>&quot;§5K2.20. <em>Aberrant Behavior</em> (Policy Statement)</p>
<p>A sentence below the applicable guideline range may be warranted in an extraordinary case if the defendant’s criminal conduct constituted aberrant behavior. However, the court may not depart below the guideline range on this basis if (1) the offense involved serious bodily injury or death; (2) the defendant discharged a firearm or otherwise used a firearm or a dangerous weapon; (3) the instant offense of conviction is a serious drug trafficking offense; (4) the defendant has more than one criminal history point, as determined under Chapter Four (Criminal History and Criminal Livelihood); or (5) the defendant has a prior federal, or state, felony conviction, regardless of whether the conviction is countable under Chapter Four.</p>
<p><em>Commentary</em></p>
<p><em>Application Notes</em>:</p>
<p>1. For purposes of this policy statement—</p>
<p>‘Aberrant behavior’ means a single criminal occurrence or single criminal transaction that (A) was committed without significant planning; (B) was of limited duration; and (C) represents a marked deviation by the defendant from an otherwise law-abiding life.</p>
<p>‘Dangerous weapon,’ ‘firearm,’ ‘otherwise used,’ and ‘serious bodily injury’ have the meaning given those terms in the Commentary to §1B1.1(Application Instructions).</p>
<p>‘Serious drug trafficking offense’ means any controlled substance offense under title 21, United States Code, other than simple possession under 21 U.S.C. § 844, that, because the defendant does not meet the criteria under §5C1.2 (Limitation on Applicability of Statutory Mandatory Minimum Sentences in Certain Cases), results in the imposition of a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment upon the defendant.</p>
<p>2. In determining whether the court should depart on the basis of aberrant behavior, the court may consider the defendant’s (A) mental and emotional conditions; (B) employment record; (C) record of prior good works; (D) motivation for committing the offense; and (E) efforts to mitigate the effects of the offense.&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This amendment responds to a circuit conflict regarding whether, for purposes of downward departure from the guideline range, a &quot;single act of aberrant behavior&quot; (Chapter One, Part A, Subpart 4(d)) includes multiple acts occurring over a period of time. <em>Compare</em> <em>United States v. Grandmaison</em>, 77 F.3d 555 (1st Cir. 1996) (Sentencing Commission intended the word &quot;single&quot; to refer to the crime committed; therefore, &quot;single acts of aberrant behavior&quot; include multiple acts leading up to the commission of the crime; the district court should review the totality of circumstances); <em>Zecevic v. United States Parole Commission</em>, 163 F.3d 731 (2d Cir. 1998) (aberrant behavior is conduct which constitutes a short-lived departure from an otherwise law-abiding life, and the best test is the totality of the circumstances); <em>United States v. Takai</em>, 941 F.2d 738 (9th Cir. 1991) (&quot;single act&quot; refers to the particular action that is criminal, even though a whole series of acts lead up to the commission of the crime); <em>United States v. Pena</em>, 930 F.2d 1486 (10th Cir. 1991) (aberrational nature of the defendant’s conduct and other circumstances justified departure), <em>with</em> <em>United States v. Marcello</em>, 13 F.3d 752 (3d Cir. 1994) (single act of aberrant behavior requires a spontaneous, thoughtless, single act involving lack of planning); <em>United States v. Glick</em>, 946 F.2d 335 (4th Cir. 1991) (conduct over a ten-week period involving a number of actions and extensive planning was not &quot;single act of aberrant behavior&quot;); <em>United States v. Williams</em>, 974 F.2d 25 (5th Cir. 1992) (a single act of aberrant behavior is generally spontaneous or thoughtless); <em>United States v. Carey</em>, 895 F.2d 318 (7th Cir. 1990) (single act of aberrant behavior contemplates a spontaneous and seemingly thoughtless act rather than one which was the result of substantial planning); <em>United States v. Garlich</em>, 951 F.2d 161 (8th Cir. 1991) (fraud spanning one year and several transactions was not a &quot;single act of aberrant behavior&quot;); <em>United States v. Withrow</em>, 85 F.3d 527 (11th Cir. 1996) (a single act of aberrant behavior is not established unless the defendant is a first-time offender and the crime was a thoughtless act rather than one that was the result of substantial planning); <em>United States v. Dyce</em>, 78 F.3d 610 (D.C. Cir.), <em>amd. on reh</em>. 91 F.3d 1462 (D.C. Cir. 1996) (<em>same</em>).</p>
<p>This amendment addresses the circuit conflict but does not adopt <em>in</em> <em>toto</em> either the majority or minority circuit view on this issue. As a threshold matter, this amendment provides that the departure is available only in an extraordinary case. However, the amendment defines and describes &quot;aberrant behavior&quot; more flexibly than the interpretation of existing guideline language followed by the majority of circuits that have allowed a departure for aberrant behavior only in a case involving a single act that was spontaneous and seemingly thoughtless. The Commission concluded that this application of the current language in Chapter One is overly restrictive and may preclude departures for aberrant behavior in circumstances in which such a departure might be warranted. For this reason, the Commission attempted to slightly relax the &quot;single act&quot; rule in some respects, and provide guidance and limitations regarding what can be considered aberrant behavior. At the same time, the Commission also chose not to adopt the &quot;totality of circumstances&quot; approach endorsed by the minority of circuits, concluding that the latter approach is overly broad and vague. The Commission anticipates that this compromise amendment will not broadly expand departures for aberrant behavior.</p>
<p>The amendment creates a new policy statement and accompanying commentary in Chapter Five, Part K (Departures) that sets forth the parameters of conduct and criminal history that the Commission believes appropriately may warrant departure as &quot;aberrant behavior.&quot; The policy statement provides, in pertinent part, that &quot;‘aberrant behavior’ means a single criminal occurrence or single criminal transaction.&quot; The Commission intends that the phrases &quot;single criminal occurrence&quot; and &quot;single criminal transaction&quot; will be somewhat broader than &quot;single act&quot;, but will be limited in potential applicability to offenses (1) committed without significant planning; (2) of limited duration; and (3) that represent a marked deviation by the defendant from an otherwise law-abiding life. For offense conduct to be considered for departure as aberrant behavior, the offense conduct must, at a minimum, have these characteristics. The Commission chose these characteristics after reviewing case law and public comment that indicated some support for the appropriateness of these factors.</p>
<p>The policy statement places significant restrictions on the type of offense and the criminal history of the offender that can be considered for this departure. The restrictions on the type of offense that can qualify reflect a Commission concern that certain offense conduct is so serious that a departure premised on a finding of aberrant behavior should not be available to those offenders who engage in such conduct. Similarly, the restrictions on criminal history reflect a Commission view that defendants with significant prior criminal records should not qualify for a departure premised on the aberrant nature of their current conduct.</p>
<p>The Commission recognizes that a number of other factors may have some relevance in evaluating the appropriateness of a departure based on aberrant behavior. Some of the relevant factors identified in the case law and public comment are listed in an application note.</p>

According to the majority of circuits, the sentencing court, in determining the sentence to impose within the guideline range, or whether a departure from the guidelines is warranted, may consider without limitation any information concerning the background, character and conduct of the defendant, unless otherwise prohibited by law. <em>See</em> §1B1.4 (Information to be Used in Imposing Sentence) and 18 U.S.C. § 3661. These courts hold that §6B1.2 (Standards for Acceptance of Plea Agreements) does not prohibit a court from considering conduct underlying counts dismissed pursuant to a plea agreement. The minority circuit view holds that a departure based on conduct uncharged or dismissed in the context of a plea agreement is inappropriate. Courts holding the minority view emphasize the need to protect the expectations of the parties to the plea agreement. <em>Compare</em> <em>United States v. Figaro</em>, 935 F.2d 4 (1st Cir. 1991) (allowing upward departure based on uncharged conduct); <em>United States v. Kim</em>, 896 F.2d 678 (2d Cir. 1990) (allowing upward departure based on related conduct that formed the basis of dismissed counts and based on prior similar misconduct not resulting in conviction); <em>United States v. Baird</em>, 109 F.3d 856 (3d Cir.), <em>cert</em>. <em>denied</em>, 118 S. Ct. 243 (1997) (allowing upward departure based on dismissed counts if the conduct underlying the dismissed counts is related to the offense of conviction conduct) (citing <em>United States v. Watts</em>, 519 U.S. 148 (1997)); <em>United States v. Barber</em>, 119 F.2d 276, 283-84 (4th Cir. 1997) (<em>en</em> <em>banc</em>); <em>United States v. Cross</em>, 121 F.3d 234 (6th Cir. 1997) (allowing upward departure based on dismissed conduct) (citing <em>Watts</em>); <em>United States v. Ashburn</em>, 38 F.3d 803 (5th Cir. 1994) (allowing upward departure based on dismissed conduct); <em>United States v. Big Medicine</em>, 73 F.3d 994 (10th Cir. 1995) (allowing departure based on uncharged conduct), <em>with</em> <em>United States v. Ruffin</em>, 997 F.2d 343 (7th Cir. 1993) (error to depart based on counts dismissed as part of plea agreement); <em>United States v. Harris</em>, 70 F.3d 1001 (8th Cir. 1995) (<em>same</em>); <em>United States v. Lawton</em>, 193 F.3d 1087 (9th Cir. 1999) (court may not accept plea bargain and later consider dismissed charges for upward departure in sentencing).</p>
<p>This amendment allows courts to consider for upward departure purposes aggravating conduct that is dismissed or not charged in connection with a plea agreement. This approach is consistent with the principles that underlie §1B1.4 and 18 U.S.C. § 3661 and preserves flexibility for the sentencing judge to impose an appropriate sentence within the context of a charge-reduction plea agreement.</p>

<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This four-part amendment makes various technical and conforming changes.</p>
<p>First, the amendment corrects a typographical error in §2B5.1 (Offenses Involving Counterfeit Bearer Obligations of the United States) by inserting a missing word in subsection (b)(2).</p>
<p>Second, the amendment corrects an omission that was made during prior, final deliberations by the Commission on amendments to implement the Comprehensive Methamphetamine Control Act of 1996 (the &quot;Act&quot;), Pub. L. 104–237. Specifically, the amendment amends §§2D1.11 and 2D1.12 (Unlawful Possession, Manufacture, Distribution, or Importation of Prohibited Flask or Equipment) to add an enhancement for environmental damage associated with methamphetamine offenses. The Commission previously had intended to amend these guidelines in this manner, but due to a technical oversight, the final amendment did not implement that intent.</p>
<p>The Act directed the Commission to determine whether the guidelines adequately punish environmental violations occurring in connection with precursor chemical offenses under 21 U.S.C. § 841(d) and (g) (sentenced under §2D1.11), and manufacturing equipment offenses under 21 U.S.C. § 843(a)(6) and (7) (sentenced under §2D1.12). On February 25, 1997, the Commission published two options to provide an increase for environmental damage associated with the manufacture of methamphetamine, the first by a specific offense characteristic, the second by an invited upward departure. <em>See</em> 62 Fed. Reg. 8487 (proposed Feb. 25, 1997). Both options proposed to make amendments to §§2D1.11, 2D1.12, and 2D1.13. Additionally, although the directive did not address manufacturing offenses under 21 U.S.C. § 841(a), the Commission elected to use its broader guideline promulgation authority under 28 U.S.C. § 994(a) to ensure that environmental violations occurring in connection with this more frequently occurring offense were treated similarly. Accordingly, the published options also included amendments to §2D1.1 (Unlawful Manufacturing, Importing, Exporting, or Trafficking).</p>
<p>The published options were revised prior to final action by the Commission. However, in the revision that was presented to the Commission for promulgation in late April 1997, amendments to §§2D1.11 and 2D1.12 mistakenly were omitted from the option to provide a specific offense characteristic, although that revision did refer to §§2D1.11 and 2D1.12 in the synopsis and included amendments to these guidelines in the upward departure option. (The revision did not include any amendments to guideline §2D1.13, covering record-keeping offenses, because, upon further examination, it seemed unlikely that offenses sentenced under this guideline would involve environmental damage.) Accordingly, when the Commission voted to adopt the option providing the specific offense characteristic for §§2D1.1, 2D1.11, and 2D1.12, the vote effectively was limited to what was before the Commission, <em>i.e.</em>, an environmental damage enhancement for §2D1.1 only. This amendment corrects that error and makes minor, conforming changes to the relevant application note in §2D1.1.</p>
<p>Third, the amendment updates the Statutory Provisions of §2K2.1 (Unlawful Receipt, Possession, or Transportation of Firearms or Ammunition) to conform to statutory re-designations made to 18 U.S.C. § 924 (and already conformed in Appendix A (Statutory Index)).</p>
<p>Finally, the amendment updates §§5B1.3 (Conditions of Probation) and 5D1.3 (Conditions of Supervised Release). Effective November 26, 1998, 18 U.S.C. §§ 3563(a) and 3583(a) were amended to add a new mandatory condition of probation and supervised release requiring a person convicted of a sexual offense described in 18 U.S.C. § 4042(c)(4) (enumerating several sex offenses) to report to the probation officer the person’s address and any subsequent change of address, and to register as a sex offender in the state in which the person resides. <em>See</em> section 115 of Departments of Commerce, Justice, and State, the Judiciary, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1998 (Pub. L. 105–119). Because the effective date of this change was later than the effective date of the last issued <em>Guidelines</em> <em>Manual</em> (November 1, 1998), the Commission did not amend §§5B1.3 and 5D1.3 to reflect the new condition. However, the Commission did provide a footnote in each guideline setting forth the new condition and alerting the user as to the date on which the condition became effective. This amendment includes the sex offender condition as a specific mandatory condition of probation and supervised release in both guidelines rather than in a footnote.</p>

<p><em>Background</em>: Subsection (b)(1) implements the instruction to the Commission in section 102 of Public Law 106–878.&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This amendment addresses the directive in section 102 (the &quot;substantial risk directive&quot;) of the Methamphetamine and Club Drug Anti-Proliferation Act of 2000 (the &quot;Act&quot;), Pub. L. 106–878.</p>
<p>The Act requires the Commission to promulgate amendments under emergency amendment authority. Although the Act generally provides that the Commission shall promulgate various amendments &quot;as soon as practicable,&quot; the substantial risk directive specifically requires that the amendment implementing the directive shall apply &quot;to any offense occurring on or after the date that is 60 days after the date of the enactment&quot; of the Act.</p>
<p>The directive instructs the Commission to amend the federal sentencing guidelines with respect to any offense relating to the manufacture, attempt to manufacture, or conspiracy to manufacture amphetamine or methamphetamine in (1) the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. § 801 et seq.); (2) the Controlled Substances Import and Export Act (21 U.S.C. § 951 et seq.); or (3) the Maritime Drug Law Enforcement Act (46 U.S.C. App. § 1901 et seq.).</p>
<p>The Act requires the Commission, in carrying out the substantial risk directive, to provide the following enhancements—</p>
<p>(A) if the offense created a substantial risk of harm to human life (other than a life described in subparagraph (B)) or the environment, increase the base offense level for the offense—</p>
<p>(i) by not less than 3 offense levels above the applicable level in effect on the date of the enactment of this Act; or</p>
<p>(ii) if the resulting base offense level after an increase under clause (i) would be less than level 27, to not less than level 27; or</p>
<p>(B) if the offense created a substantial risk of harm to the life of a minor or incompetent, increase the base offense level for the offense—</p>
<p>(i) by not less than 6 offense levels above the applicable level in effect on the date of the enactment of this Act; or</p>
<p>(ii) if the resulting base offense level after an increase under clause (i) would be less than level 30, to not less than level 30.</p>
<p>The pertinent aspects of this amendment are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) <em>Guidelines Amended</em>.—The amendment provides new enhancements in §§2D1.1 (Unlawful Manufacturing, Importing, Exporting, or Trafficking) and 2D1.10 (Endangering Human Life While Illegally Manufacturing a Controlled Substance) that also apply in the case of an attempt or a conspiracy to manufacture amphetamine or methamphetamine. The amendment does not amend §2D1.11 (Unlawfully Distributing, Importing, Exporting or Possessing a Listed Chemical) or §2D1.12 (Unlawful Possession, Manufacture, Distribution, or Importation or Prohibited Flask or Equipment). Although offenses that involve the manufacture of amphetamine or methamphetamine also are referenced in Appendix (A) (Statutory Index) to §§2D1.11 and 2D1.12, the cross reference in these guidelines, which applies if the offense involved the manufacture of a controlled substance, will result in application of §2D1.1 and accordingly, the new enhancements.</p>
<p>(2) <em>Structure</em>.—The basic structure of the amendment to §§2D1.1 and 2D1.10 tracks the structure of the directive. Accordingly, in §2D1.1, the amendment provides a three-level increase and a minimum offense level of level 27 if the offense (A) involved the manufacture of amphetamine or methamphetamine; and (B) created a substantial risk of either harm to human life or the environment. For offenses that created a substantial risk of harm to the life of a minor or an incompetent, the amendment provides a six-level increase and a minimum offense level of 30.</p>
<p>However, the structure of the amendment in §2D1.10 differs from that in §2D1.1 with respect to the first prong of the enhancement (regarding substantial risk of harm to human life or to the environment). Specifically, the amendment provides a three-level increase and a minimum offense level of level 27 if the offense involved the manufacture of amphetamine or methamphetamine without making application of the enhancement dependent upon whether the offense also involved a substantial risk of either harm to human life or the environment. Consideration of whether the offense involved a substantial risk of harm to human life is unnecessary because §2D1.10 applies only to convictions under 21 U.S.C. § 858, and the creation of a substantial risk of harm to human life is an element of a § 858 offense. Therefore, the base offense level already takes into account the substantial risk of harm to human life. Consideration of whether the offense involved a substantial risk of harm to the environment is unnecessary because the directive predicated application of the enhancement on substantial risk of harm either to human life or to the environment, and the creation of a substantial risk of harm to human life is necessarily present because it is an element of the offense.</p>
<p>(3) <em>Determining &quot;Substantial Risk of Harm&quot;</em>.—Neither the directive nor any statutory provision defines &quot;substantial risk of harm&quot;. Based on an analysis of relevant case law that interpreted &quot;substantial risk of harm&quot;, the amendment provides commentary setting forth factors that may be relevant in determining whether a particular offense created a substantial risk of harm.</p>
<p>(4) <em>Definitions</em>.—The definition of &quot;incompetent&quot; is modeled after several state statutes, which proved useful for purposes of this amendment.</p>
<p>The definition of &quot;minor&quot; has the meaning given that term in Application Note 1 of the Commentary to §2A3.1 (Criminal Sexual Abuse).</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This amendment addresses the directive in the Ecstasy Anti-Proliferation Act of 2000 (the &quot;Act&quot;), section 3664 of Pub. L. 106–310, which instructs the Commission to provide, under emergency amendment authority, increased penalties for the manufacture, importation, exportation, or trafficking of Ecstasy. The directive specifically requires the Commission to increase the base offense level for 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), 3,4-Methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA), 3,4-Methylenedioxy-N-ethylamphetamine (MDEA), Paramethoxymethamphetamine (PMA), and any other controlled substance that is marketed as Ecstasy and that has either a chemical structure similar to MDMA or an effect on the central nervous system substantially similar to or greater than MDMA.</p>
<p>The amendment addresses the directive by amending the Drug Equivalency Table in §2D1.1, Application Note 10, to increase substantially the marihuana equivalencies for the specified controlled substances, which has the effect of substantially increasing the penalties for offenses involving Ecstasy. The new penalties for Ecstasy trafficking provide penalties which, gram for gram, are more severe than those for powder cocaine. Currently under the Drug Equivalency Table, one gram of powder cocaine has a marihuana equivalency of 200 grams. This amendment sets the marihuana equivalency for one gram of Ecstasy at 500 grams.</p>
<p>There are a combination of reasons why the Commission has substantially increased the penalties in response to the congressional directive. Much evidence received by the Commission indicated that Ecstasy: (1) has powerful pharmacological effects; (2) has the capacity to cause lasting physical harms, including brain damage; and (3) is being abused by rapidly increasing numbers of teenagers and young adults. Indeed, the market for Ecstasy is overwhelmingly comprised of people under the age of 25 years.</p>
<p>Before voting to promulgate this amendment, the Commission considered whether the penalty levels for Ecstasy should be set at the same levels as for heroin (<em>i.e.</em>, one gram of heroin has a marihuana equivalency of 1000 grams) and decided that somewhat lesser penalties were appropriate for Ecstasy for a number of reasons: (1) the potential for addiction is greater with heroin; (2) heroin distribution often involves violence while, at this time, violence is not reported in Ecstasy markets; (3) because it is a narcotic and is often injected, the risk of death from overdose is much greater from heroin; and (4) because heroin is often injected, there are more secondary health consequences, such as infections and the transmission of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis.</p>
<p>Finally, based on information regarding Ecstasy trafficking patterns, the penalty levels chosen are appropriate and sufficient to target serious and high-level traffickers and to provide appropriate punishment, deterrence, and incentives for cooperation. The penalty levels chosen for Ecstasy offenses provide five year sentences for serious traffickers (those whose relevant conduct involved at least 800 pills) and ten year sentences for high-level traffickers (those whose relevant conduct involved at least 8,000 pills).</p>

<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This emergency amendment implements the directive in the Methamphetamine Anti-Proliferation Act of 2000, section 3611 of Pub. L. 106–310 (the &quot;Act&quot;), which directs the Commission to provide, under emergency amendment authority, increased guideline penalties for amphetamine such that those penalties are comparable to the base offense level for methamphetamine.</p>
<p>This amendment revises §2D1.1 to include amphetamine in the Drug Quantity Table. This amendment also treats amphetamine and methamphetamine identically, at a 1:1 ratio (<em>i.e.</em>, the same quantities of amphetamine and methamphetamine would result in the same base offense level) because of the similarities of the two substances. Specifically, amphetamine and methamphetamine (1) chemically are similar; (2) are produced by a similar method and are trafficked in a similar manner; (3) share similar methods of use; (4) affect the same parts of the brain; and (5) have similar intoxicating effects. The amendment also distinguishes between pure amphetamine (<em>i.e.</em>, amphetamine (actual)) and amphetamine mixture in the same manner, and at the same quantities, as pure methamphetamine (<em>i.e.</em>, methamphetamine (actual)) and methamphetamine mixture, respectively. The amendment reflects the view that the 1:1 ratio is appropriate given the seriousness of these two controlled substances.</p>

<p>*<em>Notes</em>:</p>
<p>(A) The List I Chemical Equivalency Table provides a method for combining different precursor chemicals to obtain a single offense level. In a case involving two or more list I chemicals used to manufacture different controlled substances or to manufacture one controlled substance by different manufacturing processes, convert each to its ephedrine equivalency from the table below, add the quantities, and use the Chemical Quantity Table to determine the base offense level. In a case involving two or more list I chemicals used together to manufacture a controlled substance in the same manufacturing process, use the quantity of the single list I chemical that results in the greatest base offense level.</p>
<p>(B) If more than one list II chemical is involved, use the single list II chemical resulting in the greatest offense level.</p>
<p>(C) If both list I and list II chemicals are involved, use the offense level determined under (A) or (B) above, whichever is greater.</p>
<p>(D) In a case involving ephedrine tablets, use the weight of the ephedrine contained in the tablets, not the weight of the entire tablets, in calculating the base offense level.</p>

<p>*Notes:</p>
<p>(A) Except as provided in Note (B), to calculate the base offense level in an offense that involves two or more chemicals, use the quantity of the single chemical that results in the greatest offense level, regardless of whether the chemicals are set forth in different tables or in different categories (<em>i.e.</em>, list I or list II) under subsection (d) of this guideline.</p>
<p>(B) To calculate the base offense level in an offense that involves two or more chemicals each of which is set forth in the Ephedrine, Pseudoephedrine, and Phenylpropanolamine Quantity Table, (i) aggregate the quantities of all such chemicals, and (ii) determine the base offense level corresponding to the aggregate quantity.</p>
<p>(C) In a case involving ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, or phenylpropanolamine tablets, use the weight of the ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, or phenylpropanolamine contained in the tablets, not the weight of the entire tablets, in calculating the base offense level.&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §2D1.11 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended by striking Note 4 in its entirety as follows:</p>
<p>&quot;4. When two or more list I chemicals are used together in the same manufacturing process, calculate the offense level for each separately and use the quantity that results in the greatest base offense level. In any other case, the quantities should be added together (using the List I Chemical Equivalency Table) for the purpose of calculating the base offense level.</p>
<p><em>Examples</em>:</p>
<p>(a) The defendant was in possession of five kilograms of ephedrine and 300 grams of hydriodic acid. Ephedrine and hydriodic acid typically are used together in the same manufacturing process to manufacture methamphetamine. Therefore, the base offense level for each listed chemical is calculated separately and the list I chemical with the higher base offense level is used. Five kilograms of ephedrine result in a base offense level of 26; 300 grams of hydriodic acid result in a base offense level of 16. In this case, the base offense level would be 26.</p>
<p>(b) The defendant was in possession of five kilograms of ephedrine and two kilograms of phenylacetic acid. Although both of these chemicals are used to manufacture methamphetamine, they are not used together in the same manufacturing process. Therefore, the quantity of phenylacetic acid should be converted to an ephedrine equivalency using the List I Chemical Equivalency Table and then added to the quantity of ephedrine. In this case, the two kilograms of phenylacetic acid convert to two kilograms of ephedrine (<em>see</em> List I Chemical Equivalency Table), resulting in a total equivalency of seven kilograms of ephedrine.&quot;,</p>
<p>and inserting the following:</p>
<p>&quot;4. <em>Cases Involving Multiple Chemicals</em>.—</p>
<p>(A) <em>Determining the Base Offense Level for Two or More Chemicals</em>.—Except as provided in subdivision (B), if the offense involves two or more chemicals, use the quantity of the single chemical that results in the greatest offense level, regardless of whether the chemicals are set forth in different tables or in different categories (<em>i.e.</em>, list I or list II) under subsections (d) and (e) of this guideline.</p>
<p><em>Example</em>: The defendant was in possession of five kilograms of ephedrine and 300 grams of hydriodic acid. Ephedrine and hydriodic acid typically are used together in the same manufacturing process to manufacture methamphetamine. The base offense level for each chemical is calculated separately and the chemical with the higher base offense level is used. Five kilograms of ephedrine result in a base offense level of level 38; 300 grams of hydriodic acid result in a base offense level of level 26. In this case, the base offense level would be level 38.</p>
<p>(B) <em>Determining the Base Offense Level for Offenses involving Ephedrine, Pseudoephedrine, or Phenylpropanolamine</em>.—If the offense involves two or more chemicals each of which is set forth in the Ephedrine, Pseudoephedrine, and Phenylpropanolamine Quantity Table, (i) aggregate the quantities of all such</p>
<p>chemicals, and (ii) determine the base offense level corresponding to the aggregate quantity.</p>
<p><em>Example</em>: The defendant was in possession of 80 grams of ephedrine and 50 grams of phenylpropanolamine, an aggregate quantity of 130 grams of such chemicals. The base offense level corresponding to that aggregate quantity is level 32.</p>
<p>(C) <em>Upward Departure</em>.—In a case involving two or more chemicals used to manufacture different controlled substances, or to manufacture one controlled substance by different manufacturing processes, an upward departure may be warranted if the offense level does not adequately address the seriousness of the offense.&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §2D1.11 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended by striking Notes 5 and 6 in their entirety as follows:</p>
<p>&quot;5. Where there are multiple list II chemicals, all quantities of the same list II chemical are added together for purposes of determining the base offense level. However, quantities of different list II chemicals are not aggregated (<em>see</em> Note B to the Chemical Quantity Table). Thus, where multiple list II chemicals are involved in the offense, the base offense level is determined by using the base offense level for the single list II chemical resulting in the greatest base offense level. For example, in the case of an offense involving seven kilograms of methyl ethyl ketone and eight kilograms of acetone, the base offense level for the methyl ethyl ketone is 12 and the base offense level for the acetone is 14; therefore, the base offense level is 14.</p>
<p>6. Where both list I chemicals and list II chemicals are involved, use the greater of the base offense level for the list I chemicals or the list II chemicals (<em>see</em> Note C to the Chemical Quantity Table).&quot;;</p>
<p>and by redesignating Notes 7 and 8 as Notes 5 and 6, respectively.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §2D1.11 captioned &quot;Background&quot; is amended in the first sentence by inserting &quot;(including ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, and phenylpropanolamine)&quot; after &quot;list I chemicals&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to 2D1.1 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended in Note 10 in the &quot;Drug Equivalency Tables&quot; by inserting after the subdivision captioned &quot;Schedule V Substances******&quot; the following new subdivision:</p>
<p>&quot;<em>List I Chemicals (relating to the manufacture of amphetamine or methamphetamine)</em>*******</p>
<p>1 gm of Ephedrine = 10 kg of marihuana</p>
<p>1 gm of Phenylpropanolamine = 10 kg of marihuana</p>
<p>1 gm of Pseudoephedrine = 10 kg of marihuana</p>
<p>*******Provided, that in a case involving ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, or phenylpropanolamine tablets, use the weight of the ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, or phenylpropanolamine contained in the tablets, not the weight of the entire tablets, in calculating the base offense level.&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This amendment is in response to the three-part directive in section 3651 of the Methamphetamine Anti-Proliferation Act of 2000, Pub. L. 106–310 (the &quot;Act&quot;), regarding enhanced punishment for trafficking in List I chemicals. That section requires the Commission to promulgate an amendment implementing the directive under emergency amendment authority.</p>
<p>First, this amendment provides a new chemical quantity table specifically for ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, and phenylpropanolamine (PPA). The table ties the base offense levels for these chemicals to the base offense levels for methamphetamine (actual) set forth in §2D1.1, assuming a 50 percent actual yield of the controlled substance from the chemicals. (Methamphetamine (actual) is used rather than methamphetamine mixture because ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, and PPA produce methamphetamine (actual)). This yield is based on information provided by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) that the typical yield of these substances for clandestine laboratories is 50 to 75 percent.</p>
<p>This new chemical quantity table has a maximum base offense level of level 38 (as opposed to a maximum base offense level of level 30 for all other precursor chemicals). Providing a maximum base offense level of level 38 complies with the directive to establish penalties for these precursors that &quot;correspond to the quantity of controlled substance that could have reasonably been manufactured using the quantity of ephedrine, phenylpropanolamine, or pseudoephedrine possessed or distributed.&quot; Additionally, this adjustment will have an impact on the relationship between §§2D1.1 and 2D1.11 by eliminating the six-level distinction that currently exists between offenses that involve intent to manufacture methamphetamine and offenses that involve an attempt to manufacture methamphetamine, at least for offenses involving ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, and PPA.</p>
<p>This amendment eliminates the Ephedrine Equivalency Table in §2D1.11 and, in its place, provides an instruction for the court to determine the base offense level in cases involving multiple precursors (other than ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, or PPA) by using the quantity of the single chemical resulting in the greatest offense level. An upward departure is provided for cases in which the offense level does not adequately address the seriousness of the offense.</p>
<p>However, this amendment provides an exception to the rule for offenses that involve a combination of ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, or PPA because these chemicals often are used in the same manufacturing process. In a case that involves two or more of these chemicals, the base offense level will be determined using the total quantity of these chemicals involved. The purpose of this exception is twofold: (1) any of the three primary precursors in the same table can be combined without difficulty; and (2) studies conducted by the DEA indicate that because the manufacturing process for amphetamine and methamphetamine is identical, there are cases in which the different precursors are included in the same batch of drugs. If the chemical is PPA, amphetamine results; and if the chemical is ephedrine, methamphetamine results.</p>
<p>Second, the amendment adds to the Drug Equivalency Tables in §2D1.1 a conversion table for these precursor chemicals, providing for a 50 percent conversion ratio. This is based on data from the DEA that the actual yield from ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, or PPA typically is in the range of 50 to 75 percent. The purpose of this part of the amendment is to achieve the same punishment level (as is achieved by the first part of this amendment) for an offense involving any of these precursor chemicals when such offense involved the manufacture of methamphetamine and, as a result, is sentenced under §2D1.1 pursuant to the cross reference in §2D1.11.</p>
<p>Third, this amendment increases the base offense level for Benzaldehyde, Hydriodic Acid, Methylamine, Nitroethane, and Norpseudoephedrine by re-calibrating these levels to the appropriate quantity of methamphetamine (actual) that could be produced assuming a 50 percent yield of chemical to drug and retaining a cap at level 30. Previously, these chemicals had been linked to methamphetamine (mixture) penalty levels. Based on a study conducted by the DEA, ephedrine and pseudoepehdrine are the primary precursors used to make methamphetamine in the United States. Phenylproponolamine is the primary precursor used to make amphetamine. Unlike the five additional List I chemicals, the chemical structures of ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, and PPA are so similar to the resulting drug (<em>i.e.</em>, methamphetamine or amphetamine) that the manufacture of methamphetamine or amphetamine from ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, or PPA is a very simple one-step synthesis which anyone can perform using a variety of chemical reagents. The manufacture of methamphetamine or amphetamine from the five additional List I chemicals is a more complex process which requires a heightened level of expertise.</p>
<p><strong>Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is May 1, 2001.</strong></p>

<p>Appendix A (Statutory Index) is amended by inserting after the line referenced to &quot;29 U.S.C. § 1141&quot; the following:</p>
<p>&quot;29 U.S.C. § 1851 2H4.2&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> In promulgating this amendment, the Commission is cognizant of the extraordinarily serious nature of offenses that involve trafficking in human lives. This amendment is in response to the directive found at section 112(b) of the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000 (the &quot;Act&quot;), Pub. L. 106–386. The Commission expects to consider further revisions and additions to the specific offense characteristics and punishment levels for these offenses, such as the possibility of providing an alternative base offense level in §2G1.1 (Promoting Prostitution or Prohibited Sexual Conduct) for convictions under 18 U.S.C. § 1591 involving victims under the age of 14 years.</p>
<p>The directive confers emergency authority on the Commission to amend the federal sentencing guidelines to reflect changes to 18 U.S.C. §§ 1581(a) (Peonage), 1583 (Enticement into Slavery), and 1584 (Sale into Involuntary Servitude). The Commission also is directed to consider how to address four new statutes: 18 U.S.C. §§ 1589 (Forced Labor); 1590 (Trafficking with Respect to Peonage, Involuntary Servitude or Forced Labor); 1591 (Sex Trafficking of Children by Force, Fraud or Coercion); and 1592 (Unlawful Conduct with Respect to Documents in Furtherance of Peonage, Involuntary Servitude or Forced Labor).</p>
<p>Specifically, the Commission is directed to &quot;review and, if appropriate, amend the sentencing guidelines applicable to . . . the trafficking of persons including . . . peonage, involuntary servitude, slave trade offenses, and possession, transfer or sale of false immigration documents in furtherance of trafficking, and the Fair Labor Standards Act and the Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural Worker Protection Act.&quot;</p>
<p>The Commission further is directed to &quot;take all appropriate measures to ensure that these sentencing guidelines . . . are sufficiently stringent to deter and adequately reflect the heinous nature of these offenses.&quot; The Commission also is directed to &quot;consider providing sentencing enhancements&quot; in cases which involve: (1) a large number of victims; (2) a pattern of continued and flagrant violations; (3) the use or threatened use of a dangerous weapon; or (4) the death or bodily injury of any person.</p>
<p>To address this multi-faceted directive, this amendment makes changes to several existing guidelines and creates a new guideline for criminal violations of the Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural Worker Protection Act. Although the directive instructs the Commission to amend the guidelines applicable to the Fair Labor Standards Act (29 U.S.C. § 201 et. seq.), a criminal violation of the Fair Labor Standards Act is only a Class B misdemeanor. <em>See</em> 29 U.S.C. § 216. Thus, the guidelines are not applicable to those offenses.</p>
<p>The amendment references the new offense at 18 U.S.C. § 1591 to §2G1.1. Section 1591 punishes a defendant who participates in the transporting or harboring of a person, or who benefits from participating in such a venture, with the knowledge that force, fraud, or coercion will be used to cause that person to engage in a commercial sex act or with knowledge that the person is not 18 years old and will be forced to engage in a commercial sex act. Despite the statute’s inclusion in a chapter of title 18 devoted mainly to peonage offenses, section 1591 offenses are more analogous to the offenses referenced to the prostitution guideline.</p>
<p>Section 1591 cases alternatively have been referred in Appendix A to §2G2.1 (Sexually Exploiting a Minor by Production of Sexually Explicit Visual or Printed Material; Custodian Permitting Minor to Engage in Sexually Explicit Conduct; Advertisement for Minors to Engage in Production). This has been done in anticipation that some portion of section 1591 cases will involve children being forced or coerced to engage in commercial sex acts for the purpose of producing pornography. Such offenses, as recognized by the higher base offense level at §2G2.1, are more serious because they both involve specific harm to an individual victim and further an additional criminal purpose, namely, commercial pornography.</p>
<p>The amendment maintains the view that §2H4.1 (Peonage, Involuntary Servitude, and Slave Trade) continues to be an appropriate tool for determining sentences for violations of 18 U.S.C. §§ 1581, 1583, and 1584. Section 2H4.1 also is designed to cover offenses under three new statutes, 18 U.S.C. §§ 1589, 1590, and 1592. Section 1589 punishes defendants who provide or obtain the labor or services of another by the use of threats of serious harm or physical restraint against a person, or by a scheme or plan intended to make the person believe that if he or she did not perform the labor or services, he or she would suffer physical restraint or serious harm. This statute also applies to defendants who provide or obtain labor or services of another by abusing or threatening abuse of the law or the legal process. <em>See</em> 18 U.S.C. § 1589.</p>
<p>Section 1590 punishes defendants who harbor, transport, or are otherwise involved in obtaining, a person for labor or services. Section 1592 punishes a defendant who knowingly possesses, destroys, or removes an actual passport, other immigration document, or government identification document of another person in the course of a violation of § 1581 (peonage), § 1583 (enticement into slavery), § 1584 (sale into involuntary servitude), § 1589 (forced labor), § 1590 (trafficking with respect to these offenses), § 1591 (sex trafficking of children by force, fraud or coercion), or § 1594(a) (attempts to violate these offenses). Section 1592 also punishes a defendant who, with intent to violate § 1581, § 1583, § 1584, § 1589, § 1590, or § 1591, knowingly possesses, destroys, or removes an actual passport, other immigration document, or government identification document of another person. These statutes prohibit the types of behaviors that have been traditionally sentenced under §2H4.1.</p>
<p>The amendment provides an alternative, less punitive base offense level of level 18 for those who violate 18 U.S.C. § 1592, an offense which limits participation in peonage cases to the destruction or wrongful confiscation of a passport or other immigration document. This alternative, lower base level reflects the lower statutory maximum sentence for § 1592 offenses (<em>i.e.</em>, 5 years).</p>
<p>Section 2H4.1(b)(2) has been expanded to provide a 4-level increase if a dangerous weapon was used and a 2-level increase if a dangerous weapon was brandished or its use was threatened. Currently, only actual use of a dangerous weapon is covered. This change reflects the directive to consider an enhancement for the &quot;use or threatened use of a dangerous weapon.&quot; The commentary to §2H4.1 is amended to clarify that the threatened use of a dangerous weapon applies regardless of whether a dangerous weapon was actually present.</p>
<p>The amendment also creates a new guideline, §2H4.2 (Willful Violations of the Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural Worker Protection Act), in response to the directive to amend the guidelines applicable to such offenses. These offenses, which have a statutory maximum sentence of one year imprisonment for first offenses and three years’ imprisonment for subsequent offenses, currently are not referred to any specific guideline. The amendment provides a base offense level of level 6 in recognition of the low statutory maximum sentences set for these cases by Congress. Further, these offenses typically involve violations of regulatory provisions. Setting the base offense level at level 6 provides consistency with guidelines for other regulatory offenses. <em>See</em>, <em>e.g.</em>, §§2N2.1 (Violations of Statutes and Regulations Dealing With Any Food, Drug, Biological Product, Device, Cosmetic, or Agricultural Product) and 2N3.1 (Odometer Laws and Regulations). Subsections (b)(1), an enhancement for bodily injury, and (b)(2), an enhancement applicable to defendants who commit the instant offense after previously sustaining a civil penalty for similar misconduct, have been established to respond to the directive that the Commission consider sentencing enhancement for these offense characteristics. This section addresses the Department of Justice’s and the Department of Labor’s concern regarding prior administrative and civil adjudications.</p>
<p>This amendment also addresses that portion of section 112 of the Act that amends chapter 77 of title 18, United States Code, to provide mandatory restitution for peonage and involuntary servitude offenses. The amendment amends §5E1.1 (Restitution) to include a reference to 18 U.S.C. § 1593 in the guideline provision regarding mandatory restitution.</p>
<p>By enactment of various sentencing enhancements and encouraged upward departures for areas of concern identified by Congress, the Commission has provided for more severe sentences for perpetrators of human trafficking offenses in keeping with the conclusion that the offenses covered by this amendment are both heinous in nature and being committed with rapidly increasing frequency.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Commentary to §1B1.2 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended in Note 1 by striking the first two sentences of the third paragraph as follows:</p>
<p>&quot;However, there is a limited exception to this general rule. Where a stipulation that is set forth in a written plea agreement or made between the parties on the record during a plea proceeding specifically establishes facts that prove a more serious offense or offenses than the offense or offenses of conviction, the court is to apply the guideline most applicable to the more serious offense or offenses established.&quot;,</p>
<p>and inserting:</p>
<p>&quot;As set forth in the first paragraph of this note, an exception to this general rule is that if a plea agreement (written or made orally on the record) contains a stipulation that establishes a more serious offense than the offense of conviction, the guideline section applicable to the stipulated offense is to be used. A factual statement or a stipulation contained in a plea agreement (written or made orally on the record) is a stipulation for purposes of subsection (a) only if both the defendant and the government explicitly agree that the factual statement or stipulation is a stipulation for such purposes. However, a factual statement or stipulation made after the plea agreement has been entered, or after any modification to the plea agreement has been made, is not a stipulation for purposes of subsection (a).&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §1B1.2 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended in Note 1 in the third paragraph by striking &quot;may be imposed&quot; and inserting &quot;shall be imposed&quot;.</p>

<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This amendment addresses the circuit conflict regarding whether admissions made by a defendant during a guilty plea hearing, without more, can be considered stipulations for purposes of subsection (a) of §1B1.2 (Application Instructions). <em>Compare</em>, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>United States v. Nathan</em>, 188 F.3d 190, 201 (3d Cir. 1999) (statements made by defendants during the factual-basis hearing for a plea agreement do not constitute stipulations for the purpose of this enhancement; a statement is a stipulation only if it is part of a defendant’s written plea agreement or if both the government and the defendant explicitly agree at a factual-basis hearing that the facts being placed on the record are stipulations that might subject the defendant to §1B1.2(a)); <em>United States v. Saaverda</em>, 148 F.3d 1311 (11th Cir. 1998) (same); <em>United States v. McCall</em>, 915 F.2d 811 (2d Cir. 1990) (same); <em>United States v. Gardner</em>, 940 F.2d 587 (10th Cir. 1991) (requiring a &quot;knowing agreement by the defendant, as part of a plea bargain, that facts supporting a more serious offense occurred and could be presented to the court&quot;); and <em>United States v. Rutter</em>, 897 F.2d 1558, 1561 (10th Cir. 1990) (once the government agrees to a plea bargain without extracting an admission, facts admitted by the defendant can be considered only as relevant conduct in determining appropriate guideline range, not as stipulations under §1B1.2(a)), <em>with</em> <em>United States v. Loos</em>, 165 F.3d 504, 508 (7th Cir. 1998) (the objective behind §1B1.2(a) is best answered by interpreting &quot;stipulations&quot; to mean any acknowledgment by the defendant that the defendant committed the acts that justify use of the more serious guideline, not in the formal agreement); and <em>United States v. Domino</em>, 62 F.3d 716 (5th Cir. 1995) (same).</p>
<p>This amendment represents a narrow approach to the majority view that a factual statement made by the defendant during the plea colloquy must be made as part of the plea agreement in order to be considered a stipulation for purposes of §1B1.2(a). This approach lessens the possibility that the plea agreement will be modified during the course of the plea proceeding without providing the parties, especially the defendant, with notice of the defendant’s potential sentencing range.</p>

{id: 614, content:"<p><strong>614.</strong> <strong>Amendment:</strong> The Commentary to §2A2.2 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended by striking Notes 1 through 3 as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;1. ‘Aggravated assault’ means a felonious assault that involved (A) a dangerous weapon with intent to do bodily harm (<em>i.e.</em>, not merely to frighten), or (B) serious bodily injury, or (C) an intent to commit another felony.</p>
<p>2. Definitions of ‘more than minimal planning,’ ‘firearm,’ ‘dangerous weapon,’ ‘brandished,’ ‘otherwise used,’ ‘bodily injury,’ ‘serious bodily injury,&quot; and ‘permanent or life-threatening bodily injury,’ are found in the Commentary to §1B1.1 (Application Instructions).</p>
<p>3. This guideline also covers attempted manslaughter and assault with intent to commit manslaughter. Assault with intent to commit murder is covered by §2A2.1 (Assault With Intent to Commit Murder). Assault with intent to commit rape is covered by §2A3.1 (Criminal Sexual Abuse).&quot;,</p>
<p>and inserting the following:</p>
<p>&quot;1. <em>Definitions</em>.—For purposes of this guideline:</p>
<p>‘Aggravated assault’ means a felonious assault that involved (A) a dangerous weapon with intent to cause bodily injury (<em>i.e.</em>, not merely to frighten) with that weapon; (B) serious bodily injury; or (C) an intent to commit another felony.</p>
<p>‘Brandished,’ ‘bodily injury,’ ‘firearm,’ ‘otherwise used,’ ‘permanent or life-threatening bodily injury,’ and ‘serious bodily injury,’ have the meaning given those terms in §1B1.1 (Application Instructions), Application Note 1.</p>
<p>‘Dangerous weapon’ has the meaning given that term in §1B1.1, Application Note 1, and includes any instrument that is not ordinarily used as a weapon (<em>e.g.</em>, a car, a chair, or an ice pick) if such an instrument is involved in the offense with the intent to commit bodily injury.</p>
<p>2. <em>Application of Subsection (b)(2)</em>.—In a case involving a dangerous weapon with intent to cause bodily injury, the court shall apply both the base offense level and subsection (b)(2).</p>
<p>3. <em>More than Minimal Planning</em>.—For purposes of subsection (b)(1), ‘more than minimal planning’ means more planning than is typical for commission of the offense in a simple form. ‘More than minimal planning’ also exists if significant affirmative steps were taken to conceal the offense, other than conduct to which §3C1.1 (Obstructing or Impeding the Administration of Justice) applies. For example, waiting to commit the offense when no witnesses were present would not alone constitute more than minimal planning. By contrast, luring the victim to a specific location or wearing a ski mask to prevent identification would constitute more than minimal planning.&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §2A2.2 captioned &quot;Background&quot; is amended by striking the text of the background as follows:</p>
<p>&quot; This section applies to serious (aggravated) assaults. Such offenses occasionally may involve planning or be committed for hire. Consequently, the structure follows §2A2.1.</p>
<p>There are a number of federal provisions that address varying degrees of assault and battery. The punishments under these statutes differ considerably, even among provisions directed to substantially similar conduct. For example, if the assault is upon certain federal officers ‘while engaged in or on account of . . . official duties,’ the maximum term of imprisonment under 18 U.S.C. § 111 is three years. If a dangerous weapon is used in the assault on a federal officer, the maximum term of imprisonment is ten years. However, if the same weapon is used to assault a person not otherwise specifically protected, the maximum term of imprisonment under 18 U.S.C. § 113(c) is five years. If the assault results in serious bodily injury, the maximum term of imprisonment under 18 U.S.C. § 113(f) is ten years, unless the injury constitutes maiming by scalding, corrosive, or caustic substances under 18 U.S.C. § 114, in which case the maximum term of imprisonment is twenty years.&quot;,</p>
<p>and inserting the following:</p>
<p>&quot; This guideline covers felonious assaults that are more serious than minor assaults because of the presence of an aggravating factor, <em>i.e.</em>, serious bodily injury, the involvement of a dangerous weapon with intent to cause bodily injury, or the intent to commit another felony. Such offenses occasionally may involve planning or be committed for hire. Consequently, the structure follows §2A2.1 (Assault with Intent to Commit Murder; Attempted Murder). This guideline also covers attempted manslaughter and assault with intent to commit manslaughter. Assault with intent to commit murder is covered by §2A2.1. Assault with intent to commit rape is covered by §2A3.1 (Criminal Sexual Abuse; Attempt to Commit Criminal Sexual Abuse).</p>
<p>An assault that involves the presence of a dangerous weapon is aggravated in form when the presence of the dangerous weapon is coupled with the intent to cause bodily injury. In such a case, the base offense level and the weapon enhancement in subsection (b)(2) take into account different aspects of the offense, even if application of the base offense level and the weapon enhancement is based on the same conduct.&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This amendment responds to a circuit conflict regarding whether the four-level enhancement in subsection (b)(2)(B) of §2A2.2 (Aggravated Assault) for use of a dangerous weapon during an aggravated assault is impermissible double counting. <em>Compare</em> <em>United States v. Williams</em>, 954 F.2d 204, 205-08 (4th Cir. 1992) (applying the dangerous weapon enhancement under §2A2.2(b)(2)(B) for defendant’s use of his chair as a dangerous weapon did not constitute impermissible double counting even though that conduct increased the defendant’s offense level twice: first, by triggering the application of the aggravated assault guideline, and second, as the basis for the four-level enhancement for use of a dangerous weapon), <em>with</em> <em>United States v. Hudson</em>, 972 F.2d 504, 506-07 (2d Cir. 1992) (in a case in which the use of an automobile caused the crime to be classified as an aggravated assault, the court may not enhance the base offense level under §2A2.2(b) for use of the same, non-inherently dangerous weapon).</p>
<p>This amendment addresses the circuit conflict by providing in the aggravated assault guideline that (1) both the base offense level of level 15 and the weapon use enhancement in subsection (b)(2) shall apply to aggravated assaults that involve a dangerous weapon with intent to cause bodily harm; and (2) an instrument, such as a car or chair, that ordinarily is not used as a weapon may qualify as a dangerous weapon for purposes of the use of the aggravated assault guideline and the application of subsection (b)(2) when the defendant involves it in the offense with the intent to cause bodily harm.</p>

<p><em>Application Notes</em>:</p>
<p>1. <em>Definitions</em>.—For purposes of this guideline:</p>
<p>‘Minor’ means an individual who had not attained the age of 18 years.</p>
<p>‘Minor victim’ includes (A) an undercover law enforcement officer who represented to the defendant that the officer was a minor; or (B) any minor the officer represented to the defendant would be involved in the prohibited sexual conduct.</p>
<p>2. <em>Covered Sex Crime as Instant Offense of Conviction</em>.—For purposes of this guideline, the instant offense of conviction must be a covered sex crime, <em>i.e.</em>: (A) an offense, perpetrated against a minor, under (i) chapter 109A of title 18, United States Code; (ii) chapter 110 of such title, not including trafficking in, receipt of, or possession of, child pornography, or a recordkeeping offense; (iii) chapter 117 of such title, not including transmitting information about a minor or filing a factual statement about an alien individual; or (B) an attempt or a conspiracy to commit any offense described in subdivisions (A)(i) through (iii) of this note.</p>
<p>3. <em>Application of Subsection (a)</em>.—</p>
<p>(A) <em>Definitions</em>.—For purposes of subsection (a):</p>
<p>(i) ‘Offense statutory maximum’ means the maximum term of imprisonment authorized for the instant offense of conviction that is a covered sex crime, including any increase in that maximum term under a sentencing enhancement provision (such as a sentencing enhancement provision contained in 18 U.S.C. § 2247(a) or § 2426(a)) that applies to that covered sex crime because of the defendant’s prior criminal record.</p>
<p>(ii) ‘Sex offense conviction’ (I) means any offense described in 18 U.S.C. § 2426(b)(1)(A) or (B), if the offense was perpetrated against a minor; and (II) does not include trafficking in, receipt of, or possession of, child pornography. ‘Child pornography’ has the meaning given that term in 18 U.S.C. § 2256(8).</p>
<p>(B) <em>Determination of Offense Statutory Maximum in the Case of Multiple Counts of Conviction</em>.—In a case in which more than one count of the instant offense of conviction is a felony that is a covered sex crime, the court shall use the maximum authorized term of imprisonment for the count that has the greatest offense statutory maximum, for purposes of determining the offense statutory maximum under subsection (a).</p>
<p>4. <em>Application of Subsection (b)</em>.—</p>
<p>(A) <em>Definition</em>.—For purposes of subsection (b), ‘prohibited sexual conduct’ (i) means any offense described in 18 U.S.C. § 2426(b)(1)(A) or (B); (ii) includes the production of child pornography; (iii) includes trafficking in child pornography only if, prior to the commission of the instant offense of conviction, the defendant sustained a felony conviction for that trafficking in child pornography; and (iv) does not include receipt or possession of child pornography. ‘Child pornography’ has the meaning given that term in 18 U.S.C. § 2256(8).</p>
<p>(B) <em>Determination of Pattern of Activity</em>.—</p>
<p>(i) <em>In General</em>.—For purposes of subsection (b), the defendant engaged in a pattern of activity involving prohibited sexual conduct if—</p>
<p>(I) on at least two separate occasions, the defendant engaged in prohibited sexual conduct with a minor; and</p>
<p>(II) there were at least two minor victims of the prohibited sexual conduct.</p>
<p>For example, the defendant engaged in a pattern of activity involving prohibited sexual conduct if there were two separate occasions of prohibited sexual conduct and each such occasion involved a different minor, or if there were two separate occasions of prohibited sexual conduct involving the same two minors.</p>
<p>(ii) <em>Occasion of Prohibited Sexual Conduct</em>.—An occasion of prohibited sexual conduct may be considered for purposes of subsection (b) without regard to whether the occasion (I) occurred during the course of the instant offense; or (II) resulted in a conviction for the conduct that occurred on that occasion.</p>
<p>5. <em>Treatment and Monitoring</em>.—</p>
<p>(A) <em>Recommended Maximum Term of Supervised Release</em>.—The statutory maximum term of supervised release is recommended for offenders sentenced under this guideline.</p>
<p>(B) <em>Recommended Conditions of Probation and Supervised Release</em>.—Treatment and monitoring are important tools for supervising offenders and should be considered as special conditions of any term of probation or supervised release that is imposed.</p>
<p><em>Background</em>: This guideline is intended to provide lengthy incarceration for offenders who commit sex offenses against minors and who present a continuing danger to the public. It applies to offenders whose instant offense of conviction is a sex offense committed against a minor victim. The relevant criminal provisions provide for increased statutory maximum penalties for repeat sex offenders and make those increased statutory maximum penalties available if the defendant previously was convicted of any of several federal and state sex offenses (<em>see</em> 18 U.S.C. §§ 2247, 2426). In addition, section 632 of Pub. L. 102–141 and section 505 of Pub. L. 105–314 directed the Commission to ensure lengthy incarceration for offenders who engage in a pattern of activity involving the sexual abuse or exploitation of minors.&quot;.</p>
<p>Section 5B1.3(d) is amended by adding at the end the following:</p>
<p>&quot;(7) <em>Sex Offenses</em></p>
<p>If the instant offense of conviction is a sex offense, as defined in §5D1.2 (Term of Supervised Release) -- a condition requiring the defendant to participate in a program approved by the United States Probation Office for the treatment and monitoring of sex offenders.&quot;.</p>
<p>Section 5D1.2 is amended by adding after subsection (b) the following:</p>
<p>&quot;(c) If the instant offense of conviction is a sex offense, the statutory maximum term of supervised release is recommended.&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §5D1.2 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended by redesignating Notes 1 and 2 as Notes 2 and 3, respectively; by inserting before Note 2, as redesignated by this amendment, the following:</p>
<p>&quot;1. <em>Definition</em>.—For purposes of this guideline, ‘sex offense’ means (A) an offense, perpetrated against a minor, under (i) chapter 109A of title 18, United States Code; (ii) chapter 110 of such title, not including a recordkeeping offense; or (iii) chapter 117 of such title, not including transmitting information about a minor or filing a factual statement about an alien individual; or (B) an attempt or a conspiracy to commit any offense described in subdivisions (A)(i) through (iii) of this note.&quot;;</p>
<p>in Note 2, as redesignated by this amendment, by inserting &quot;<em>Safety Valve Cases</em>.—&quot; before &quot;A defendant&quot;; and in Note 3, as redesignated by this amendment, by inserting &quot;<em>Substantial Assistance Cases</em>.—&quot; before &quot;Upon motion&quot;.</p>
<p>Section 5D1.3(d) is amended by inserting at the end the following:</p>
<p>&quot;(7) <em>Sex Offenses</em></p>
<p>If the instant offense of conviction is a sex offense, as defined in §5D1.2 (Term of Supervised Release) -- a condition requiring the defendant to participate in a program approved by the United States Probation Office for the treatment and monitoring of sex offenders.&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This is a three-part amendment promulgated primarily in response to the Protection of Children from Sexual Predators Act of 1998, Pub. L. 105–314 (the &quot;Act&quot;), which contains several directives to the Commission. In furtherance of the directives, the Commission initiated a comprehensive examination of the guidelines under which most sex crimes are sentenced. Amendment 592, effective November 1, 2000, addressed a number of these directives. (<em>See</em> Amendment 592.)</p>
<p>The first part of the amendment addresses the Act’s directive to increase penalties in any case in which the defendant engaged in a pattern of activity of sexual abuse or sexual exploitation of a minor. In response to this directive, the amendment provides a new Chapter Four (Criminal History and Criminal Livelihood) guideline, §4B1.5 (Repeat and Dangerous Sex Offender Against Minors), that focuses on repeat child sex offenders. This new guideline works in a coordinated manner with §4B1.1 (Career Offender) and creates a tiered approach to punishing repeat child sex offenders.</p>
<p>The first tier, in §4B1.5(a), aims to incapacitate repeat child sex offenders who have an instant offense of conviction of sexual abuse of a minor and a prior felony conviction for sexual abuse of a minor (but to whom §4B1.1 does not apply). This provision subjects a defendant to the greater of the offense level determined under Chapters Two and Three or the offense level obtained from a table that, like the table in §4B1.1, bases the applicable offense level on the statutory maximum for the offense. In addition, the defendant is subject to an enhanced criminal history category of not less than Category V, similar to §4B1.1 (which provides for Category VI). By statute, defendants convicted of a federal sex offense are subject to twice the statutory maximum penalty for a subsequent sex offense conviction. This guideline provision effectuates the Commission’s and Congress's intent to punish repeat child sex offenders severely.</p>
<p>The second tier, in §4B1.5(b), provides a five-level increase in the offense level and a minimum offense level of level 22 for defendants who are not subject to either §4B1.1 or to §4B1.5(a) and who have engaged in a pattern of activity involving prohibited sexual conduct with minors. This part of the guideline does not rely on prior convictions to increase the penalty for those who have a pattern of activity of sexual abuse or exploitation of a minor. The pattern of activity enhancement requires that the defendant engaged in prohibited sexual conduct on at least two separate occasions and that at least two minors were victims of the sexual conduct. This provision is similar to the existing five-level pattern of activity enhancement in subsection (b)(4) of §2G2.2 (Trafficking in Material Involving the Sexual Exploitation of a Minor; Receiving, Transporting, Shipping, or Advertising Material Involving the Sexual Exploitation of a Minor; Possessing Material Involving the Sexual Exploitation of a Minor with Intent to Traffic) and effectuates the Commission’s and Congress’s intent to punish severely offenders who engage in a pattern of activity involving the sexual abuse or exploitation of minors.</p>
<p>Conforming amendments are made to the criminal sexual abuse guidelines in Chapter Two, Part A, Subpart 3 to delete the upward departure provisions for prior sentences for similar conduct; that factor is now taken into account in the new guideline.</p>
<p>In addition to creating a new guideline, this part of the amendment also modifies §5D1.2 (Term of Supervised Release) to provide that the recommended term of supervised release for a defendant convicted of a sex crime is the maximum term authorized by statute. Amendments to §§5B1.3 (Conditions of Probation) and 5D1.3 (Conditions of Supervised Release) effectuate the Commission’s intent that offenders who commit sex crimes receive appropriate treatment and monitoring.</p>
<p>The second part of the amendment addresses a circuit conflict regarding whether multiple counts of possession, receipt, or transportation of images containing child pornography should be grouped together pursuant to subsection (a) or (b) of §3D1.2 (Groups of Closely Related Counts). Resolution of the conflict depends, in part, on determining who is the victim of the offense: the child depicted in the pornography images or society as a whole. Six circuits have held that the child depicted is the victim, and, therefore, that the counts are not grouped. <em>See</em> <em>United States v. Norris</em>, 159 F.3d 926 (5th Cir. 1998); <em>United States v. Hibbler</em>, 159 F.3d 233 (6th Cir. 1998); <em>United States v. Ketcham</em>, 80 F.3d 789 (3d Cir. 1996); <em>United States v. Rugh</em>, 968 F.2d 750 (8th Cir. 1992); <em>United States v. Boos</em>, 127 F.3d 1207 (9th Cir. 1997), <em>cert. denied</em>, 522 U.S. 1066 (1998); and <em>United States v. Tillmon</em>, 195 F.3d 640 (11th Cir. 1999). In contrast, one circuit has held that society as a whole is the victim of these types of offenses, and, therefore, that one count of interstate transportation of child pornography does not group with a count of interstate transportation of a minor with intent to engage in illegal sexual activity in a case in which the child portrayed in the pornography was the same child transported. <em>See</em> <em>United States v. Toler</em>, 901 F.2d 399 (4th Cir. 1990).</p>
<p>In addressing the circuit conflict, the Commission adopted a position that provides for grouping of multiple counts of child pornography distribution, receipt, and possession pursuant to §3D1.2(d). Grouping multiple counts of these offenses pursuant to §3D1.2(d) is appropriate because these offenses typically are continuous and ongoing enterprises. This grouping provision does not require the determination of whether counts involve the same victim in order to calculate a combined adjusted offense level for multiple counts of conviction which, particularly in these kinds of cases, could be complex and time consuming. Consistent with the provisions of subsection (a)(2) of §1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct), this approach provides that additional images of child pornography (often involved in the case, but outside of the offense of conviction) shall be considered by the court in determining the appropriate sentence for the defendant if the conduct related to those images is part of the same course of conduct or common scheme or plan.</p>
<p>The third part of the amendment makes several modifications to §2A3.2 (Criminal Sexual Abuse of a Minor Under the Age of Sixteen Years (Statutory Rape) or Attempt to Commit Such Acts). The amendment responds to the directive in the Act to provide an enhancement for offenses under chapter 117 of title 18, United States Code, involving the transportation of minors for prostitution or prohibited sexual conduct. The amendment increases the offense levels in §2A3.2 and in §2A3.4 (Abusive Sexual Contact or Attempt to Commit Abusive Sexual Contact). The Act focuses on those individuals who travel to meet or transport minors for illegal sexual activity by providing increased statutory maximum penalties for those individuals. In response, the increase in penalties in these guidelines were geared toward those individuals. Specifically, the amendment distinguishes between chapter 117 offenses that involve the commission of a sexual act or sexual contact and those offenses (<em>e.g.</em>, sting cases) that do not, by providing an alternative base offense level in §2A3.2 for chapter 117 offenses that also involve the commission of a sexual act or sexual contact that is three levels greater (<em>i.e.</em>, level 24) than the base offense level applicable to chapter 117 offenses that do not involve a sexual act or sexual contact.</p>
<p>The amendment provides a three-level increase in the base offense level for offenses sentenced under §2A3.2, such that the base offense level (1) for statutory rape unaccompanied by aggravating conduct is increased from level 15 to level 18; (2) for a chapter 117 offense (unaccompanied by a sexual act or sexual contact) is increased from level 18 to level 21; and (3) for a chapter 117 offense (accompanied by a sexual act or sexual contact) results in a base offense level of level 24. The amendment reflects the seriousness accorded criminal sexual abuse offenses by Congress, which provided for statutory maximum penalties of 15 years’ imprisonment (or 30 years’ imprisonment with a prior conviction for a sex crime). A defendant who transmits child pornography to a minor as a means of enticing the minor to engage in illegal sexual activity will receive a sentence increase when that defendant subsequently travels across state lines to engage in illegal sexual activity with that minor. Therefore, this increase also maintains the proportionality between §§2A3.2 and 2G2.2.</p>
<p>The third part of the amendment also makes conforming changes to §2A3.2 to ensure that some chapter 117 offenses that do not include aggravating conduct receive the offense level applicable to statutory rape in its basic form. Technical changes made by the amendment (such as the addition of headings and the reordering of applications notes) are not intended to have substantive effect.</p>

{id: 616, content:"<p><strong>616.</strong> <strong>Amendment:</strong> Section 2A6.2(a) is amended by striking &quot;14&quot; and inserting &quot;18&quot;.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Section 2A6.2(c) is amended by striking subdivision (1) as follows:</p>
<p>&quot;(1) If the offense involved conduct covered by another offense guideline from Chapter Two, Part A (Offenses Against the Person), apply that offense guideline, if the resulting offense level is greater than that determined above.&quot;,</p>

<p>&quot;(1) If the offense involved the commission of another criminal offense, apply the offense guideline from Chapter Two, Part A (Offenses Against the Person) most applicable to that other criminal offense, if the resulting offense level is greater than that determined above.&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §2A6.2 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended in Note 1 by striking the 1-em dash and inserting a colon; and by striking the last paragraph as follows:</p>
<p>&quot;‘Stalking’ means traveling with the intent to injure or harass another person and, in the course of, or as a result of, such travel, placing the person in reasonable fear of death or serious bodily injury to the person or the person’s immediate family. <em>See</em> 18 U.S.C. § 2261A. ‘Immediate family’ has the meaning set forth in 18 U.S.C. § 115(c)(2).&quot;,</p>
<p>and inserting the following:</p>
<p>&quot;‘Stalking’ means (A) traveling with the intent to kill, injure, harass, or intimidate another person and, in the course of, or as a result of, such travel, placing the person in reasonable fear of death or serious bodily injury to that person or an immediate family member of that person; or (B) using the mail or any facility of interstate or foreign commerce to engage in a course of conduct that places that person in reasonable fear of the death of, or serious bodily injury to, that person or an immediate family member of that person. <em>See</em> 18 U.S.C. § 2261A. ‘Immediate family member’ (A) has the meaning given that term in 18 U.S.C. § 115(c)(2); and (B) includes a spouse or intimate partner. ‘Course of conduct’ and ‘spouse or intimate partner’ have the meaning given those terms in 18 U.S.C. § 2266(2) and (7), respectively.&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §1B1.5 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended in Note 3 by inserting after the first sentence the following:</p>
<p>&quot;Consistent with the provisions of §1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct), such other offense includes conduct that may be a state or local offense and conduct that occurred under circumstances that would constitute a federal offense had the conduct taken place within the territorial or maritime jurisdiction of the United States.&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This amendment addresses section 1107 of the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000, Pub. L 106–386 (the &quot;Act&quot;). That section amends 18 U.S.C. §§ 2261, 2261A, and 2262 to broaden the reach of those statutes to include international travel to stalk, commit domestic violence, or violate a protective order. Section 2261A also is amended to broaden the category of persons protected by this statute to include intimate partners of the person stalked. The Act also creates a new offense at section 2261A(2) that prohibits the use of the mail or any facility of interstate or foreign commerce to commit a stalking offense. Several technical changes were also made to these statutes.</p>
<p>The Act includes a directive to the Commission to amend the federal sentencing guidelines to reflect the changes made to 18 U.S.C. § 2261, with specific consideration to be given to the following factors: (1) whether the guidelines relating to stalking offenses should be modified in light of the amendment made by this subsection; and (2) whether any changes the Commission may make to the guidelines pursuant to clause (1) should also be made with respect to offenses under chapter 110A of title 18, United States Code (stalking and domestic violence offenses).</p>
<p>For several reasons, the amendment refers the new stalking by mail offense, like other stalking offenses, to §2A6.2 (Stalking or Domestic Violence). First, the statutory penalties for stalking by mail are the same as the statutory penalties for other stalking offenses. Second, although there was some consideration to refer this new offense to §2A6.1 (Threatening or Harassing Communications), stalking by mail offenses differ significantly from threatening communications in that the former require the defendant’s intent to kill, or injure a person, or place a person in reasonable fear of death or serious bodily injury. Third, referencing stalking by mail offenses to §2A6.1 could result in these offenses receiving higher penalties than other stalking offenses. For example, a defendant who writes a threatening letter, violates a protective order, and engages in some conduct evidencing an intent to carry out such threat, would receive an offense level of level 20 under §2A6.1. A defendant who engages in stalking by mail, violates a protective order, and actually commits bodily injury on the person who is the subject of the protection order would have received, prior to this amendment, an offense level of level 18 under §2A6.2. This amendment reflects the policy judgment that the second defendant should receive punishment equal to, or perhaps greater than, that received by the first defendant. Accordingly, because of concern for proportionality in sentencing stalking and domestic violence offenses relative to other crimes, such as threatening or harassing communications, this amendment increases the base offense level in §2A6.2 from level 14 to level 18. Setting the base offense level at level 18 for stalking and domestic violence crimes ensures that these offenses are sentenced at or above the offense levels for offenses involving threatening and harassing communications.</p>
<p>The amendment also conforms the definition of &quot;stalking&quot; in Application Note 1 of §2A6.2 to the statutory changes made by the Act. Additionally, the amendment modifies the language of subsection (c) in §2A6.2 to clarify application of the cross reference. This change is consistent with the amendment to Application Note 3 of §1B1.5 (Interpretation of References to Other Offense Guidelines), which also clarifies the operation of cross references generally.</p>
<p>These revisions are designed to clarify that, unless otherwise specified, cross references in Chapter Two (Offense Conduct) are to be determined consistently with the provisions of §1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct). Therefore, in a case in which the guideline includes a reference to use another guideline if the conduct involved another offense, the other offense includes conduct that may be a state or local offense and conduct that occurred under circumstances that would constitute a federal offense had the conduct taken place within the territorial or maritime jurisdiction of the United States.</p>

<p><em>Commentary</em></p>
<p><em>Statutory Provisions</em>: 18 U.S.C. §§ 225, 553(a)(1), 641, 656, 657, 659, 662, 664, 1702, 1708, 1831, 1832, 2113(b), 2312-2317; 29 U.S.C. § 501(c). For additional statutory provision(s), <em>see</em> Appendix A (Statutory Index).</p>
<p><em>Application Notes</em>:</p>
<p>1. ‘More than minimal planning,’ ‘firearm,’ and ‘destructive device’ are defined in the Commentary to §1B1.1 (Application Instructions).</p>
<p>‘Trade secret’ is defined in 18 U.S.C. § 1839(3).</p>
<p>‘Foreign instrumentality’ and ‘foreign agent’ are defined in 18 U.S.C. § 1839(1) and (2), respectively.</p>
<p>‘National cemetery’ means a cemetery (A) established under section 2400 of title 38, United States Code; or (B) under the jurisdiction of the Secretary of the Army, the Secretary of the Navy, the Secretary of the Air Force, or the Secretary of the Interior.</p>
<p>2. ‘Loss’ means the value of the property taken, damaged, or destroyed. Ordinarily, when property is taken or destroyed the loss is the fair market value of the particular property at issue. Where the market value is difficult to ascertain or inadequate to measure harm to the victim, the court may measure loss in some other way, such as reasonable replacement cost to the victim. Loss does not include the interest that could have been earned had the funds not been stolen. When property is damaged, the loss is the cost of repairs, not to exceed the loss had the property been destroyed. <em>Examples</em>: (1) In the case of a theft of a check or money order, the loss is the loss that would have occurred if the check or money order had been cashed. (2) In the case of a defendant apprehended taking a vehicle, the loss is the value of the vehicle even if the vehicle is recovered immediately.</p>
<p>If the offense involved making a fraudulent loan or credit card application, or other unlawful conduct involving a loan, a counterfeit access device, or an unauthorized access device, the loss is to be determined in accordance with the Commentary to §2F1.1 (Fraud and Deceit). For example, in accordance with Application Note 17 of the Commentary to §2F1.1, in a case involving an unauthorized access device (such as a stolen credit card), loss includes any unauthorized charge(s) made with the access device. In such a case, the loss shall be not less than $500 per unauthorized access device. For purposes of this application note, ‘counterfeit access device’ and ‘unauthorized access device’ have the meaning given those terms in 18 U.S.C. § 1029(e)(2) and (e)(3), respectively.</p>
<p>In certain cases, an offense may involve a series of transactions without a corresponding increase in loss. For example, a defendant may embezzle $5,000 from a bank and conceal this embezzlement by shifting this amount from one account to another in a series of nine transactions over a six-month period. In this example, the loss is $5,000 (the amount taken), not $45,000 (the sum of the nine transactions), because the additional transactions did not increase the actual or potential loss.</p>
<p>In stolen property offenses (receiving, transporting, transferring, transmitting, or possessing stolen property), the loss is the value of the stolen property determined as in a theft offense.</p>
<p>In an offense involving unlawfully accessing, or exceeding authorized access to, a ‘protected computer’ as defined in 18 U.S.C. § 1030(e)(2)(A) or (B), ‘loss’ includes the reasonable cost to the victim of conducting a damage assessment, restoring the system and data to their condition prior to the offense, and any lost revenue due to interruption of service.</p>
<p>In the case of a partially completed offense (<em>e.g.</em>, an offense involving a completed theft that is part of a larger, attempted theft), the offense level is to be determined in accordance with the provisions of §2X1.1 (Attempt, Solicitation, or Conspiracy) whether the conviction is for the substantive offense, the inchoate offense (attempt, solicitation, or conspiracy), or both; <em>see</em> Application Note 4 in the Commentary to §2X1.1.</p>
<p>3. For the purposes of subsection (b)(1), the loss need not be determined with precision. The court need only make a reasonable estimate of the loss, given the available information. This estimate, for example, may be based upon the approximate number of victims and the average loss to each victim, or on more general factors such as the scope and duration of the offense.</p>
<p>4. Controlled substances should be valued at their estimated street value.</p>
<p>5. ‘Undelivered United States mail’ means mail that has not actually been received by the addressee or his agent (<em>e.g.</em>, it includes mail that is in the addressee’s mail box).</p>
<p>6. ‘From the person of another’ refers to property, taken without the use of force, that was being held by another person or was within arms’ reach. Examples include pick-pocketing or non-forcible purse-snatching, such as the theft of a purse from a shopping cart.</p>
<p>7. Subsection (b)(5), referring to an ‘organized scheme to steal vehicles or vehicle parts,’ provides an alternative minimum measure of loss in the case of an ongoing, sophisticated operation such as an auto theft ring or ‘chop shop.’ ‘Vehicles’ refers to all forms of vehicles, including aircraft and watercraft.</p>
<p>8. ‘Financial institution,’ as used in this guideline, is defined to include any institution described in 18 U.S.C. §§ 20, 656, 657, 1005-1007, and 1014; any state or foreign bank, trust company, credit union, insurance company, investment company, mutual fund, savings (building and loan) association, union or employee pension fund; any health, medical or hospital insurance association; brokers and dealers registered, or required to be registered, with the Securities and Exchange Commission; futures commodity merchants and commodity pool operators registered, or required to be registered, with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission; and any similar entity, whether or not insured by the federal government. ‘Union or employee pension fund’ and ‘any health, medical, or hospital insurance association,’ as used above, primarily include large pension funds that serve many individuals (<em>e.g.</em>, pension funds of large national and international organizations, unions, and corporations doing substantial interstate business), and associations that undertake to provide pension, disability, or other benefits (<em>e.g.</em>, medical or hospitalization insurance) to large numbers of persons.</p>
<p>9. An offense shall be deemed to have ‘substantially jeopardized the safety and soundness of a financial institution’ if, as a consequence of the offense, the institution became insolvent; substantially reduced benefits to pensioners or insureds; was unable on demand to refund fully any deposit, payment, or investment; was so depleted of its assets as to be forced to merge with another institution in order to continue active operations; or was placed in substantial jeopardy of any of the above.</p>
<p>10. ‘The defendant derived more than $1,000,000 in gross receipts from the offense,’ as used in subsection (b)(6)(B), generally means that the gross receipts to the defendant individually, rather than to all participants, exceeded $1,000,000. ‘Gross receipts from the offense’ includes all property, real or personal, tangible or intangible, which is obtained directly or indirectly as a result of such offense. <em>See</em> 18 U.S.C. § 982(a)(4).</p>
<p>11. If the defendant is convicted under 18 U.S.C. § 225 (relating to a continuing financial crimes enterprise), the offense level is that applicable to the underlying series of offenses comprising the ‘continuing financial crimes enterprise.’</p>
<p>12. If subsection (b)(6)(A) or (B) applies, there shall be a rebuttable presumption that the offense involved ‘more than minimal planning.’</p>
<p>13. If the offense involved theft or embezzlement from an employee pension or welfare benefit plan (a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 664) and the defendant was a fiduciary of the benefit plan, an adjustment under §3B1.3 (Abuse of Position of Trust or Use of Special Skill) will apply. ‘Fiduciary of the benefit plan’ is defined in 29 U.S.C. § 1002(21)(A) to mean a person who exercises any discretionary authority or control in respect to the management of such plan or exercises authority or control in respect to management or disposition of its assets, or who renders investment advice for a fee or other direct or indirect compensation with respect to any moneys or other property of such plan, or has any authority or responsibility to do so, or who has any discretionary authority or responsibility in the administration of such plan.</p>
<p>If the offense involved theft or embezzlement from a labor union (a violation of 29 U.S.C. § 501(c)) and the defendant was a union officer or occupied a position of trust in the union as set forth in 29 U.S.C. § 501(a), an adjustment under §3B1.3 (Abuse of Position of Trust or Use of Special Skill) will apply.</p>
<p>14. In cases where the loss determined under subsection (b)(1) does not fully capture the harmfulness of the conduct, an upward departure may be warranted. For example, the theft of personal information or writings (<em>e.g.</em>, medical records, educational records, a diary) may involve a substantial invasion of a privacy interest that would not be addressed by the monetary loss provisions of subsection (b)(1).</p>
<p>15. In cases involving theft of information from a ‘protected computer’, as defined in 18 U.S.C. § 1030(e)(2)(A) or (B), an upward departure may be warranted where the defendant sought the stolen information to further a broader criminal purpose.</p>
<p><em>Background</em>: The value of the property stolen plays an important role in determining sentences for theft and other offenses involving stolen property because it is an indicator of both the harm to the victim and the gain to the defendant. Because of the structure of the Sentencing Table (Chapter 5, Part A), subsection (b)(1) results in an overlapping range of enhancements based on the loss.</p>
<p>The guidelines provide an enhancement for more than minimal planning, which includes most offense behavior involving affirmative acts on multiple occasions. Planning and repeated acts are indicative of an intention and potential to do considerable harm. Also, planning is often related to increased difficulties of detection and proof.</p>
<p>Consistent with statutory distinctions, an increased minimum offense level is provided for the theft of undelivered mail. Theft of undelivered mail interferes with a governmental function, and the scope of the theft may be difficult to ascertain.</p>
<p>Theft from the person of another, such as pickpocketing or non-forcible purse-snatching, receives an enhanced sentence because of the increased risk of physical injury. This guideline does not include an enhancement for thefts from the person by means of force or fear; such crimes are robberies.</p>
<p>A minimum offense level of 14 is provided for offenses involving an organized scheme to steal vehicles or vehicle parts. Typically, the scope of such activity is substantial (<em>i.e.</em>, the value of the stolen property, combined with an enhancement for ‘more than minimal planning’ would itself result in an offense level of at least 14), but the value of the property is particularly difficult to ascertain in individual cases because the stolen property is rapidly resold or otherwise disposed of in the course of the offense. Therefore, the specific offense characteristic of ‘organized scheme’ is used as an alternative to ‘loss’ in setting the offense level.</p>

<p><em>Commentary</em></p>
<p><em>Statutory Provisions</em>: 7 U.S.C. §§ 6, 6b, 6c, 6h, 6o, 13, 23; 15 U.S.C. §§ 50, 77e, 77q, 77x, 78j, 78ff, 80b-6, 1644; 18 U.S.C. §§ 225, 285-289, 471-473, 500, 510, 659, 1001-1008, 1010-1014, 1016-1022, 1025, 1026, 1028, 1029, 1030(a)(4), 1031, 1341-1344, 2314, 2315. For additional statutory provision(s), <em>see</em> Appendix A (Statutory Index).</p>
<p><em>Application Notes</em>:</p>
<p>1. The adjustments in §2F1.1(b)(4) are alternative rather than cumulative. If in a particular case, however, both of the enumerated factors applied, an upward departure might be warranted.</p>
<p>2. ‘More than minimal planning’ (subsection (b)(2)(A)) is defined in the Commentary to §1B1.1 (Application Instructions).</p>
<p>3. ‘Mass-marketing,’ as used in subsection (b)(3), means a plan, program, promotion, or campaign that is conducted through solicitation by telephone, mail, the Internet, or other means to induce a large number of persons to (A) purchase goods or services; (B) participate in a contest or sweepstakes; or (C) invest for financial profit. The enhancement would apply, for example, if the defendant conducted or participated in a telemarketing campaign that solicited a large number of individuals to purchase fraudulent life insurance policies.</p>
<p>4. ‘Scheme to defraud more than one victim,’ as used in subsection (b)(2)(B), refers to a design or plan to obtain something of value from more than one person. In this context, &quot;victim&quot; refers to the person or entity from which the funds are to come directly. Thus, a wire fraud in which a single telephone call was made to three distinct individuals to get each of them to invest in a pyramid scheme would involve a scheme to defraud more than one victim, but passing a fraudulently endorsed check would not, even though the maker, payee and/or payor all might be considered victims for other purposes, such as restitution.</p>
<p>5. Subsection (b)(4)(A) provides an adjustment for a misrepresentation that the defendant was acting on behalf of a charitable, educational, religious or political organization, or a government agency. Examples of conduct to which this factor applies would include a group of defendants who solicit contributions to a non-existent famine relief organization by mail, a defendant who diverts donations for a religiously affiliated school by telephone solicitations to church members in which the defendant falsely claims to be a fund-raiser for the school, or a defendant who poses as a federal collection agent in order to collect a delinquent student loan.</p>
<p>6. Subsection (b)(4)(C) provides an enhancement if the defendant commits a fraud in contravention of a prior, official judicial or administrative warning, in the form of an order, injunction, decree, or process, to take or not to take a specified action. A defendant who does not comply with such a prior, official judicial or administrative warning demonstrates aggravated criminal intent and deserves additional punishment. If it is established that an entity the defendant controlled was a party to the prior proceeding that resulted in the official judicial or administrative action, and the defendant had knowledge of that prior decree or order, this enhancement applies even if the defendant was not a specifically named party in that prior case. For example, a defendant whose business previously was enjoined from selling a dangerous product, but who nonetheless engaged in fraudulent conduct to sell the product, is subject to this enhancement. This enhancement does not apply if the same conduct resulted in an enhancement pursuant to a provision found elsewhere in the guidelines (<em>e.g.</em>, a violation of a condition of release addressed in §2J1.7 (Commission of Offense While on Release) or a violation of probation addressed in §4A1.1 (Criminal History Category)).</p>
<p>If the conduct that forms the basis for an enhancement under (b)(4)(B) or (C) is the only conduct that forms the basis for an adjustment under §3C1.1 (Obstruction of Justice), do not apply an adjustment under §3C1.1.</p>
<p>7. Some fraudulent schemes may result in multiple-count indictments, depending on the technical elements of the offense. The cumulative loss produced by a common scheme or course of conduct should be used in determining the offense level, regardless of the number of counts of conviction. <em>See</em> Chapter Three, Part D (Multiple Counts).</p>
<p>8. Valuation of loss is discussed in the Commentary to §2B1.1 (Larceny, Embezzlement, and Other Forms of Theft). As in theft cases, loss is the value of the money, property, or services unlawfully taken; it does not, for example, include interest the victim could have earned on such funds had the offense not occurred. Consistent with the provisions of §2X1.1 (Attempt, Solicitation, or Conspiracy), if an intended loss that the defendant was attempting to inflict can be determined, this figure will be used if it is greater than the actual loss. Frequently, loss in a fraud case will be the same as in a theft case. For example, if the fraud consisted of selling or attempting to sell $40,000 in worthless securities, or representing that a forged check for $40,000 was genuine, the loss would be $40,000.</p>
<p>There are, however, instances where additional factors are to be considered in determining the loss or intended loss:</p>
<p>(a) <em>Fraud Involving Misrepresentation of the Value of an Item or Product Substitution</em></p>
<p>A fraud may involve the misrepresentation of the value of an item that does have some value (in contrast to an item that is worthless). Where, for example, a defendant fraudulently represents that stock is worth $40,000 and the stock is worth only $10,000, the loss is the amount by which the stock was overvalued (<em>i.e.</em>, $30,000). In a case involving a misrepresentation concerning the quality of a consumer product, the loss is the difference between the amount paid by the victim for the product and the amount for which the victim could resell the product received.</p>
<p>(b) <em>Fraudulent Loan Application and Contract Procurement Cases</em></p>
<p>In fraudulent loan application cases and contract procurement cases, the loss is the actual loss to the victim (or if the loss has not yet come about, the expected loss). For example, if a defendant fraudulently obtains a loan by misrepresenting the value of his assets, the loss is the amount of the loan not repaid at the time the offense is discovered, reduced by the amount the lending institution has recovered (or can expect to recover) from any assets pledged to secure the loan. However, where the intended loss is greater than the actual loss, the intended loss is to be used.</p>
<p>In some cases, the loss determined above may significantly understate or overstate the seriousness of the defendant’s conduct. For example, where the defendant substantially understated his debts to obtain a loan, which he nevertheless repaid, the loss determined above (zero loss) will tend not to reflect adequately the risk of loss created by the defendant’s conduct. Conversely, a defendant may understate his debts to a limited degree to obtain a loan (<em>e.g.</em>, to expand a grain export business), which he genuinely expected to repay and for which he would have qualified at a higher interest rate had he made truthful disclosure, but he is unable to repay the loan because of some unforeseen event (<em>e.g.</em>, an embargo imposed on grain exports) which would have caused a default in any event. In such a case, the loss determined above may overstate the seriousness of the defendant’s conduct. Where the loss determined above significantly understates or overstates the seriousness of the defendant’s conduct, an upward or downward departure may be warranted.</p>
<p>(c) <em>Consequential Damages in Procurement Fraud and Product Substitution Cases</em></p>
<p>In contrast to other types of cases, loss in a procurement fraud or product substitution case includes not only direct damages, but also consequential damages that were reasonably foreseeable. For example, in a case involving a defense product substitution offense, the loss includes the government’s reasonably foreseeable costs of making substitute transactions and handling or disposing of the product delivered or retrofitting the product so that it can be used for its intended purpose, plus the government’s reasonably foreseeable cost of rectifying the actual or potential disruption to government operations caused by the product substitution. Similarly, in the case of fraud affecting a defense contract award, loss includes the reasonably foreseeable administrative cost to the government and other participants of repeating or correcting the procurement action affected, plus any increased cost to procure the product or service involved that was reasonably foreseeable. Inclusion of reasonably foreseeable consequential damages directly in the calculation of loss in procurement fraud and product substitution cases reflects that such damages frequently are substantial in such cases.</p>
<p>(d) <em>Diversion of Government Program Benefits</em></p>
<p>In a case involving diversion of government program benefits, loss is the value of the benefits diverted from intended recipients or uses.</p>
<p>(e) <em>Davis-Bacon Act Cases</em></p>
<p>In a case involving a Davis-Bacon Act violation (a violation of 40 U.S.C. § 276a, criminally prosecuted under 18 U.S.C. § 1001), the</p>
<p>loss is the difference between the legally required and actual wages paid.</p>
<p>9. For the purposes of subsection (b)(1), the loss need not be determined with precision. The court need only make a reasonable estimate of the loss, given the available information. This estimate, for example, may be based on the approximate number of victims and an estimate of the average loss to each victim, or on more general factors, such as the nature and duration of the fraud and the revenues generated by similar operations. The offender’s gain from committing the fraud is an alternative estimate that ordinarily will underestimate the loss.</p>
<p>10. In the case of a partially completed offense (<em>e.g.</em>, an offense involving a completed fraud that is part of a larger, attempted fraud), the offense level is to be determined in accordance with the provisions of §2X1.1 (Attempt, Solicitation, or Conspiracy) whether the conviction is for the substantive offense, the inchoate offense (attempt, solicitation, or conspiracy), or both; <em>see</em> Application Note 4 in the Commentary to §2X1.1.</p>
<p>11. In cases in which the loss determined under subsection (b)(1) does not fully capture the harmfulness and seriousness of the conduct, an upward departure may be warranted. Examples may include the following:</p>
<p>(a) a primary objective of the fraud was non-monetary; or the fraud caused or risked reasonably foreseeable, substantial non-monetary harm;</p>
<p>(b) false statements were made for the purpose of facilitating some other crime;</p>
<p>(c) the offense caused reasonably foreseeable, physical or psychological harm or severe emotional trauma;</p>
<p>(d) the offense endangered national security or military readiness;</p>
<p>(e) the offense caused a loss of confidence in an important institution;</p>
<p>(f) the offense involved the knowing endangerment of the solvency of one or more victims.</p>
<p>In a few instances, the loss determined under subsection (b)(1) may overstate the seriousness of the offense. This may occur, for example, where a defendant attempted to negotiate an instrument that was so obviously fraudulent that no one would seriously consider honoring it. In such cases, a downward departure may be warranted.</p>
<p>12. Offenses involving access devices, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 1028 and 1029, are also covered by this guideline. In such a case, an upward departure may be warranted where the actual loss does not adequately reflect the seriousness of the conduct.</p>
<p>Offenses involving identification documents, false identification documents, and means of identification, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1028, also are covered by this guideline. If the primary purpose of the offense was to violate, or assist another to violate, the law pertaining to naturalization, citizenship, or legal resident status, apply §2L2.1 (Trafficking in a Document Relating to Naturalization) or §2L2.2 (Fraudulently Acquiring Documents Relating to Naturalization), as appropriate, rather than §2F1.1.</p>
<p>13. If the fraud exploited vulnerable victims, an enhancement will apply. <em>See</em> §3A1.1 (Hate Crime Motivation or Vulnerable Victim).</p>
<p>14. Sometimes, offenses involving fraudulent statements are prosecuted under 18 U.S.C. § 1001, or a similarly general statute, although the offense is also covered by a more specific statute. Examples include false entries regarding currency transactions, for which §2S1.3 would be more apt, and false statements to a customs officer, for which §2T3.1 likely would be more apt. In certain other cases, the mail or wire fraud statutes, or other relatively broad statutes, are used primarily as jurisdictional bases for the prosecution of other offenses. For example, a state arson offense where a fraudulent insurance claim was mailed might be prosecuted as mail fraud. Where the indictment or information setting forth the count of conviction (or a stipulation as described in §1B1.2(a)) establishes an offense more aptly covered by another guideline, apply that guideline rather than §2F1.1. Otherwise, in such cases, §2F1.1 is to be applied, but a departure from the guidelines may be considered.</p>
<p>15. For purposes of subsection (b)(5)—</p>
<p>‘Counterfeit access device’ (A) has the meaning given that term in 18 U.S.C. § 1029(e)(2); and (B) also includes a telecommunications instrument that has been modified or altered to obtain unauthorized use of telecommunications service. ‘Telecommunications service’ has the meaning given that term in 18 U.S.C. § 1029(e)(9).</p>
<p>‘Device-making equipment’ (A) has the meaning given that term in 18 U.S.C. § 1029(e)(6); and (B) also includes (i) any hardware or software that has been configured as described in 18 U.S.C. § 1029(a)(9); and (ii) a scanning receiver referred to in 18 U.S.C. § 1029(a)(8). ‘Scanning receiver’ has the meaning given that term in 18 U.S.C. § 1029(e)(8).</p>
<p>‘Means of identification’ has the meaning given that term in 18 U.S.C. § 1028(d)(3), except that such means of identification shall be of an actual (<em>i.e.</em>, not fictitious) individual other than the defendant or a person for whose conduct the defendant is accountable under §1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct).</p>
<p>‘Produce’ includes manufacture, design, alter, authenticate, duplicate, or assemble. ‘Production’ includes manufacture, design, alteration, authentication, duplication, or assembly.</p>
<p>‘Unauthorized access device’ has the meaning given that term in 18 U.S.C. § 1029(e)(3).</p>
<p>16. Subsection (b)(5)(C)(i) applies in a case in which a means of identification of an individual other than the defendant (or a person for whose conduct the defendant is accountable under §1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct)) is used without that individual’s authorization unlawfully to produce or obtain another means of identification.</p>
<p>Examples of conduct to which this subsection should apply are as follows:</p>
<p>(A) A defendant obtains an individual’s name and social security number from a source (<em>e.g.</em>, from a piece of mail taken from the individual’s mailbox) and obtains a bank loan in that individual’s name. In this example, the account number of the bank loan is the other means of identification that has been obtained unlawfully.</p>
<p>(B) A defendant obtains an individual’s name and address from a source (<em>e.g.</em>, from a driver’s license in a stolen wallet) and applies for, obtains, and subsequently uses a credit card in that individual’s name. In this example, the credit card is the other means of identification that has been obtained unlawfully.</p>
<p>Examples of conduct to which subsection (b)(5)(C)(i) should not apply are as follows:</p>
<p>(A) A defendant uses a credit card from a stolen wallet only to make a purchase. In such a case, the defendant has not used the stolen credit card to obtain another means of identification.</p>
<p>(B) A defendant forges another individual’s signature to cash a stolen check. Forging another individual’s signature is not producing another means of identification.</p>
<p>Subsection (b)(5)(C)(ii) applies in any case in which the offense involved the possession of 5 or more means of identification that unlawfully were produced or obtained, regardless of the number of individuals in whose name (or other identifying information) the means of identification were so produced or so obtained.</p>
<p>In a case involving unlawfully produced or unlawfully obtained means of identification, an upward departure may be warranted if the offense level does not adequately address the seriousness of the offense. Examples may include the following:</p>
<p>(A) The offense caused substantial harm to the victim’s reputation or credit record, or the victim suffered a substantial inconvenience related to repairing the victim’s reputation or a damaged credit record.</p>
<p>(B) An individual whose means of identification the defendant used to obtain unlawful means of identification is erroneously arrested or denied a job because an arrest record has been made in the individual’s name.</p>
<p>(C) The defendant produced or obtained numerous means of identification with respect to one individual and essentially assumed that individual’s identity.</p>
<p>17. In a case involving any counterfeit access device or unauthorized access device, loss includes any unauthorized charges made with the counterfeit access device or unauthorized access device. In any such case, loss shall be not less than $500 per access device. However, if the unauthorized access device is a means of telecommunications access that identifies a specific telecommunications instrument or telecommunications account (including an electronic serial number/mobile identification number (ESN/MIN) pair), and that means was only possessed, and not used, during the commission of the offense, loss shall be not less than $100 per unused means. For purposes of this application note, ‘counterfeit access device’ and ‘unauthorized access device’ have the meaning given those terms in Application Note 15.</p>
<p>18. For purposes of subsection (b)(6)(B), ‘United States’ means each of the 50 states, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the United States Virgin Islands, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, and American Samoa.</p>
<p>For purposes of subsection (b)(6)(C), ‘sophisticated means’ means especially complex or especially intricate offense conduct pertaining to the execution or concealment of an offense. For example, in a telemarketing scheme, locating the main office of the scheme in one jurisdiction but locating soliciting operations in another jurisdiction would ordinarily indicate sophisticated means. Conduct such as hiding assets or transactions, or both, through the use of fictitious entities, corporate shells, or offshore bank accounts also ordinarily would indicate sophisticated means.</p>
<p>The enhancement for sophisticated means under subsection (b)(6)(C) requires conduct that is significantly more complex or intricate than the conduct that may form the basis for an enhancement for more than minimal planning under subsection (b)(2)(A).</p>
<p>If the conduct that forms the basis for an enhancement under subsection (b)(6) is the only conduct that forms the basis for an adjustment under §3C1.1 (Obstruction of Justice), do not apply an adjustment under §3C1.1.</p>
<p>19. ‘Financial institution,’ as used in this guideline, is defined to include any institution described in 18 U.S.C. §§ 20, 656, 657, 1005-1007, and 1014; any state or foreign bank, trust company, credit union, insurance company, investment company, mutual fund, savings (building and loan) association, union or employee pension fund; any health, medical or hospital insurance association; brokers and dealers registered, or required to be registered, with the Securities and Exchange Commission; futures commodity merchants and commodity pool operators registered, or required to be registered, with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission; and any similar entity, whether or not insured by the federal government. ‘Union or employee pension fund’ and ‘any health, medical, or hospital insurance association,’ as used above, primarily include large pension funds that serve many individuals (<em>e.g.</em>, pension funds of large national and international organizations, unions, and corporations doing substantial interstate business), and associations that undertake to provide pension, disability, or other benefits (<em>e.g.</em>, medical or hospitalization insurance) to large numbers of persons.</p>
<p>20. An offense shall be deemed to have ‘substantially jeopardized the safety and soundness of a financial institution’ if, as a consequence of the offense, the institution became insolvent; substantially reduced benefits to pensioners or insureds; was unable on demand to refund fully any deposit, payment, or investment; was so depleted of its assets as to be forced to merge with another institution in order to continue active operations; or was placed in substantial jeopardy of any of the above.</p>
<p>21. ‘The defendant derived more than $1,000,000 in gross receipts from the offense,’ as used in subsection (b)(8)(B), generally means that the gross receipts to the defendant individually, rather than to all participants, exceeded $1,000,000. ‘Gross receipts from the offense’ includes all property, real or personal, tangible or intangible, which is obtained directly or indirectly as a result of such offense. <em>See</em> 18 U.S.C. § 982(a)(4).</p>
<p>22. If the defendant is convicted under 18 U.S.C. § 225 (relating to a continuing financial crimes enterprise), the offense level is that applicable to the underlying series of offenses comprising the ‘continuing financial crimes enterprise.’</p>
<p>23. If subsection (b)(5), subsection (b)(8)(A), or subsection (b)(8)(B) applies, there shall be a rebuttable presumption that the offense also involved more than minimal planning for purposes of subsection (b)(2).</p>
<p>If the conduct that forms the basis for an enhancement under subsection (b)(5) is the only conduct that forms the basis of an enhancement under subsection (b)(6), do not apply an enhancement under subsection (b)(6).</p>
<p><em>Background</em>: This guideline is designed to apply to a wide variety of fraud cases. The statutory maximum term of imprisonment for most such offenses is five years. The guideline does not link offense characteristics to specific code sections. Because federal fraud statutes are so broadly written, a single pattern of offense conduct usually can be prosecuted under several code sections, as a result of which the offense of conviction may be somewhat arbitrary. Furthermore, most fraud statutes cover a broad range of conduct with extreme variation in severity.</p>
<p>Empirical analyses of pre-guidelines practice showed that the most important factors that determined sentence length were the amount of loss and whether the offense was an isolated crime of opportunity or was sophisticated or repeated. Accordingly, although they are imperfect, these are the primary factors upon which the guideline has been based.</p>
<p>The extent to which an offense is planned or sophisticated is important in assessing its potential harmfulness and the dangerousness of the offender, independent of the actual harm. A complex scheme or repeated incidents of fraud are indicative of an intention and potential to do considerable harm. In pre-guidelines practice, this factor had a significant impact, especially in frauds involving small losses. Accordingly, the guideline specifies a 2-level enhancement when this factor is present.</p>
<p>Use of false pretenses involving charitable causes and government agencies enhances the sentences of defendants who take advantage of victims’ trust in government or law enforcement agencies or their generosity and charitable motives. Taking advantage of a victim’s self-interest does not mitigate the seriousness of fraudulent conduct. However, defendants who exploit victims’ charitable impulses or trust in government create particular social harm. The commission of a fraud in the course of a bankruptcy proceeding subjects the defendant to an enhanced sentence because that fraudulent conduct undermines the bankruptcy process as well as harms others with an interest in the bankruptcy estate.</p>
<p>Offenses that involve the use of transactions or accounts outside the United States in an effort to conceal illicit profits and criminal conduct involve a particularly high level of sophistication and complexity. These offenses are difficult to detect and require costly investigations and prosecutions. Diplomatic processes often must be used to secure testimony and evidence beyond the jurisdiction of United States courts. Consequently, a minimum level of 12 is provided for these offenses.</p>
<p>Subsections (b)(5)(A) and(B) implement the instruction to the Commission in section 4 of the Wireless Telephone Protection Act, Public Law 105–172.</p>
<p>Subsection (b)(5)(C) implements the directive to the Commission in section 4 of the Identity Theft and Assumption Deterrence Act of 1998, Public Law 105–318. This subsection focuses principally on an aggravated form of identity theft known as ‘affirmative identity theft’ or ‘breeding,’ in which a defendant uses another individual’s name, social security number, or some other form of identification (the ‘means of identification’) to ‘breed’ (<em>i.e.</em>, produce or obtain) new or additional forms of identification. Because 18 U.S.C. § 1028(d) broadly defines ‘means of identification,’ the new or additional forms of identification can include items such as a driver’s license, a credit card, or a bank loan. This subsection provides a minimum offense level of level 12, in part, because of the seriousness of the offense. The minimum offense level accounts for the fact that the means of identification that were ‘bred’ (<em>i.e.</em>, produced or obtained) often are within the defendant’s exclusive control, making it difficult for the individual victim to detect that the victim’s identity has been ‘stolen.’ Generally, the victim does not become aware of the offense until certain harms have already occurred (<em>e.g.</em>, a damaged credit rating or inability to obtain a loan). The minimum offense level also accounts for the non-monetary harm associated with these types of offenses, much of which may be difficult or impossible to quantify (<em>e.g.</em>, harm to the individual’s reputation or credit rating, inconvenience, and other difficulties resulting from the offense). The legislative history of the Identity Theft and Assumption Deterrence Act of 1998 indicates that Congress was especially concerned with providing increased punishment for this type of harm.</p>
<p>Subsection (b)(6) implements, in a broader form, the instruction to the Commission in section 6(c)(2) of Public Law 105–184.</p>
<p>Subsection (b)(7)(B) implements, in a broader form, the instruction to the Commission in section 110512 of Public Law 103–322.</p>
<p>Subsection (b)(8)(A) implements, in a broader form, the instruction to the Commission in section 961(m) of Public Law 101–73.</p>
<p>Subsection (b)(8)(B) implements the instruction to the Commission in section 2507 of Public Law 101–647.</p>
<p>Subsection (c) implements the instruction to the Commission in section 805(c) of Public Law 104–132.</p>

<p><em>Statutory Provisions</em>: 15 U.S.C. § 78j and 17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5. For additional statutory provision(s), <em>see</em> Appendix A (Statutory Index).</p>
<p><em>Application Note</em>:</p>
<p>1. Section 3B1.3 (Abuse of Position of Trust or Use of Special Skill) should be applied only if the defendant occupied and abused a position of special trust. Examples might include a corporate president or an attorney who misused information regarding a planned but unannounced takeover attempt. It typically would not apply to an ordinary ‘tippee.’</p>
<p><em>Background</em>: This guideline applies to certain violations of Rule 10b-5 that are commonly referred to as ‘insider trading.’ Insider trading is treated essentially as a sophisticated fraud. Because the victims and their losses are difficult if not impossible to identify, the gain, <em>i.e.</em>, the total increase in value realized through trading in securities by the defendant and persons acting in concert with him or to whom he provided inside information, is employed instead of the victims’ losses.</p>
<p>Certain other offenses, <em>e.g.</em>, 7 U.S.C. § 13(e), that involve misuse of inside information for personal gain also may appropriately be covered by this guideline.&quot;.</p>
<p>Chapter Two, Part B, Subpart 1, is amended by adding at the end the following:</p>
<p>&quot;§2B1.4. <em>Insider Trading</em></p>
<p>(a) Base Offense Level: 8</p>
<p>(b) Specific Offense Characteristic</p>
<p>(1) If the gain resulting from the offense exceeded $5,000, increase by the number of levels from the table in §2B1.1 (Theft, Property Destruction, and Fraud) corresponding to that amount.</p>

<p><em>Application Note</em>:</p>
<p>1. <em>Application of Subsection of §3B1.3</em>.—Section 3B1.3 (Abuse of Position of Trust or Use of Special Skill) should be applied only if the defendant occupied and abused a position of special trust. Examples might include a corporate president or an attorney who misused information regarding a planned but unannounced takeover attempt. It typically would not apply to an ordinary ‘tippee’.</p>

<p>The Commentary to §1B1.1 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended in Note 1 by striking subdivision (f) as follows:</p>
<p>&quot;(f) ‘More than minimal planning’ means more planning than is typical for commission of the offense in a simple form. ‘More than minimal planning’ also exists if significant affirmative steps were taken to conceal the offense, other than conduct to which §3C1.1 (Obstructing or Impeding the Administration of Justice) applies.</p>
<p>‘More than minimal planning’ is deemed present in any case involving repeated acts over a period of time, unless it is clear that each instance was purely opportune. Consequently, this adjustment will apply especially frequently in property offenses.</p>
<p>In an assault, for example, waiting to commit the offense when no witnesses were present would not alone constitute more than minimal planning. By contrast, luring the victim to a specific location, or wearing a ski mask to prevent identification, would constitute more than minimal planning.</p>
<p>In a commercial burglary, for example, checking the area to make sure no witnesses were present would not alone constitute more than minimal planning. By contrast, obtaining building plans to plot a particular course of entry, or disabling an alarm system, would constitute more than minimal planning.</p>
<p>In a theft, going to a secluded area of a store to conceal the stolen item in one’s pocket would not alone constitute more than minimal planning. However, repeated instances of such thefts on several occasions would constitute more than minimal planning. Similarly, fashioning a special device to conceal the property, or obtaining information on delivery dates so that an especially valuable item could be obtained, would constitute more than minimal planning.</p>
<p>In an embezzlement, a single taking accomplished by a false book entry would constitute only minimal planning. On the other hand, creating purchase orders to, and invoices from, a dummy corporation for merchandise that was never delivered would constitute more than minimal planning, as would several instances of taking money, each accompanied by false entries.&quot;;</p>
<p>and by redesignating subdivisions (g) through (l) as subdivisions (f) through (k), respectively.</p>

<p>The Commentary to §2T1.1 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended by striking the text of Note 4 as follows:</p>
<p>&quot;For purposes of subsection (b)(2), ‘sophisticated concealment’ means especially complex or especially intricate offense conduct in which deliberate steps are taken to make the offense, or its extent, difficult to detect. Conduct such as hiding assets or transactions, or both, through the use of fictitious entities, corporate shells, or offshore bank accounts ordinarily indicates sophisticated concealment.&quot;,</p>
<p>and inserting the following:</p>
<p>&quot;<em>Sophisticated Means Enhancement</em>.— For purposes of subsection (b)(2), ‘sophisticated means’ means especially complex or especially intricate offense conduct pertaining to the execution or concealment of an offense. Conduct such as hiding assets or transactions, or both, through the use of fictitious entities, corporate shells, or offshore financial accounts ordinarily indicates sophisticated means.&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §2T1.1 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended by striking the text of Note 7 as follows:</p>
<p>&quot;If the offense involves both individual and corporate tax returns, the tax loss is the aggregate tax loss from the offenses taken together.&quot;,</p>
<p>and inserting the following:</p>
<p>&quot;If the offense involved both individual and corporate tax returns, the tax loss is the aggregate tax loss from the individual tax offense and the corporate tax offense added together. Accordingly, in a case in which a defendant fails to report income derived from a corporation on both the defendant’s individual tax return and the defendant’s corporate tax return, the tax loss is the sum of (A) the unreported or diverted amount multiplied by (i) 28%; or (ii) the tax rate for the individual tax offense, if sufficient information is available to make a more accurate assessment of that tax rate; and (B) the unreported or diverted amount multiplied by (i) 34%; or (ii) the tax rate for the corporate tax offense, if sufficient information is available to make a more accurate assessment of that tax rate. For example, the defendant, the sole owner of a Subchapter C corporation, fraudulently understates the corporation’s income in the amount of $100,000 on the corporation’s tax return, diverts the funds to the defendant’s own use, and does not report these funds on the defendant’s individual tax return. For purposes of this example, assume the use of 34% with respect to the corporate tax loss and the use of 28% with respect to the individual tax loss. The tax loss attributable to the defendant’s corporate tax return is $34,000 ($100,000 multiplied by 34%). The tax loss attributable to the defendant’s individual tax return is $28,000 ($100,000 multiplied by 28%). The tax loss for the offenses are added together to equal $62,000 ($34,000 + $28,000).&quot;.</p>
<p>Section 2T1.4(b)(2) is amended by striking &quot;concealment&quot; and inserting &quot;means&quot;; and by inserting after &quot;levels.&quot; the following:</p>
<p>&quot;If the resulting offense level is less than level 12, increase to level 12.&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §2T1.4 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended by striking the text of Note 3 as follows:</p>
<p>&quot;For purposes of subsection (b)(2), ‘sophisticated concealment’ means especially complex or especially intricate offense conduct in which deliberate steps are taken to make the offense, or its extent, difficult to detect. Conduct such as hiding assets or transactions, or both, through the use of fictitious entities, corporate shells, or offshore bank accounts ordinarily indicates sophisticated concealment.&quot;,</p>

<p>&quot;4. The following additional illustrations of an abuse of a position of trust pertain to theft or embezzlement from employee pension or welfare benefit plans or labor unions:</p>
<p>(A) If the offense involved theft or embezzlement from an employee pension or welfare benefit plan and the defendant was a fiduciary of the benefit plan, an adjustment under this section for abuse of a position of trust will apply. ‘Fiduciary of the benefit plan’ is defined in 29 U.S.C. § 1002(21)(A) to mean a person who exercises any discretionary authority or control in respect to the management of such plan or exercises authority or control in respect to management or disposition of its assets, or who renders investment advice for a fee or other direct or indirect compensation with respect to any moneys or other property of such plan, or has any authority or responsibility to do so, or who has any discretionary authority or responsibility in the administration of such plan.</p>
<p>(B) If the offense involved theft or embezzlement from a labor union and the defendant was a union officer or occupied a position of trust in the union (as set forth in 29 U.S.C. § 501(a)), an adjustment under this section for an abuse of a position of trust will apply.&quot;.</p>
<p>Section 3D1.2(d) is amended in the second paragraph by striking &quot;2B1.3&quot; and inserting &quot;2B1.4&quot;; and by striking &quot;§§2F1.1, 2F1.2;&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §3D1.2 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended in Note 6 in the third paragraph by striking &quot;, and would include, for example, larceny, embezzlement, forgery, and fraud&quot;.</p>
<p>Section 3D1.3(b) is amended by striking &quot;(<em>e.g.</em>, theft and fraud)&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §3D1.3 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended in Note 3 by striking &quot;(<em>e.g.</em>, theft and fraud)&quot;; and by striking the last sentence as follows:</p>
<p>&quot;In addition, the adjustment for ‘more than minimal planning’ frequently will apply to multiple count convictions for property offenses.&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary following §3D1.5 captioned &quot;Illustrations of the Operation of the Multiple-Count Rules&quot; is amended by striking Illustration 2 as follows:</p>
<p>&quot;2. Defendant B was convicted on the following seven counts: (1) theft of a $2,000 check; (2) uttering the same $2,000 check; (3) possession of a stolen $1,200 check; (4) forgery of a $600 check; (5) possession of a stolen $1,000 check; (6) forgery of the same $1,000 check; (7) uttering the same $1,000 check. Counts 1, 3 and 5 involve offenses under Part B (Offenses Involving Property), while Counts 2, 4, 6 and 7 involve offenses under Part F (Offenses Involving Fraud and Deceit). For purposes of §3D1.2(d), fraud and theft are treated as offenses of the same kind, and therefore all counts are grouped into a single Group, for which the offense level depends on the aggregate harm. The total value of the checks is $4,800. The fraud guideline is applied, because it produces an offense level that is as high as or higher than the theft guideline. The base offense level is 6; 1 level is added because of the value of the property (§2F1.1(b)(1)); and 2 levels are added because the conduct involved repeated acts with some planning (§2F1.1(b)(2)(A)). The resulting offense level is 9.&quot;;</p>
<p>and by redesignating Illustrations 3 and 4 as Illustrations 2 and 3, respectively.</p>
<p>The Commentary following §3D1.5 captioned &quot;Illustrations of the Operation of the Multiple-Count Rules&quot; is amended in Illustration 3, as redesignated by this amendment, by striking &quot;§2F1.1 (Fraud and Deceit)&quot; and inserting &quot;§2B1.1 (Theft, Property Destruction, and Fraud)&quot;; by striking &quot;14&quot; each place it appears and inserting &quot;16&quot;; and by striking &quot;§2B4.1 or §2F1.1&quot; and inserting &quot;§2B1.1 (assuming the application of the ‘sophisticated means’ enhancement in §2B1.1(b)(8)) or §2B4.1&quot;.</p>

<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This &quot;Economic Crime Package&quot; is a six-part amendment that is the result of Commission study of economic crime issues over a number of years. The major parts of the amendment are: (1) consolidation of the theft, property destruction, and fraud guidelines; (2) a revised, common loss table for the consolidated guideline, and a similar table for tax offenses; (3) a revised, common definition of loss for the consolidated guideline; (4) revisions to guidelines that refer to the loss table in the consolidated guideline; (5) technical and conforming amendments; and (6) amendments regarding tax loss.</p>
<p><em>Consolidation of Theft, Property Destruction, and Fraud; Miscellaneous Revisions </em></p>
<p>The first part of this amendment consolidates the guidelines for theft, §2B1.1 (Larceny, Embezzlement, and Other Forms of Theft; Receiving, Transporting, Transferring, Transmitting, or Possessing Stolen Property), property destruction, §2B1.3 (Property Damage or Destruction), and fraud, §2F1.1 (Fraud and Deceit; Forgery; Offenses Involving Altered or Counterfeit Instruments Other than Counterfeit Bearer Obligations of the United States) into one guideline, §2B1.1 (Theft, Property Destruction, and Fraud). Consolidation will provide similar treatment for similar offenses for which pecuniary harm is a major factor in determining the offense level and, therefore, decrease unwarranted sentencing disparity that may be caused by undue complexity in the guidelines. Consolidation addresses concerns raised over several years by probation officers, judges, and practitioners about the difficulties of determining for particular cases, whether to apply §2B1.1 or §2F1.1 and the disparate sentencing outcomes that can result depending on that decision. Commentators have noted that inasmuch as theft and fraud offenses are conceptually similar, there is no strong reason to sentence them differently.</p>
<p>The base offense level for the consolidated guideline is level 6. This maintains the base offense level for fraud offenses, but represents a two-level increase for theft and property destruction offenses, which prior to this amendment was level 4. The increase of two levels in the base offense levels for theft and property destruction offenses will have minimal impact for low-level theft offenses involving offenders in criminal history Category I or Category II. Commission analysis indicates that only a few defendants will move from Zone A (where probation without conditions of confinement is possible) to Zone B or Zone C, and those that are moved into a zone at higher offense levels in the Sentencing Table generally will have criminal history categories above Category I. As a result, the Commission decided against promulgating a two-level reduction for offenses involving loss amounts less than $2,000.</p>
<p>The amendment deletes the two-level enhancement for more than minimal planning previously at §§2B1.1(b)(4)(A) and 2F1.1(b)(2)(A). The two-fold reason for this change was to obviate the need for judicial fact-finding about this frequently occurring enhancement and to avoid the potential overlap between the more than minimal planning enhancement and the sophisticated means enhancement previously at §2F1.1(b)(6) and now, by this amendment, at §2B1.1(b)(8).</p>
<p>The amendment also eliminates the alternative prong of the more than minimal planning enhancement, at §2F1.1(b)(2)(B) prior to this amendment, which provided a two-level increase if the offense involved more than one victim. The amendment replaces this enhancement with a specific offense characteristic for offenses that involved large numbers of victims. This change addresses three concerns. First, as a result of the consolidation, the more-than-one-victim enhancement, if retained, would apply in cases that, prior to this amendment, were not subject to such an enhancement. Second, a two-level increase in every case involving more than one victim is arguably inconsistent with the approach in subsection (b)(2) of §3A1.1 (Hate Crime Motivation or Vulnerable Victim), which provides a two-level increase if the offense involved a large number of vulnerable victims. Third, in practice, the more than minimal planning enhancement was so closely linked with this enhancement that the decision to eliminate the former argues strongly for also eliminating the latter.</p>
<p>The amendment provides a two-level enhancement for offenses involving ten or more, but fewer than 50, victims, and a four-level increase for offenses involving 50 or more victims. This provision is designed to provide a measured increment that results in increased punishment for offenses involving larger numbers of victims. Its applicability to those cases in which victims, both individuals and organizations, sustain an actual loss under subsection (b)(1) or sustain bodily injury.</p>
<p>A special rule is provided for application of the victim enhancement for offenses involving United States mail because of (i) the unique proof problems often attendant to such offenses, (ii) the frequently significant, but difficult to quantify, non-monetary losses in such offenses, and (iii) the importance of maintaining the integrity of the United States mail.</p>
<p>In addition, the amendment moves the mass-marketing enhancement into the new victim-related specific offense characteristic, as an alternative to the two-level adjustment for more than ten, but fewer than 50, victims. The provision is retained to remain responsive to the congressional directive that led to its original promulgation and reflects the Commission’s expectation that most telemarketing cases, or similar mass-marketing cases, will have at least ten victims and, receive this enhancement. The mass-marketing alternative enhancement also will continue to apply in cases in which mass-marketing has been used to target a large number of persons, regardless of the number of persons who have sustained an actual loss or injury.</p>
<p>In addition, the amendment provides that if a victim enhancement applies, the enhancement under §3A1.1(b)(2) for &quot;a large number of vulnerable victims&quot; does not also apply because the more serious conduct already would have resulted in a higher penalty level.</p>
<p>In response to issues raised in a circuit conflict, the amendment revises the commentary related to subsection (b)(4)(B) of §2B1.1 to clarify the meaning of &quot;person in the business of receiving and selling stolen property.&quot; The amendment addresses an issue that has arisen in case law regarding what conduct receives a defendant for the 4-level enhancement.</p>
<p>In determining the meaning of &quot;in the business of&quot;, some circuits apply what has been termed the &quot;fence test&quot;, under which the court must consider (1) if the stolen property was bought and sold, and (2) to what extent the stolen property transactions encouraged others to commit property crimes. Other circuits have adopted the &quot;totality of the circumstances test&quot; that focuses on the regularity and sophistication of the defendant's operation. <em>Compare</em> <em>United States v. Esquivel</em>, 919 F.2d 957 (5th Cir. 1990), <em>with</em> <em>United States v. St. Cyr</em>, 997 F.2d 698 (1st Cir. 1992). Under either test, courts consider the sophistication and regularity of the business as well as the control, volume, turnover, relationship with thieves, and connections with buyers. Although the factors considered by all of these circuits are similar, the approaches are different.</p>
<p>After consideration, the Commission adopted the totality of circumstances approach because it is more objective and more properly targets the conduct of the individual who is actually in the business of fencing. <em>See</em> <em>United States v. St. Cyr</em>, <em>supra</em>.</p>
<p>In addition, this amendment resolves a circuit conflict regarding the scope of the enhancement in the consolidated guideline for a misrepresentation that the defendant was acting on behalf of a charitable, educational, religious, or political organization, or a government agency. (Prior to this amendment, the enhancement was at subsection (b)(4)(A) of §2F1.1). The conflict concerns whether the misrepresentation enhancement applies only in cases in which the defendant does not have any authority to act on behalf of the covered organization or government agency or if it applies more broadly to cases in which the defendant has a legitimate connection to the covered organization or government agency, but misrepresents that the defendant is acting solely on behalf of that organization or agency. <em>Compare</em>, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>United States v. Marcum</em>, 16 F.3d 599 (4th Cir. 1994) (enhancement appropriate even though defendant did not misrepresent his authority to act on behalf of the organization but rather only misrepresented that he was conducting an activity wholly on behalf of the organization), <em>with</em> <em>United States v. Frazier</em>, 53 F.3d 1105 (10th Cir. 1995) (application of the enhancement is limited to cases in which the defendant exploits the victim by claiming to have authority which in fact does not exist).</p>
<p>The amendment follows the broader view of the Fourth Circuit. It provides for application of the enhancement, now, by this amendment, at §2B1.1(b)(7)(A), if the defendant falsely represented that the defendant was acting to obtain a benefit for a covered organization or agency when, in fact, the defendant intended to divert all or part of that benefit (for example, for the defendant’s personal gain), regardless of whether the defendant actually was associated with the organization or government agency. The Commission determined that the enhancement was appropriate in such cases because the representation that the defendant was acting to obtain a benefit for the organization enables the defendant to commit the offense. In the case of an employee who also holds a position of trust, the amendment provides an application note instructing the court not to apply §3B1.3 (Abuse of Position of Trust or Use of Special Skill) if the same conduct forms the basis both for the enhancement and the adjustment in §3B1.3.</p>
<p>The amendment implements the directive in section 3 of the College Scholarship Fraud Prevention Act of 2000, Public Law 106–420, by providing an additional alternative enhancement that applies if the offense involves a misrepresentation to a consumer in connection with obtaining, providing, or furnishing financial assistance for an institution of higher education. The enhancement targets the provider of the financial assistance or scholarship services, not the individual applicant for such assistance or scholarship, consistent with the intent of the legislation.</p>
<p>This amendment makes two minor substantive changes to the enhancement for conscious or reckless risk of serious bodily injury, now, by this amendment, at subsection (b)(11)(A). First, it increases the minimum offense level from level 13 to level 14 to promote proportionality within this guideline. For example, within the theft and fraud guidelines prior to this amendment, there were other specific offense characteristics that had a higher floor offense level than the risk of bodily injury enhancement: (1) &quot;chop shops&quot; (level 14); (2) jeopardizing the solvency of a financial institution (level 24); and (3) personally receiving more than $1,000,000 from a financial institution (level 24). Second, it inserts &quot;death&quot; before the term &quot;or serious bodily injury&quot; to clarify that the risk of the greater harm also is covered. Including risk of death also provides consistency with similar provisions in other parts of the <em>Guidelines Manual</em>, where risk of death is always included with risk of serious bodily injury.</p>
<p>The amendment modifies the four-level increase and minimum offense level of level 24 for a defendant who personally derives more than $1,000,000 in gross receipts from an offense that affected a financial institution, now, by this amendment, at subsection (b)(12)(A). The amendment retains the minimum offense level but reduces the four-level enhancement to two levels because of the increased offense levels that will result from the loss table for the consolidated guideline. The two-level increase was retained because elimination of the enhancement entirely would not provide an appropriate punishment for those offenders involved with losses that are in the $1,000,000 to $2,500,000 range of loss.</p>
<p>The enhancement also was modified to address issues about what it means to &quot;affect&quot; a financial institution and how to apply the enhancement to a case in which there are more than one financial institution involved. Accordingly, the revised provision focuses on whether the defendant derived more than $1,000,000 in gross receipts from one or more financial institutions as a result of the offense.</p>
<p>The amendment includes a new cross reference (subsection (c)(3)) that is more generally applicable and intended to apply whenever a broadly applicable fraud statute is used to reach conduct that is addressed more specifically in another Chapter Two guideline. Prior to this amendment, the fraud guideline contained an application note that instructed the user to move to another, more appropriate Chapter Two guideline, under specified circumstances. Although this note was not a cross reference, but rather a reminder of the principles enunciated in §1B1.2, it operated like a cross reference in the sense that it required use of a different guideline.</p>
<p>This amendment also makes a minor revision (adding &quot;in a broader form&quot;) to the background commentary regarding the implementation of the directive in section 2507 of Public Law 101–647, nullifying the effect of <em>United States v. Tomasino</em>, 206 F. 3d 739 (7th Cir. 2000).</p>
<p><em>Loss Tables</em></p>
<p>The amendment provides revised loss tables for this consolidated guideline and for the tax offense guidelines. A principle feature of the new tables is that they expand the previously existing one-level increments into two-level increments, thus increasing the range of losses that correspond to an individual increment, compressing the table, and reducing fact-finding. The new loss tables also provide substantial increases in penalties for moderate and higher loss amounts, even, for fraud and theft offenses, notwithstanding the elimination of the two-level enhancement for more than minimal planning. These higher penalty levels respond to comments received from the Department of Justice, the Criminal Law Committee of the Judicial Conference, and others, that the offenses sentenced under the guidelines consolidated by this amendment under-punish individuals involved with moderate and high loss amounts, relative to penalty levels for offenses of similar seriousness sentenced under other guidelines.</p>
<p>Some offenders accountable for relatively low dollar losses will receive slightly lower offense levels under the new loss table for the consolidated guideline because of (1) the elimination of the enhancement for more than minimal planning; (2) the change from one-level to two-level increments for increasing loss amounts; (3) the selection of the breakpoints for the loss increments (including $5,000 as the first loss amount that results in an increase); and (4) the slope chosen for the relationship between increases in loss amount and increases in offense level at the lower loss amounts. This amendment reflects a decision by the Commission that this effect on penalty levels at lower loss amounts is appropriate for several reasons: (1) the lower offense levels provide appropriate deterrence and punishment, generally, (2) at lower offense levels more defendants will be subject to the court’s ability to fashion sentencing alternatives as appropriate (<em>see</em>, <em>e.g.</em>, §5C1.1 (Imposition of a Term of Imprisonment)); and (3) these penalty levels may facilitate the payment of restitution.</p>
<p>The loss table for the consolidated guideline provides the first of incremental increases for cases in which loss exceeds $5,000, rather than $2,000 provided previously in §2F1.1, or $100 provided previously in §2B1.1. The Commission believes this will reduce the fact-finding burden on courts for less serious offenses that are generally subject to greater sentencing flexibility because of the availability of alternatives to incarceration.</p>
<p>The amendment also provides a revised loss table in §2T4.1 (Tax Table) for tax offenses that ensures significantly higher penalty levels for offenses involving moderate and high tax loss in a similar manner and degree as the loss table for the consolidated guideline. The new table is designed to reflect more appropriately the seriousness of tax offenses and to maintain proportionality with the offenses sentenced under the consolidated guideline.</p>
<p>The tax loss table is similar to the loss table for the consolidated guideline, except it does not reduce generally any sentences for offenders involved with lower loss amounts. The tax table provides its first increment for loss at $2,000, rather than the $5,000 threshold under the consolidated guideline (and the $1,700 threshold under the tax loss table prior to this amendment). These differences are intended to avoid unintended decreases that would occur otherwise. The increases in the new tax loss table for offenders involved with lower loss amounts are intended to maintain the long-standing treatment of tax offenses relative to theft and fraud offenses.</p>
<p><em>Definition of Loss </em></p>
<p>This amendment provides a new definition of loss applicable to offenses previously sentenced under §§2B1.1, 2B1.3, and 2F1.1. The revised definition makes clarifying and substantive revisions to the definitions of loss previously in the commentary to §§2B1.1 and 2F1.1, resolves a number of circuit conflicts, addresses a variety of application issues, and promotes consistency in application.</p>
<p>Significantly, the new definition of loss retains the core rule that loss is the greater of actual and intended loss. The Commission concluded that, for cases in which intended loss is greater than actual loss, the intended loss is a more appropriate initial measure of the culpability of the offender. Conversely, in cases which the actual loss is greater, that amount is a more appropriate measure of the seriousness of the offense.</p>
<p>A definition is provided for intended loss that is consistent with the rule regarding the interaction of actual and intended loss.</p>
<p>The amendment includes a resolution of the circuit conflict relating to the meaning and application of intended loss.</p>
<p>The amendment resolves the conflict to provide that intended loss includes unlikely or impossible losses that are intended, because their inclusion better reflects the culpability of the offender. <em>Compare</em> <em>United States v. Geevers</em>, 226 F.3d 186 (3d Cir. 2000) (agreeing with the majority of circuits holding that impossibility is not in and of itself a limit on the intended loss for purposes of calculating sentences under the guidelines . . . impossibility does not require a sentencing court to lower its calculations of intended loss); and <em>United States v. Coffman</em>, 94 F.3d 330 (7th Cir. 1996) (rejecting the argument that a loss that cannot possibly occur cannot be intended); <em>United States v. Koenig</em>, 952 F.2d 267 (9th Cir. 1991) (holding that §2F1.1 only requires a calculation of intended loss and does not require a finding that the intentions were realistic); <em>United States v. Klisser</em>, 190 F. 3d 34, 36 (2d Cir. 1999) (same); <em>United States v. Blitz</em>, 151 F. 3d 1002, 1010 (9<sup>th</sup> Cir. 1998) (same); <em>United States v. Studevent</em>, 116 F. 3d 1559, 1563 (D.C. Cir. 1997) (same); <em>United States v. Wai-Keung</em>, 115 F. 3d 874, 877 (11<sup>th</sup> Cir. 1997) (same), <em>with</em> <em>United States v. Galbraith</em>, 20 F. 3d 1054, 1059 (10<sup>th</sup> Cir. 1993) (because intended loss only includes losses that are possible, in an undercover sting operation the intended loss is zero); and <em>United States v. Watkins</em>, 994 F.2d 1192, 1196 (6th Cir. 1993) (holding that a limitation on the broad reach of the intended loss rule is that the intended loss must have been possible to be considered relevant).</p>
<p>Accordingly, concepts such as &quot;economic reality&quot; or &quot;amounts put at risk&quot; will no longer be considerations in the determination of intended loss. <em>See</em> <em>United States v. Bonanno</em>, 146 F.3d 502 (7th Cir. 1998) (holding that the relevant inquiry is how much the scheme put at risk); and <em>United States v. Wells</em>, 127 F. 3d 739 (8th Cir. 1997) (citing <em>United States v. Morris</em>, 18 F.3d 562 (8th Cir. 1994)) (holding that intended loss properly was measured by the possible loss the defendant intended, and did not hinge on actual or net loss).</p>
<p>This amendment also resolves differing circuit interpretations of the standard of causation applicable for actual loss, an issue that was not addressed expressly in the prior definition of actual loss. Various circuits recognized three arguably inconsistent standards for loss causation. First, §1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct) provides that a defendant is responsible for all losses – foreseen or unforeseen – that result from the defendant’s actions or that result from the foreseeable actions of co-participants. <em>See</em> <em>United States v. Sarno</em>, 73 F.3d 1470 (9th Cir. 1995) (holding that &quot;[a] sentence calculated pursuant to the loss tables . . . is properly based on actual loss notwithstanding the fact that this loss may be greater than the intended, expected or foreseeable loss&quot;), <em>cert. denied</em>, 518 U.S. 1020 (1996); and <em>United States v. Lopreato</em>, 83 F.3d 571 (2d Cir. 1996) (holding that in a bribery case, the defendant is responsible for all losses, foreseeable or not). A second view is premised on the fact that prior to this amendment commentary in §2F1.1 limited the loss amount to the value of the money, property, or services unlawfully taken. <em>See</em> <em>United States v. Marlatt</em>, 24 F.3d 1005 (7th Cir. 1994) (refusing to count foreseeable losses in loss figure because they did not represent the actual thing taken). A third view is that the commentary’s explicit inclusion of consequential damages in the loss determination for contract procurement and product substitution cases implies that only non-consequential or direct damages are included in other cases. <em>See</em> <em>United States v. Thomas</em>, 62 F.3d 1332 (11th Cir. 1995), <em>cert. denied</em>, 516 U.S. 1166 (1996) (only non-consequential or direct damages are included in loss). <em>See</em> <em>also</em> <em>United States v. Daddona</em>, 34 F.3d 163 (3d Cir.), <em>cert. denied</em>, 513 U.S. 1002 (1994) (holding that merely incidental or consequential damages may not be counted in computing loss); and <em>United States v. Newman</em>, 6 F.3d 623 (9th Cir. 1993) (holding that loss caused by the defendant arsonist was only the value of the property destroyed by the fire, not costs of putting out the fire).</p>
<p>The amendment defines &quot;actual loss&quot; as the &quot;reasonably foreseeable pecuniary harm&quot; that resulted from the offense. The amendment incorporates this causation standard that, at a minimum, requires factual causation (often called &quot;but for&quot; causation) and provides a rule for legal causation (<em>i.e.</em>, guidance to courts regarding how to draw the line as to what losses should be included and excluded from the loss determination). Significantly, the application of this causation standard in the great variety of factual contexts in which it is expected to occur appropriately is entrusted to sentencing judges.</p>
<p>&quot;Pecuniary harm&quot; is defined in a manner that excludes emotional distress, harm to reputation, and other non-economic harm, in order to foreclose the laborious effort sometimes necessary to quantify non-economic harms (as in some tort proceedings, for example).</p>
<p>&quot;Reasonably foreseeable pecuniary harm&quot; is defined to include pecuniary harms that the defendant knew or, under the circumstances, reasonably should have known, was a potential result of the offense. The Commission determined that this standard better ensures the inclusion in loss of those harms that reflect the seriousness of the offense and the culpability of the offender.</p>
<p>The definition deletes the previous rule that, by negative implication, excludes consequential damages (except in specified cases), thus resolving a circuit conflict. <em>Compare</em> <em>United States v. Izydore</em>, 167 F.3d 213 (5th Cir. 1999) (the fact that the Commission prescribed consequential losses in only specific fraud cases, and not others, is strong evidence that consequential damages were omitted from the general loss definition by design rather than mistake), <em>with</em> <em>United States v. Gottfried</em>, 58 F.3d 648 (D.C. Cir. 1995) (holding that merely incidental or consequential damages may not be counted in computing loss). The Commission decided, however, not to use the term &quot;consequential damages,&quot; or any similar civil law distinction between direct and indirect harms. Rather, the Commission determined that the reasonable foreseeability standard provides sufficient guidance to courts as to what type of harms are included in loss.</p>
<p>In addition, this amendment preserves the special provisions addressing loss in protected computer offenses and the inclusion of consequential damages in product substitution and contract procurement offenses; however, these special cases are re-characterized as rules of construction to avoid any negative implications regarding other types of offenses.</p>
<p>The amendment reflects a decision by the Commission that interest and similar costs shall be excluded from loss. However, the amendment provides that a departure may be warranted in the rare case in which exclusion of interest will under-punish the offender. Thus, the rule resolves the circuit split regarding whether &quot;bargained for&quot; interest may be included in loss. <em>Compare</em> <em>United States v. Henderson</em>, 19 F.3d 917 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied</em>, 513 U.S. 877 (1994) (holding that interest should be included if the victim had a reasonable expectation of receiving interest from the transaction); <em>United States v. Gilberg</em>, 75 F.3d 15 (1st Cir. 1996) (including in loss interest on fraudulently procured mortgage loan); and <em>United States v. Sharma</em>, 190 F.3d 220 (3d Cir. 1999) (holding that Application Note 8 of §2F1.1 requires the exclusion of &quot;opportunity cost&quot; interest, but did not intend to exclude bargained-for interest), <em>with</em> <em>United States v. Hoyle</em>, 33 F.3d 415 (4th Cir. 1994), <em>cert.</em> <em>denied</em>, 513 U.S. 1133 (1995) (excluding interest from the determination of loss for sentencing purposes); and <em>United States v. Guthrie</em>, 144 F.3d 1006 (6th Cir. 1998) (holding that when the defendant concealed assets in a bankruptcy proceeding, the lower court’s determination that loss to creditors included interest was erroneous). This rule is consistent with the general purpose of the loss determination to serve as a rough measurement of the seriousness of the offense and culpability of the offender and avoids unnecessary litigation regarding the amount of interest to be included.</p>
<p>The loss definition also excludes from loss certain costs incurred by the government and victims in connection with criminal investigation and prosecution of the offense. Such losses are likely to occur in a broad range of cases, would present a fact-finding burden in those cases, and would not contribute to the ability of loss to perform its essential function.</p>
<p>The loss definition also provides for the exclusion from loss of certain economic benefits transferred to victims, to be measured at the time of detection. This provision codifies the &quot;net loss&quot; approach that has developed in the case law, with some modifications made for policy reasons. This crediting approach is adopted because the seriousness of the offense and the culpability of a defendant is better determined by using a net approach. This approach recognizes that the offender who transfers something of value to the victim(s) generally is committing a less serious offense than an offender who does not.</p>
<p>The amendment adopts &quot;time of detection&quot; as the most appropriate and least burdensome time for measuring the value of the transferred benefits. The Commission determined that valuing such benefits at the time of transfer would be especially problematic in cases in which the offender misrepresented the value of an item that is difficult to value. Although the time of detection standard will allow some fluctuation in value which may inure to the defendant’s benefit or detriment, the Commission determined that, because the time of detection is closer in time to the sentencing and occurs at a point when the authorities are aware of the criminality, its use generally would make it easier to determine a more accurate value of the benefit.</p>
<p>The definition of &quot;time of detection&quot; was adopted because there may be situations in which it is difficult to prove that the defendant knew the offense was detected even if it was already discovered. In addition, the words &quot;about to be detected&quot; are included to cover those situations in which the offense is not yet detected, but the defendant knows it is about to be detected. In such a case, it would be inappropriate to credit the defendant with benefits transferred to the victim after that defendant’s awareness.</p>
<p>The definition of &quot;loss&quot; also provides special rules for certain schemes. One rule includes in loss (and excludes from crediting) the benefits received by victims of persons fraudulently providing professional services. This rule reverses case law that has allowed crediting (or exclusion from loss) in cases in which services were provided by persons posing as attorneys and medical personnel. <em>See</em> <em>United States v. Maurello</em>, 76 F.3d 1304 (3d Cir. 1996) (calculating loss by subtracting the value of satisfactory legal services from amount of fees paid to a person posing as a lawyer); and <em>United States v. Reddeck</em>, 22 F.3d 1504 (10th Cir. 1994) (reducing loss by the value of education received from a sham university). The Commission determined that the seriousness of these offenses and the culpability of these offenders is best reflected by a loss determination that does not credit the value of the unlicensed benefits provided. In addition, this provision eliminates the additional burden that would be imposed on courts if required to determine the value of these benefits.</p>
<p>Similarly, the definition of loss provides a special rule that includes in loss (and excludes from crediting) the value of items that were falsely represented as approved by a regulatory agency, for which regulatory approval was obtained by fraud, or for which regulatory approval was required but not obtained. The Commission determined that the seriousness of these offenses and the culpability of these offenders is best reflected by a loss determination that does not credit the value of these items. This decision reflects the importance of the regulatory approval process to public health, safety, and confidence.</p>
<p>Regarding investment schemes, the amendment resolves a circuit conflict regarding whether and how to credit payments made to victims. <em>Compare</em> <em>United States v. Mucciante</em>, 21 F.3d 1228 (2nd Cir. 1994) (under the Guidelines, loss includes the value of all property taken, even though all or part of it was returned.); <em>United States v. Deavours</em>, 219 F.3d 400 (5th Cir. 2000) (intended loss is not reduced by any sums returned to investors); and <em>United States v. Loayza</em>, 107 F.3d 257 (4th Cir.1997) (declining to follow the approach of net loss and holding defendants responsible for the value of all property taken, even though all or a part is returned), <em>with</em> <em>United States v. Holiusa</em>, 13 F.3d 1043 (7th Cir.1994) (holding that only the net loss should be included in loss, thus allowing a credit for returned interest), and <em>United States v. Orton</em>, 73 F.3d 331 (11th Cir. 1996) (only payments made to losing investors should be credited, not payments to investors who made a profit).</p>
<p>This amendment adopts the approach of the Eleventh Circuit that excludes the gain to any individual investor in the scheme from being used to offset the loss to other individual investors because any gain realized by an individual investor is designed to lure others into the fraudulent scheme. <em>See</em> <em>United States v. Orton</em>, <em>supra</em>.</p>
<p>The definition retains the rule providing for the use of gain when loss cannot reasonably be determined. It clarifies that there must be a loss for gain to be considered. In doing so, the Commission resolved another circuit conflict. <em>Compare</em> <em>United States v. Robie</em>, 166 F.3d 444 (2d Cir. 1999) (holding that use of defendant’s gain for purposes of subsection (b)(1) is improper if there is no economic loss to the victim), <em>with</em> <em>United States v. Haas,</em> 171 F.3d 259 (5th Cir. 1999) (stating that &quot;if the <span id="SearchTerm" class="anchor"></span>loss is either incalculable or zero, the district court must determine the §2F1.1 sentence enhancement by estimating the gain to the defendant as a result of his fraud&quot;). The Commission decided not to expand the use of gain to situations in which loss can be determined but the gain is greater than the loss because such instances should occur infrequently, the efficiency of the criminal operation as reflected in the amount of gain ordinarily should not determine the penalty level, and the traditional use of loss is generally adequate.</p>
<p>The amendment revises the special rule on determining loss in cases involving diversion of government program benefits to resolve another circuit conflict. The revision is intended to clarify that loss in such cases only includes amounts that were diverted from intended recipients or uses, not benefits received or used by authorized persons. In other words, even if such benefits flowed through an unauthorized intermediary, as long as they went to intended recipients for intended uses, the amount of those benefits should not be included in loss. <em>Compare</em> <em>United States v. Henry</em>, 164 F.3d 1304 (10th Cir. 1999) (holding that loss includes the value of gross benefits paid, rather than the value of benefits improperly received or diverted in determining the loss), <em>with</em> <em>United States v. Peters</em>, 59 F.3d 732 (8th Cir. 1995) (determining that loss is the value of benefits diverted from intended recipients); and <em>United States v. Barnes</em>, 117 F.3d 328 (7th Cir. 1997) (holding that the sentence is calculated only on the value of the government benefits diverted from intended recipients or users). This net loss approach is more consistent with general rules for determining loss.</p>
<p><em>Referring Guidelines for Theft and Fraud</em></p>
<p>The amendment includes revisions to the guidelines that, prior to this amendment, referred to the loss tables in §2B1.1 or §2F1.1. Pursuant to this amendment, these guidelines will refer to the loss tables in the consolidated guideline. Prior to this amendment, the referring guidelines used the tables in §§2B1.1 and 2F1.1, which provided the first loss increment for losses in excess of $2,000. Because the consolidated loss table provides the first loss increment for losses in excess of $5,000, the referring guidelines are amended to provide a one-level increase in a case in which the loss is more than $2,000, but did not exceed $5,000. This increase is provided to avoid a one-level decrease that would otherwise occur for an offense involving losses of more than $2,000 but not more than $5,000.</p>
<p>Two referring guidelines (§§2B2.1 (Burglary of a Residence or a Structure Other than a Residence) and 2B3.1 (Robbery)) that use the definition of loss previously in §2B1.1 will retain that definition of loss rather than the new loss definition in the consolidated guideline. The existing definition has not proven problematic for cases sentenced under these guidelines.</p>
<p><em>Technical and Conforming Amendments</em></p>
<p>The amendment includes a number of technical and conforming amendments, most of which are necessitated by the consolidation and the deletion of the more than minimal planning enhancement.</p>
<p><em>Computing Tax Loss</em></p>
<p>This amendment addresses several issues related to tax loss. It addresses a circuit conflict regarding how tax loss under §2T1.1 (Tax Evasion) is computed for cases that involve a defendant’s under-reporting of income on both individual and corporate tax returns. Such a case often arises when (1) the defendant fails to report, and pay corporate income taxes on, income earned by the corporation; (2) the defendant diverts that unreported corporate income for the defendant’s personal use; and (3) the defendant fails to report, and to pay personal income taxes on, that diverted income. The amendment provides that the amount of the federal tax loss is the sum of the federal income tax due from the corporation and the amount of federal income tax due from the individual.</p>
<p>The amendment thereby resolves a circuit conflict as to the methodology used to calculate tax loss in cases involving a corporate diversion. Two circuits use a sequential method to aggregate the tax loss. Under this method, the court determines the corporate federal income tax that would have been due, subtracts that amount from the amount diverted to the defendant personally, then determines the personal federal income tax that would have been due on the reduced diverted amount. <em>See</em> <em>United States v. Harvey</em>, 996 F.2d 919 (7th Cir. 1993); and <em>United States v. Martinez-Rios</em>, 143 F.3d 662 (2d Cir. 1998). The Commission adopted the alternative method used in <em>United States v. Cseplo</em>, 42 F.3d 360 (6th Cir. 1994), in which the court determines the corporate federal income tax due on the diverted amount, and adds that amount to the personal federal income tax due on the total amount diverted. This clarifies the prior rule in Application Note 7 of §2T1.1 that &quot;if the offense involves both individual and corporate tax returns, the tax loss is the aggregate tax loss from the offenses taken together&quot; and reflects the Commission’s conclusion that, in cases of corporate diversions, the method for computing total tax loss adopted by the Sixth Circuit in <em>Cseplo</em> more accurately reflects the seriousness of the total harm caused by these offenses than would be reflected by the alternative method.</p>
<p>In evasion-of-payment tax cases, the Commission amended the definition of &quot;tax loss&quot; to include interest and penalties because, in contrast to evasion-of-assessment tax cases, such amounts appropriately are included in tax loss for such cases. This amendment limits the inclusion of interest or penalties to willful evasion of payment cases under 26 U.S.C. § 7201 and willful failure to pay cases under 26 U.S.C. § 7203. The nature of these cases is such that the interest and penalties often greatly exceed the assessed tax amount constituting the bulk of the harm associated with these offenses.</p>
<p>This amendment also revises the sophisticated concealment enhancement in subsection (b)(2) of §§2T1.1 (Tax Evasion) and 2T1.4 (Aiding, Assisting, Procuring, Counseling, or Advising Tax Fraud) to conform to the sophisticated means enhancement in the consolidated guideline, including imposition of a minimum offense level of level 12. This revision is appropriate inasmuch as certain tax offenses can be committed using sophisticated means in addition to being concealed in a sophisticated manner. Indeed, tax offenses committed in a sophisticated manner are more serious offenses, and reflect a greater culpability on the part of the offender (just as a tax offense concealed in a sophisticated manner reflects greater culpability). Consequently, this revision will allow the enhancement to apply to a somewhat greater range of tax offenses than the previously existing sophisticated concealment enhancement.</p>
<p>In addition, the amendment revises &quot;offshore bank accounts&quot; by substituting &quot;financial&quot; for &quot;bank&quot;, to ensure that the enhancement applies to conduct involving similar kinds of accounts, consistent with language in §2S1.1 (Laundering of Monetary Instruments; Engaging in Monetary Transactions in Property Derived from Unlawful Activity). A similar revision is made in §2B1.1.</p>

<p>The Commentary to §2B5.1 captioned &quot;Background&quot; is amended by striking &quot;(b)(3)&quot; and inserting &quot;(b)(4)&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> The frequency of counterfeiting offenses has increased significantly since 1995 due to the increasing affordability and availability of personal computers and digital printers. This amendment addresses concerns raised by the Department of the Treasury and the United States Secret Service regarding both the operation of, and the penalties provided by, §2B5.1 (Offenses Involving Counterfeit Bearer Obligations of the United States). The amendment increases penalties for counterfeiting activity in two ways.</p>
<p>First, the amendment adds a two-level enhancement for manufacturing, in addition to the minimum offense level of level 15 for manufacturing. This change will ensure some degree of additional punishment for all offenders who engage in manufacturing activity.</p>
<p>Second, the amendment adds a two-level enhancement (which would apply alternatively to the manufacturing enhancement) if the offense involved possessing or controlling (1) paper that is similar to a distinctive paper used by the United States for its currency, obligations, or securities; or (2) a feature or device that is essentially identical to a distinctive counterfeit deterrent used by the United States for its currency, obligations, or securities. This enhancement is justified because of the higher statutory maximum penalties under 18 U.S.C. § 474A (<em>i.e.</em>, a term of imprisonment of up to 25 years compared to 10, 15, and 20 years for other counterfeiting offenses). In addition, use of paper similar to &quot;distinctive paper&quot; and use of features and devices essentially identical to &quot;distinctive counterfeit deterrents&quot; (both of which are defined in §2B5.1 consistently with the statute) make the counterfeit item more passable and the offense more sophisticated.</p>
<p>In addition, the amendment deletes the language in the commentary of §2B5.1 that suggests that the manufacturing adjustment does not apply if the defendant &quot;merely photocopies&quot;. That commentary was intended to make the manufacturing minimum offense level of level 15 inapplicable to notes that are so obviously counterfeit that they are unlikely to be accepted. Particularly with the advent of digital technology, it cannot be said that photocopying necessarily produces a note so obviously counterfeit as to be impassible.</p>

<p>1. Do not apply the adjustment in §3B1.3 (Abuse of Position of Trust or Use of Special Skill).</p>
<p><em>Background</em>: Violations of 18 U.S.C. § 209 involve the unlawful supplementation of salary of various federal employees. 18 U.S.C. § 1909 prohibits bank examiners from performing any service for compensation for banks or bank officials.&quot;.</p>
<p>Section 8C2.1(a) is amended by striking &quot;2C1.4,&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> The amendment (1) consolidates §§2C1.3 (Conflict of Interest) and 2C1.4 (Payment or Receipt of Unauthorized Compensation) covering payments to obtain public office, to promote ease of application; and (2) adds a cross reference in §2C1.3 (Conflict of Interest; Payment or Receipt of Unauthorized Compensation) to §2C1.1 (Offering, Giving, Soliciting, or Receiving a Bribe; Extortion Under Color of Official Right) and §2C1.2 (Offering, Giving, Soliciting, or Receiving a Gratuity) to account for aggravating conduct often occurring in offenses involving the unlawful supplementation of the salary of various federal officials and employees committed in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 209.</p>
<p>The amendment simplifies guideline operation by consolidating §§2C1.3 and 2C1.4. Consolidation is appropriate because the gravamen of the offenses covered by §§2C1.3 and 2C1.4 is similar: unauthorized receipt of a payment in respect to an official act. The cross reference to §2C1.1 or §2C1.2 was added by this amendment because the cases to which these guidelines apply usually involve a conflict of interest offense that is associated with a bribe or gratuity.</p>

<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> The Commission promulgated an emergency amendment addressing the directive in section 102 (the &quot;substantial risk directive&quot;) of the Methamphetamine Anti-Proliferation Act of 2000, Pub. L. 106–310 (the &quot;Act&quot;), with an effective date of December 16, 2000. (<em>See</em> Amendment 608.) This amendment repromulgates the emergency amendment, with modifications, as a permanent amendment.</p>
<p>The substantial risk directive instructs the Commission to amend the federal sentencing guidelines with respect to any offense relating to the manufacture, attempt to manufacture, or conspiracy to manufacture amphetamine or methamphetamine in (1) the Controlled Substances Act, 21 U.S.C. §§ 801-90; (2) the Controlled Substances Import and Export Act, 21 U.S.C. §§ 951-71; or (3) the Maritime Drug Law Enforcement Act, 46 U.S.C. App. §§ 1901-04.</p>
<p>The Act requires the Commission, in carrying out the substantial risk directive, to provide the following enhancements—</p>
<p>(A) if the offense created a substantial risk of harm to human life (other than a life described in subparagraph (B)) or the environment, increase the base offense level for the offense—</p>
<p>(i) by not less than 3 offense levels above the applicable level in effect on the date of the enactment of this Act; or</p>
<p>(ii) if the resulting base offense level after an increase under clause (i) would be less than level 27, to not less than level 27; or</p>
<p>(B) if the offense created a substantial risk of harm to the life of a minor or incompetent, increase the base offense level for the offense—</p>
<p>(i) by not less than 6 offense levels above the applicable level in effect on the date of the enactment of this Act; or</p>
<p>(ii) if the resulting base offense level after an increase under clause (i) would be less than level 30, to not less than level 30.</p>
<p>The emergency amendment provided enhancements in §§2D1.1 (Unlawful Manufacturing, Importing, Exporting, or Trafficking (Including Possession with Intent to Commit These Offenses); Attempt or Conspiracy) and 2D1.10 (Endangering Human Life While Illegally Manufacturing a Controlled Substance) that also apply in the case of an attempt or a conspiracy to manufacture amphetamine or methamphetamine. The amendment did not amend §2D1.11 (Unlawfully Distributing, Importing, Exporting or Possessing a Listed Chemical; Attempt or Conspiracy) or §2D1.12 (Unlawful Possession, Manufacture, Distribution, or Importation of Prohibited Flask or Equipment). Although offenses that involve the manufacture of amphetamine or methamphetamine also are referenced in Appendix A (Statutory Index) to §§2D1.11 and 2D1.12, the cross references in these guidelines, which apply if the offense involved the manufacture of a controlled substance, will result in application of §2D1.1 and accordingly, the enhancements.</p>
<p>The basic structure of the emergency amendment to §§2D1.1 and 2D1.10 tracked the structure of the substantial risk directive. Accordingly, in §2D1.1, the amendment provided a three-level increase and a minimum offense level of level 27 if the offense (1) involved the manufacture of amphetamine or methamphetamine; and (2) created a substantial risk of harm either to human life or the environment. For offenses that created a substantial risk of harm to the life of a minor or an incompetent, the amendment provided a six-level increase and a minimum offense level of level 30.</p>
<p>However, the structure of the emergency amendment to §2D1.10 differed from the structure of the emergency amendment to §2D1.1 with respect to the first prong of the enhancement (regarding substantial risk of harm to human life or to the environment). Specifically, the emergency amendment provided a three-level increase and a minimum offense level of level 27 if the offense involved the manufacture of amphetamine or methamphetamine without making application of the enhancement dependent upon whether the offense also involved a substantial risk of either harm to human life or the environment. Consideration of whether the offense involves a substantial risk of harm to human life also is unnecessary because §2D1.10 applies only to convictions under 21 U.S.C. § 858, and the creation of a substantial risk of harm to human life is an element of an offense under 21 U.S.C. § 858. Therefore, the base offense level already takes into account the substantial risk of harm to human life. Consideration of whether the offense involved a substantial risk of harm to the environment was unnecessary because the directive predicated application of the enhancement on substantial risk of harm either to human life or to the environment, and the creation of a substantial risk of harm to human life necessarily is taken into account as an element of the offense.</p>
<p>Neither the substantial risk directive nor any statutory provision defines &quot;substantial risk of harm.&quot; Based on an analysis of relevant case law that interpreted &quot;substantial risk of harm,&quot; the emergency amendment provided commentary setting forth factors that may be relevant in determining whether a particular offense created a substantial risk of harm. The definition of &quot;incompetent&quot; was modeled after several state statutes.</p>
<p>This permanent amendment re-promulgates, with modifications, the emergency amendment regarding the substantial risk directive. This amendment differs from the emergency amendment in several respects:</p>
<p>First, in §2D1.1, this amendment treats the existing specific offense characteristic in §2D1.1(b)(5), relating to a two-level enhancement for environmental violations occurring in the course of a drug trafficking offense, as an alternative to the three-level enhancement for substantial risk of harm to human life or the environment. This portion of the amendment is in response to an issue related to the substantial risk directive regarding how to implement it in a manner consistent with the earlier environmental hazard directive in section 303 of the Comprehensive Methamphetamine Control Act, Pub. L. 104–237. The emergency amendment made the enhancements cumulative. However, this permanent amendment makes the new guideline provision alternative with the pre-existing enhancement for environmental hazards in §2D1.1.</p>
<p>Second, in §2D1.1, this amendment lists four factors that the court &quot;shall&quot;, as opposed to &quot;may&quot;, consider to determine whether subsection (b)(6)(A) or (B) applies. Similarly, in §2D1.10, this amendment lists four factors the court &quot;shall&quot; consider to determine whether subsection (b)(1)(B) applies. The list of four factors was identified by the Commission to assist the courts in defining the meaning of &quot;substantial risk of harm&quot; for offenses related to the production and trafficking of precursor chemicals and the manufacture of amphetamine and methamphetamine.</p>
<p>Third, in §2D1.1, this amendment provides that the court (1) shall consider any costs of environmental cleanup and harm to individuals and property in cases involving the manufacture of amphetamine or methamphetamine in determining the amount of restitution under §5E1.1 (Restitution) and in fashioning appropriate conditions of probation and supervision under §§5B1.3 (Conditions of Probation) and 5D1.3 (Conditions of Supervised Release), and (2) should consider such costs and harms in cases involving the manufacture of a controlled substance other than amphetamine or methamphetamine.</p>
<p>The amendment also makes a minor technical change in the background commentary.</p>

{id: 621, content:"<p><strong>621.</strong> <strong>Amendment:</strong> The subdivision captioned &quot;LSD, PCP, and Other Schedule I and II Hallucinogens (and their immediate precursors)*&quot; of the Drug Equivalency Tables of Note 10 of the Commentary to §2D1.1 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot;, effective May 1, 2001 (<em>see</em> Amendment 609), is repromulgated without change.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This amendment repromulgates (as a permanent amendment) without change the emergency amendment previously promulgated that addressed the directive in section 3664 of the Ecstasy Anti-Proliferation Act of 2000, Pub. L. 106–310 (the &quot;Act&quot;). (<em>See</em> Amendment 609). That directive instructs the Commission to provide increased penalties for the manufacture, importation, exportation, or trafficking of &quot;Ecstasy&quot;. The directive specifically requires the Commission to increase the base offense level for 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), 3,4-Methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA), 3,4-Methylenedioxy-N-ethylamphetamine (MDEA), Paramethoxymethamphetamine (PMA), and any other controlled substance that is marketed as &quot;Ecstasy&quot; and that has either a chemical structure similar to MDMA or an effect on the central nervous system substantially similar to or greater than MDMA.</p>
<p>The amendment addresses the directive by amending the Drug Equivalency Tables in §2D1.1, Application Note 10, to increase substantially the marihuana equivalencies for the specified controlled substances, which has the effect of substantially increasing the penalties for offenses involving &quot;Ecstasy&quot;. The new penalties for &quot;Ecstasy&quot; trafficking provide penalties which, gram for gram, are more severe than those for powder cocaine. Under the Drug Equivalency Tables, one gram of powder cocaine has a marihuana equivalency of 200 grams. This amendment sets the marihuana equivalency for one gram of &quot;Ecstasy&quot; at 500 grams.</p>
<p>There is a combination of reasons why the Commission has substantially increased the penalties in response to the congressional directive. Much evidence received by the Commission indicated that &quot;Ecstasy&quot; (1) has powerful pharmacological effects; (2) has the capacity to cause lasting physical harms, including brain damage; and (3) is being abused by rapidly increasing numbers of teenagers and young adults. Indeed, the market for &quot;Ecstasy&quot; is overwhelmingly comprised of persons under the age of 25 years.</p>
<p>The Commission considered whether the penalty levels for &quot;Ecstasy&quot; should be set at the same levels as for heroin (one gram of heroin has a marihuana equivalency of 1000 grams) and decided that somewhat lesser penalties were appropriate for &quot;Ecstasy&quot; for a number of reasons: (1) the potential for addiction is greater with heroin; (2) heroin distribution often involves violence while, at this time, violence is not reported in &quot;Ecstasy&quot; markets; (3) because heroin it is a narcotic and is often injected, the risk of death from overdose is much greater than for &quot;Ecstasy&quot;; and (4) because heroin is often injected, there are more secondary health consequences, such as infections and the transmission of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis than for &quot;Ecstasy&quot;.</p>
<p>Finally, based on information regarding &quot;Ecstasy&quot; trafficking patterns, the penalty levels chosen are appropriate and sufficient to target serious and high-level traffickers and to provide appropriate punishment, deterrence, and incentives for cooperation. The penalty levels chosen for &quot;Ecstasy&quot; offenses provide five year sentences for serious traffickers (those whose relevant conduct involved approximately 800 pills) and ten year sentences for high-level traffickers (those whose relevant conduct involved approximately 8,000 pills).</p>

<p>The Commentary to §2D1.1 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended in Note 10 in the Drug Equivalency Tables in the subdivision captioned &quot;Cocaine and Other Schedule I and II Stimulants (and their immediate precursors)*&quot; by striking &quot;1 gm of Dextroamphetamine = 200 gm of marihuana&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This amendment repromulgates as a permanent amendment the emergency amendment previously promulgated to implement the directive in section 3611 of the Methamphetamine Anti-Proliferation Act of 2000, Pub. L. 106–310 (the &quot;Act&quot;), which directs the Commission to provide increased guideline penalties for amphetamine offenses such that those penalties are comparable to the base offense level for methamphetamine offenses. The directive provided the Commission emergency amendment authority. (<em>See</em> Amendment 610.)</p>
<p>This amendment revises §2D1.1 to include amphetamine in the Drug Quantity Table in §2D1.1 (Unlawful Manufacturing, Importing, Exporting, or Trafficking (Including Possession with Intent to Commit These Offenses); Attempt or Conspiracy). This amendment also treats amphetamine and methamphetamine identically, at a 1:1 ratio (<em>i.e.</em>, the same quantities of amphetamine and methamphetamine will result in the same base offense level) because of the similarities of the two substances. Specifically, amphetamine and methamphetamine (1) are chemically similar; (2) are produced by a similar method and are trafficked in a similar manner; (3) share similar methods of use; (4) affect the same parts of the brain; and (5) have similar intoxicating effects. The amendment also distinguishes between pure amphetamine (<em>i.e.</em>, amphetamine (actual)) and amphetamine mixture in the same manner, and at the same quantities, as pure methamphetamine (<em>i.e.</em>, methamphetamine (actual)) and methamphetamine mixture, respectively. The Commission determined that the 1:1 ratio is appropriate given the similarity of these two controlled substances.</p>
<p>This amendment differs from the emergency amendment in that it also (1) amends §2D1.1(b)(4) to make the enhancement for the importation of methamphetamine applicable to amphetamine offenses as well, and makes a conforming change in the commentary to §2D1.1 in Application Note 19; (2) deletes as unnecessary the marihuana equivalency for dextroamphetamine in the Drug Equivalency Tables in §2D1.1; and (3) amends Appendix A (Statutory Index) to refer a new offense at 49 U.S.C. § 46317(b), (prohibiting transportation of controlled substances by aircraft) to §2D1.1.</p>

<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This amendment implements the Hillory J. Farias and Samantha Reid Date-Rape Drug Prohibition Act of 2000, Pub. L. 106–172 (the &quot;Act&quot;), which provides the emergency scheduling of gamma hydroxybutyric acid (&quot;GHB&quot;) as a Schedule I controlled substance under the Controlled Substances Act when the drug is used illicitly. The Act also amended section 401(b)(1)(C) of the Controlled Substances Act, 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(C), and section 1010(b)(3) of the Controlled Substances Import and Export Act, 21 U.S.C. § 960(b)(3), to provide penalties of not more than 20 years’ imprisonment for an offense that involves GHB.</p>
<p>This amendment eliminates the maximum base offense level of level 20 in the Drug Quantity Table of §2D1.1 (Unlawful Manufacturing, Importing, Exporting, or Trafficking (Including Possession with Intent to Commit These Offenses); Attempt or Conspiracy) for Schedule I and II depressants (including GHB). The same change is made with respect to flunitrazepam, which, for sentencing purposes, is tied to Schedule I and II depressants. The Commission determined that increased penalties for the more serious offenses involving Schedule I and II depressants are appropriate.</p>
<p>Corresponding changes to the Drug Equivalency Tables in §2D1.1 were made for both Flunitrazepam and Schedule I or II depressants by eliminating the maximum marihuana equivalency when offenses involving these controlled substances also involve offenses for controlled substances in Schedules III, IV, or V.</p>

<p>&quot;14. Where (A) the amount of the controlled substance for which the defendant is accountable under §1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct) results in a base offense level greater than 36, (B) the court finds that this offense level overrepresents the defendant’s culpability in the criminal activity, and (C) the defendant qualifies for a mitigating role adjustment under §3B1.2 (Mitigating Role), a downward departure may be warranted. The court may depart to a sentence no lower than the guideline range that would have resulted if the defendant’s Chapter Two offense level had been offense level 36. <em>Provided</em>, that a defendant is not eligible for a downward departure under this provision if the defendant:</p>
<p>(a) has one or more prior felony convictions for a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense as defined in §4B1.2 (Definitions of Terms Used in Section 4B1.1);</p>
<p>(b) qualifies for an adjustment under §3B1.3 (Abuse of Position of Trust or Use of Special Skill);</p>

<p>(d) had decision-making authority;</p>
<p>(e) owned the controlled substance or financed any part of the offense; or</p>
<p>(f) sold the controlled substance or played a substantial part in negotiating the terms of the sale.</p>
<p><em>Example</em>: A defendant, who the court finds meets the criteria for a downward departure under this provision, has a Chapter Two offense level of 38, a 2-level reduction for a minor role from §3B1.2, and a 3-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility from §3E1.1. His final offense level is 33. If the defendant’s Chapter Two offense level had been 36, the 2-level reduction for a minor role and 3-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility would have resulted in a final offense level of 31. Therefore, under this provision, a downward departure not to exceed 2 levels (from level 33 to level 31) would be authorized.&quot;;</p>

<p>&quot;(b) In the case of a defendant (1) who meets the criteria set forth in subsection (a); and (2) for whom the statutorily required minimum sentence is at least five years, the offense level applicable from Chapters Two (Offense Conduct) and Three (Adjustments) shall be not less than level 17.&quot;.</p>

<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This amendment expands the eligibility for the two-level reduction in subsection (b)(6) of §2D1.1 (Unlawful Manufacturing, Importing, Exporting, or Trafficking (Including Possession with Intent to Commit These Offenses); Attempt or Conspiracy) for persons who meet the criteria set forth in §5C1.2 (Limitation on Applicability of Statutory Minimum Sentences in Certain Cases) to include defendants with an offense level less than level 26. The Commission determined that limiting the applicability of this reduction to defendants with an offense level of level 26 or greater is inconsistent with the general principles underlying this two-level reduction (and the related safety valve provision, <em>see</em> 18 U.S.C. § 3553(f)) to provide lesser punishment for first time, nonviolent offenders.</p>
<p>This amendment also establishes in §5C1.2 a minimum offense level of level 17 for a defendant who meets the requirements set forth in §5C1.2, and for whom the statutorily required minimum sentence is at least five years, in order to comply more strictly with the directive to the Commission at section 80001(b) of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, Pub.

<p>The Commentary to §2D1.11 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended in the first paragraph of Note 4(A) by striking &quot;subsection (d) of&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §2D1.1 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended in Note 10 in the Drug Equivalency Tables in the subdivision captioned &quot;List I Chemicals (relating to the manufacture of amphetamine or methamphetamine)*******&quot; in the heading by striking &quot;*******&quot; and inserting &quot;******&quot;; and by striking &quot;*******Provided,&quot; and inserting &quot;******Provided,&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This amendment repromulgates, with additional changes, the emergency amendment previously promulgated in response to the three-part directive in section 3651 of the Methamphetamine Anti-Proliferation Act of 2000, Pub. L. 106–310 (the &quot;Act&quot;), regarding enhanced punishment for trafficking in List I chemicals. (<em>See</em> Amendment 611). That section provided the Commission emergency amendment authority to implement the directive.</p>
<p>This amendment provides a new chemical quantity table in §2D1.11 (Unlawfully Distributing, Importing, Exporting or Possessing a Listed Chemical; Attempt or Conspiracy) specifically for ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, and phenylpropanolamine (PPA). The table ties the base offense levels for these chemicals to the base offense levels for methamphetamine (actual) set forth in §2D1.1 (Unlawful Manufacturing, Importing, Exporting, or Trafficking (Including Possession with Intent to Commit These Offenses); Attempt or Conspiracy), assuming a 50 percent actual yield of the controlled substance from the chemicals. (Methamphetamine (actual) is used rather than methamphetamine mixture because ephedrine and pseudoephedrine produce methamphetamine (actual), and PPA produces amphetamine (actual)). This yield is based on information provided by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) that the typical yield of these substances for clandestine laboratories is 50 to 75 percent.</p>
<p>This new chemical quantity table has a maximum base offense level of level 38 (as opposed to a maximum base offense level of level 30 for all other precursor chemicals). Providing a maximum base offense level of level 38 complies with the directive to establish penalties for these precursors that &quot;correspond to the quantity of controlled substance that reasonably could have been manufactured using the quantity of ephedrine, phenylpropanolamine, or pseudoephedrine possessed or distributed.&quot; Additionally, this eliminates the six-level distinction that currently exists between precursor chemical offenses that involve intent to manufacture amphetamine or methamphetamine and such offenses that also involve an actual attempt to manufacture amphetamine or methamphetamine.</p>
<p>This amendment eliminates the Ephedrine Equivalency Table in §2D1.11 and, in its place, provides a general rule for the court to determine the base offense level in cases involving multiple precursors (other than ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, or PPA) by using the quantity of the single chemical resulting in the greatest offense level. An upward departure is provided for cases in which the offense level does not adequately address the seriousness of the offense.</p>
<p>However, this amendment provides an exception to that general rule for offenses that involve a combination of ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, or PPA because these chemicals often are used in the same manufacturing process. In a case that involves two or more of these chemicals, the base offense level will be determined using the total quantity of these chemicals involved. The purpose of this exception is twofold: (1) any of the three primary precursors in the same table can be combined without difficulty; and (2) studies conducted by the DEA indicate that because the manufacturing process for amphetamine is essentially identical to the manufacturing process for methamphetamine, there are cases in which the different precursors are included in the same batch of drugs. If the chemical is PPA, amphetamine results; if the chemical is ephedrine or pseudoephedrine, methamphetamine results.</p>
<p>The amendment also adds to the Drug Equivalency Tables in §2D1.1 a conversion table for these precursor chemicals, providing for a 50 percent conversion ratio. This is based on data from the DEA that the actual yield from ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, or PPA typically is in the range of 50 to 75 percent. The purpose of this part of the amendment is to achieve the same punishment level (as is achieved by the first part of this amendment) for an offense involving any of these precursor chemicals when such offense involved the manufacture of amphetamine or methamphetamine and, as a result, is sentenced under §2D1.1 pursuant to the cross reference in §2D1.11.</p>
<p>This amendment also increases the base offense level for Benzaldehyde, Hydriodic Acid, Methylamine, Nitroethane, and Norpseudoephedrine by re-calibrating these levels to the appropriate quantity of methamphetamine (actual) that could be produced assuming a 50 percent yield of chemical to drug and retaining a cap at level 30. Previously, these chemicals had been linked to methamphetamine (mixture) penalty levels. Based on a study conducted by the DEA, ephedrine and pseudoepehdrine are the primary precursors used to make methamphetamine in the United States. Phenylproponolamine is the primary precursor used to make amphetamine. Unlike the five additional List I chemicals, the chemical structures of ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, and PPA are so similar to the resulting drug (<em>i.e.</em>, methamphetamine or amphetamine) that the manufacture of methamphetamine or amphetamine from ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, or PPA is a very simple one-step synthesis which anyone can perform using a variety of chemical reagents. The manufacture of methamphetamine or amphetamine from the five additional List I chemicals is a more complex process which requires a heightened level of expertise.</p>
<p>This amendment adds to the emergency amendment in two ways. First, it amends the Chemical Quantity Table in §2D1.11 to include gamma-butyrolactone (GBL), a precursor for gamma hydroxybutyric acid (GHB), as a List I chemical. This change is in response to the Hillory J. Farias and Samantha Reid Date Rape Prohibition Act of 2000, Pub. L. 106–172, which added GBL to the list of List 1 chemicals in section 401 (b)(1)(C) of the Controlled Substances Act, 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(C). Offense levels for GBL were established in the same manner as other List I chemicals. The offense level for a specific quantity of GHB that can be produced from a given quantity of GBL, assuming a 50 percent yield, was determined using the Drug Quantity Table in §2D1.1. From this offense level, six levels were subtracted to reflect the fact that an attempt to manufacture is not a required element of these offenses and, therefore, they are less serious offenses than offenses covered by §2D1.1.</p>
<p>Second, the amendment adds iodine to the Chemical Quantity Table in §2D1.11(e) in response to a recent classification of iodine as a List II chemical. Iodine is used to produce hydrogen iodide which, in the presence of water, becomes hydriodic acid, a List I chemical that is a reagent used in the production of amphetamine and methamphetamine. The penalties for iodine were established based upon its conversion to hydriodic acid.</p>

<p>and inserting the following:</p>
<p>&quot;If the offense involved the large-scale manufacture, distribution, transportation, exportation, or importation of prohibited flasks, equipment, chemicals, products, or material, an upward departure may be warranted.&quot;.</p>
<p>Appendix A (Statutory Index) is amended by inserting after the line referenced to 21 U.S.C. § 863 the following:</p>
<p>&quot;21 U.S.C. § 864 2D1.12&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This amendment addresses the new offense, in section 423 of the Controlled Substances Act, 21 U.S.C. § 864, of stealing or transporting across state lines anhydrous ammonia knowing, intending, or having reasonable cause to believe that such anhydrous ammonia will be used to manufacture a controlled substance. This new offense, created by section 3653 of the Methamphetamine Anti-Proliferation Act of 2000, Pub. L. 106–310, carries the statutory penalties contained in section 403(d) of the Controlled Substances Act, 21 U.S.C. § 843, <em>i.e.</em>, not more than four years' imprisonment (or not more than eight years' imprisonment in the case of certain prior convictions), or not more than ten years' imprisonment (or not more than 20 years' imprisonment in the case of certain prior convictions) if the offense involved the manufacture of methamphetamine.</p>
<p>The amendment references the new offense to §2D1.12 (Unlawful Possession, Manufacture, Distribution, or Importation of Prohibited Flask or Equipment; Attempt or Conspiracy). Reference to this guideline is appropriate because the new offense is similar to other offenses that already are referenced to the guideline and have the same penalty structure, such as 21 U.S.C. § 843(a)(6), which among other things, makes it unlawful to possess any chemical, product, or material that may be used to manufacture a controlled substance. In addition, this amendment expands the coverage of Application Note 1 to also apply to cases involving the transportation and exportation of prohibited chemicals, products, or material. Finally, the amendment makes minor, non-substantive changes to the guideline in order to fully incorporate the new and existing offenses.</p>

{id: 627, content:"<p><strong>627.</strong> <strong>Amendment:</strong> Sections 2G1.1, 2G2.1, 2H4.1, 2H4.2, and 5E1.1, and each line in Appendix A (Statutory Index) referenced to 18 U.S.C. § 241, § 1589, § 1590, §1591, or §1592, or to 29 U.S.C. § 1851, effective May 1, 2001 (<em>see</em> Amendment 612), are repromulgated with the following changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Section 5E1.1(a)(1) is amended by inserting &quot;, or 21 U.S.C. § 853(q)&quot; after &quot;3663A&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §5E1.1 captioned &quot;Background&quot; is amended in the first paragraph by inserting &quot;, and 21 U.S.C. § 853(q)&quot; after &quot;3663A&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This amendment repromulgates as a permanent amendment the previously promulgated emergency amendment on human trafficking. (<em>See</em> Amendment 612.) The amendment implements the congressional directive in section 112(b) of the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000, Pub. L. 106–386 (the &quot;Act&quot;).</p>
<p>The directive requires the Commission to amend, if appropriate, the guidelines applicable to human trafficking (<em>i.e.</em>, peonage, involuntary servitude, and forced labor) offenses. It also requires the Commission to ensure that the guidelines &quot;are sufficiently stringent to deter and adequately reflect the heinous nature of these offenses.&quot; In compliance with the directive, the amendment (1) creates a new guideline, §2H4.2 (Willful Violations of the Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural Worker Protection Act); (2) refers violations of four new statutes, 18 U.S.C. §§ 1589 (Forced Labor), 1590 (Trafficking with Respect to Peonage, Involuntary Servitude or Forced Labor), 1591 (Sex Trafficking of Children by Force, Fraud or Coercion), and 1592 (Unlawful Conduct with Respect to Documents in Furtherance of Peonage, Involuntary Servitude, or Forced Labor) to the appropriate guidelines; and (3) makes changes, consistent with the directive, which both enhance sentences and reflect changes to three existing statutes: 18 U.S.C. §§ 1581(a) (Peonage), 1583 (Enticement into Slavery) and 1584 (Sale into Involuntary Servitude).</p>
<p>To address this multi-faceted directive, the amendment makes changes to several existing guidelines and creates a new guideline for criminal violations of the Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural Worker Protection Act. Although the directive instructs the Commission to amend the guidelines applicable to the Fair Labor Standards Act (29 U.S.C. § 201 et. seq.), a criminal violation of the Fair Labor Standards Act is only a Class B misdemeanor. <em>See</em> 29 U.S.C. § 216. Thus, the guidelines are not applicable to those offenses.</p>
<p>The amendment references the new offense at 18 U.S.C. § 1591 to §2G1.1 (Promoting Prostitution or Prohibited Sexual Conduct). Section 1591 provides criminal penalties for a defendant who participates in the transporting or harboring of a person, or who benefits from participating in such a venture, with the knowledge that force, fraud, or coercion will be used to cause that person to engage in a commercial sex act or with knowledge that the person is not 18 years old and will be forced to engage in a commercial sex act. Despite the statute’s inclusion in a chapter of title 18 devoted mainly to peonage offenses, section 1591 offenses are more analogous to the offenses referenced to the prostitution guideline.</p>
<p>Section 1591 cases alternatively have been referred in Appendix A (Statutory Index) to §2G2.1 (Sexually Exploiting a Minor by Production of Sexually Explicit Visual or Printed Material; Custodian Permitting Minor to Engage in Sexually Explicit Conduct; Advertisement for Minors to Engage in Production). This has been done in anticipation that some portion of section 1591 cases will involve forcing or coercing children to engage in commercial sex acts for the purpose of producing pornography. Such offenses, as recognized by the higher base offense level at §2G2.1, are more serious because they both involve specific harm to an individual victim and further an additional criminal purpose, namely, commercial pornography.</p>
<p>The amendment maintains the view that §2H4.1 (Peonage, Involuntary Servitude, and Slave Trade) continues to be an appropriate tool for determining sentences for violations of 18 U.S.C. §§ 1581, 1583, and 1584. Section 2H4.1 also is designed to cover offenses under three new statutes: 18 U.S.C. §§ 1589, 1590, and 1592. Section 1589 provides criminal penalties for a defendant who provides or obtains the labor or services of another by the use of threats of serious harm or physical restraint against a person, or by a scheme or plan intended to make the person believe that physical restraint or serious harm would result from not performing the labor or services. This statute also applies to defendants who provide or obtain labor or services of another by abusing or threatening abuse of the law or the legal process. <em>See</em> 18 U.S.C. § 1589.</p>
<p>Section 1590 provides criminal penalties for a defendant who harbors, transports, or is otherwise involved in obtaining, a person for labor or services. Section 1592 provides criminal penalties for a defendant who knowingly possesses, destroys, or removes an actual passport, other immigration document, or government identification document of another person in the course of a violation of § 1581 (peonage), § 1583 (enticement into slavery), § 1584 (sale into involuntary servitude), § 1589 (forced labor), § 1590 (trafficking with respect to these offenses), § 1591 (sex trafficking of children by force, fraud, or coercion), or § 1594(a) (attempts to violate these offenses). Section 1592 also provides criminal penalties for a defendant who, with intent to violate § 1581, § 1583, § 1584, § 1589, § 1590, or § 1591, knowingly possesses, destroys, or removes an actual passport, other immigration document, or government identification document of another person. These statutes prohibit the types of behaviors that traditionally have been sentenced under §2H4.1.</p>
<p>The amendment provides an alternative, less punitive base offense level of level 18 for those who violate 18 U.S.C. § 1592, an offense which limits participation in peonage cases to the destruction or wrongful confiscation of a passport or other immigration document. This alternative, lower base level reflects the lower statutory maximum sentence for section 1592 offenses (<em>i.e.</em>, 5 years’ imprisonment).</p>
<p>Section 2H4.1(b)(2) has been expanded to provide a four-level increase if a dangerous weapon was used and a two-level increase if a dangerous weapon was brandished or its use was threatened. Prior to this amendment, only actual use of a dangerous weapon was covered. This change reflects the directive to consider an enhancement for the use or threatened use of a dangerous weapon. The commentary to §2H4.1 is amended to clarify that the threatened use of a dangerous weapon applies regardless of whether a dangerous weapon was actually present.</p>
<p>The amendment also creates a new guideline, §2H4.2 (Willful Violations of the Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural Worker Protection Act), in response to the directive to amend the guidelines applicable to such offenses. These offenses, which have a statutory maximum sentence of one year imprisonment for first offenses and three years’ imprisonment for subsequent offenses, were not, prior to this amendment, referred to any specific guideline. The amendment provides a base offense level of level 6 in recognition of the low statutory maximum sentences set for these cases by Congress. Further, these offenses typically involve violations of regulatory provisions. Setting the base offense level at level 6 provides consistency with guidelines for other regulatory offenses. <em>See</em>, <em>e.g.</em>, §§2N2.1 (Violations of Statutes and Regulations Dealing With Any Food, Drug, Biological Product, Device, Cosmetic, or Agricultural Product) and 2N3.1 (Odometer Laws and Regulations). Subsections (b)(1), an enhancement for bodily injury, and (b)(2), an enhancement applicable to defendants who commit the instant offense after previously sustaining a civil penalty for similar misconduct, have been established to respond to the directive that the Commission consider sentencing enhancement for this aggravated conduct. This provision addresses the Department of Justice’s and the Department of Labor’s concern regarding the need for enhanced penalties in cases involving prior administrative and civil adjudications.</p>
<p>This amendment also addresses that portion of section 112 of the Act that amends chapter 77 of title 18, United States Code, to provide mandatory restitution for peonage and involuntary servitude offenses. The amendment amends §5E1.1 (Restitution) to include a reference to 18 U.S.C. § 1593 in the guideline provision regarding mandatory restitution.</p>
<p>By enactment of various sentencing enhancements and encouraged upward departures for areas of concern identified by Congress, the Commission has provided for more severe sentences for perpetrators of human trafficking offenses in keeping with the conclusion that the offenses covered by this amendment are both heinous in nature and being committed with increasing frequency.</p>
<p>In addition, to repromulgating the emergency amendment, this amendment responds to section 3613 of the Methamphetamine Anti-Proliferation Act of 2000, Pub. L. 106–310, that amends 21 U.S.C. § 853(q) to provide mandatory restitution for offenses involving the manufacture of methamphetamine. Accordingly, the amendment amends §5E1.1 (Restitution) to include a reference to 21 U.S.C. § 853(q) in the guideline provision regarding mandatory restitution.</p>

<p>The Commentary to §2H3.1 captioned &quot;Background&quot; is amended by adding at the end the following additional paragraph:</p>
<p>&quot; This section also refers to conduct relating to the disclosure and inspection of tax returns and tax return information, which is proscribed by 26 U.S.C. §§ 7213(a)(1)-(3), (5), (d), 7213A, and 7216. These statutes provide for a maximum term of imprisonment of five years for most types of disclosure of tax return information, but provide a maximum term of imprisonment of one year for violations of 26 U.S.C. §§ 7213A and 7216.&quot;.</p>

<p>and by inserting after the line referenced to 26 U.S.C. § 7215 the following new line:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;26 U.S.C. § 7216 2H3.1&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This amendment responds to the Internal Revenue Service Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998, Public Law 105–206 (&quot;the Act&quot;). The Act created new tax offenses pertaining to the unlawful disclosure of tax-related information contained on computer software and to unlawful requests for tax audits. In addition, the Taxpayer Browsing Protection Act of 1997, Public Law 105–35, created another tax offense pertaining to the unlawful inspection of tax information.</p>
<p>Specifically, Public Law 105–35 expanded 26 U.S.C. § 7213 to prohibit federal and state employees and certain other persons from disclosing tax-related computer software. Public Law 105–35 also created an offense at 26 U.S.C. § 7213A making it unlawful for federal and state employees and certain other persons to inspect tax return information in any way other than that authorized under the Internal Revenue Code.</p>
<p>This is a two-part amendment. First, this amendment updates Appendix A (Statutory Index) by referring most of these offenses to §2H3.1 (Interception of Communications and Eavesdropping). Prior to this amendment, no guideline provision or statutory reference was expressly promulgated to address tax offenses that implicated privacy interests. Under subsection (a) of §1B1.2 (Applicable Guidelines) and under §2X5.1 (Other Offenses), courts are required to use the most analogous offense guideline from Chapter Two (Offense Conduct) in each pending case brought under a statute having no reference in the guidelines’ statutory index.</p>
<p>In general, the guideline most analogous for these offenses is §2H3.1. Section 2H3.1 concerns offenses against privacy and, in large measure, these tax-related offenses are devoted to protecting taxpayer privacy interests. Section 2H3.1 also contains a cross reference to &quot;another offense&quot; if a greater offense level will result.</p>
<p>Second, this amendment adds a three-level decrease in the base offense level under §2H3.1 for the least serious types of offense behavior, in which there was no intent to harm or obtain pecuniary gain. The base offense level for §2H3.1 is level 9 with a range of 4 to 10 months (in criminal history Category I). The Commission determined that a base offense level of level 9 is too severe for the misdemeanor offenses contained in 26 U.S.C. §§ 7213A (Unauthorized Inspection) and 7216 (Unauthorized Disclosure), and the three-level decrease addresses this concern.</p>

<p>The Commentary to §2K1.3 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended by striking the text of Note 3 as follows:</p>
<p>&quot;‘Prohibited person,’ as used in subsection (a)(3), means anyone who: (i) is under indictment for, or has been convicted of, a ‘crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year,’ as defined at 18 U.S.C. § 841(l); (ii) is a fugitive from justice; (iii) is an unlawful user of, or is addicted to, any controlled substance; or (iv) has been adjudicated as a mental defective or involuntarily committed to a mental institution.&quot;,</p>

<p>Section 2K2.1(a)(6) is amended by striking &quot;is&quot; after &quot;(A)&quot; and inserting &quot;was&quot;; and by inserting &quot;at the time the defendant committed the instant offense&quot; after &quot;prohibited person&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §2K2.1 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended by striking the text of Note 6 as follows:</p>
<p>‘Prohibited person,’ as used in subsections (a)(4)(B) and (a)(6), means anyone who: (i) is under indictment for, or has been convicted of, a ‘crime punishable by imprisonment for more than one year,’ as defined by 18 U.S.C. § 921(a)(20); (ii) is a fugitive from justice; (iii) is an unlawful user of, or is addicted to, any controlled substance; (iv) has been adjudicated as a mental defective or involuntarily committed to a mental institution; (v) being an alien, is illegally or unlawfully in the United States; (vi) is subject to a court order that restrains such person from harassing, stalking, or threatening an intimate partner of such person or child of such intimate partner or person, or engaging in other conduct that would place an intimate partner in reasonable fear of bodily injury to the partner or child as defined in 18 U.S.C. § 922(d)(8); or (vii) has been convicted in any court of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence as defined in 18 U.S.C. § 921(a)(33).&quot;,</p>
<p>and inserting the following:</p>
<p>&quot;For purposes of subsections (a)(4)(B) and (a)(6), ‘prohibited person’ means any person described in 18 U.S.C. § 922(g) or § 922(n).&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This amendment makes two revisions regarding the definition of &quot;prohibited person&quot; in subsection (a)(3) of §2K1.3 (Unlawful Receipt, Possession, or Transportation of Explosive Materials; Prohibited Transactions Involving Explosive Materials) and subsections (a)(4)(B) and (a)(6) of §2K2.1 (Unlawful Receipt, Possession, or Transportation of Firearms or Ammunition; Prohibited Transactions Involving Firearms or Ammunition). First, the amendment adopts the definitions of prohibited person found in specific statutes for explosive and firearm offenses. (There is no uniform statutory definition of prohibited person.) The relevant statutory provision for §2K1.3 is 18 U.S.C. § 842(i), and the relevant statutory provisions for §2K2.1 are 18 U.S.C. § 922(g) and (n).</p>
<p>Second, the amendment clarifies that the pertinent alternative base offense level applies only when the offender attains the requisite status prior to committing the instant offense. This clarification is consistent with the amendment on prior felonies, which provides for increased punishment only when the offender sustains certain felony convictions prior to committing the instant offense.</p>

<p>‘Crime of violence’ has the meaning given that term in §4B1.2(a) and Application Note 1 of the Commentary to §4B1.2.</p>
<p>‘Felony conviction’ means a prior adult federal or state conviction for an offense punishable by death or imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, regardless of whether such offense is specifically designated as a felony and regardless of the actual sentence imposed. A conviction for an offense committed at age eighteen years or older is an adult conviction. A conviction for an offense committed prior to age eighteen years is an adult conviction if it is classified as an adult conviction under the laws of the jurisdiction in which the defendant was convicted (<em>e.g.</em>, a federal conviction for an offense committed prior to the defendant’s eighteenth birthday is an adult conviction if the defendant was expressly proceeded against as an adult).&quot;.</p>

<p>‘Felony conviction’ means a prior adult federal or state conviction for an offense punishable by death or imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, regardless of whether such offense is specifically designated as a felony and regardless of the actual sentence imposed. A conviction for an offense committed at age eighteen years or older is an adult conviction. A conviction for an offense committed prior to age eighteen years is an adult conviction if it is classified as an adult conviction under the laws of the jurisdiction in which the defendant was convicted (<em>e.g.</em>, a federal conviction for an offense committed prior to the defendant’s eighteenth birthday is an adult conviction if the defendant was expressly proceeded against as an adult).&quot;.</p>

<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This amendment modifies subsections (a)(1) and (a)(2) of §2K1.3 (Unlawful Receipt, Possession, or Transportation of Explosive Materials; Prohibited Transactions Involving Explosive Materials) and subsections (a)(1), (a)(2), (a)(3) and (a)(4)(A) of §2K2.1 (Unlawful Receipt, Possession or Transportation of Firearms or Ammunition) to resolve a circuit conflict regarding whether a crime committed after the commission of the instant offense and before sentencing for the instant offense is counted as a prior felony conviction for purposes of determining the defendant’s base offense level. <em>Compare</em> <em>United States v. Pugh</em>, 158 F.3d 1308, 1311 (D.C. Cir. 1998) (finding the guideline language ambiguous but the commentary language clear, thereby counting prior felony conviction that was sentenced prior to sentencing for the instant federal offense, even if the defendant committed the prior felony offense after the instant federal offense); <em>United States v. McCary</em>, 14 F.3d 1502, 1506 (10th Cir. 1994) (the defendant’s base offense level is to be determined on the basis of the defendant’s status as of the date the district court imposed sentence, not the date of the offense for which he had previously been convicted); and <em>United States v. Laihben</em>, 167 F.3d 1364 (11th Cir. 1999) (district court properly considered defendant’s conviction, which occurred after commission of, but before sentencing, on the federal firearms offense, in determining offense level), <em>with</em> <em>United States v. Barton</em>, 100 F.3d 43, 46 (6th Cir. 1996) (defendant’s state drug crime, which was committed after federal offense of being a felon in possession of firearm, could not have been counted as prior felony conviction under §2K2.1(a), even though defendant was convicted and sentenced on state offense prior to sentencing on federal charge; only those convictions that occur prior to the commission of the firearm offense may be counted against the defendant in determining the base offense level) ) and <em>United States v. Oetken</em>, 241 F.3d 1057 (8th Cir. 2001) (only convictions that occur prior to the commission of the offense qualify as &quot;prior convictions&quot;).</p>
<p>The amendment adopts the minority view that an offense committed after the commission of any part of the offense cannot be counted as a prior felony conviction. The amendment clarifies, in §2K1.3(a)(1) and (a)(2) and in §2K2.1(a)(1), (a)(2), (a)(3) and (a)(4)(A), that the instant offense must have been committed subsequent to sustaining the prior felony conviction. In so doing, this amendment adopts a rule that is consistent with the requirements concerning the use of prior convictions under §§4B1.1 (Career Offender) and 4B1.2 (Definitions of Terms Used in Section 4B1.1).</p>
<p>This amendment also clarifies that in cases in which more than one prior felony conviction is required for application of the base offense level in §2K1.3 or §2K2.1, the prior felony convictions must be counted separately under Chapter Four (Criminal History and Criminal Livelihood).</p>
<p>The amendment makes nonsubstantive clarifying changes in the definitions of &quot;controlled</p>
<p>substance offense&quot;, &quot;crime of violence&quot;, and &quot;felony conviction&quot; for purposes of §§2K1.3 and 2K2.1.</p>

<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This amendment responds to a recommendation from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) to increase the penalties in §2K2.1 (Unlawful Receipt, Possession or Transportation of Firearms or Ammunition) for offenses involving more than 100 firearms.</p>
<p>The amendment modifies the firearms table at §2K2.1(b)(1), to provide enhancements in two-level increments. Prior to this amendment, the table provided enhancements in one-level increments. This change has the effect of compressing the table by providing a wider range in each subdivision of the table for the number of firearms involved in the offense. Compressing the table in this manner diminishes some of the fact-finding required to determine how many firearms were involved in the offense and provides some increase in penalties. The amendment provides additional two-level increases for offenses that involve either 100-199 firearms, or 200 or more firearms. These increases are provided to ensure adequate and proportionate punishment in cases that involve large numbers of firearms.</p>
<p>The amendment also makes a conforming change to Application Note 16 of §2K2.1 regarding upward departures.</p>

<p><em>Statutory Provisions</em>: 8 U.S.C. § 1325(a) (second or subsequent offense only), 8 U.S.C. § 1326. For additional statutory provision(s), <em>see</em> Appendix A (Statutory Index).</p>
<p><em>Application Notes</em>:</p>
<p>1. For purposes of this guideline—</p>
<p>‘Deported after a conviction,’ means that the deportation was subsequent to the conviction, whether or not the deportation was in response to such conviction. An alien has previously been ‘deported’ if he or she has been removed or has departed the United States while an order of exclusion, deportation, or removal was outstanding.</p>
<p>‘Remained in the United States following a removal order issued after a conviction,’ means that the removal order was subsequent to the conviction, whether or not the removal order was in response to such conviction.</p>
<p>‘Aggravated felony,’ is defined at 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43) without regard to the date of conviction of the aggravated felony.</p>
<p>‘Crime of violence’ and ‘controlled substance offense’ are defined in §4B1.2. For purposes of subsection (b)(1)(B), &quot;crime of violence&quot; includes offenses punishable by imprisonment for a term of one year or less.</p>
<p>‘Firearms offense’ means any offense covered by Chapter Two, Part K, Subpart 2, or any similar offense under state or local law.</p>
<p>‘Felony offense’ means any federal, state, or local offense punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year.</p>
<p>2. This guideline applies only to felonies. A first offense under 8 U.S.C. § 1325(a) is a Class B misdemeanor for which no guideline has been promulgated. A prior sentence for such offense, however, is to be considered under the provisions of Chapter Four, Part A (Criminal History).</p>
<p>3. In the case of a defendant with repeated prior instances of deportation, an upward departure may be warranted. <em>See</em> §4A1.3 (Adequacy of Criminal History Category).</p>
<p>4. An adjustment under subsection (b) for a prior felony conviction applies in addition to any criminal history points added for such conviction in Chapter Four, Part A (Criminal History).</p>
<p>5. Aggravated felonies that trigger the adjustment from subsection (b)(1)(A) vary widely. If subsection (b)(1)(A) applies, and (A) the defendant has previously been convicted of only one felony offense; (B) such offense was not a crime of violence or firearms offense; and (C) the term of imprisonment imposed for such offense did not exceed one year, a downward departure may be warranted based on the seriousness of the aggravated felony.&quot;.</p>
<p>A replacement guideline is inserted as §2L1.2 (Unlawfully Entering or Remaining in the United States).</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This amendment responds to concerns raised by a number of judges, probation officers, and defense attorneys, particularly in districts along the southwest border between the United States and Mexico, that §2L1.2 (Unlawfully Entering or Remaining in the United States) sometimes results in disproportionate penalties because of the 16-level enhancement provided in the guideline for a prior conviction for an aggravated felony. The disproportionate penalties result because the breadth of the definition of &quot;aggravated felony&quot; provided in 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43), which is incorporated into the guideline by reference, means that a defendant who previously was convicted of murder, for example, receives the same 16-level enhancement as a defendant previously convicted of simple assault. The Commission also observed that the criminal justice system has been addressing this inequity on an <em>ad</em> <em>hoc</em> basis in such cases by increased use of departures.</p>
<p>This amendment responds to these concerns by providing a more graduated sentencing enhancement of between 8 levels and 16 levels, depending on the seriousness of the prior aggravated felony and the dangerousness of the defendant. In doing so, the Commission determined that the 16-level enhancement is warranted if the defendant previously was deported, or unlawfully remained in the United States, after a conviction for certain serious offenses, specifically, a drug trafficking offense for which the sentence imposed exceeded 13 months, a felony that is a crime of violence, a felony that is a firearms offense, a felony that is a national security or terrorism offense, a felony that is a human trafficking offense, and a felony that is an alien smuggling offense committed for profit. Other felony drug trafficking offenses will receive a 12-level enhancement. All other aggravated felony offenses will receive an 8-level enhancement.</p>
<p>This amendment also deletes an application note providing that a downward departure may be warranted based on the seriousness of the offense if the 16-level enhancement applied and (1) the defendant has previously been convicted of only one felony offense; (2) such offense was not a crime of violence or firearms offense; and (3) the term of imprisonment for such offenses did not exceed one year. The Commission determined that the graduation of the 16-level enhancement based on the seriousness of the prior conviction negated the need for this departure provision. As a result, this amendment may have the indirect result of reducing the departure rate for cases sentenced under §2L1.2. In addition, this amendment renders moot a circuit conflict regarding whether the three criteria set forth in the application note are the exclusive basis for a downward departure from the 16-level enhancement. <em>Compare</em> <em>United States v. Sanchez-Rodriguez</em>, 161 F.3d 556 (9th Cir. 1998) (holding that Application Note 5 to §2L1.2 does not limit the circumstances under which a downward departure from the 16-level enhancement is warranted); and <em>United States v. Alfaro-Zayas</em>, 196 F.3d 1338 (11th Cir. 1999) (same), <em>with</em> <em>United States v. Tappin</em>, 205 F.3d 536 (2d Cir. 2000) (holding that a defendant must satisfy all three criteria set forth in Application Note 5 in §2L1.2 to receive a downward departure from the 16-level enhancement).</p>
<p>This amendment also makes a number of other minor changes to §2L1.2, to provide guidance regarding the application of the enhancement for the commission of three or more prior misdemeanors and to provide definitions for terms used in the guideline.</p>

<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This amendment responds to a statutory provision expressing a sense of Congress and addresses two offenses relating to biological and chemical weapons. Specifically, the amendment responds to section 1423(a) of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1997, Public Law 104–201, that expressed a sense of Congress that guideline penalties are inadequate for certain offenses involving the importation and exportation of nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons, materials, or technologies by providing a four-level increase for those offenses in subsection (a)(1) of both §§2M5.1 (Evasion of Export Controls) and 2M5.2 (Exportation of Arms, Munitions, or Military Equipment or Services Without a Required Validated Export License). This increase serves to make the penalty structure for those offenses proportional to other national security guidelines in Chapter Two, Part M. In addition, Appendix A (Statutory Index) is amended to refer one of the offenses, 50 U.S.C. § 1701 (which prior to this amendment was not referenced in the Statutory Index), to both §§2M5.1 and 2M5.2.</p>
<p>The amendment also substantially revises §2M6.1 to incorporate offenses at 18 U.S.C. § 175, relating to biological weapons, and 18 U.S.C. § 229, relating to chemical weapons. Specifically, the amendment modifies §2M6.1 as follows:</p>
<p>First, the amendment provides three alternative base offense levels. The first alternative base offense level of level 42 applies if the offense was committed with the intent to injure the United States or to aid a foreign government or foreign terrorist organization and incorporates the 12-level enhancement previously at subsection (b)(1). Therefore, this change does not affect the overall offense level for these offenses. &quot;Foreign terrorist organizations&quot; are added because such groups are investing in the acquisition of unconventional weapons such as nuclear, biological, and chemical agents. This first alternative base offense level is expected to apply to cases previously covered by the guideline (<em>i.e.</em>, the acquisition of nuclear material from nuclear facilities in order to assist foreign governments, thereby creating a threat to the national security), as well as to cases that implicate the national security and involve biological and chemical weapons and other weapons of mass destruction.</p>
<p>The amendment provides that, if the base offense level of level 42 applies, none of the adjustments in subsection (b) shall apply. However, if death results, the cross reference allows for the possibility of a greater offense level through application of the first degree murder guideline.</p>
<p>The second alternative base offense level of level 28 applies to those cases that do not threaten the national security of the United States, and is expected to apply in most cases.</p>
<p>The third alternative base offense level of level 20 applies to cases which involve a threat to use a nuclear, biological, or chemical weapon or material, or other weapon of mass destruction, but do not involve any conduct evidencing an intent or ability to carry out the threat and, accordingly, are less serious offenses.</p>
<p>Second, the amendment provides a two-level enhancement in subsection (b)(1) if the offense or threat involved particularly dangerous types of nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons and materials that are defined in the guideline commentary by reference to the applicable statutory and regulatory provisions. This enhancement reflects the distinctions already made in international treaties, provisions of title 18, United States Code, relevant regulatory schemes, and the fact that certain types of weapons and materials are inherently more lethal and pose a greater threat to the public safety.</p>
<p>Third, the amendment provides a four-level enhancement in subsection (b)(2) if any victim died or sustained permanent or life-threatening bodily injury, and a two-level enhancement if any victim sustained serious bodily injury. If the degree of injury is between permanent or life-threatening bodily injury and serious bodily injury, a three-level enhancement is provided. This enhancement is modeled after the enhancement found in §2N1.1 (Tampering or Attempting to Tamper Involving Risk of Death or Bodily Injury).</p>
<p>Fourth, the amendment provides a four-level enhancement for cases involving a substantial disruption of public, governmental, or business functions or services, or the substantial expenditure of funds to clean up, decontaminate, or otherwise respond to the offense.</p>
<p>Fifth, the amendment provides two cross references, applicable if the resulting offense level is greater and either death resulted (in which case the first or second degree murder guideline would apply), or if the offense was tantamount to attempted murder (in which case the attempted murder guideline would apply). These cross references are also modeled after the cross reference found in §2N1.1.</p>
<p>Sixth, the amendment provides a special instruction that if the defendant is convicted of one count involving the death of, serious bodily injury to, or attempted murder of, more than one victim, the grouping rules will be applied as if the defendant had been convicted of separate counts for each such victim.</p>
<p>Seventh, the amendment amends Appendix A to refer violations of 18 U.S.C. §§ 175 and 229 to §2M6.1 and to delete a number of guideline references for violations of 18 U.S.C. § 2332a and instead provide a reference for that offense to §§2K1.4 (Arson; Property Damage by Use of Explosives) and 2M6.1 (in the case of other weapons of mass destruction).</p>
<p>Finally, the amendment amends the title of §2M6.1 to include attempts and conspiracies, and adds §2M6.1 under the sections addressing attempts and conspiracies in Application</p>
<p>Note 1 of §2X1.1 (Attempt, Solicitation, or Conspiracy) to indicate that attempts and conspiracies are covered expressly by the §2M6.1 offense guideline.</p>

<p><em>Commentary</em></p>
<p><em>Statutory Provision</em>: 18 U.S.C. § 1956.</p>
<p><em>Background</em>: The statute covered by this guideline is a part of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986, and prohibits financial transactions involving funds that are the proceeds of ‘specified unlawful activity,’ if such transactions are intended to facilitate that activity, or conceal the nature of the proceeds or avoid a transaction reporting requirement. The maximum term of imprisonment authorized is twenty years.</p>
<p>In keeping with the clear intent of the legislation, this guideline provides for substantial punishment. The punishment is higher than that specified in §2S1.2 and §2S1.3 because of the higher statutory maximum, and the added elements as to source of funds, knowledge, and intent.</p>
<p>A higher base offense level is specified if the defendant is convicted under 18 U.S.C. § 1956(a)(1)(A), (a)(2)(A), or (a)(3)(A) because those subsections apply to defendants who encouraged or facilitated the commission of further crimes. Effective November 18, 1988, 18 U.S.C. § 1956(a)(1)(A) contains two subdivisions. The base offense level of 23 applies to § 1956(a)(1)(A)(i) and (ii).</p>
<p>The amount of money involved is included as a factor because it is an indicator of the magnitude of the criminal enterprise, and the extent to which the defendant aided the enterprise. Narcotics trafficking is included as a factor because of the clearly expressed Congressional intent to adequately punish persons involved in that activity.&quot;.</p>
<p>A replacement guideline with accompanying commentary is inserted as §2S1.1 (Laundering of Monetary Instruments; Engaging in Monetary Transactions in Property Derived from Unlawful Activity).</p>
<p>Chapter Two, Part S is amended by striking §2S1.2 as follows:</p>

<p>(b) Specific Offense Characteristics</p>
<p>(1) If the defendant knew that the funds were the proceeds of:</p>
<p>(A) an unlawful activity involving the manufacture, importation, or distribution of narcotics or other controlled substances, increase by 5 levels; or</p>
<p>(B) any other specified unlawful activity (<em>see</em> 18 U.S.C. § 1956(c)(7)), increase by 2 levels.</p>
<p>(2) If the value of the funds exceeded $100,000, increase the offense level as specified in §2S1.1(b)(2).</p>
<p>(c) Special Instruction for Fines - Organizations</p>
<p>(1) In lieu of the applicable amount from the table in subsection (d) of §8C2.4 (Base Fine), use:</p>
<p>(A) the greater of $175,000 or 60 percent of the value of the funds if subsection (b)(1)(A) is used to determine the offense level; or</p>
<p>(B) the greater of $150,000 or 50 percent of the value of the funds if subsection (b)(1)(B) is used to determine the offense level.</p>
<p><em>Commentary</em></p>
<p><em>Statutory Provisions</em>: 18 U.S.C. § 1957. For additional statutory provision(s), <em>see</em> Appendix A (Statutory Index).</p>
<p><em>Application Note</em>:</p>
<p>1. ‘Specified unlawful activity’ is defined in 18 U.S.C. § 1956(c)(7) to include racketeering offenses (18 U.S.C. § 1961(1)), drug offenses, and most other serious federal crimes but does not include other money-laundering offenses.</p>
<p><em>Background</em>: The statute covered by this guideline is a part of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986, and prohibits monetary transactions that exceed $10,000 and involve the proceeds of ‘specified unlawful activity’ (as defined in 18 U.S.C. § 1956), if the defendant knows that the funds are criminally derived property. (Knowledge that the property is from a specified unlawful activity is not an element of the offense.) The maximum term of imprisonment specified is ten years.</p>
<p>The statute is similar to 18 U.S.C. § 1956, but does not require that the recipient exchange or ‘launder’ the funds, that he have knowledge that the funds were proceeds of a specified unlawful activity, nor that he have any intent to further or conceal such an activity. In keeping with the intent of the legislation, this guideline provides for substantial punishment. The offense levels are higher than in §2S1.3 because of the higher statutory maximum and the added element of knowing that the funds were criminally derived property.</p>
<p>The 2-level increase in subsection (b)(1)(B) applies if the defendant knew that the funds were not merely criminally derived, but were in fact the proceeds of a specified unlawful activity. Such a distinction is not made in §2S1.1, because the level of intent required in that section effectively precludes an inference that the defendant was unaware of the nature of the activity.&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §2S1.3 captioned &quot;Statutory Provisions&quot; is amended by inserting &quot;18 U.S.C. § 1960;&quot; before &quot;26 U.S.C. § 7203&quot;; and by inserting &quot;, 5326&quot; after &quot;5324&quot;.</p>

<p>The Commentary to §1B1.3 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended in Note 6 in the second paragraph by striking &quot;An express&quot; and inserting &quot;Unless otherwise specified, an express&quot;; and by striking the last sentence as follows:</p>

<p>and inserting the following:</p>
<p>&quot;For example, §2S1.1(b)(2)(B) (which is applicable only if the defendant is convicted under 18 U.S.C. § 1956) would be applied in determining the offense level under §2X3.1 (Accessory After the Fact) in a case in which the defendant was convicted of accessory after the fact to a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1956 but would not be applied in a case in which the defendant is convicted of a conspiracy under 18 U.S.C. § 1956(h) and the sole object of that conspiracy was to commit an offense set forth in 18 U.S.C. § 1957. <em>See</em> Application Note 3(C) of §2S1.1.&quot;.</p>
<p>Section 3D1.2(d) is amended in the second paragraph by striking &quot;2S1.2,&quot;.</p>
<p>Section 8C2.1(a) is amended by striking &quot;2S1.2,&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §8C2.4 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended in Note 5 by striking &quot;; 2S1.1 (Laundering of Monetary Instruments); and 2S1.2 (Engaging in Monetary Transactions in Property Derived from Specified Unlawful Activity)&quot;; and by inserting &quot;and&quot; before &quot;2R1.1&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §8C2.4 captioned &quot;Background&quot; is amended in the seventh sentence by striking &quot;and money laundering&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This amendment consolidates the money laundering guidelines, §§2S1.1 (Laundering of Monetary Instruments) and 2S1.2 (Engaging in Monetary Transactions in Property Derived from Specified Unlawful Activity), into one guideline that applies to convictions under 18 U.S.C. § 1956 or § 1957, or 21 U.S.C. § 854. The amendment responds in several ways to concerns that the penalty structure existing prior to this amendment for such offenses did not reflect adequately the culpability of the defendant or the seriousness of the money laundering conduct because the offense level for money laundering was determined without sufficient consideration of the defendant’s involvement in, or the relative seriousness of, the underlying offense. This amendment is designed to promote proportionality by providing increased penalties for defendants who launder funds derived from more serious underlying criminal conduct, such as drug trafficking, crimes of violence, and fraud offenses that generate relatively high loss amounts, and decreased penalties for defendants who launder funds derived from less serious underlying criminal conduct, such as basic fraud offenses that generate relatively low loss amounts.</p>
<p>First, this amendment ties offense levels for money laundering more closely to the underlying conduct that was the source of the criminally derived funds by separating money laundering offenders into two categories for purposes of determining the base offense level. For direct money launderers (offenders who commit or would be accountable under §1B1.3(a)(1)(A) (Relevant Conduct) for the underlying offense which generated the criminal proceeds), subsection (a)(1) sets the base offense level at the offense level in Chapter Two (Offense Conduct) for the underlying offense (<em>i.e.</em>, the base offense level, specific offense characteristics, cross references, and special instructions for the underlying offense). For third party money launderers (offenders who launder the proceeds generated from underlying offenses that the defendant did not commit or would not be accountable for under §1B1.3(a)(1)(A)), subsection (a)(2) sets the base offense level at level 8, plus an increase based on the value of the laundered funds from the table in subsection (b)(1) of §2B1.1 (Theft, Fraud, Property Destruction).</p>
<p>Second, in addition to the base offense level calculation, this amendment provides an enhancement designed to reflect the differing seriousness of the underlying conduct that was the source of the criminally derived funds. Subsection (b)(1) provides a six-level enhancement for third party money launderers who knew or believed that any of the laundered funds were the proceeds of, or were intended to promote, certain types of more serious underlying criminal conduct; specifically, drug trafficking, crimes of violence, offenses involving firearms, explosives, national security, terrorism, and the sexual exploitation of a minor. The Commission determined that defendants who knowingly launder the proceeds of these more serious underlying offenses are substantially more culpable than third party launderers of criminally derived proceeds of less serious underlying offenses.</p>
<p>Third, this amendment provides three alternative enhancements, with the greatest applicable enhancement to be applied. These enhancements are designed to (1) ensure that all direct money launderers receive additional punishment for committing both the money laundering offense and the underlying offense, and (2) reflect the differing seriousness of money laundering conduct depending on the nature and sophistication of the offense. Specifically, subsection (b)(2)(A) provides a one-level increase if the defendant was convicted under 18 U.S.C. § 1957, and subsection (b)(2)(B) provides a two-level increase if the defendant was convicted under 18 U.S.C. § 1956. The one-level difference between these two enhancements reflects the fact that 18 U.S.C. § 1956 has a statutory maximum penalty (20 years’ imprisonment) that is twice as long as the statutory maximum penalty for violations of 18 U.S.C. § 1957 (10 years’ imprisonment). In addition, subsection (b)(3) provides an additional two-level increase if subsection (b)(2)(B) applies and the offense involved sophisticated laundering such as the use of fictitious entities, shell corporations, two or more levels of transactions, or offshore financial accounts. The Commission determined that, similar to fraud and tax offenses that involve sophisticated means, <em>see</em> subsection (b)(8) of §2B1.1 (Theft, Property Destruction, and Fraud), subsection (b)(2) of §2T1.1 (Tax Evasion; Willful Failure to File Return, Supply Information, or Pay Tax; Fraudulent or False Returns, Statements, or Other Documents), violations of 18 U.S.C. § 1956 that involve sophisticated laundering warrant additional punishment because such offenses are more difficult and time consuming for law enforcement to detect than less sophisticated laundering. As a result of the enhancements provided by subsections (b)(2)(A), (b)(2)(B), and (b)(3), all direct money launderers will receive an offense level that is one to four levels greater than the Chapter Two offense level for the underlying offense, depending on the statute of conviction and sophistication of the money laundering offense conduct.</p>
<p>With respect to third party money launderers, subsection (b)(2)(C) provides a four-level enhancement if the defendant is &quot;in the business&quot; of laundering funds. The Commission determined that, similar to a professional &quot;fence&quot;, <em>see</em> §2B1.1(b)(4)(B), defendants who routinely engage in laundering funds on behalf of others, and who gain financially from engaging in such transactions, warrant substantial additional punishment because they encourage the commission of additional criminal conduct.</p>
<p>Fourth, this amendment contains an application note expressly providing instructions regarding the grouping of money laundering counts with a count of conviction for the underlying offense. In a case in which the defendant is to be sentenced on a count of conviction for money laundering and a count of conviction for the underlying offense that generated the laundered funds, this application note instructs that such counts shall be grouped pursuant to subsection (c) of §3D1.2 (Groups of Closely-Related Counts), thereby resolving a circuit conflict on this issue. <em>Compare</em> <em>United States v. Cusumano</em>, 943 F.2d 305 (3d Cir. 1991), <em>cert. denied</em>, 502 U.S. 1036 (1992) (affirming decision to group under §3D1.2(b) money laundering count with other offenses that &quot;were all part of one scheme to obtain money&quot; from an employee benefit fund); <em>United States v. Leonard</em>, 61 F.3d 1181 (5th Cir. 1995) (affirming decision to group fraud and money laundering offenses under §3D1.2(d) because defendant’s money laundering activity and fraudulent telemarketing scheme constituted the same common plan and had the same victims); and <em>United States v. Wilson</em>, 98 F.3d 281 (7th Cir. 1996) (district court erred in not grouping money laundering and mail fraud convictions under §3D1.2(d)), <em>with</em> <em>United States v. Kneeland</em>, 148 F.3d 6 (1st Cir. 1998) (affirming district court decision not to group fraud and money laundering counts under §3D1.2(d) because the offense level for fraud, unlike money laundering, is determined &quot;largely on the basis of total amount of harm or loss&quot;); <em>United States v. Napoli</em>, 179 F.3d 1 (2d Cir. 1999), <em>cert. denied</em>, 528 U.S. 1162 (2000) (affirming decision not to group wire fraud and money laundering counts under §3D1.2(b) or (d) because the offenses have different victims and the offense level for money laundering, unlike fraud, is not based primarily on the amount of money involved); <em>United States v. Hildebrand</em>, 152 F.3d 756 (8th Cir.), <em>cert. denied</em>, 525 U.S. 1033 (1998) (finding that money laundering and fraud counts should not be grouped because the fraud and money laundering guidelines do not measure the same types of harm); <em>United States v. Hanley</em>, 190 F.3d 1017 (9th Cir. 1999) (affirming decision not to group money laundering and wire fraud counts under §3D1.2(d) because the guidelines for such offenses measure harm differently); and <em>United States v. Johnson</em>, 971 F.2d 562 (10th Cir. 1992) (district court erred in grouping money laundering and fraud counts under §3D1.2(d) because the measurement of harm for fraud is not the same as that for money laundering).</p>
<p>Finally, this amendment provides that convictions under 18 U.S.C. § 1960 are referenced to §2S1.3 (Structuring Transactions to Evade Reporting Requirements). Operation of money transmitting businesses without an appropriate license is proscribed by 18 U.S.C. § 1960, as are failures to comply with certain reporting requirements issued under 31 U.S.C. § 5330. The Commission determined that offenses involving these regulatory requirements serve many of the same purposes as Currency Transaction Reports, Currency and Monetary Instrument Reports, Reports of Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts, and Reports of Cash Payments over $10,000 Received in a Trade or Business, violations regarding which currently are referenced to §2S1.3, and that, therefore, violations of 18 U.S.C. § 1960 also should be referenced to §2S1.3.</p>
<p><strong>Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2001.</strong></p>
</blockquote>"},
{id: 635, content:"<p><strong>635.</strong> <strong>Amendment:</strong> The Commentary to §3B1.2 is amended by striking Notes 1 through 4 and the background as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;1. Subsection (a) applies to a defendant who plays a minimal role in concerted activity. It is intended to cover defendants who are plainly among the least culpable of those involved in the conduct of a group. Under this provision, the defendant’s lack of knowledge or understanding of the scope and structure of the enterprise and of the activities of others is indicative of a role as minimal participant.</p>
<p>2. It is intended that the downward adjustment for a minimal participant will be used infrequently. It would be appropriate, for example, for someone who played no other role in a very large drug smuggling operation than to offload part of a single marihuana shipment, or in a case where an individual was recruited as a courier for a single smuggling transaction involving a small amount of drugs.</p>
<p>3. For purposes of §3B1.2(b), a minor participant means any participant who is less culpable than most other participants, but whose role could not be described as minimal.</p>
<p>4. If a defendant has received a lower offense level by virtue of being convicted of an offense significantly less serious than warranted by his actual criminal conduct, a reduction for a mitigating role under this section ordinarily is not warranted because such defendant is not substantially less culpable than a defendant whose only conduct involved the less serious offense. For example, if a defendant whose actual conduct involved a minimal role in the distribution of 25 grams of cocaine (an offense having a Chapter Two offense level of 14 under §2D1.1) is convicted of simple possession of cocaine (an offense having a Chapter Two offense level of 6 under §2D2.1), no reduction for a mitigating role is warranted because the defendant is not substantially less culpable than a defendant whose only conduct involved the simple possession of cocaine.</p>
<p><em>Background</em>: This section provides a range of adjustments for a defendant who plays a part in committing the offense that makes him substantially less culpable than the average participant. The determination whether to apply subsection (a) or subsection (b), or an intermediate adjustment, involves a determination that is heavily dependent upon the facts of the particular case.&quot;,</p>
<p>and inserting the following:</p>
<p>&quot;1. <em>Definition</em>.—For purposes of this guideline, ‘participant’ has the meaning given that term in Application Note 1 of §3B1.1 (Aggravating Role).</p>
<p>2. <em>Requirement of Multiple Participants</em>.—This guideline is not applicable unless more than one participant was involved in the offense. <em>See</em> the Introductory Commentary to this Part (Role in the Offense). Accordingly, an adjustment under this guideline may not apply to a defendant who is the only defendant convicted of an offense unless that offense involved other participants in addition to the defendant and the defendant otherwise qualifies for such an adjustment.</p>
<p>3. <em>Applicability of Adjustment</em>.—</p>
<p>(A) <em>Substantially Less Culpable than Average Participant</em>.—This section provides a range of adjustments for a defendant who plays a part in committing the offense that makes him substantially less culpable than the average participant.</p>
<p>A defendant who is accountable under §1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct) only for the conduct in which the defendant personally was involved and who performs a limited function in concerted criminal activity is not precluded from consideration for an adjustment under this guideline. For example, a defendant who is convicted of a drug trafficking offense, whose role in that offense was limited to transporting or storing drugs and who is accountable under §1B1.3 only for the quantity of drugs the defendant personally transported or stored is not precluded from consideration for an adjustment under this guideline.</p>
<p>(B) <em>Conviction of Significantly Less Serious Offense</em>.—If a defendant has received a lower offense level by virtue of being convicted of an offense significantly less serious than warranted by his actual criminal conduct, a reduction for a mitigating role under this section ordinarily is not warranted because such defendant is not substantially less culpable than a defendant whose only conduct involved the less serious offense. For example, if a defendant whose actual conduct involved a minimal role in the distribution of 25 grams of cocaine (an offense having a Chapter Two offense level of level 14 under §2D1.1 (Unlawful Manufacturing, Importing, Exporting, or Trafficking (Including Possession with Intent to Commit These Offenses); Attempt or Conspiracy)) is convicted of simple possession of cocaine (an offense having a Chapter Two offense level of level 6 under §2D2.1 (Unlawful Possession; Attempt or Conspiracy)), no reduction for a mitigating role is warranted because the defendant is not substantially less culpable than a defendant whose only conduct involved the simple possession of cocaine.</p>
<p>(C) <em>Fact-Based Determination</em>.—The determination whether to apply subsection (a) or subsection (b), or an intermediate adjustment, involves a determination that is heavily dependent upon the facts of the particular case. As with any other factual issue, the court, in weighing the totality of the circumstances, is not required to find, based solely on the defendant’s bare assertion, that such a role adjustment is warranted.</p>
<p>4. <em>Minimal Participant</em>.—Subsection (a) applies to a defendant described in Application Note 3(A) who plays a minimal role in concerted activity. It is intended to cover defendants who are plainly among the least culpable of those involved in the conduct of a group. Under this provision, the defendant’s lack of knowledge or understanding of the scope and structure of the enterprise and of the activities of others is indicative of a role as minimal participant. It is intended that the downward adjustment for a minimal participant will be used infrequently.</p>
<p>5. <em>Minor Participant</em>.— Subsection (b) applies to a defendant described in Application Note 3(A) who is less culpable than most other participants, but whose role could not be described as minimal.&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This amendment resolves a circuit conflict regarding whether a defendant who is accountable under §1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct) only for conduct in which the defendant personally was involved, and who performs a limited function in concerted criminal activity, is precluded from consideration for an adjustment under §3B1.2 (Mitigating Role). <em>Compare</em> <em>United States v. Burnett</em>, 66 F.3d 137 (7th Cir. 1995) (&quot;where a defendant is sentenced only for the amount of drugs he handled, he is not entitled to a §3B1.2 reduction&quot;), <em>with</em> <em>United States v. Rodriguez De Varon</em>, 175 F.3d 930 (11th Cir. 1999) (a defendant is not automatically precluded from consideration for a mitigating role adjustment in a case in which the defendant is held accountable solely for the amount of drugs he personally handled). Although this circuit conflict arose in the context of a drug offense, the amendment resolves it in a manner that makes the rule applicable to all types of offenses.</p>
<p>The amendment adopts the approach articulated by the Eleventh Circuit in <em>United States v. Rodriguez De Varon</em>, <em>supra</em>, that §3B1.2 does not automatically preclude a defendant from being considered for a mitigating role adjustment in a case in which the defendant is held accountable under §1B1.3 solely for the amount of drugs the defendant personally handled. In considering a §3B1.2 adjustment, a court must measure the defendant’s role against the relevant conduct for which the defendant is held accountable at sentencing, whether or not other defendants are charged.</p>
<p>In contrast to the holding in <em>United States v. Burnett</em>, <em>supra</em>, this amendment allows the court to apply traditional analysis on the applicability of a reduction pursuant to §3B1.2, even in a case in which a defendant is held liable under §1B1.3 only for conduct (such as drug quantities) in which the defendant was involved personally.</p>
<p>The substantive impact of this amendment in resolving the circuit conflict is to provide, in the context of a drug courier, for example, that the court is not precluded from considering a §3B1.2 adjustment simply because the defendant’s role in the offense was limited to transporting or storing drugs, and the defendant was accountable under §1B1.3 only for the quantity of drugs the defendant personally transported or stored. The amendment does not require that such a defendant receive a reduction under §3B1.2, or suggest that such a defendant can receive a reduction based only on those facts; rather, the amendment provides only that such a defendant is not precluded from consideration for such a reduction if the defendant otherwise qualifies for the reduction pursuant to the terms of §3B1.2.</p>
<p>In addition to resolving the circuit conflict, the amendment makes the following non-substantive revisions to §3B1.2 to clarify guideline application: (1) incorporating commentary from the Introduction to Chapter Three, Part B (Role in the Offense) that there must be more than one participant before application of a mitigating role adjustment may be considered; (2) incorporating into this guideline the definition of &quot;participant&quot; from §3B1.1 (Aggravating Role); (3) moving into an application note significant background commentary that has been cited frequently in appellate decisions; (4) adding a section on fact-based determinations to Application Note 3 that emphasizes the significant judicial role in decision-making on the applicability of §3B1.2; (5) maintaining commentary language that the minimal role adjustment is intended to be used infrequently; and (6) making technical amendments to the Commentary to clarify applicable rules (such as the addition of headings for, and the reordering of, application notes in the commentary) that are intended to have no substantive impact.</p>
<p>The language regarding &quot;average participant&quot; is moved from the Background into Application Note 3(A) to provide guidance as to the applicability of §3B1.2. For a reduction to apply, the court, at a minimum, must make a factual determination that the defendant’s role was significantly less culpable than the average participant.</p>

<p>&quot;1. <em>‘Federal Crime of Terrorism’ Defined</em>.—For purposes of this guideline, ‘federal crime of terrorism’ has the meaning given that term in 18 U.S.C. § 2332b(g)(5).&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §3A1.4 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended by redesignating Note 2 as Note 3; and by inserting after Note 1 the following:</p>

<p>&quot;4. <em>Upward Departure Provision</em>.—By the terms of the directive to the Commission in section 730 of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, the adjustment provided by this guideline applies only to federal crimes of terrorism. However, there may be cases in which (A) the offense was calculated to influence or affect the conduct of government by intimidation or coercion, or to retaliate against government conduct but the offense involved, or was intended to promote, an offense other than one of the offenses specifically enumerated in 18 U.S.C. § 2332b(g)(5)(B); or (B) the offense involved, or was intended to promote, one of the offenses specifically enumerated in 18 U.S.C. § 2332b(g)(5)(B), but the terrorist motive was to intimidate or coerce a civilian population, rather than to influence or affect the conduct of government by intimidation or coercion, or to retaliate against government conduct. In such cases an upward departure would be warranted, except that the sentence resulting from such a departure may not exceed the top of the guideline range that would have resulted if the adjustment under this guideline had been applied.&quot;.</p>

<p>49 U.S.C. § 60123(b) 2B1.1, 2K1.4, 2M2.1, 2M2.3&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This amendment is a six-part amendment that responds to the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism (USA PATRIOT Act) Act of 2001, Pub. L. 107–56 (the &quot;Act&quot;).</p>
<p>Among its many provisions are appropriately severe penalties for offenses against mass transportation systems and interstate gas or hazardous liquid pipelines. The amendment also increases sentences for threats that substantially disrupt governmental or business operations or result in costly cleanup measures. It expands the guideline coverage of offenses involving bioterrorism, and it creates a new guideline for providing material support to foreign terrorist organizations. It punishes attempts and conspiracies to commit terrorism as if the offense had been carried out and adds an invited upward departure to the guidelines’ terrorism enhancement for appropriate cases. Finally, it authorizes a term of supervised release up to life for a defendant convicted of a federal crime of terrorism that resulted in substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury to another person.</p>
<p>First, this amendment makes a number of changes to Appendix A (Statutory Index) and several guidelines in Chapter Two (Offense Conduct) in order to incorporate several new predicate offenses to federal crimes of terrorism. This amendment addresses section 801 of the Act, which added 18 U.S.C. § 1993, generally pertaining to offenses against mass transportation systems and facilities. The amendment also addresses 49 U.S.C. § 46507 pertaining to false information and threats, that heretofore was not listed in the Statutory Index, as well as the new offense at 49 U.S.C. § 46503, pertaining to interference with security screening personnel.</p>
<p>Specifically, the amendment makes a number of changes to §2A5.2 (Interference with Flight Crew Member or Flight Attendant) and the guidelines in Chapter Two, Part A, Subpart 2 (Assault). First, this amendment references violations of 18 U.S.C. § 1993(a)(4), (a)(5), (a)(6), and (b) and 49 U.S.C. § 46503 to §2A5.2 because that guideline presently covers other similar offenses and because the guideline’s alternative base offense levels cover offenses that involve reckless or intentional endangerment, conduct which is an element of some of these new offenses.</p>
<p>In order to take into account aggravating conduct which may occur in such offenses, the amendment adds a specific offense characteristic for use of a weapon, borrowing language from §2A2.2 (Aggravated Assault). The specific offense characteristic provides a graduated enhancement with a minimum offense level of level 24 at §2A5.2(b)(1) for the involvement of a dangerous weapon in the offense. This enhancement addresses concerns that the current base offense level of level 18 (in §2A5.2(a)(2)) for reckless endangerment may be inadequate in situations involving a dangerous weapon and reckless disregard for the safety of human life. The minimum offense level of level 24 mirrors the offense level that applies for conduct amounting to reckless endangerment under subsection (b)(1) of §2K1.5 (Possessing Dangerous Weapons or Materials While Boarding or Aboard an Aircraft). A cross reference to the appropriate homicide guideline also is provided for offenses in which death results; death as an aggravating circumstance is included in 18 U.S.C. § 1993(b).</p>
<p>The amendment also amends §2A6.1 (Threatening or Harassing Communications) to incorporate offenses against mass transportation systems under 18 U.S.C. § 1993(a)(7) and (a)(8) and 49 U.S.C. § 46507 and provides corresponding references in the Statutory Index. These three provisions require the same type of threatening conduct or conveyance of false information as two other offenses referenced to §2A6.1, specifically 18 U.S.C. §§ 32(c) and 35(b), which cover aircraft, railroads, and shipping, rather than mass transportation systems. Additionally, a specific offense characteristic is added if the offense resulted in a substantial disruption of public, governmental, or business functions or services, or a substantial expenditure of funds to clean up, decontaminate, or otherwise respond to the offense. This enhancement recognizes that a terrorist threat usually will be directed at a large number of individuals, governmental buildings or operations, or infrastructure. Unless such a terrorist threat is immediately dismissed as not credible, the conduct may result in significant disruption and response costs. This specific offense characteristic is the same as that contained in subsection (b)(3) of §2M6.1 (Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical Weapons, and Other Weapons of Mass Destruction). An invited upward departure provision is added for situations in which the offense involved multiple victims, a circumstance which might occur in the context of these new offenses.</p>
<p>This amendment also amends §2K1.4 (Arson; Property Damage by Use of Explosives) and §2B1.1 (Theft, Property Destruction, and Fraud) to cover violations of 18 U.S.C. § 1993(a)(1) and (b). Offenses under 18 U.S.C. § 1993(a)(1) are similar to another offense referenced to these guidelines, 18 U.S.C. § 32(a)(1), with respect to the intent standard required to commit the offense, offense conduct, and resulting harm. The amendment references violations of 18 U.S.C. § 1993(a)(2), (a)(3), and (b) to §§2K1.4 and 2M6.1. These offenses encompass a wide range of conduct. For example, a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1993(a)(3) may occur if the defendant sets fire to a garage or places a biological agent or toxin for use as a destructive substance near an aircraft and this likely endangered the safety of that aircraft.</p>
<p>The amendment expands §2M6.1 to cover 18 U.S.C. §§ 175(b) and 175b, two new offenses created by section 817 of the Act, involving possession of biological agents, toxins, and delivery systems. Section 2M6.1 is the most appropriate guideline for these offenses because they involve the knowing possession of certain biological substances. A base offense level of level 20 is provided for 18 U.S.C. § 175(b) offenses, the same base offense level as is currently provided for threat cases under that guideline. The current two level increase for particularly dangerous biological agents would be available for the most serious substances.</p>
<p>A base offense level of level 22 is provided for offenses under 18 U.S.C. § 175b, which forbids certain restricted persons (defined in the statute) to ship or transport in interstate or foreign commerce, or possess in or affecting commerce, any biological agent or toxin, or to receive any biological agent or toxin that has been shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce, if the biological agent or toxin is listed as a select agent (<em>e.g.</em>, ebola, anthrax). Because this offense already takes into account the serious nature of a select agent, the amendment treats these offenses separately from offenses under 18 U.S.C. § 175(b), with a higher base offense level and an instruction that the enhancement for select biological agents does not apply.</p>
<p>The amendment also amends the Statutory Index to reference 18 U.S.C. § 2339 to §§2X2.1 (Aiding and Abetting) and 2X3.1 (Accessory After the Fact). This offense prohibits harboring or concealing any person who the defendant knows, or has reasonable grounds to believe, has committed or is about to commit, one of several enumerated offenses.</p>
<p>Second, this amendment provides Statutory Index references, as well as modifications to various Chapter Two guidelines, for a number of offenses that, prior to enactment of the Act, were enumerated in 18 U.S.C. § 2332b(g)(5) as predicate offenses for federal crimes of terrorism but were not explicitly incorporated in the guidelines.</p>
<p>Specifically, the amendment references 18 U.S.C. § 2332b(a)(1) offenses to §§2A1.1 (First Degree Murder), 2A1.2 (Second Degree Murder), 2A1.3 (Voluntary Manslaughter), 2A1.4 (Involuntary Manslaughter), 2A2.1 (Assault with Intent to Commit Murder; Attempted Murder), 2A2.2 (Aggravated Assault), and 2A4.1 (Kidnapping, Abduction, Unlawful Restraint), inasmuch as 18 U.S.C. § 2332b offenses are analogous to offenses currently referenced to those guidelines.</p>
<p>The amendment also provides a Statutory Index reference to §2A6.1 (Threatening or Harassing Communications) for cases under 18 U.S.C. § 2332b(a)(2), which prohibits threats, attempts and conspiracies to commit an offense under 18 U.S.C. § 2332b(a)(1).</p>
<p>This amendment also creates a new guideline, at §2M5.3 (Providing Material Support or Resources to Designated Foreign Terrorist Organizations), for offenses under 18 U.S.C. § 2339B, which prohibits the provision of material support or resources to a foreign terrorist organization. The amendment references offenses under 18 U.S.C. § 2339A to §§2X2.1 and 2X3.1. Section 2339A offenses concern providing material support to terrorists that the defendant knows or intends will be used in preparation for, or in carrying out, certain specified predicate offenses. Thus, the essence of 18 U.S.C. § 2339A offenses is akin to aiding and abetting or accessory after the fact offenses, which warrants reference to §§2X2.1 and 2X3.1. In contrast, 18 U.S.C. § 2339B offenses are referenced to a new guideline, §2M5.3, primarily because they are not statutorily linked to the commission of any specified predicate offenses. To account for the variety of ways in which such offenses may be committed, the new guideline provides two specific offense characteristics that enhance the sentence for cases in which the material support involved dangerous weapons and in which the material support involved nuclear, biological, or chemical weapons.</p>
<p>The amendment references torture offenses under 18 U.S.C. § 2340A to §§2A1.1, 2A1.2, 2A2.1, 2A2.2, and 2A4.1. The amendment also references 49 U.S.C. § 60123(b), pertaining to damaging or destroying an interstate gas or hazardous liquid pipeline facility, to §§2B1.1, 2K1.4, 2M2.1 (Destruction of, or Production of Defective, War Material, Premises, or Utilities), and 2M2.3 (Destruction of, or Production of Defective, National Defense Material, Premises, or Utilities).</p>
<p>Third, the amendment responds to section 811 of the Act, which amended a number of offenses to ensure that attempts and conspiracies to commit any of those offenses subject the offender to the same penalties prescribed for the object offense. This amendment provides a special instruction in §2X1.1 (Attempt, Solicitation, or Conspiracy) that the three level reduction in §2X1.1(b) does not apply to these offenses when committed for a terrorist objective.</p>
<p>Fourth, the amendment adds an encouraged, structured upward departure in §3A1.4 (Terrorism) for offenses that involve terrorism but do not otherwise qualify as offenses that involved or were intended to promote &quot;federal crimes of terrorism&quot; for purposes of the terrorism adjustment in §3A1.4. The amendment provides an upward departure, rather than a specified guideline adjustment, because of the expected infrequency of these terrorism offenses and to provide the court with a viable tool to account for the harm involved during the commission of these offenses on a case-by-case basis. In addition, the structured upward departure provision makes it possible to impose punishment equal in severity to that which would be imposed if the §3A1.4 adjustment actually applied.</p>
<p>The amendment adds an application note to §3A1.4 regarding harboring and concealing offenses to clarify that §3A1.4 may apply in the case of offenses that occurred after the commission of the federal crime of terrorism (<em>e.g.</em>, a case in which the defendant, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2339A, concealed an individual who had committed a federal crime of terrorism).</p>
<p>Fifth, the amendment amends §2S1.3 (Structuring Transactions to Evade Reporting Requirements; Failure to Report Cash or Monetary Transactions; Failure to File Currency and Monetary Instrument Report; Knowingly Filing False Reports) to incorporate new money laundering provisions created by the Act.</p>
<p>Specifically, the amendment provides an alternative base offense level of level 8 in §2S1.3(a) in order to incorporate offenses under 31 U.S.C. §§ 5318 and 5318A. The base offense level of level 8 recognizes the heightened due diligence requirements placed on financial institutions with respect to payable-through accounts, correspondent accounts, and shell banks.</p>
<p>The amendment also amends §2S1.3(b)(1), relating to the promotion of unlawful activity, to provide an alternative prong if the offense involved bulk cash smuggling. This amendment addresses 31 U.S.C. § 5332, added by section 371 of the Act, which prohibits concealing, with intent to evade a currency reporting requirement under 31 U.S.C. § 5316, more than $10,000 in currency or other monetary instruments and transporting or transferring such currency or monetary instruments into or outside of the United States. Findings set forth in that section of the Act indicate that bulk cash smuggling typically involves the promotion of unlawful activity.</p>
<p>The amendment also provides an enhancement in §2S1.3(b) to give effect to the enhanced penalty provisions under 31 U.S.C. § 5322(b) for offenses under subchapter II of chapter 53 of title 31, United Stated Code, if such offenses were committed as part of a pattern of unlawful activity involving more than $100,000 in a 12-month period.</p>
<p>Sixth, the amendment addresses a number of miscellaneous issues related to terrorism. Specifically, it provides a definition of terrorism for purposes of the prior conviction enhancement in §2L1.2 (Unlawfully Entering or Remaining in the United States). For consistency, the definition is the same as that found in the current Chapter Three terrorism adjustment.</p>
<p>It also amends §3C1.1 (Obstructing or Impeding the Administration of Justice), in response to section 319(d) of the Act, which amends the Controlled Substances Act at 21 U.S.C. § 853(e) to require a defendant to repatriate any property that may be seized and forfeited and to deposit that property in the registry of the court or with the United States Marshals Service or the Secretary of the Treasury. Section 319(d) of the Act also states that the failure to comply with a protective order and an order to repatriate property &quot;may also result in an enhancement of the sentence of the defendant under the obstruction of justice provision of the Federal Sentencing Guidelines.&quot; Accordingly, the amendment adds Application Note 4(j) to §3C1.1 to provide that failure to comply with an order issued pursuant to 21 U.S.C. § 835(e) is an example of the types of conduct to which the adjustment applies.</p>
<p>It also amends §5D1.2 (Term of Supervised Release), in response to section 812 of the Act, which authorizes a term of supervised release of any term of years or life for a defendant convicted of a federal crime of terrorism the commission of which resulted in, or created a foreseeable risk of, death or serious bodily injury to another person.</p>
<p>It also amends §2B1.1 to delete the special instruction pertaining to the imposition of not less than six months’ imprisonment for a defendant convicted under 18 U.S.C. § 1030(a)(4) or (5). This amendment is in response to section 814(f) of the Act, which directed the Commission to amend the guidelines &quot;to ensure that any individual convicted of a violation of section 1030 of title 18, United States Code, can be subjected to appropriate penalties, without regard to any mandatory minimum term of imprisonment.&quot;</p>
<p>It also adds a reference in the Statutory Index to §2C1.1 (Offering, Giving, Soliciting, or Receiving a Bribe; Extortion Under Color of Official Right), for the new offense created by section 329 of the Act, which prohibits a federal official or employee, in connection with administration of the money laundering provisions of the Act, to corruptly demand, seek, receive, accept, or agree to receive or accept anything of value in return for being influenced in the performance of an official act, being influenced to commit or aid in committing any fraud on the United States, or being induced to do or omit to do any act in violation of official duties.</p>
<p>It also amends §2M5.1 (Evasion of Export Controls) to incorporate 18 U.S.C. § 2332d, which prohibits a United States person, knowing or having reasonable cause to know that a country is designated under the Export Administration Act as a country supporting international terrorism, to engage in a financial transaction with the government of that country. The amendment provides a base offense level of level 26 for these offenses.</p>
<p>Finally, it amends §2B2.3 (Trespass) to incorporate the offense under 18 U.S.C. § 1036. That offense, added by section 2 of the Enhanced Federal Security Act of 2000, Pub. L. 106–547, prohibits, by fraud or pretense, the entering or attempting to enter any real property, vessel, or aircraft of the United States, or secure area of an airport. The amendment amends the existing two level enhancement in §2B2.3(b)(1) to provide an additional ground for application of the enhancement if the trespass involved a vessel, aircraft of the United States, or secure area of an airport. It also adds a cross reference to §2X1.1 if the offense involved the intent to commit another felony.</p>

<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This amendment provides a new guideline at §2B1.5 (Theft of, Damage to, Destruction of, Cultural Heritage Resources; Unlawful Sale, Purchase, Exchange, Transportation, or Receipt of Cultural Heritage Resources) for offenses involving cultural heritage resources. This amendment reflects the Commission’s conclusion that the existing sentencing guidelines for economic and property destruction crimes are inadequate to punish in an appropriate and proportional way the variety of federal crimes involving the theft of, damage to, destruction of, or illicit trafficking in, cultural heritage resources. The Commission has determined that a separate guideline, which specifically recognizes both the federal government’s long-standing obligation and role in preserving such resources, and the harm caused to both the nation and its inhabitants when its history is degraded through the destruction of cultural heritage resources, is needed.</p>
<p>Cultural heritage resources include national memorials, landmarks, parks, archaeological and other historic and cultural resources, specifically designated by Congress and the President for the preservation of the cultural heritage of this nation and its ancestors. The federal government acts either as a trustee for the public generally, or as a fiduciary on behalf of American Indians, Alaska Natives and Native Hawaiian Organizations, to protect these cultural heritage resources. Because individuals, communities, and nations identify themselves through intellectual, emotional, and spiritual connections to places and objects, the effects of cultural heritage resource crimes transcend mere monetary considerations. Accordingly, this new guideline takes into account the transcendent and irreplaceable value of cultural heritage resources and punishes in a proportionate way the aggravating conduct associated with cultural heritage resource crimes.</p>
<p>This guideline incorporates into the definition of &quot;cultural heritage resource&quot; a broad range of existing federal statutory definitions for various historical, cultural, and archaeological items. If a defendant is convicted of an offense that charges illegal conduct involving a cultural heritage resource, this guideline will apply, irrespective of whether the conviction is obtained under general property theft or damage statutes, such as laws concerning the theft and destruction of government property, 18 U.S.C. § 641, interstate sale or receipt of stolen property, 18 U.S.C. §§ 2314-15, and smuggling, 18 U.S.C. §§ 541 et seq., or under specific cultural heritage statutes, such as the Archaeological Resources Protection Act of 1979, 16 U.S.C. § 470ee (ARPA), the criminal provisions of the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA) at 18 U.S.C. § 1170, and 18 U.S.C. § 668, which concerns theft from museums. In addition, if a more general offense is charged that is referenced in Appendix A to §2B1.1 (Theft, Property Destruction, and Fraud), this guideline will apply by cross reference if the offense conduct involves a cultural heritage resource and results in a higher offense level.</p>
<p>This new guideline has a base offense level of level 8, which is two levels higher than the base offense level for general economic and property destruction crimes. The higher base offense level represents the Commission’s determination that offenses involving cultural heritage resources are more serious because they involve essentially irreplaceable resources and cause intangible harm to society.</p>
<p>The new guideline also provides that the monetary value of the cultural heritage resource is an important, although not the sole, factor in determining the appropriate punishment. The Commission has elected not to use the concept of &quot;loss,&quot; which is an integral part of the theft, fraud, and property destruction guideline at §2B1.1, because cultural heritage offenses do not involve the same fungible and compensatory values embodied in &quot;loss.&quot; Instead, under this new guideline, value is to be based on commercial value, archaeological value, and the cost of restoration and repair. These methods of valuation are derived from existing federal law. <em>See</em> 16 U.S.C. § 470ee(d); 43 C.F.R. § 7.14.</p>
<p>The Commission has recognized that archaeological value shall be used in calculating the value of archaeological resources but has provided flexibility for the sentencing court to determine whether either commercial value or the cost of restoration and repair, or both, should be added to archaeological value in determining the appropriate value of archaeological resources. For all other types of cultural heritage resources covered by this guideline, the Commission has provided flexibility for the sentencing court regarding whether and when to use all or some of the methods of valuation, as appropriate, for calculating the total value associated with the harm to the particular resource caused by the defendant’s offense conduct. The value of the cultural heritage resource is then referenced to the monetary table provided at §2B1.1(b)(1) in order to determine appropriate and proportionate offense levels in a manner consistent with the overall guidelines structure.</p>
<p>The new guideline provides five additional specific offense characteristics to provide proportionate enhancements for aggravating conduct that may occur in connection with cultural heritage resource offenses. In providing enhancements for these non-pecuniary aggravating factors, the Commission seeks to ensure that the nonquantifiable harm caused by the offense to affected cultural groups, and society as a whole, is adequately reflected in the penalty structure.</p>
<p>The first two of these enhancements, at subsections (b)(2) and (b)(3), relate to whether the offense involves a place or resource that Congress has designated for special protection. A two level enhancement attaches if the offense involves a resource from one of eight locations specifically designated by Congress for historic commemoration, resource preservation, or public education. These are the national park system, national historic landmarks, national monuments, national memorials, national marine sanctuaries, national cemeteries, sites contained on the World Heritage List, and museums.</p>
<p>Consistent with the definition in 18 U.S.C. § 668(a)(1), museums are defined broadly to include all organized and permanent institutions, with an essentially educational or aesthetic purpose, which exhibit tangible objects to the public on a regular schedule. Adoption of this definition reflects the Commission’s recognition that cultural heritage resource crimes affecting institutions dedicated to the preservation of resources and associated knowledge, irrespective of the institution’s size, ownership, or funding, deprive the public and future generations of the opportunity to learn and appreciate the richness of the nation’s heritage. Similarly, this enhancement reflects the Commission’s assessment that damage to the other listed places degrades not only the resource itself but also the historical and cultural aspects which the resource commemorates.</p>
<p>An additional two level enhancement attaches to offense conduct that involves any of a number of specified resources, including human remains and other resources that have been designated by Congress for special treatment and heightened protection under federal law. Funerary objects, items of cultural patrimony, and sacred objects are included because they are domestic cultural heritage resources protected under NAGPRA. <em>See</em> 25 U.S.C. § 3001. Cultural property, designated archaeological and ethnological material, and pre-Columbian monumental and architectural sculpture and murals are included in the enhancement because these are cultural heritage resources of foreign provenance for which Congress has chosen, in the implementation of international treaties and bilateral agreements, to impose import restrictions. <em>See</em> 19 U.S.C. §§ 2092, 2606, and 2607.</p>
<p>This guideline also provides a two level enhancement at subsection (b)(4) if the offense was committed for pecuniary gain or otherwise involved a commercial purpose. This increase is based on a determination that offenders who are motivated by financial gain or other commercial incentive are more culpable than offenders who are motivated solely by their personal interest in possessing cultural heritage resources. Those motivated by financial gain contribute to illicit trafficking and support dealers and brokers who earn a livelihood from illegal activities. Mindful of INTERPOL’s findings, as reported by the Department of Justice, that the annual dollar value of art and cultural property theft is exceeded only by trafficking in illicit narcotics, money laundering, and arms trafficking, the Commission seeks to ensure that the penalty structure adequately accounts for these increased harms.</p>
<p>This guideline also provides a two level enhancement at subsection (b)(5) if the offense involves a pattern of misconduct, and provides a definition of &quot;pattern of misconduct&quot; that is designed to interact with other requirements of the guidelines regarding relevant conduct and criminal history. &quot;Pattern of misconduct&quot; is defined as &quot;two or more separate instances of offense conduct involving cultural heritage resources that did not occur during the course of the instant offense (<em>i.e</em>., that did not occur during the offense of conviction and all relevant conduct under §1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct))&quot;. Accordingly, under this guideline, separate instances of offense conduct need not result in a criminal conviction or legal adjudication in order for this enhancement to apply. Separate instances of offense conduct involving cultural heritage resources that are included in the defendant’s criminal history may also form the factual basis for the application of this enhancement. The Commission considers such increased punishment to be appropriate for offenders who repeatedly disregard cultural heritage resource laws and regulations and the social values underlying them. These repeat offenders cause serious harm, not only to the resources themselves, but to the nation and the individuals who treasure them.</p>
<p>This guideline also provides at subsection (b)(6) a two level enhancement and a minimum offense level of level 14 if a dangerous weapon, including a firearm, is brandished or its use threatened. This enhancement reflects the increased culpability of offenders who pose a threat to law enforcement officers and innocent passersby. Recognizing that there are legitimate uses in remote expanses of tribal and federal land for certain tools and firearms that may otherwise qualify as &quot;dangerous weapons&quot; under the guideline definitions, the Commission has limited the scope of this enhancement by requiring that the dangerous weapon or firearm be brandished or its use threatened, in order for increased punishment to attach under this provision.</p>
<p>In light of the increased potential for the symbols of our nation’s heritage and culture to be targets of violent individuals, including terrorists, the Commission also has provided for increased punishment through a cross reference to §2K1.4 (Arson; Property Damage by Use of Explosives), if the offense involved arson or property damage by the use of any explosive, explosive material, or destructive devices, when the resulting offense level is greater under §2K1.4 than the offense level under this guideline.</p>
<p>This guideline also includes a special rule in the Commentary to address multiple counts of cultural heritage resource offenses, as well as multiple counts of conviction involving offenses under this and other guidelines. Consistent with the principles underlying the rules for grouping multiple counts of conviction in §3D1.2 (Groups of Closely Related Counts) and the unique concerns sought to be addressed by this amendment, the new guideline provides that multiple counts of cultural heritage resource offenses are to be grouped under §3D1.2(d). However, because the monetary harm is measured differently, a count of conviction for an offense sentenced under §2B1.5 may not be grouped under this provision with a conviction for an offense sentenced under a different guideline.</p>
<p>This guideline also invites an upward departure if the determined offense level substantially understates the seriousness of the cultural heritage resource offense. Two illustrations of such situations are given. Finally, this amendment provides a cross reference within §2B1.1. Theft, fraud, and property destruction offenses which also involve cultural heritage resources are cross referenced to the new guideline at §2B1.5 if the resulting offense level under it would be greater than under §2B1.1. When a case involving a cultural heritage resource is sentenced under §2B1.1, loss attributable to that cultural heritage resource is to be determined using the definition of &quot;value of the cultural heritage resource&quot; from §2B1.5.</p>
<p>The Commission recognizes that the full implementation of this new guideline for the most serious offenders often will be limited in its application because of the extremely low statutory maxima of some of the potentially applicable statutes, such as the criminal provisions of ARPA, NAGPRA, and 18 U.S.C. § 1163 (covering the theft of tribal property). Currently ARPA has either a one year or two year statutory maximum term of imprisonment for the first offense, depending on whether the value exceeds $500, and NAGPRA has a statutory maximum term of imprisonment of one year for the first offense irrespective of value. These statutes all have five year statutory maximum terms of imprisonment for second and subsequent offenses. Consequently, the statutory ceiling may limit the full range of proportionate guideline sentencing, but the Commission has promulgated this new guideline to cover the wide variety of potential offense conduct that can occur in connection with cultural heritage resources. The Commission has recommended to Congress that the statutory maximum terms of imprisonment for these offenses be raised appropriately.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Commentary to §2B4.1 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended in Note 1 by inserting &quot;, foreign governments, or public international organizations&quot; after &quot;local government&quot;; and by striking &quot;governmental&quot; and inserting &quot;any such&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §2B4.1 captioned &quot;Background&quot; is amended in the sixth paragraph by striking &quot;to violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 78dd‑1 and 78dd-2, and&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §2C1.1 captioned &quot;Statutory Provisions&quot; is amended by inserting &quot;15 U.S.C. §§ 78dd-1, 78dd-2, 78dd-3;&quot; before &quot;18 U.S.C.&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §2C1.1 captioned &quot;Background&quot; is amended by inserting after the ninth paragraph the following:</p>
<p>&quot; Section 2C1.1 also applies to offenses under 15 U.S.C. §§ 78dd-1, 78dd-2, and 78dd-3. Such offenses generally involve a payment to a foreign public official, candidate for public office, or agent or intermediary, with the intent to influence an official act or decision of a foreign government or political party. Typically, a case prosecuted under these provisions will involve an intent to influence governmental action.&quot;.</p>
<p>Appendix A (Statutory Index) is amended in the line referenced to 15 U.S.C. § 78dd‑1 by striking &quot;2B4.1&quot; and inserting &quot;2C1.1&quot;;</p>
<p>in the line referenced to 15 U.S.C. § 78dd‑2 by striking &quot;2B4.1&quot; and inserting &quot;2C1.1&quot;;</p>
<p>by inserting after the line referenced to 15 U.S.C. § 78dd-2 following new line:</p>
<p>&quot;15 U.S.C. § 78dd‑3 2C1.1&quot;;</p>
<p>and n the line referenced to 15 U.S.C. § 78ff by striking &quot;2B4.1&quot; and inserting &quot;2C1.1&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This amendment changes the Statutory Index reference for violations of section 30A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. § 78dd-1) and sections 104 and 104A of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 (15 U.S.C. §§ 78dd-2 and 78dd-3), from §2B4.1 (Bribery in Procurement of Bank Loan and Other Commercial Bribery) to §2C1.1 (Offering, Giving, Soliciting, or Receiving a Bribe; Extortion Under Color of Official Right).</p>
<p>This change is made because violations of 15 U.S.C. §§ 78dd-1 through 78dd-3 involve public corruption of foreign officials and are, therefore, more akin to public corruption cases than commercial bribery cases. Violations of the 15 U.S.C. §§ 78dd-1 through 78dd-3 typically involve payments to foreign officials for the purposes of influencing their official acts or decisions, inducing them to do or omit an act in violation of their lawful duty, inducing them to influence a foreign government, or securing any improper advantage. These cases also involve payments to foreign political parties or officials, candidates for foreign political office, or persons who act as conduits to these individuals. Most cases prosecuted under 15 U.S.C. §§ 78dd-1 through 78dd-3 involve an intent to influence governmental action.</p>
<p>Conversely, commercial bribery cases sentenced under §2B4.1 often involve kickback and gratuity payments made to bank officials or others who accept payments in return for influence or some type of exchange from the other person. These cases typically do not involve bribery of public or governmental officials and indeed, the Commentary to the guideline makes this clear in Application Note 1.</p>
<p>This change also is made to comply with the mandate of a mulitlateral treaty entered into by the United States, the Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions. In part, this Convention requires signatory countries to impose comparable sentences in both domestic and foreign bribery cases. Domestic public bribery cases are referenced to §2C1.1. To comply with the treaty, offenses committed in violation of 15 U.S.C. §§ 78dd-1 through 78dd-3 are now similarly referenced to §2C1.1.</p>

<p>MDMA 250 mg&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §2D1.1 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended by adding at the end the following:</p>
<p>&quot;21. <em>Applicability of Subsection (b)(6)</em>.—The applicability of subsection (b)(6) shall be determined without regard to whether the defendant was convicted of an offense that subjects the defendant to a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment. Section §5C1.2(b), which provides a minimum offense level of level 17, is not pertinent to the determination of whether subsection (b)(6) applies.&quot;.</p>
<p>Section 2D1.8(a)(2) is amended by striking &quot;16&quot; and inserting &quot;26&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §3B1.2 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended by adding at the end the following:</p>
<p>&quot;6. <em>Application of Role Adjustment in Certain Drug Cases</em>.—In a case in which the court applied §2D1.1 and the defendant’s base offense level under that guideline was reduced by operation of the maximum base offense level in §2D1.1(a)(3), the court also shall apply the appropriate adjustment under this guideline.&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This amendment responds to concerns that the guidelines pertaining to drug offenses do not satisfactorily reflect the culpability of certain offenders. The amendment also clarifies the operation of certain provisions in §2D1.1 (Unlawful Manufacturing, Importing, Exporting, or Trafficking (Including Possession with Intent to Commit These Offenses); Attempt or Conspiracy).</p>
<p>First, the amendment increases the maximum base offense level under subsection (a)(2) of §2D1.8 (Renting or Managing a Drug Establishment; Attempt or Conspiracy) from level 16 to level 26. This part of the amendment responds to concerns that §2D1.8 did not adequately punish defendants convicted under 21 U.S.C. § 856, pertaining to the establishment of manufacturing operations. That statute originally was enacted to target defendants who maintain, manage, or control so-called &quot;crack houses&quot; and more recently has been applied to defendants who facilitate drug use at commercial dance clubs, frequently called &quot;raves&quot;.</p>
<p>Prior to this amendment, §2D1.8(a)(2) provided a maximum base offense level of level 16 for defendants convicted under 21 U.S.C. § 856 who had no participation in the underlying controlled substance offense other than allowing use of their premises. The Commission determined that the maximum base offense level of level 16 did not adequately reflect the culpability of offenders who permit distribution of drugs in quantities that under §2D1.1 result in offense levels higher than level 16. Such offenders knowingly and intentionally facilitate and profit, at least indirectly, from the trafficking of illegal drugs, even though they may not participate directly in the underlying controlled substance offense.</p>
<p>Second, the amendment modifies §2D1.1(a)(3) to provide a maximum base offense level of level 30 if the defendant receives an adjustment under §3B1.2 (Mitigating Role). The maximum base offense level somewhat limits the sentencing impact of drug quantity for offenders who perform relatively low level trafficking functions, have little authority in the drug trafficking organization, and have a lower degree of individual culpability (<em>e.g.</em>, &quot;mules&quot; or &quot;couriers&quot; whose most serious trafficking function is transporting drugs and who qualify for a mitigating role adjustment).</p>
<p>This part of the amendment responds to concerns that base offense levels derived from the Drug Quantity Table in §2D1.1 overstate the culpability of certain drug offenders who meet the criteria for a mitigating role adjustment under §3B1.2. The Commission determined that, ordinarily, a maximum base offense level of level 30 adequately reflects the culpability of a defendant who qualifies for a mitigating role adjustment. Other aggravating adjustments in the trafficking guideline (<em>e.g.</em>, the weapon enhancement at §2D1.1(b)(1)), or other general, aggravating adjustments in Chapter Three (Adjustments), may increase the offense level above level 30. The maximum base offense level is expected to apply narrowly, affecting approximately six percent of all drug trafficking offenders.</p>
<p>The amendment also adds an application note in §3B1.2 that instructs the court to apply the appropriate adjustment under that guideline in a case in which the maximum base offense level in §2D1.1(a)(3) operates to reduce the defendant’s base offense level under §2D1.1.</p>
<p>Third, the amendment modifies the Typical Weight Per Unit (Dose, Pill, or Capsule) Table in the commentary to §2D1.1 to reflect more accurately the type and weight of ecstasy pills typically trafficked and consumed. Specifically, the amendment adds a reference for MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine) in the Typical Weight Per Unit Table and lists the typical weight as 250 milligrams per pill. The amendment also revises the typical weight for MDA to 250 milligrams of the mixture or substance containing the controlled substance. Prior to this amendment, the Table listed the typical weight of MDA as 100 milligrams of the actual controlled substance.</p>
<p>Information provided by the Drug Enforcement Administration indicates that ecstasy usually is trafficked and used as MDMA in pills weighing approximately 250 to 350 milligrams.</p>
<p>The absence of MDMA from the Typical Weight Per Unit (Dose, Pill, or Capsule) Table and the listing for MDA of an estimate of the actual weight of the controlled substance created the potential for misapplying the MDA estimate in a case in which MDMA is involved, which could result in underpunishment in some ecstasy cases. This part of the amendment thus promotes uniform application of §2D1.1 for offenses involving ecstasy by adding a reference for MDMA and revising the estimated weight for MDA.</p>
<p>Fourth, the amendment addresses two application concerns regarding the two level reduction under §2D1.1(b)(6) for defendants who meet the criteria set forth in §5C1.2 (Limitation on Applicability of Statutory Minimum Sentences in Certain Cases). The amendment provides an application note that clarifies that the two level reduction under §2D1.1(b)(6) does not depend on whether the defendant is convicted under a statute that carries a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment. The application note also clarifies that §5C1.2(b), which provides a minimum offense level of level 17 for certain offenders, is not applicable to §2D1.1(b)(6).</p>

<p>(B) The offense involved more than 10 victims.&quot;,</p>
<p>and inserting the following:</p>
<p>&quot;12. <em>Upward Departure Provision</em>.—An upward departure may be warranted if the offense involved more than 10 victims.&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This amendment ensures that appropriately severe sentences for sex trafficking crimes apply to commercial sex acts such as production of child pornography, in addition to prostitution, and also targets offenders who use fraud to entrap victims. It makes several changes to §2G1.1 (Promoting Prostitution or Prohibited Sexual Conduct) to address more adequately the portion of section 112(b) of the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000 (the &quot;Act&quot;), Pub. L. 106–386, pertaining to the new offense at 18 U.S.C. § 1591, which prohibits knowingly transporting or harboring any person, or benefitting from such transporting or harboring, knowing either that force, fraud, or coercion will be used to cause that person to engage in a commercial sex act, or that the person has not attained the age of 18 years and will be forced to engage in a commercial sex act.</p>
<p>In response to the Act, the Commission in 2001 promulgated an amendment that referenced 18 U.S.C. § 1591 to §§2G1.1 and 2G2.1 (Sexually Exploiting a Minor by Production of Sexually Explicit Visual or Printed Material) and provided an encouraged upward departure in those guidelines to address cases in which (1) the defendant was convicted under 18 U.S.C. § 1591 and the offense involved a victim who had not attained the age of 14 years; or (2) the offense involved more than 10 victims. (<em>See</em> Supplement to Appendix C, Amendment 612, effective May 1, 2001, and Amendment 627, effective November 1, 2001).</p>
<p>This amendment makes three substantive changes to §2G1.1. First, this amendment broadens the conduct covered by the guideline beyond prostitution to encompass all commercial sex acts, consistent with the scope of the Act. Second, this amendment expands the &quot;force or coercion&quot; prong of §2G1.1(b)(1) to also cover offenses involving fraud. This change addresses the increased punishment provided by 18 U.S.C. § 1591 for offenses effected by force, fraud, or coercion. Third, the amendment deletes the portion of the encouraged upward departure provision in §2G1.1 pertaining to the age of the victim because such conduct already is taken into account by that guideline.</p>

<p>(c) If the defendant (1) was convicted of violating section 924(c) or section 929(a) of title 18, United States Code; and (2) as a result of that conviction (alone or in addition to another offense of conviction), is determined to be a career offender under §4B1.1 (Career Offender), the guideline sentence shall be determined under §4B1.1(c). Except for §§3E1.1 (Acceptance of Responsibility), 4B1.1, and 4B1.2 (Definitions of Terms Used in Section 4B1.1), Chapters Three and Four shall not apply to that count of conviction.&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §2K2.4 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended by redesignating Notes 2 through 5 as Notes 4 through 7, respectively; and by striking Note 1 as follows:</p>
<p>&quot;1. Section 844(h) of title 18, United State Code, provides a mandatory term of imprisonment of 10 years (or 20 years for the second or subsequent offense). Sections 924(c) and 929(a) of title 18, United States Code, provide mandatory minimum terms of imprisonment (<em>e.g.</em>, not less than five years). Subsection (a) reflects this distinction. Accordingly, the guideline sentence for a defendant convicted under 18 U.S.C. § 844(h) is the term required by the statute, and the guideline sentence for a defendant convicted under 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) or § 929(a) is the minimum term required by the relevant statute. Each of 18 U.S.C. §§ 844(h), 924(c), and 929(a) requires a term of imprisonment imposed under this section to run consecutively to any other term of imprisonment.</p>
<p>A sentence above the minimum term required by 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) or § 929(a) is an upward departure from the guideline sentence. A departure may be warranted, for example, to reflect the seriousness of the defendant’s criminal history, particularly in a case in which the defendant is convicted of an 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) or § 929(a) offense and has at least two prior felony convictions for a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense that would have resulted in application of §4B1.1 (Career Offender) if that guideline applied to these offenses. <em>See</em> Application Note 3.&quot;,</p>
<p>and inserting the following:</p>
<p>&quot;1. <em>Application of Subsection (a)</em>.—Section 844(h) of title 18, United State Code, provides a mandatory term of imprisonment of 10 years (or 20 years for the second or subsequent offense). Accordingly, the guideline sentence for a defendant convicted under 18 U.S.C. § 844(h) is the term required by that statute. Section 844(h) of title 18, United State Code, also requires a term of imprisonment imposed under this section to run consecutively to any other term of imprisonment.</p>
<p>2. <em>Application of Subsection (b)</em>.—</p>
<p>(A) <em>In General</em>.—Sections 924(c) and 929(a) of title 18, United States Code, provide mandatory minimum terms of imprisonment (<em>e.g.</em>, not less than five years). Except as provided in subsection (c), in a case in which the defendant is convicted under 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) or § 929(a), the guideline sentence is the minimum term required by the relevant statute. Each of 18 U.S.C. §§ 924(c) and 929(a) also requires that a term of imprisonment imposed under that section shall run consecutively to any other term of imprisonment.</p>
<p>(B) <em>Upward Departure Provision</em>.—In a case in which the guideline sentence is determined under subsection (b), a sentence above the minimum term required by 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) or § 929(a) is an upward departure from the guideline sentence. A departure may be warranted, for example, to reflect the seriousness of the defendant’s criminal history in a case in which the defendant is convicted of an 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) or § 929(a) offense but is not determined to be a career offender under §4B1.1.</p>
<p>3. <em>Application of Subsection (c)</em>.—In a case in which the defendant (A) was convicted of violating 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) or 18 U.S.C. § 929(a); and (B) as a result of that conviction (alone or in addition to another offense of conviction), is determined to be a career offender under §4B1.1 (Career Offender), the guideline sentence shall be determined under §4B1.1(c).

<p>&quot;(a) A defendant is a career offender if (1) the defendant was at least eighteen years old at the time the defendant committed the instant offense of conviction; (2) the instant offense of conviction is a felony that is either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense; and (3) the defendant has at least two prior felony convictions of either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense.</p>
<p>(b) Except as provided in subsection (c), if the offense level for a career offender from the table in this subsection is greater than the offense level otherwise applicable, the offense level from the table in this subsection shall apply. A career offender’s criminal history category in every case under this subsection shall be Category VI.&quot;.</p>
<p>Section 4B1.1 is amended by adding after &quot;corresponding to that adjustment.&quot; the following:</p>
<p>&quot;(c) If the defendant is convicted of 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) or § 929(a), and the defendant is determined to be a career offender under subsection (a), the applicable guideline range shall be determined as follows:</p>
<p>(1) If the only count of conviction is 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) or § 929(a), the applicable guideline range shall be determined using the table in subsection (c)(3).</p>
<p>(2) In the case of multiple counts of conviction in which at least one of the counts is a conviction other than a conviction for 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) or § 929(a), the guideline range shall be the greater of—</p>
<p>(A) the guideline range that results by adding the mandatory minimum consecutive penalty required by the 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) or § 929(a) count(s) to the minimum and the maximum of the otherwise applicable guideline range determined for the count(s) of conviction other than the 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) or § 929(a) count(s); and</p>
<p>(B) the guideline range determined using the table in subsection (c)(3).</p>

<p>&quot;3. <em>Application of Subsection (c)</em>.—</p>
<p>(A) <em>In General</em>.—Subsection (c) applies in any case in which the defendant (i) was convicted of violating 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) or § 929(a); and (ii) as a result of that conviction (alone or in addition to another offense of conviction), is determined to be a career offender under §4B1.1(a).</p>
<p>(B) <em>Subsection (c)(2)</em>.—To determine the greater guideline range under subsection (c)(2), the court shall use the guideline range with the highest minimum term of imprisonment.</p>
<p>(C) <em>‘Otherwise Applicable Guideline Range’</em>.—For purposes of subsection (c)(2)(A), ‘otherwise applicable guideline range’ for the count(s) of conviction other than the 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) or 18 U.S.C. § 929(a) count(s) is determined as follows:</p>
<p>(i) If the count(s) of conviction other than the 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) or 18 U.S.C. § 929(a) count(s) does not qualify the defendant as a career offender, the otherwise applicable guideline range for that count(s) is the guideline range determined using: (I) the Chapter Two and Three offense level for that count(s); and (II) the appropriate criminal history category determined under §§4A1.1 (Criminal History Category) and 4A1.2 (Definitions and Instructions for Computing Criminal History).</p>
<p>(ii) If the count(s) of conviction other than the 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) or 18 U.S.C. § 929(a) count(s) qualifies the defendant as a career offender, the otherwise applicable guideline range for that count(s) is the guideline range determined for that count(s) under §4B1.1(a) and (b).</p>
<p>(D) <em>Imposition of Consecutive Term of Imprisonment</em>.—In a case involving multiple counts, the sentence shall be imposed according to the rules in subsection (e) of §5G1.2 (Sentencing on Multiple Counts of Conviction).</p>
<p>(E) <em>Example</em>.—The following example illustrates the application of subsection (c)(2) in a multiple count situation:</p>
<p>The defendant is convicted of one count of violating 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) for possessing a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking offense (5 year mandatory minimum), and one count of violating 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(B) (5 year mandatory minimum, 40 year statutory maximum). Applying subsection (c)(2)(A), the court determines that the drug count (without regard to the 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) count) qualifies the defendant as a career offender under §4B1.1(a). Under §4B1.1(a), the otherwise applicable guideline range for the drug count is 188-235 months (using offense level 34 (because the statutory maximum for the drug count is 40 years), minus 3 levels for acceptance of responsibility, and criminal history category VI). The court adds 60 months (the minimum required by 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)) to the minimum and the maximum of that range, resulting in a guideline range of 248-295 months. Applying subsection (c)(2)(B), the court then determines the career offender guideline range from the table in subsection (c)(3) is 262-327 months. The range with the greatest minimum, 262-327 months, is used to impose the sentence in accordance with §5G1.2(e).&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §4B1.1 captioned &quot;Background&quot; is amended by adding at the end the following:</p>
<p>&quot; Subsection (c) provides rules for determining the sentence for career offenders who have been convicted of 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) or § 929(a). The Career Offender Table in subsection (c)(3) provides a sentence at or near the statutory maximum for these offenders by using guideline ranges that correspond to criminal history category VI and offense level 37 (assuming §3E.1.1 (Acceptance of Responsibility) does not apply), offense level 35 (assuming a 2-level reduction under §3E.1.1 applies), and offense level 34 (assuming a 3-level reduction under §3E1.1 applies).&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §4B1.2 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended in Note 1 by striking the following:</p>
<p>&quot;A prior conviction for violating 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) or § 929(a) is a ‘prior felony conviction’ for purposes of applying §4B1.1 (Career Offender) if the prior offense of conviction established that the underlying offense was a ‘crime of violence’ or ‘controlled substance offense.’ (Note that if the defendant also was convicted of the underlying offense, the two convictions will be treated as related cases under §4A1.2 (Definitions and Instruction for Computing Criminal History)).&quot;,</p>
<p>and inserting the following:</p>
<p>&quot;A violation of 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) or § 929(a) is a ‘crime of violence’ or a ‘controlled substance offense’ if the offense of conviction established that the underlying offense was a ‘crime of violence’ or a ‘controlled substance offense’. (Note that in the case of a prior 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) or § 929(a) conviction, if the defendant also was convicted of the underlying offense, the two prior convictions will be treated as related cases under §4A1.2 (Definitions and Instructions for Computing Criminal History).)&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §4B1.2 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended by striking Note 2 as follows:</p>
<p>&quot;2. The guideline sentence for a conviction under 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) or § 929(a) is determined only by the statute and is imposed independently of any other sentence. <em>See</em> §§2K2.4 (Use of Firearm, Armor-Piercing Ammunition, or Explosive During or in Relation to Certain Crimes), 3D1.1 (Procedure for Determining Offense Level on Multiple Counts), and subsection (a) of §5G1.2 (Sentencing on Multiple Counts of Conviction). Accordingly, do not apply this guideline if the only offense of conviction is for violating 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) or § 929(a). For provisions pertaining to an upward departure from the guideline sentence for a conviction under 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) or § 929(a), <em>see</em> Application Note 1 of §2K2.4.&quot;;</p>
<p>and by redesignating Notes 3 and 4 as Notes 2 and 3, respectively.</p>
<p>Section 5G1.2(a) is amended by striking &quot;The&quot; and inserting &quot;Except as provided in subsection (e), the&quot;; and by inserting a comma after &quot;other term of imprisonment&quot;.</p>
<p>Section 5G1.2 is amended by adding after subsection (d) the following:</p>
<p>&quot;(e) In a case in which subsection (c) of §4B1.1 (Career Offender) applies, to the extent possible, the total punishment is to be apportioned among the counts of conviction, except that (1) the sentence to be imposed on a count requiring a minimum term of imprisonment shall be at least the minimum required by statute; and (2) the sentence to be imposed on the 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) or § 929(a) count shall be imposed to run consecutively to any other count.&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §5G1.2 is amended by striking the first paragraph as follows:</p>
<p>&quot;This section specifies the procedure for determining the specific sentence to be formally imposed on each count in a multiple-count case. The combined length of the sentences (&quot;total punishment&quot;) is determined by the adjusted combined offense level. To the extent possible, the total punishment is to be imposed on each count. Sentences on all counts run concurrently, except as required to achieve the total sentence, or as required by law.&quot;,</p>
<p>and inserting the following:</p>
<p>&quot;<em>Application Notes</em>:</p>
<p>1. <em>In General</em>.—This section specifies the procedure for determining the specific sentence to be formally imposed on each count in a multiple-count case. The combined length of the sentences (‘total punishment’) is determined by the court after determining the adjusted combined offense level and the Criminal History Category. Except as otherwise required by subsection (e) or any other law, the total punishment is to be imposed on each count and the sentences on all counts are to be imposed to run concurrently to the extent allowed by the statutory maximum sentence of imprisonment for each count of conviction.&quot;;</p>
<p>by indenting the second and third paragraphs 2 ems from the left margin; and by striking the fourth paragraph as follows:</p>
<p>&quot; Subsection (a) applies if a statute (1) specifies a term of imprisonment to be imposed; and (2) requires that such term of imprisonment be imposed to run consecutively to any other term of imprisonment. <em>See</em>, <em>e.g.</em>, 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) (requiring mandatory minimum terms of imprisonment, based on the conduct involved, to run consecutively to any other term of imprisonment). The term of years to be imposed consecutively is determined by the statute of conviction, and is independent of a guideline sentence on any other count. <em>See</em>, <em>e.g.</em>, Commentary to §§2K2.4 (Use of Firearm, Armor-Piercing Ammunition, or Explosive During or in Relation to Certain Crimes) and 3D1.1 (Procedure for Determining Offense Level on Multiple Counts) regarding determination of the offense levels for related counts when a conviction under 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) is involved. Note, however, that even in the case of a consecutive term of imprisonment imposed under subsection (a), any term of supervised release imposed is to run concurrently with any other term of supervised release imposed. <em>See</em> 18 U.S.C. § 3624(e). Subsection (a) also applies in certain other instances in which an independently determined and consecutive sentence is required. <em>See</em>, <em>e.g.</em>, Application Note 3 of the Commentary to §2J1.6 (Failure to Appear by Defendant), relating to failure to appear for service of sentence.&quot;,</p>
<p>and inserting the following:</p>
<p>&quot;2. <em>Mandatory Minimum and Mandatory Consecutive Terms of Imprisonment (Not Covered by Subsection (e))</em>.—Subsection (a) applies if a statute (A) specifies a term of imprisonment to be imposed; and (B) requires that such term of imprisonment be imposed to run consecutively to any other term of imprisonment. <em>See</em>, <em>e.g.</em>, 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) (requiring mandatory minimum terms of imprisonment, based on the conduct involved, and also requiring the sentence imposed to run consecutively to any other term of imprisonment). Except for certain career offender situations in which subsection (c) of §4B1.1 (Career Offender) applies, the term of years to be imposed consecutively is the minimum required by the statute of conviction and is independent of the guideline sentence on any other count. <em>See</em>, <em>e.g.</em>, the Commentary to §§2K2.4 (Use of Firearm, Armor-Piercing Ammunition, or Explosive During or in Relation to Certain Crimes) and 3D1.1 (Procedure for Determining Offense Level on Multiple Counts) regarding the determination of the offense levels for related counts when a conviction under 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) is involved. Note, however, that even in the case of a consecutive term of imprisonment imposed under subsection (a), any term of supervised release imposed is to run concurrently with any other term of supervised release imposed. <em>See</em> 18 U.S.C. § 3624(e). Subsection (a) also applies in certain other instances in which an independently determined and consecutive sentence is required. <em>See</em>, <em>e.g.</em>, Application Note 3 of the Commentary to §2J1.6 (Failure to Appear by Defendant), relating to failure to appear for service of sentence.</p>
<p>3. <em>Career Offenders Covered under Subsection (e)</em>.—</p>
<p>(A) <em>Imposing Sentence</em>.—The sentence imposed for a conviction under 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) or § 929(a) shall, under that statute, consist of a minimum term of imprisonment imposed to run consecutively to the sentence on any other count. Subsection (e) requires that the total punishment determined under §4B1.1(c) be apportioned among all the counts of conviction. In most cases this can be achieved by imposing the statutory minimum term of imprisonment on the 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) or § 929(a) count, subtracting that minimum term of imprisonment from the total punishment determined under §4B1.1(c), and then imposing the balance of the total punishment on the other counts of conviction. In some cases covered by subsection (e), a consecutive term of imprisonment longer than the minimum required by 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) or § 929(a) will be necessary in order both to achieve the total punishment determined by the court and to comply with the applicable statutory requirements.</p>
<p>(B) <em>Examples</em>.—The following examples illustrate the application of subsection (e) in a multiple count situation:</p>
<p>(i) The defendant is convicted of one count of violating 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) for possessing a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking offense (5 year mandatory minimum), and one count of violating 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(C) (20 year statutory maximum). Applying §4B1.1(c), the court determines that a sentence of 300 months is appropriate (applicable guideline range of 262-327). The court then imposes a sentence of 60 months on the 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) count, subtracts that 60 months from the total punishment of 300 months and imposes the remainder of 240 months on the 21 U.S.C. § 841 count. As required by statute, the sentence on the 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) count is imposed to run consecutively.</p>
<p>(ii) The defendant is convicted of one count of 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) (5 year mandatory minimum), and one count of violating 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(C) (20 year statutory maximum). Applying §4B1.1(c), the court determines that a sentence of 327 months is appropriate (applicable guideline range of 262-327). The court then imposes a sentence of 240 months on the 21 U.S.C. § 841 count and a sentence of 87 months on the 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) count to run consecutively to the sentence on the 21 U.S.C. § 841 count.</p>
<p>(iii) The defendant is convicted of two counts of 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) (5 year mandatory minimum on first count, 25 year mandatory minimum on second count) and one count of violating 18 U.S.C. § 2113(a) (20 year statutory maximum). Applying §4B1.1(c), the court determines that a sentence of 400 months is appropriate (applicable guideline range of 360-life). The court then imposes (I) a sentence of 60 months on the first 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) count; (II) a sentence of 300 months on the second 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) count; and (III) a sentence of 40 months on the 18 U.S.C. § 2113(a) count. The sentence on each count is imposed to run consecutively to the other counts.&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This amendment is intended to comply with the statutory directive in 28 U.S.C. § 994(h) by providing a guideline sentence at or near the statutory maximum of life imprisonment for cases in which certain serious firearm offenses establish the defendant as a career offender.</p>
<p>This amendment provides special rules in §§4B1.1 (Career Offender) and 5G1.2 (Sentencing on Multiple Counts of Conviction) for determining and imposing a guideline sentence in a case in which the defendant is convicted of an offense under 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) or § 929(a) and, as a result of that conviction, is determined to be a career offender under §§4B1.1 and 4B1.2 (Definitions of Terms Used in Section 4B1.1). The amendment supplements Amendment 600 (effective November 1, 2000) in which the Commission first addressed implementation of the statutory changes in penalties for 18 U.S.C. §§ 924(c) and 929(a) offenses made by the Act to Throttle the Criminal Use of Guns, Pub. L. 105–386. At that time, the Commission deferred addressing the more complicated issues of whether convictions under 18 U.S.C. §§ 924(c) and 929(a) can qualify as instant offenses for purposes of §4B1.1, and if they do so qualify, how the sentence would be imposed. Promulgation of this amendment reflects the Commission’s decision that the amendment, while somewhat complex, is necessary to comply appropriately with 28 U.S.C. § 994(h).</p>
<p>Operationally, this amendment achieves two goals. First, it permits 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) or § 929(a) offenses, whether as the instant or prior offense of conviction, to qualify for career offender purposes. Second, it ensures that, in a case in which such an instant offense establishes the defendant as a career offender, the resulting guideline sentence is determined under §4B1.1 using a count of conviction that has a statutory maximum of life imprisonment. The special rule necessarily is somewhat more complex because of the need to address certain anomalies that infrequently would occur in the absence of such a rule, <em>i.e.</em>, that a very serious offender could receive a lower sentence by virtue of the application of §4B1.1 than that which would otherwise be received by imposing the statutorily required minimum sentence consecutively to the otherwise applicable guideline range.</p>
<p>This amendment does not change the current guideline rules precluding application of guideline weapon enhancements in a case in which the defendant is convicted of a 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) or § 929(a) offense. Furthermore, under this amendment, in a case in which the defendant is convicted of a 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) or § 929(a) offense but that offense, together with any prior convictions, does not establish the defendant as a career offender, the current guideline rules for sentencing on that 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) or § 929(a) count continue to apply. Accordingly, under §2K2.4 (Use of Firearm, Armor-Piercing Ammunition, or Explosive During or in Relation to Certain Crimes), the guideline sentence on that count is the statutory minimum, and that sentence is imposed independently and consecutively to the sentence on other counts. No adjustments in Chapter Three (Adjustments) or Chapter Four (Criminal History and Criminal Livelihood) apply to adjust the guideline sentence for that 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) or § 929(a) count.</p>
<p>However, under this amendment, in a case in which the 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) or § 929(a) count establishes the defendant as a career offender, which the court will determine under §§4B1.1 and 4B1.2, new special rules and instructions will apply. To determine the guideline sentence on the 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) or § 929(a) count, the court moves directly from §2K2.4 to §4B1.1 and applies the new special instruction therein. New special instructions for imposing sentence in these cases also have been added to §5G1.2.</p>

<p>The Commentary to §3A1.2 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended by striking Note 4, as redesignated by this amendment, as follows:</p>
<p>&quot;4. Subdivision (b) applies in circumstances tantamount to aggravated assault against a law enforcement or corrections officer, committed in the course of, or in immediate flight following, another offense, such as bank robbery. While this subdivision may apply in connection with a variety of offenses that are not by nature targeted against official victims, its applicability is limited to assaultive conduct against law enforcement or corrections officers that is sufficiently serious to create at least a ‘substantial risk of serious bodily injury’ and that is proximate in time to the commission of the offense.&quot;,</p>
<p>and inserting the following:</p>
<p>&quot;4. <em>Application of Subsection (b)</em>.—</p>
<p>(A) <em>In General</em>.—Subsection (b) applies in circumstances tantamount to aggravated assault (i) against a law enforcement officer, committed in the course of, or in immediate flight following, another offense; or (ii) against a prison official, while the defendant (or a person for whose conduct the defendant is otherwise accountable) was in the custody or control of a prison or other correctional facility. While subsection (b) may apply in connection with a variety of offenses that are not by nature targeted against official victims, its applicability is limited to assaultive conduct against such official victims that is sufficiently serious to create at least a ‘substantial risk of serious bodily injury’.</p>
<p>(B) <em>Definitions</em>.—For purposes of subsection (b):</p>
<p>‘Custody and control’ includes ‘non-secure custody’, <em>i.e</em>., custody with no significant physical restraint. For example, a defendant is in the custody and control of a prison or other correctional facility if the defendant (i) is on a work detail outside the security perimeter of the prison or correctional facility; (ii) is physically away from the prison or correctional facility while on a pass or furlough; or (iii) is in custody at a community corrections center, community treatment center, ‘halfway house’, or similar facility. The defendant also shall be deemed to be in the custody and control of a prison or other correctional facility while the defendant is in the status of having escaped from that prison or correctional facility.</p>
<p>‘Prison official’ means any individual (including a director, officer, employee, independent contractor, or volunteer, but not including an inmate) authorized to act on behalf of a prison or correctional facility. For example, this enhancement would be applicable to any of the following: (i) an individual employed by a prison as a corrections officer; (ii) an individual employed by a prison as a work detail supervisor; and (iii) a nurse who, under contract, provides medical services to prisoners in a prison health facility.</p>
<p>‘Substantial risk of serious bodily injury’ includes any more serious injury that was risked, as well as actual serious bodily injury (or more serious injury) if it occurs.&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §3A1.2 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended by striking Note 5, as redesignated by this amendment, as follows:</p>
<p>&quot;5. The phrase ‘substantial risk of serious bodily injury’ in subdivision (b) is a threshold level of harm that includes any more serious injury that was risked, as well as actual serious bodily injury (or more serious harm) if it occurs.&quot;,</p>
<p>and inserting the following:</p>
<p>&quot;5. <em>Upward Departure Provision</em>.—Certain high level officials, <em>e.g.</em>, the President and Vice President, although covered by this section, do not represent the heartland of the conduct covered. An upward departure to reflect the potential disruption of the governmental function in such cases typically would be warranted.&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This amendment expands the category of persons who may be considered official victims for purposes of triggering the two level enhancement at §3A1.2 (Official Victim). This amendment is promulgated in response to concerns expressed by the Bureau of Prisons regarding <em>United States v. Walker</em>, 202 F.3d 181 (3d Cir. 2000). <em>Walker</em> held that an individual employed by the prison to supervise food service functions who was attacked by an inmate subordinate was not a &quot;corrections officer&quot; within the scope of §3A1.2. The Bureau of Prisons advised the Commission that the Bureau uses a variety of employees, contractors, and volunteers to supervise inmates and that maintenance of a safe and stable institutional environment is fostered by knowledge on the part of inmates that anyone in prison employment or performing an authorized role within a prison is afforded the protection of §3A1.2. In accord with the Bureau’s recommendation, the amendment includes a broad definition of &quot;prison official&quot; to include prison employees, as well as independent contractors and volunteers on prison premises with official authorization, but does not include inmates.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;7. <em>Downward Departure Provision</em>.—In the case of a discharged term of imprisonment, a downward departure is not prohibited if subsection (b) would have applied to that term of imprisonment had the term been undischarged. Any such departure should be fashioned to achieve a reasonable punishment for the instant offense.&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This amendment modifies §5G1.3 (Imposition of a Sentence on a Defendant Subject to an Undischarged Term of Imprisonment) to include certain discharged terms of imprisonment. Specifically, the amendment adds commentary to §5G1.3 to provide that courts are not prohibited from considering a downward departure in a case in which §5G1.3(b) would have applied if the term of imprisonment had not been discharged. In the case of undischarged terms of imprisonment, §5G1.3(b) currently authorizes a court to adjust the sentence if the conduct underlying the undischarged term of imprisonment has been fully taken into account in the offense level for the instant federal offense. <em>See</em> Application Note 2 of the Commentary to §5G1.3. By adding the new commentary, the Commission makes clear that discharged terms of imprisonment may merit a downward departure for a similar reason. The amendment thereby addresses a circuit conflict regarding the propriety of a downward departure under such circumstances. <em>Compare</em>, <em>e.g</em>., <em>United States v. O’Hagan</em>, 139 F.3d 641, 657 (8th Cir. 1998) (holding that a sentencing court could downwardly depart to adjust for time served on a discharged state sentence); <em>United States v. Blackwell</em>, 49 F.3d 1232, 1241-42 (7th Cir. 1995) (same) with <em>United States v. McHan</em>, 101 F.3d 1027, 1040 (4th Cir. 1996) (holding that downward departure to allow an adjustment for a discharged term was based on an error of law and therefore an abuse of discretion), cert. denied, 520 U.S. 1281 (1997).</p>

Before the enactment of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, the condition at 18 U.S.C. § 3563(b)(11) was intermittent confinement. The Act deleted 18 U.S.C. § 3563(b)(2), authorizing the payment of a fine as a condition of probation, and redesignated the remaining conditions of probation set forth in 18 U.S.C. § 3563(b); intermittent confinement is now set forth at subsection (b)(10), whereas subsection (b)(11) sets forth the condition of residency at a community corrections facility.

<p>&quot;42 U.S.C. § 14905 2B1.1&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This thirteen-part amendment makes several technical and conforming changes to various guideline provisions.</p>
<p>First, the amendment conforms the language concerning offenses that &quot;affected a financial institution&quot; in subsection (b)(2) of §2B4.1 (Bribery in Procurement of Bank Loan and Other Commercial Bribery) with subsection (b)(12) of §2B1.1 (Theft, Property Destruction, and Fraud).</p>
<p>Second, the amendment: (1) updates statutory references in §§2D1.9 (Placing or Maintaining Dangerous Devices on Federal Property to Protect the Unlawful Production of Controlled Substances; Attempt or Conspiracy), 2D1.11 (Unlawfully Distributing, Importing, Exporting or Possessing a Listed Chemical; Attempt or Conspiracy), and 2D1.13 (Structuring Chemical Transactions or Creating a Chemical Mixture to Evade Reporting or Recordkeeping Requirements; Presenting False or Fraudulent Identification to Obtain a Listed Chemical; Attempt or Conspiracy) and Appendix A (Statutory Index) to correspond to statutory redesignations made by the Hillory J. Farias and Samantha Reid Date-Rape Drug Prohibition Act of 2000, Pub. L. 106–172; and (2) corrects references to the new chemical quantity tables in §2D1.11.</p>
<p>Third, the amendment corrects a change to the commentary of §2N2.1 (Violations of Statutes and Regulations Dealing With Any Food, Drug, Biological Product, Device, Cosmetic, or Agricultural Product) that was inadvertently made as part of the conforming package of amendments in the Economic Crime Package (<em>see</em> Supplement to Appendix C, Amendment 617, effective November 1, 2001).</p>
<p>Fourth, the amendment inserts a missing &quot;or&quot; in subsection (a)(3) of §2Q1.6 (Hazardous or Injurious Devices on Federal Lands).</p>
<p>Fifth, the amendment corrects a grammatical error in Note (D) of subsection (c)(1) of §2T1.1 (Tax Evasion; Willful Failure to File Return, Supply Information, or Pay Tax; Fraudulent or False Returns, Statements, or Other Documents) by replacing &quot;subdivisions (A), (B), or (C)&quot; with &quot;subdivision (A), (B), or (C)&quot;.</p>
<p>Sixth, the amendment repromulgates amendment 568, effective November 1, 1997, to correct an inadvertent omission of a conforming amendment to §4B1.4 (Armed Career Criminal) from amendment 568.</p>
<p>Seventh, the amendment conforms §§5C1.1 (Imposition of a Term of Imprisonment), 5D1.3 (Conditions of Supervised Release), and 5F1.1 (Community Confinement), Part A of Chapter Seven (Violations of Probation and Supervised Release), and §7B1.3 (Revocation of Probation or Supervised Release) to current statutory provisions at 18 U.S.C. §§ 3563 and 3583 and provides an explanatory note concerning the status of intermittent confinement and community confinement as conditions of supervised release.</p>
<p>Eighth, the amendment clarifies that language in subsection (c) of §5D1.2 (Term of Supervised Release) is a policy statement (because it recommends the maximum term of supervised release for sex offenders rather than requires it).</p>
<p>Ninth, the amendment deletes from Application Note 5 of §5E1.2 (Fines for Individual Defendants) an incorrect statement concerning the Clean Air Act.</p>
<p>Tenth, the amendment updates statutory references in §5F1.5 (Occupational Restrictions).</p>
<p>Eleventh, the amendment inserts a missing &quot;Background&quot; heading in §5F1.7 (Shock Incarceration Program).</p>
<p>Twelfth, the amendment references 18 U.S.C. § 2245, which covers sexual abuse resulting in death, to §2A1.1 (First Degree Murder) in Appendix A (Statutory Index) because the offense requires the death of a person.</p>
<p>Finally, the amendment responds to new legislation as follows:</p>
<p>(1) It updates, in §2B1.1, a statutory reference in the definition of &quot;means of identification&quot; to correspond to a redesignation made by the Internet False Identification Prevention Act of 2000, Pub. L. 106–578.</p>
<p>(2) It provides guideline references in Appendix A for two new offenses created by the American Homeownership and Economic Opportunity Act of 2000, Pub. L. 106–569 (&quot;the Act&quot;). First, section 608 of the Act amends section 610(a) of the National Manufactured Housing Construction and Safety Standards Act of 1974 (42 U.S.C. § 5409(a)) which makes it unlawful to fail to comply with a state’s installation program. Under section 611 of the National Housing Construction and Safety Standard Act of 1974 (42 U.S.C.§ 5410(b)), knowing and willful violations of subsection 610(a) are punishable by imprisonment of not more than one year. The amendment references this provision to §2N2.1. Second, section 708 of the Act created section 543 in Title V of the Housing Act of 1949 (42 U.S.C. § 1490(s)(a)), which provides a criminal penalty of not more than five years’ imprisonment for equity skimming. The amendment references this provision to §2B1.1.</p>
<p>(3) It references offenses under section 307(c) of the National Marine Sanctuaries Act (16 U.S.C. § 1437(c)) to §2A2.4 (Obstructing or Impeding Officers). Section 307(c) of the National Marine Sanctuaries Act, as amended by the National Marine Sanctuaries Amendments Act of 2000, Pub. L. 106–513, prohibits the interference with the enforcement of conservation activities authorized in title 16, United States Code, including refusing to permit any officer authorized to enforce such title to board a vessel for purposes of conducting a search or inspection in connection with the enforcement of such title.</p>

<p>18 U.S.C. § 1520 2E5.3&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This amendment implements directives to the Commission contained in sections 805, 905, and 1104 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, Pub. L. 107–204 (the &quot;Act&quot;), by making several modifications to §2B1.1 (Larceny, Embezzlement, and Other Forms of Theft; Offenses Involving Stolen Property; Property Damage or Destruction; Fraud and Deceit; Forgery; Offenses Involving Altered or Counterfeit Instruments Other than Counterfeit Bearer Obligations of the United States) and §2J1.2 (Obstruction of Justice). The directives pertain to serious fraud and related offenses and obstruction of justice offenses. The directives require the Commission under emergency amendment authority to promulgate amendments addressing, among other things, officers and directors of publicly traded companies who commit fraud and related offenses, fraud offenses that endanger the solvency or financial security of a substantial number of victims, fraud offenses that involve significantly greater than 50 victims, and obstruction of justice offenses that involve the destruction of evidence.</p>
<p>First, the amendment addresses the directive contained in section 1104(b)(5) of the Act to &quot;ensure that the guideline offense levels and enhancements under United States Sentencing Guideline §2B1.1 (as in effect on the date of enactment of this Act) are sufficient for a fraud offense when the number of victims adversely involved is significantly greater than 50.&quot; The amendment implements this directive by expanding the existing enhancement at §2B1.1(b)(2) based on the number of victims involved in the offense. Prior to the amendment, subsection (b)(2) provided a two level enhancement if the offense involved more than 10, but less than 50, victims (or was committed through mass-marketing), and a four level enhancement if the offense involved 50 or more victims. The amendment provides an additional two level increase, for a total of six levels, if the offense involved 250 or more victims. The Commission determined that an enhancement of this magnitude appropriately responds to the pertinent directive and reflects the extensive nature of, and the large scale victimization caused by, such offenses.</p>
<p>Second, the amendment addresses directives contained in sections 805 and 1104 of the Act pertaining to securities and accounting fraud offenses and fraud offenses that endanger the solvency or financial security of a substantial number of victims. Specifically, section 805(a)(4) directs the Commission to ensure that &quot;a specific offense characteristic enhancing sentencing is provided under United States Sentencing Guideline 2B1.1 (as in effect on the date of enactment of this Act) for a fraud offense that endangers the solvency or financial security of a substantial number of victims.&quot; In addition, section 1104(b)(1) directs the Commission to &quot;ensure that the sentencing guidelines and policy statements reflect the serious nature of securities, pension, and accounting fraud and the need for aggressive and appropriate law enforcement action to prevent such offenses.&quot; The amendment implements these directives by expanding the scope of the existing enhancement at §2B1.1(b)(12)(B).</p>
<p>Prior to the amendment, §2B1.1(b)(12)(B) provided a four level enhancement and a minimum offense level of 24 if the offense substantially jeopardized the safety and soundness of a financial institution. The amendment expands the scope of this enhancement by providing two additional prongs. The first prong applies to offenses that substantially endanger the solvency or financial security of an organization that, at any time during the offense, was a publicly traded company or had 1,000 or more employees. The addition of this prong reflects the Commission’s determination that such an offense undermines the public’s confidence in the securities and investment market much in the same manner as an offense that jeopardizes the safety and soundness of a financial institution undermines the public’s confidence in the banking system. This prong also reflects the likelihood that an offense that endangers the solvency or financial security of an employer of this size will similarly affect a substantial number of individual victims, without requiring the court to determine whether the solvency or financial security of each individual victim was substantially endangered.</p>
<p>A corresponding application note for §2B1.1(b)(12)(B) sets forth a non-exhaustive list of factors that the court shall consider in determining whether the offense endangered the solvency or financial security of a publicly traded company or an organization with 1,000 or more employees. The list of factors includes references to insolvency, filing for bankruptcy, substantially reducing the value of the company’s stock, and substantially reducing the company’s workforce among the list of factors that the court shall consider when applying the new enhancement, and other factors not enumerated in the application note could be considered by the court as appropriate.</p>
<p>The amendment also modifies the application note of the previously existing prong of §2B1.1(b)(12)(B), the financial institutions enhancement, to be consistent structurally with the new prongs of the enhancement. Prior to the amendment, the presence of any one of the factors enumerated in the application note would trigger the financial institutions enhancement under §2B1.1(b)(12)(B). Under the amendment, the application note to the financial institutions enhancement sets forth a non-exhaustive list of factors that the court shall consider in determining whether the offense substantially jeopardized the safety and soundness of a financial institution. The list of factors that the court shall consider when applying this enhancement includes references to insolvency, substantially reducing benefits to pensioners and insureds, and an inability to refund fully any deposit, payment, or investment on demand.</p>
<p>The second prong added to §2B1.1(b)(12)(B) by the amendment applies to offenses that substantially endangered the solvency or financial security of 100 or more victims, regardless of whether a publicly traded company or other organization was affected by the offense. The Commission concluded that the specificity of the directive in section 805(a)(4) required an enhancement focused specifically on conduct that endangers the financial security of individual victims. Thus, use of this prong of the enhancement will be appropriate in cases in which there is sufficient evidence for the court to determine that the amount of loss suffered by individual victims of the offense substantially endangered the solvency or financial security of those victims. The Commission also determined that the enhancement provided in §2B1.1(b)(12)(B) shall apply cumulatively with the enhancement at §2B1.1(b)(2), which is based solely on the number of victims involved in the offense, to reflect the particularly acute harm suffered by victims of offenses for which the new prongs of subsection (b)(12)(B) apply.</p>
<p>Third, the amendment addresses the directive contained at section 1104(a)(2) of the Act to &quot;consider the promulgation of new sentencing guidelines or amendments to existing sentencing guidelines to provide an enhancement for officers or directors of publicly traded corporations who commit fraud and related offenses.&quot; The amendment implements this directive by providing a new, four level enhancement at §2B1.1(b)(13) that applies if the offense involved a violation of securities law and, at the time of the offense, the defendant was an officer or director of a publicly traded company. The Commission concluded that a four level enhancement appropriately reflects that an officer or director of a publicly traded company who commits such an offense violates certain heightened fiduciary duties imposed by securities law upon such individuals. Accordingly, the court is not required to determine specifically whether the defendant abused a position of trust in order for the enhancement to apply, and a corresponding application note provides that, in cases in which the new, four level enhancement applies, the existing two level enhancement for abuse of position of trust at §3B1.3 (Abuse of Position of Trust or Use of Special Skill) shall not apply.</p>
<p>The corresponding application note also expressly provides that the enhancement would apply regardless of whether the defendant was convicted under a specific securities fraud statute (<em>e.g</em>., 18 U.S.C. § 1348, a new offense created by the Act specifically prohibiting securities fraud) or under a general fraud statute (e.g., 18 U.S.C. § 1341, prohibiting mail fraud), provided that the offense involved a violation of &quot;securities law&quot; as defined in the application note.</p>
<p>Fourth, the amendment expands the loss table at §2B1.1(b)(1) to punish adequately offenses that cause catastrophic losses of magnitudes previously unforeseen, such as the serious corporate scandals that gave rise to several portions of the Act. Prior to the amendment, the loss table at §2B1.1(b)(1) provided sentencing enhancements in two level increments up to a maximum of 26 levels for offenses in which the loss exceeded $100,000,000. The amendment adds two additional loss amount categories to the table; an increase of 28 levels for offenses in which the loss exceeded $200,000,000, and an increase of 30 levels for offenses in which the loss exceeded $400,000,000. These additions to the loss table address congressional concern regarding particularly extensive and serious fraud offenses, and more fully effectuate increases in statutory maximum penalties provided by the Act (<em>e.g.</em>, the increase in the statutory maximum penalties for wire fraud and mail fraud offenses from five to 20 years set forth in section 903 of the Act). The amendment also modifies the tax table in §2T4.1 in a similar manner to maintain the longstanding proportional relationship between the loss table in §2B1.1 and the tax table.</p>
<p>The amendment also adds a new factor to the general, enumerated factors that the court may consider in determining the amount of loss under §2B1.1(b)(1). Specifically, the amendment adds the reduction in the value of equity securities or other corporate assets that resulted from the offense to the list of general factors set forth in Application Note 2(C) of §2B1.1. This factor was added to provide courts additional guidance in determining loss in certain cases, particularly in complex white collar cases.</p>
<p>Fifth, the amendment modifies §2J1.2 to address the directives pertaining to obstruction of justice offenses contained in sections 805 and 1104 of the Act. Specifically, section 805(a) of the Act directs the Commission to ensure that the base offense level and existing enhancements in §2J1.2 are sufficient to deter and punish obstruction of justice offenses generally, and specifically are adequate in cases involving the destruction, alteration, or fabrication of a large amount of evidence, a large number of participants, the selection of evidence that is particularly probative or essential to the investigation, more than minimal planning, or abuse of a special skill or a position of trust. Section 1104(b) of the Act further directs the Commission to ensure that the &quot;guideline offense levels and enhancements for an obstruction of justice offense are adequate in cases where documents or other physical evidence are actually destroyed or fabricated.&quot;</p>
<p>The amendment implements these directives by making two modifications to §2J1.2. First, the amendment increases the base offense level in §2J1.2 from level 12 to level 14. Second, the amendment adds a new two level enhancement to §2J1.2. This enhancement applies if the offense (i) involved the destruction, alteration, or fabrication of a substantial number of records, documents or tangible objects; (ii) involved the selection of any essential or especially probative record, document, or tangible object to destroy or alter; or (iii) was otherwise extensive in scope, planning, or preparation. The Commission determined that existing adjustments in Chapter Three for aggravating role, §3B1.1, and abuse of position of trust or use of special skill, §3B1.3, adequately account for those particular factors described in section 805(a) of the Act.</p>
<p>Sixth, the amendment addresses new offenses created by the Act. Section 1520 of title 18, United States Code, relating to destruction of corporate audit records, is referenced to §2E5.3 (False Statements and Concealment of Facts in Relation to Documents Required by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act; Failure to Maintain and Falsification of Records Required by the Labor Management Reporting and Disclosure Act; Destruction and Failure to Maintain Corporate Audit Records). Section 1520 provides a statutory maximum penalty of ten years’ imprisonment for knowing and willful violations of document maintenance requirements as set forth in that section or in rules or regulations to be promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to that section. The amendment also expands the existing cross reference in §2E5.3(a)(2) specifically to cover fraud and obstruction of justice offenses. Accordingly, if a defendant who is convicted under 18 U.S.C. § 1520 committed the offense in order to obstruct justice, the amendment to the cross reference provision requires the court to apply §2J1.2 instead of §2E5.3. Other new offenses are listed in Appendix A (Statutory Index), as well as in the statutory provisions of the relevant guidelines.</p>

<p>2. <em>Application of Subsection (b)(3)(B)</em>.—Subsection (b)(3)(B) provides an enhancement for a defendant who commits the offense for the purpose of achieving a specific, identifiable non-monetary Federal benefit that does not rise to the level of a bribe or a gratuity. Subsection (b)(3)(B) is not intended to apply to offenses under this guideline in which the defendant’s only motivation for commission of the offense is generally to achieve increased visibility with, or heightened access to, public officials. Rather, subsection (b)(3)(B) is intended to apply to defendants who commit the offense to obtain a specific, identifiable non-monetary Federal benefit, such as a Presidential pardon or information proprietary to the government.</p>
<p>3. <em>Application of Subsection (b)(4)</em>.—Subsection (b)(4) shall apply if the defendant engaged in any combination of 30 or more illegal transactions during the course of the offense, whether or not the illegal transactions resulted in a conviction for such conduct.</p>
<p>4. <em>Departure Provision</em>.—In a case in which the defendant’s conduct was part of a systematic or pervasive corruption of a governmental function, process, or office that may cause loss of public confidence in government, an upward departure may be warranted.&quot;.</p>
<p>Section 3D1.2(d) is amended by inserting &quot;, 2C1.8&quot; after &quot;2C1.7&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §5E1.2 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended in the second sentence of Note 5 by striking &quot;and&quot; after &quot;Control Act;&quot; and by inserting before the period at the end the following:</p>
<p>&quot;; and 2 U.S.C. § 437g(d)(1)(D), which authorizes, for violations of the Federal Election Campaign Act under 2 U.S.C. § 441f, a fine up to the greater of $50,000 or 1,000 percent of the amount of the violation, and which requires, in the case of such a violation, a minimum fine of not less than 300 percent of the amount of the violation.</p>
<p>There may be cases in which the defendant has entered into a conciliation agreement with the Federal Election Commission under section 309 of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 in order to correct or prevent a violation of such Act by the defendant. The existence of a conciliation agreement between the defendant and Federal Election Commission, and the extent of compliance with that conciliation agreement, may be appropriate factors in determining at what point within the applicable fine guideline range to sentence the defendant, unless the defendant began negotiations toward a conciliation agreement after becoming aware of a criminal investigation&quot;.</p>
<p>Appendix A (Statutory Index) is amended by inserting before the line referenced to 7 U.S.C. § 6 the following new lines:</p>

<p>Appendix A (Statutory Index) is amended by inserting after the line referenced to 18 U.S.C. § 597 the following new line:</p>
<p>&quot;18 U.S.C. § 607 2C1.8&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This amendment implements the directive from Congress contained in the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002, Pub. L. 107–155, (the &quot;BCRA&quot;) to the effect that the Commission &quot;promulgate a guideline, or amend an existing guideline ..., for penalties for violations of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 (the &quot;FECA&quot;) and related election laws ... .&quot;. The BCRA significantly increased statutory penalties for campaign finance crimes, formerly misdemeanors under the FECA. The new statutory maximum term of imprisonment for even the least serious of these offenses is now two years and for more serious offenses, the maximum term of imprisonment is five years.</p>
<p>To effectively punish these offenses, the Commission chose to create a new guideline at §2C1.8 (Making, Receiving, or Failing to Report a Contribution, Donation, or Expenditure in Violation of the Federal Election Campaign Act; Fraudulently Misrepresenting Campaign Authority; Soliciting or Receiving a Donation in Connection with an Election While on Certain Federal Property). The Commission opted against simply amending an existing guideline because it determined after review that the characteristics of election-violation cases did not bear sufficient similarity to cases sentenced under any existing guideline. The offenses which will be sentenced under §2C1.8 include: violations of the statutory prohibitions against &quot;soft money&quot; (2 U.S.C. § 441i); restrictions on &quot;hard money&quot; contributions (2 U.S.C. § 441a); contributions by foreign nationals (2 U.S.C. § 441e); restrictions on &quot;electioneering communications&quot; as defined at 2 U.S.C. § 434(f)(3)_C_); certain fraudulent misrepresentations (2 U.S.C. § 441h); and &quot;conduit contributions&quot; (2 U.S.C. § 441f).</p>
<p>The new guideline has a base offense level of level 8, which reflects the fact that these offenses, while they are somewhat similar to fraud offenses (sentenced under §2B1.1 (Theft, Property Destruction, and Fraud) at a base offense level of level 6), generally are more serious due to the additional harm, or the potential harm, of corrupting the elective process.</p>
<p>The new guideline provides five specific offense characteristics to ensure appropriate penalty enhancements for aggravating conduct which may occur during the commission of certain campaign finance offenses. First, the new guideline provides a specific offense characteristic, at §2C1.8(b)(1), that uses the fraud loss table in §2B1.1 to incrementally increase the offense level in proportion to the monetary amounts involved in the illegal transactions. This both assures proportionality with penalties for fraud offenses and responds to Congress’ directive to provide an enhancement for &quot;a large aggregate amount of illegal contributions.&quot;</p>
<p>Second, the new guideline provides alternative enhancements, at §2C1.8(b)(2), if the offense involved a foreign national (two levels) or a foreign government (four levels). These enhancements respond to another specific directive in the BCRA and reflect the seriousness of foreign entities attempting to tamper with the United States’ election processes.</p>
<p>Third, the new guideline provides alternative two level enhancements, at §2C1.8(b)(3), when the offense involves either &quot;governmental funds,&quot; defined broadly to include Federal, State, or local funds, or an intent to derive &quot;a specific, identifiable non-monetary Federal benefit&quot; (<em>e.g.</em>, a presidential pardon). Each of these enhancements responds to specific directives of the BCRA.</p>
<p>Fourth, the new guideline provides a two level enhancement, at subsection (b)(4), when the offender engages in &quot;30 or more illegal transactions.&quot; After a review of all campaign finance cases in the Commission’s datafile, the Commission chose 30 transactions as the number best illustrative of a &quot;large number&quot; in that context. This enhancement also responds to a specific directive in the BCRA to the effect that the Commission provide enhanced sentencing for cases involving &quot;a large number of illegal transactions.&quot;</p>
<p>Fifth, the new guideline provides a 4 level enhancement, at §2C1.8(b)(5), if the offense involves the use of &quot;intimidation, threat of pecuniary or other harm, or coercion.&quot; This enhancement responds to information received from the Federal Election Commission and the Public Integrity Section of the Department of Justice which characterizes offenses of this type as some of the most aggravated offenses committed under the FECA.</p>
<p>The new guideline also provides a cross reference, at subsection _c_, which directs the sentencing court to apply either §2C1.1 or §2C1.2, as appropriate, if the offense involved a bribe or a gratuity and the resulting offense level would be greater than that determined under §2C1.8.</p>
<p>Section 3D1.2 (Groups of Closely Related Counts) has been amended, consistent with the principles underlying the rules for grouping multiple counts of conviction, to include §2C1.8 offenses among those in which the offense level is determined largely on the basis of the total amount of harm or loss or some other measure of aggregate harm. (<em>See</em> §3D1.2(d)).</p>
<p>Finally, §5E1.2 (Fines for Individual Defendants) has been amended to specifically reflect fine provisions unique to the FECA. This part of the amendment also provides that the defendant’s participation in a conciliation agreement with the Federal Election Commission may be an appropriate factor for use in determining the specific fine within the applicable fine guideline range unless the defendant began negotiations with the Federal Election Commission after the defendant became aware that he or it was the subject of a criminal investigation.</p>

<p>AND GENERAL APPLICATION PRINCIPLES&quot;.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Chapter One is amended by striking Part A as follows:</p>
<p>&quot; PART A - INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>1. <em>Authority</em></p>
<p>The United States Sentencing Commission (‘Commission’) is an independent agency in the judicial branch composed of seven voting and two non-voting, <em>ex officio</em> members. Its principal purpose is to establish sentencing policies and practices for the federal criminal justice system that will assure the ends of justice by promulgating detailed guidelines prescribing the appropriate sentences for offenders convicted of federal crimes.</p>
<p>The guidelines and policy statements promulgated by the Commission are issued pursuant to Section 994(a) of Title 28, United States Code.</p>
<p>2. <em>The Statutory Mission</em></p>
<p>The Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 (Title II of the Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984) provides for the development of guidelines that will further the basic purposes of criminal punishment: deterrence, incapacitation, just punishment, and rehabilitation. The Act delegates broad authority to the Commission to review and rationalize the federal sentencing process.</p>
<p>The Act contains detailed instructions as to how this determination should be made, the most important of which directs the Commission to create categories of offense behavior and offender characteristics. An offense behavior category might consist, for example, of ‘bank robbery/committed with a gun/$2500 taken.’ An offender characteristic category might be ‘offender with one prior conviction not resulting in imprisonment.’ The Commission is required to prescribe guideline ranges that specify an appropriate sentence for each class of convicted persons determined by coordinating the offense behavior categories with the offender characteristic categories. Where the guidelines call for imprisonment, the range must be narrow: the maximum of the range cannot exceed the minimum by more than the greater of 25 percent or six months. 28 U.S.C. § 994(b)(2).</p>
<p>Pursuant to the Act, the sentencing court must select a sentence from within the guideline range. If, however, a particular case presents atypical features, the Act allows the court to depart from the guidelines and sentence outside the prescribed range. In that case, the court must specify reasons for departure. 18 U.S.C. § 3553(b). If the court sentences within the guideline range, an appellate court may review the sentence to determine whether the guidelines were correctly applied. If the court departs from the guideline range, an appellate court may review the reasonableness of the departure. 18 U.S.C. § 3742. The Act also abolishes parole, and substantially reduces and restructures good behavior adjustments.</p>
<p>The Commission’s initial guidelines were submitted to Congress on April 13, 1987. After the prescribed period of Congressional review, the guidelines took effect on November 1, 1987, and apply to all offenses committed on or after that date. The Commission has the authority to submit guideline amendments each year to Congress between the beginning of a regular Congressional session and May 1. Such amendments automatically take effect 180 days after submission unless a law is enacted to the contrary. 28 U.S.C. § 994(p).</p>
<p>The initial sentencing guidelines and policy statements were developed after extensive hearings, deliberation, and consideration of substantial public comment. The Commission emphasizes, however, that it views the guideline-writing process as evolutionary. It expects, and the governing statute anticipates, that continuing research, experience, and analysis will result in modifications and revisions to the guidelines through submission of amendments to Congress. To this end, the Commission is established as a permanent agency to monitor sentencing practices in the federal courts.</p>
<p>3. <em>The Basic Approach</em> (Policy Statement)</p>
<p>To understand the guidelines and their underlying rationale, it is important to focus on the three objectives that Congress sought to achieve in enacting the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984. The Act’s basic objective was to enhance the ability of the criminal justice system to combat crime through an effective, fair sentencing system. To achieve this end, Congress first sought honesty in sentencing. It sought to avoid the confusion and implicit deception that arose out of the pre-guidelines sentencing system which required the court to impose an indeterminate sentence of imprisonment and empowered the parole commission to determine how much of the sentence an offender actually would serve in prison. This practice usually resulted in a substantial reduction in the effective length of the sentence imposed, with defendants often serving only about one-third of the sentence imposed by the court.</p>
<p>Second, Congress sought reasonable uniformity in sentencing by narrowing the wide disparity in sentences imposed for similar criminal offenses committed by similar offenders. Third, Congress sought proportionality in sentencing through a system that imposes appropriately different sentences for criminal conduct of differing severity.</p>
<p>Honesty is easy to achieve: the abolition of parole makes the sentence imposed by the court the sentence the offender will serve, less approximately fifteen percent for good behavior. There is a tension, however, between the mandate of uniformity and the mandate of proportionality. Simple uniformity -- sentencing every offender to five years -- destroys proportionality. Having only a few simple categories of crimes would make the guidelines uniform and easy to administer, but might lump together offenses that are different in important respects. For example, a single category for robbery that included armed and unarmed robberies, robberies with and without injuries, robberies of a few dollars and robberies of millions, would be far too broad.</p>
<p>A sentencing system tailored to fit every conceivable wrinkle of each case would quickly become unworkable and seriously compromise the certainty of punishment and its deterrent effect. For example: a bank robber with (or without) a gun, which the robber kept hidden (or brandished), might have frightened (or merely warned), injured seriously (or less seriously), tied up (or simply pushed) a guard, teller, or customer, at night (or at noon), in an effort to obtain money for other crimes (or for other purposes), in the company of a few (or many) other robbers, for the first (or fourth) time.</p>
<p>The list of potentially relevant features of criminal behavior is long; the fact that they can occur in multiple combinations means that the list of possible permutations of factors is virtually endless. The appropriate relationships among these different factors are exceedingly difficult to establish, for they are often context specific. Sentencing courts do not treat the occurrence of a simple bruise identically in all cases, irrespective of whether that bruise occurred in the context of a bank robbery or in the context of a breach of peace. This is so, in part, because the risk that such a harm will occur differs depending on the underlying offense with which it is connected; and also because, in part, the relationship between punishment and multiple harms is not simply additive. The relation varies depending on how much other harm has occurred. Thus, it would not be proper to assign points for each kind of harm and simply add them up, irrespective of context and total amounts.</p>
<p>The larger the number of subcategories of offense and offender characteristics included in the guidelines, the greater the complexity and the less workable the system. Moreover, complex combinations of offense and offender characteristics would apply and interact in unforeseen ways to unforeseen situations, thus failing to cure the unfairness of a simple, broad category system. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, probation officers and courts, in applying a complex system having numerous subcategories, would be required to make a host of decisions regarding whether the underlying facts were sufficient to bring the case within a particular subcategory. The greater the number of decisions required and the greater their complexity, the greater the risk that different courts would apply the guidelines differently to situations that, in fact, are similar, thereby reintroducing the very disparity that the guidelines were designed to reduce.</p>
<p>In view of the arguments, it would have been tempting to retreat to the simple, broad category approach and to grant courts the discretion to select the proper point along a broad sentencing range. Granting such broad discretion, however, would have risked correspondingly broad disparity in sentencing, for different courts may exercise their discretionary powers in different ways. Such an approach would have risked a return to the wide disparity that Congress established the Commission to reduce and would have been contrary to the Commission’s mandate set forth in the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984.</p>
<p>In the end, there was no completely satisfying solution to this problem. The Commission had to balance the comparative virtues and vices of broad, simple categorization and detailed, complex subcategorization, and within the constraints established by that balance, minimize the discretionary powers of the sentencing court. Any system will, to a degree, enjoy the benefits and suffer from the drawbacks of each approach.</p>
<p>A philosophical problem arose when the Commission attempted to reconcile the differing perceptions of the purposes of criminal punishment. Most observers of the criminal law agree that the ultimate aim of the law itself, and of punishment in particular, is the control of crime. Beyond this point, however, the consensus seems to break down. Some argue that appropriate punishment should be defined primarily on the basis of the principle of ‘just deserts.’ Under this principle, punishment should be scaled to the offender’s culpability and the resulting harms. Others argue that punishment should be imposed primarily on the basis of practical ‘crime control’ considerations. This theory calls for sentences that most effectively lessen the likelihood of future crime, either by deterring others or incapacitating the defendant.</p>
<p>Adherents of each of these points of view urged the Commission to choose between them and accord one primacy over the other. As a practical matter, however, this choice was unnecessary because in most sentencing decisions the application of either philosophy will produce the same or similar results.</p>
<p>In its initial set of guidelines, the Commission sought to solve both the practical and philosophical problems of developing a coherent sentencing system by taking an empirical approach that used as a starting point data estimating pre-guidelines sentencing practice. It analyzed data drawn from 10,000 presentence investigations, the differing elements of various crimes as distinguished in substantive criminal statutes, the United States Parole Commission’s guidelines and statistics, and data from other relevant sources in order to determine which distinctions were important in pre-guidelines practice. After consideration, the Commission accepted, modified, or rationalized these distinctions.</p>
<p>This empirical approach helped the Commission resolve its practical problem by defining a list of relevant distinctions that, although of considerable length, was short enough to create a manageable set of guidelines. Existing categories are relatively broad and omit distinctions that some may believe important, yet they include most of the major distinctions that statutes and data suggest made a significant difference in sentencing decisions. Relevant distinctions not reflected in the guidelines probably will occur rarely and sentencing courts may take such unusual cases into account by departing from the guidelines.</p>
<p>The Commission’s empirical approach also helped resolve its philosophical dilemma. Those who adhere to a just deserts philosophy may concede that the lack of consensus might make it difficult to say exactly what punishment is deserved for a particular crime. Likewise, those who subscribe to a philosophy of crime control may acknowledge that the lack of sufficient data might make it difficult to determine exactly the punishment that will best prevent that crime. Both groups might therefore recognize the wisdom of looking to those distinctions that judges and legislators have, in fact, made over the course of time. These established distinctions are ones that the community believes, or has found over time, to be important from either a just deserts or crime control perspective.</p>
<p>The Commission did not simply copy estimates of pre-guidelines practice as revealed by the data, even though establishing offense values on this basis would help eliminate disparity because the data represent averages. Rather, it departed from the data at different points for various important reasons. Congressional statutes, for example, suggested or required departure, as in the case of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986 that imposed increased and mandatory minimum sentences. In addition, the data revealed inconsistencies in treatment, such as punishing economic crime less severely than other apparently equivalent behavior.</p>
<p>Despite these policy-oriented departures from pre-guidelines practice, the guidelines represent an approach that begins with, and builds upon, empirical data. The guidelines will not please those who wish the Commission to adopt a single philosophical theory and then work deductively to establish a simple and perfect set of categorizations and distinctions. The guidelines may prove acceptable, however, to those who seek more modest, incremental improvements in the status quo, who believe the best is often the enemy of the good, and who recognize that these guidelines are, as the Act contemplates, but the first step in an evolutionary process. After spending considerable time and resources exploring alternative approaches, the Commission developed these guidelines as a practical effort toward the achievement of a more honest, uniform, equitable, proportional, and therefore effective sentencing system.</p>
<p>4. <em>The Guidelines’ Resolution of Major Issues</em> (Policy Statement)</p>
<p>The guideline-drafting process required the Commission to resolve a host of important policy questions typically involving rather evenly balanced sets of competing considerations. As an aid to understanding the guidelines, this introduction briefly discusses several of those issues; commentary in the guidelines explains others.</p>
<p>(a) <em>Real Offense vs. Charge Offense Sentencing</em>.</p>
<p>One of the most important questions for the Commission to decide was whether to base sentences upon the actual conduct in which the defendant engaged regardless of the charges for which he was indicted or convicted (‘real offense’ sentencing), or upon the conduct that constitutes the elements of the offense for which the defendant was charged and of which he was convicted (‘charge offense’ sentencing). A bank robber, for example, might have used a gun, frightened bystanders, taken $50,000, injured a teller, refused to stop when ordered, and raced away damaging property during his escape. A pure real offense system would sentence on the basis of all identifiable conduct. A pure charge offense system would overlook some of the harms that did not constitute statutory elements of the offenses of which the defendant was convicted.</p>
<p>The Commission initially sought to develop a pure real offense system. After all, the pre-guidelines sentencing system was, in a sense, this type of system. The sentencing court and the parole commission took account of the conduct in which the defendant actually engaged, as determined in a presentence report, at the sentencing hearing, or before a parole commission hearing officer. The Commission’s initial efforts in this direction, carried out in the spring and early summer of 1986, proved unproductive, mostly for practical reasons. To make such a system work, even to formalize and rationalize the status quo, would have required the Commission to decide precisely which harms to take into account, how to add them up, and what kinds of procedures the courts should use to determine the presence or absence of disputed factual elements. The Commission found no practical way to combine and account for the large number of diverse harms arising in different circumstances; nor did it find a practical way to reconcile the need for a fair adjudicatory procedure with the need for a speedy sentencing process given the potential existence of hosts of adjudicated ‘real harm’ facts in many typical cases. The effort proposed as a solution to these problems required the use of, for example, quadratic roots and other mathematical operations that the Commission considered too complex to be workable. In the Commission’s view, such a system risked return to wide disparity in sentencing practice.</p>
<p>In its initial set of guidelines submitted to Congress in April 1987, the Commission moved closer to a charge offense system. This system, however, does contain a significant number of real offense elements. For one thing, the hundreds of overlapping and duplicative statutory provisions that make up the federal criminal law forced the Commission to write guidelines that are descriptive of generic conduct rather than guidelines that track purely statutory language. For another, the guidelines take account of a number of important, commonly occurring real offense elements such as role in the offense, the presence of a gun, or the amount of money actually taken, through alternative base offense levels, specific offense characteristics, cross references, and adjustments.</p>
<p>The Commission recognized that a charge offense system has drawbacks of its own. One of the most important is the potential it affords prosecutors to influence sentences by increasing or decreasing the number of counts in an indictment. Of course, the defendant’s actual conduct (that which the prosecutor can prove in court) imposes a natural limit upon the prosecutor’s ability to increase a defendant’s sentence. Moreover, the Commission has written its rules for the treatment of multicount convictions with an eye toward eliminating unfair treatment that might flow from count manipulation. For example, the guidelines treat a three-count indictment, each count of which charges sale of 100 grams of heroin or theft of $10,000, the same as a single-count indictment charging sale of 300 grams of heroin or theft of $30,000. Furthermore, a sentencing court may control any inappropriate manipulation of the indictment through use of its departure power. Finally, the Commission will closely monitor charging and plea agreement practices and will make appropriate adjustments should they become necessary.</p>
<p>(b) <em>Departures</em>.</p>
<p>The sentencing statute permits a court to depart from a guideline-specified sentence only when it finds ‘an aggravating or mitigating circumstance of a kind, or to a degree, not adequately taken into consideration by the Sentencing Commission in formulating the guidelines that should result in a sentence different from that described.’ 18 U.S.C. § 3553(b). The Commission intends the sentencing courts to treat each guideline as carving out a ‘heartland,’ a set of typical cases embodying the conduct that each guideline describes. When a court finds an atypical case, one to which a particular guideline linguistically applies but where conduct significantly differs from the norm, the court may consider whether a departure is warranted. Section 5H1.10 (Race, Sex, National Origin, Creed, Religion, and Socio-Economic Status), §5H1.12 (Lack of Guidance as a Youth and Similar Circumstances), the third sentence of §5H1.4 (Physical Condition, Including Drug or Alcohol Dependence or Abuse), the last sentence of §5K2.12 (Coercion and Duress), and §5K2.19 (Post-Sentencing Rehabilitative Efforts) list several factors that the court cannot take into account as grounds for departure. With those specific exceptions, however, the Commission does not intend to limit the kinds of factors, whether or not mentioned anywhere else in the guidelines, that could constitute grounds for departure in an unusual case.</p>
<p>The Commission has adopted this departure policy for two reasons. First, it is difficult to prescribe a single set of guidelines that encompasses the vast range of human conduct potentially relevant to a sentencing decision. The Commission also recognizes that the initial set of guidelines need not do so. The Commission is a permanent body, empowered by law to write and rewrite guidelines, with progressive changes, over many years. By monitoring when courts depart from the guidelines and by analyzing their stated reasons for doing so and court decisions with references thereto, the Commission, over time, will be able to refine the guidelines to specify more precisely when departures should and should not be permitted.</p>
<p>Second, the Commission believes that despite the courts’ legal freedom to depart from the guidelines, they will not do so very often. This is because the guidelines, offense by offense, seek to take account of those factors that the Commission’s data indicate made a significant difference in pre-guidelines sentencing practice. Thus, for example, where the presence of physical injury made an important difference in pre-guidelines sentencing practice (as in the case of robbery or assault), the guidelines specifically include this factor to enhance the sentence. Where the guidelines do not specify an augmentation or diminution, this is generally because the sentencing data did not permit the Commission to conclude that the factor was empirically important in relation to the particular offense. Of course, an important factor (<em>e.g.</em>, physical injury) may infrequently occur in connection with a particular crime (<em>e.g.</em>, fraud). Such rare occurrences are precisely the type of events that the courts’ departure powers were designed to cover -- unusual cases outside the range of the more typical offenses for which the guidelines were designed.</p>
<p>It is important to note that the guidelines refer to two different kinds of departure. The first involves instances in which the guidelines provide specific guidance for departure by analogy or by other numerical or non-numerical suggestions. The Commission intends such suggestions as policy guidance for the courts. The Commission expects that most departures will reflect the suggestions and that the courts of appeals may prove more likely to find departures ‘unreasonable’ where they fall outside suggested levels.</p>
<p>A second type of departure will remain unguided. It may rest upon grounds referred to in Chapter Five, Part K (Departures) or on grounds not mentioned in the guidelines. While Chapter Five, Part K lists factors that the Commission believes may constitute grounds for departure, the list is not exhaustive. The Commission recognizes that there may be other grounds for departure that are not mentioned; it also believes there may be cases in which a departure outside suggested levels is warranted. In its view, however, such cases will be highly infrequent.</p>
<p>(c) <em>Plea Agreements</em>.</p>
<p>Nearly ninety percent of all federal criminal cases involve guilty pleas and many of these cases involve some form of plea agreement. Some commentators on early Commission guideline drafts urged the Commission not to attempt any major reforms of the plea agreement process on the grounds that any set of guidelines that threatened to change pre-guidelines practice radically also threatened to make the federal system unmanageable. Others argued that guidelines that failed to control and limit plea agreements would leave untouched a ‘loophole’ large enough to undo the good that sentencing guidelines would bring.</p>
<p>The Commission decided not to make major changes in plea agreement practices in the initial guidelines, but rather to provide guidance by issuing general policy statements concerning the acceptance of plea agreements in Chapter Six, Part B (Plea Agreements). The rules set forth in Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(e) govern the acceptance or rejection of such agreements. The Commission will collect data on the courts’ plea practices and will analyze this information to determine when and why the courts accept or reject plea agreements and whether plea agreement practices are undermining the intent of the Sentencing Reform Act. In light of this information and analysis, the Commission will seek to further regulate the plea agreement process as appropriate. Importantly, if the policy statements relating to plea agreements are followed, circumvention of the Sentencing Reform Act and the guidelines should not occur.</p>
<p>The Commission expects the guidelines to have a positive, rationalizing impact upon plea agreements for two reasons. First, the guidelines create a clear, definite expectation in respect to the sentence that a court will impose if a trial takes place. In the event a prosecutor and defense attorney explore the possibility of a negotiated plea, they will no longer work in the dark. This fact alone should help to reduce irrationality in respect to actual sentencing outcomes. Second, the guidelines create a norm to which courts will likely refer when they decide whether, under Rule 11(e), to accept or to reject a plea agreement or recommendation.</p>
<p>(d) <em>Probation and Split Sentences</em>.</p>
<p>The statute provides that the guidelines are to ‘reflect the general appropriateness of imposing a sentence other than imprisonment in cases in which the defendant is a first offender who has not been convicted of a crime of violence or an otherwise serious offense . . . .’ 28 U.S.C. § 994(j). Under pre-guidelines sentencing practice, courts sentenced to probation an inappropriately high percentage of offenders guilty of certain economic crimes, such as theft, tax evasion, antitrust offenses, insider trading, fraud, and embezzlement, that in the Commission’s view are ‘serious.’</p>
<p>The Commission’s solution to this problem has been to write guidelines that classify as serious many offenses for which probation previously was frequently given and provide for at least a short period of imprisonment in such cases. The Commission concluded that the definite prospect of prison, even though the term may be short, will serve as a significant deterrent, particularly when compared with pre-guidelines practice where probation, not prison, was the norm.</p>
<p>More specifically, the guidelines work as follows in respect to a first offender. For offense levels one through eight, the sentencing court may elect to sentence the offender to probation (with or without confinement conditions) or to a prison term. For offense levels nine and ten, the court may substitute probation for a prison term, but the probation must include confinement conditions (community confinement, intermittent confinement, or home detention). For offense levels eleven and twelve, the court must impose at least one-half the minimum confinement sentence in the form of prison confinement, the remainder to be served on supervised release with a condition of community confinement or home detention. The Commission, of course, has not dealt with the single acts of aberrant behavior that still may justify probation at higher offense levels through departures.*</p>
<p>*Note: Although the Commission had not addressed ‘single acts of aberrant behavior’ at the time the Introduction to the <em>Guidelines</em> <em>Manual</em> originally was written, it subsequently addressed the issue in Amendment 603, effective November 1, 2000. (<em>See</em> Supplement to Appendix C, amendment 603.)</p>
<p>(e) <em>Multi-Count Convictions</em>.</p>
<p>The Commission, like several state sentencing commissions, has found it particularly difficult to develop guidelines for sentencing defendants convicted of multiple violations of law, each of which makes up a separate count in an indictment. The difficulty is that when a defendant engages in conduct that causes several harms, each additional harm, even if it increases the extent to which punishment is warranted, does not necessarily warrant a proportionate increase in punishment. A defendant who assaults others during a fight, for example, may warrant more punishment if he injures ten people than if he injures one, but his conduct does not necessarily warrant ten times the punishment. If it did, many of the simplest offenses, for reasons that are often fortuitous, would lead to sentences of life imprisonment -- sentences that neither just deserts nor crime control theories of punishment would justify.</p>
<p>Several individual guidelines provide special instructions for increasing punishment when the conduct that is the subject of that count involves multiple occurrences or has caused several harms. The guidelines also provide general rules for aggravating punishment in light of multiple harms charged separately in separate counts. These rules may produce occasional anomalies, but normally they will permit an appropriate degree of aggravation of punishment for multiple offenses that are the subjects of separate counts.</p>
<p>These rules are set out in Chapter Three, Part D (Multiple Counts). They essentially provide: (1) when the conduct involves fungible items (<em>e.g.</em>, separate drug transactions or thefts of money), the amounts are added and the guidelines apply to the total amount; (2) when nonfungible harms are involved, the offense level for the most serious count is increased (according to a diminishing scale) to reflect the existence of other counts of conviction. The guidelines have been written in order to minimize the possibility that an arbitrary casting of a single transaction into several counts will produce a longer sentence. In addition, the sentencing court will have adequate power to prevent such a result through departures.</p>
<p>(f) <em>Regulatory Offenses</em>.</p>
<p>Regulatory statutes, though primarily civil in nature, sometimes contain criminal provisions in respect to particularly harmful activity. Such criminal provisions often describe not only substantive offenses, but also more technical, administratively-related offenses such as failure to keep accurate records or to provide requested information. These statutes pose two problems: first, which criminal regulatory provisions should the Commission initially consider, and second, how should it treat technical or administratively-related criminal violations?</p>
<p>In respect to the first problem, the Commission found that it could not comprehensively treat all regulatory violations in the initial set of guidelines. There are hundreds of such provisions scattered throughout the United States Code. To find all potential violations would involve examination of each individual federal regulation. Because of this practical difficulty, the Commission sought to determine, with the assistance of the Department of Justice and several regulatory agencies, which criminal regulatory offenses were particularly important in light of the need for enforcement of the general regulatory scheme. The Commission addressed these offenses in the initial guidelines.</p>
<p>In respect to the second problem, the Commission has developed a system for treating technical recordkeeping and reporting offenses that divides them into four categories. First, in the simplest of cases, the offender may have failed to fill out a form intentionally, but without knowledge or intent that substantive harm would likely follow. He might fail, for example, to keep an accurate record of toxic substance transport, but that failure may not lead, nor be likely to lead, to the release or improper handling of any toxic substance. Second, the same failure may be accompanied by a significant likelihood that substantive harm will occur; it may make a release of a toxic substance more likely. Third, the same failure may have led to substantive harm. Fourth, the failure may represent an effort to conceal a substantive harm that has occurred.</p>
<p>The structure of a typical guideline for a regulatory offense provides a low base offense level (<em>e.g.</em>, 6) aimed at the first type of recordkeeping or reporting offense. Specific offense characteristics designed to reflect substantive harms that do occur in respect to some regulatory offenses, or that are likely to occur, increase the offense level. A specific offense characteristic also provides that a recordkeeping or reporting offense that conceals a substantive offense will have the same offense level as the substantive offense.</p>
<p>(g) <em>Sentencing Ranges</em>.</p>
<p>In determining the appropriate sentencing ranges for each offense, the Commission estimated the average sentences served within each category under the pre-guidelines sentencing system. It also examined the sentences specified in federal statutes, in the parole guidelines, and in other relevant, analogous sources. The Commission’s Supplementary Report on the Initial Sentencing Guidelines (1987) contains a comparison between estimates of pre-guidelines sentencing practice and sentences under the guidelines.</p>
<p>While the Commission has not considered itself bound by pre-guidelines sentencing practice, it has not attempted to develop an entirely new system of sentencing on the basis of theory alone. Guideline sentences, in many instances, will approximate average pre-guidelines practice and adherence to the guidelines will help to eliminate wide disparity. For example, where a high percentage of persons received probation under pre-guidelines practice, a guideline may include one or more specific offense characteristics in an effort to distinguish those types of defendants who received probation from those who received more severe sentences. In some instances, short sentences of incarceration for all offenders in a category have been substituted for a pre-guidelines sentencing practice of very wide variability in which some defendants received probation while others received several years in prison for the same offense. Moreover, inasmuch as those who pleaded guilty under pre-guidelines practice often received lesser sentences, the guidelines permit the court to impose lesser sentences on those defendants who accept responsibility for their misconduct. For defendants who provide substantial assistance to the government in the investigation or prosecution of others, a downward departure may be warranted.</p>
<p>The Commission has also examined its sentencing ranges in light of their likely impact upon prison population. Specific legislation, such as the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986 and the career offender provisions of the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 (28 U.S.C. § 994(h)), required the Commission to promulgate guidelines that will lead to substantial prison population increases. These increases will occur irrespective of the guidelines. The guidelines themselves, insofar as they reflect policy decisions made by the Commission (rather than legislated mandatory minimum or career offender sentences), are projected to lead to an increase in prison population that computer models, produced by the Commission and the Bureau of Prisons in 1987, estimated at approximately 10 percent over a period of ten years.</p>
<p>(h) <em>The Sentencing Table</em>.</p>
<p>The Commission has established a sentencing table that for technical and practical reasons contains 43 levels. Each level in the table prescribes ranges that overlap with the ranges in the preceding and succeeding levels. By overlapping the ranges, the table should discourage unnecessary litigation. Both prosecution and defense will realize that the difference between one level and another will not necessarily make a difference in the sentence that the court imposes. Thus, little purpose will be served in protracted litigation trying to determine, for example, whether $10,000 or $11,000 was obtained as a result of a fraud. At the same time, the levels work to increase a sentence proportionately. A change of six levels roughly doubles the sentence irrespective of the level at which one starts. The guidelines, in keeping with the statutory requirement that the maximum of any range cannot exceed the minimum by more than the greater of 25 percent or six months (28 U.S.C. § 994(b)(2)), permit courts to exercise the greatest permissible range of sentencing discretion. The table overlaps offense levels meaningfully, works proportionately, and at the same time preserves the maximum degree of allowable discretion for the court within each level.</p>
<p>Similarly, many of the individual guidelines refer to tables that correlate amounts of money with offense levels. These tables often have many rather than a few levels. Again, the reason is to minimize the likelihood of unnecessary litigation. If a money table were to make only a few distinctions, each distinction would become more important and litigation over which category an offender fell within would become more likely. Where a table has many small monetary distinctions, it minimizes the likelihood of litigation because the precise amount of money involved is of considerably less importance.</p>
<p>5. <em>A Concluding Note</em></p>
<p>The Commission emphasizes that it drafted the initial guidelines with considerable caution. It examined the many hundreds of criminal statutes in the United States Code. It began with those that were the basis for a significant number of prosecutions and sought to place them in a rational order. It developed additional distinctions relevant to the application of these provisions and it applied sentencing ranges to each resulting category. In doing so, it relied upon pre-guidelines sentencing practice as revealed by its own statistical analyses based on summary reports of some 40,000 convictions, a sample of 10,000 augmented presentence reports, the parole guidelines, and policy judgments.</p>
<p>The Commission recognizes that some will criticize this approach as overly cautious, as representing too little a departure from pre-guidelines sentencing practice. Yet, it will cure wide disparity. The Commission is a permanent body that can amend the guidelines each year. Although the data available to it, like all data, are imperfect, experience with the guidelines will lead to additional information and provide a firm empirical basis for consideration of revisions.</p>
<p>Finally, the guidelines will apply to more than 90 percent of all felony and Class A misdemeanor cases in the federal courts. Because of time constraints and the nonexistence of statistical information, some offenses that occur infrequently are not considered in the guidelines. Their exclusion does not reflect any judgment regarding their seriousness and they will be addressed as the Commission refines the guidelines over time.&quot;;</p>

<p>&quot; PART A - AUTHORITY</p>
<p>§1A1.1. <em>Authority</em></p>
<p>The guidelines, policy statements, and commentary set forth in this Guidelines Manual, including amendments thereto, are promulgated by the United States Sentencing Commission pursuant to: (1) section 994(a) of title 28, United States Code; and (2) with respect to guidelines, policy statements, and commentary promulgated or amended pursuant to specific congressional directive, pursuant to the authority contained in that directive in addition to the authority under section 994(a) of title 28, United States Code.</p>
<p><em>Commentary</em></p>
<p><em>Application Note</em>:</p>
<p>1. <em>Historical Review of Original Introduction</em>.—Part A of Chapter One originally was an introduction to the Guidelines Manual that explained a number of policy decisions made by the Commission when it promulgated the initial set of guidelines. This introduction was amended occasionally between 1987 and 2003. In 2003, as part of the Commission’s implementation of the Prosecutorial Remedies and Other Tools to end the Exploitation of Children Today Act of 2003 (the ‘PROTECT Act’, Public Law 108–21), the original introduction was transferred to the Editorial Note at the end of this guideline. The Commission encourages the review of this material for context and historical purposes.</p>
<p><em>Background</em>: The Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 changed the course of federal sentencing. Among other things, the Act created the United States Sentencing Commission as an independent agency in the Judicial Branch, and directed it to develop guidelines and policy statements for sentencing courts to use when sentencing offenders convicted of federal crimes. Moreover, it empowered the Commission with ongoing responsibilities to monitor the guidelines, submit to Congress appropriate modifications of the guidelines and recommended changes in criminal statutes, and establish education and research programs. The mandate rested on Congressional awareness that sentencing was a dynamic field that requires continuing review by an expert body to revise sentencing policies, in light of application experience, as new criminal statutes are enacted, and as more is learned about what motivates and controls criminal behavior.&quot;;</p>
<p>and adding an editorial note following the guideline.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §1B1.1 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended by striking Note 1 as follows:</p>
<p>&quot;1. The following are definitions of terms that are used frequently in the guidelines and are of general applicability (except to the extent expressly modified in respect to a particular guideline or policy statement):</p>
<p>(a) ‘Abducted’ means that a victim was forced to accompany an offender to a different location. For example, a bank robber’s forcing a bank teller from the bank into a getaway car would constitute an abduction.</p>
<p>(b) ‘Bodily injury’ means any significant injury; <em>e.g.</em>, an injury that is painful and obvious, or is of a type for which medical attention ordinarily would be sought.</p>
<p>(c) ‘Brandished’ with reference to a dangerous weapon (including a firearm) means that all or part of the weapon was displayed, or the presence of the weapon was otherwise made known to another person, in order to intimidate that person, regardless of whether the weapon was directly visible to that person. Accordingly, although the dangerous weapon does not have to be directly visible, the weapon must be present.</p>
<p>(d) ‘Dangerous weapon’ means (i) an instrument capable of inflicting death or serious bodily injury; or (ii) an object that is not an instrument capable of inflicting death or serious bodily injury but (I) closely resembles such an instrument; or (II) the defendant used the object in a manner that created the impression that the object was such an instrument (<em>e.g</em>. a defendant wrapped a hand in a towel during a bank robbery to create the appearance of a gun).</p>
<p>(e) ‘Firearm’ means (i) any weapon (including a starter gun) which will or is designed to or may readily be converted to expel a projectile by the action of an explosive; (ii) the frame or receiver of any such weapon; (iii) any firearm muffler or silencer; or (iv) any destructive device. A weapon, commonly known as a ‘BB’ or pellet gun, that uses air or carbon dioxide pressure to expel a projectile is a dangerous weapon but not a firearm.</p>
<p>(f) ‘Otherwise used’ with reference to a dangerous weapon (including a firearm) means that the conduct did not amount to the discharge of a firearm but was more than brandishing, displaying, or possessing a firearm or other dangerous weapon.</p>
<p>(g) ‘Permanent or life-threatening bodily injury’ means injury involving a substantial risk of death; loss or substantial impairment of the function of a bodily member, organ, or mental faculty that is likely to be permanent; or an obvious disfigurement that is likely to be permanent. In the case of a kidnapping, for example, maltreatment to a life-threatening degree (<em>e.g.</em>, by denial of food or medical care) would constitute life-threatening bodily injury.</p>
<p>(h) ‘Physically restrained’ means the forcible restraint of the victim such as by being tied, bound, or locked up.</p>
<p>(i) ‘Serious bodily injury’ means injury involving extreme physical pain or the protracted impairment of a function of a bodily member, organ, or mental faculty; or requiring medical intervention such as surgery, hospitalization, or physical rehabilitation. In addition, ‘serious bodily injury’ is deemed to have occurred if the offense involved conduct constituting criminal sexual abuse under 18 U.S.C. § 2241 or § 2242 or any similar offense under state law.</p>
<p>(j) ‘Destructive device’ means any article described in 26 U.S.C. § 5845(f) (including an explosive, incendiary, or poison gas - (i) bomb, (ii) grenade, (iii) rocket having a propellant charge of more than four ounces, (iv) missile having an explosive or incendiary charge of more than one-quarter ounce, (v) mine, or (vi) device similar to any of the devices described in the preceding clauses).</p>
<p>(k) ‘Offense’ means the offense of conviction and all relevant conduct under §1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct) unless a different meaning is specified or is otherwise clear from the context. The term ‘instant’ is used in connection with ‘offense,’ ‘federal offense,’ or ‘offense of conviction,’ as the case may be, to distinguish the violation for which the defendant is being sentenced from a prior or subsequent offense, or from an offense before another court (<em>e.g.</em>, an offense before a state court involving the same underlying conduct).&quot;,</p>
<p>and inserting the following:</p>
<p>&quot;1. The following are definitions of terms that are used frequently in the guidelines and are of general applicability (except to the extent expressly modified in respect to a particular guideline or policy statement):</p>
<p>(A) ‘Abducted’ means that a victim was forced to accompany an offender to a different location. For example, a bank robber’s forcing a bank teller from the bank into a getaway car would constitute an abduction.</p>
<p>(B) ‘Bodily injury’ means any significant injury; <em>e.g.</em>, an injury that is painful and obvious, or is of a type for which medical attention ordinarily would be sought.</p>
<p>(C) ‘Brandished’ with reference to a dangerous weapon (including a firearm) means that all or part of the weapon was displayed, or the presence of the weapon was otherwise made known to another person, in order to intimidate that person, regardless of whether the weapon was directly visible to that person. Accordingly, although the dangerous weapon does not have to be directly visible, the weapon must be present.</p>
<p>(D) ‘Dangerous weapon’ means (i) an instrument capable of inflicting death or serious bodily injury; or (ii) an object that is not an instrument capable of inflicting death or serious bodily injury but (I) closely resembles such an instrument; or (II) the defendant used the object in a manner that created the impression that the object was such an instrument (<em>e.g.</em> a defendant wrapped a hand in a towel during a bank robbery to create the appearance of a gun).</p>
<p>(E) ‘Departure’ means (i) for purposes other than those specified in subdivision (ii), imposition of a sentence outside the applicable guideline range or of a sentence that is otherwise different from the guideline sentence; and (ii) for purposes of §4A1.3 (Departures Based on Inadequacy of Criminal History Category), assignment of a criminal history category other than the otherwise applicable criminal history category, in order to effect a sentence outside the applicable guideline range. ‘Depart’ means grant a departure.</p>
<p>‘Downward departure’ means departure that effects a sentence less than a sentence that could be imposed under the applicable guideline range or a sentence that is otherwise less than the guideline sentence. ‘Depart downward’ means grant a downward departure.</p>
<p>‘Upward departure’ means departure that effects a sentence greater than a sentence that could be imposed under the applicable guideline range or a sentence that is otherwise greater than the guideline sentence. ‘Depart upward’ means grant an upward departure.</p>
<p>(F) ‘Destructive device’ means any article described in 26 U.S.C. § 5845(f) (including an explosive, incendiary, or poison gas - (i) bomb, (ii) grenade, (iii) rocket having a propellant charge of more than four ounces, (iv) missile having an explosive or incendiary charge of more than one-quarter ounce, (v) mine, or (vi) device similar to any of the devices described in the preceding clauses).</p>
<p>(G) ‘Firearm’ means (i) any weapon (including a starter gun) which will or is designed to or may readily be converted to expel a projectile by the action of an explosive; (ii) the frame or receiver of any such weapon; (iii) any firearm muffler or silencer; or (iv) any destructive device. A weapon, commonly known as a ‘BB’ or pellet gun, that uses air or carbon dioxide pressure to expel a projectile is a dangerous weapon but not a firearm.</p>
<p>(H) ‘Offense’ means the offense of conviction and all relevant conduct under §1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct) unless a different meaning is specified or is otherwise clear from the context. The term ‘instant’ is used in connection with ‘offense,’ ‘federal offense,’ or ‘offense of conviction,’ as the case may be, to distinguish the violation for which the defendant is being sentenced from a prior or subsequent offense, or from an offense before another court (<em>e.g.</em>, an offense before a state court involving the same underlying conduct).</p>
<p>(I) ‘Otherwise used’ with reference to a dangerous weapon (including a firearm) means that the conduct did not amount to the discharge of a firearm but was more than brandishing, displaying, or possessing a firearm or other dangerous weapon.</p>
<p>(J) ‘Permanent or life-threatening bodily injury’ means injury involving a substantial risk of death; loss or substantial impairment of the function of a bodily member, organ, or mental faculty that is likely to be permanent; or an obvious disfigurement that is likely to be permanent. In the case of a kidnapping, for example, maltreatment to a life-threatening degree (<em>e.g.</em>, by denial of food or medical care) would constitute life-threatening bodily injury.</p>
<p>(K) ‘Physically restrained’ means the forcible restraint of the victim such as by being tied, bound, or locked up.</p>
<p>(L) ‘Serious bodily injury’ means injury involving extreme physical pain or the protracted impairment of a function of a bodily member, organ, or mental faculty; or requiring medical intervention such as surgery, hospitalization, or physical rehabilitation. In addition, ‘serious bodily injury’ is deemed to have occurred if the offense involved conduct constituting criminal sexual abuse under 18 U.S.C. § 2241 or § 2242 or any similar offense under state law.&quot;.</p>
<p>Section 2A4.1 is amended by striking:</p>

<p>Section 2A4.1(b) is amended by striking:</p>
<p>&quot;(5) If the victim was sexually exploited:</p>
<p>(A) increase by 3 levels (effective before, but not on or after, May 30, 2003).</p>
<p>(A) increase by 6 levels (effective on and after May 30, 2003).&quot;;</p>
<p>and inserting:</p>
<p>&quot;(5) If the victim was sexually exploited, increase by 6 levels.&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §2A4.1 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended by striking Note 3 as follows:</p>
<p>&quot;3. For the purpose of subsection (b)(4)(C), ‘released’ includes allowing the victim to escape or turning him over to law enforcement authorities without resistance (effective before, but not on or after, May 30, 2003).&quot;;</p>
<p>and by redesignating Notes 4 and 5 and Notes 3 and 4, respectively.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §4A1.1 captioned &quot;Background&quot; is amended by striking &quot;permits information about the significance or similarity of past conduct underlying prior convictions to be used as a basis for imposing a sentence outside the applicable guideline range.&quot; and inserting &quot;authorizes the court to depart from the otherwise applicable criminal history category in certain circumstances.&quot;.</p>
<p>Chapter Four, Part A, Subpart One is amended by striking the following guideline and accompanying commentary:</p>
<p>&quot;§4A1.3. <em>Adequacy of Criminal History Category</em> (Policy Statement)</p>
<p>If reliable information indicates that the criminal history category does not adequately reflect the seriousness of the defendant’s past criminal conduct or the likelihood that the defendant will commit other crimes, the court may consider imposing a sentence departing from the otherwise applicable guideline range. Such information may include, but is not limited to, information concerning:</p>
<p>(a) prior sentence(s) not used in computing the criminal history category (<em>e.g.</em>, sentences for foreign and tribal offenses);</p>
<p>(b) prior sentence(s) of substantially more than one year imposed as a result of independent crimes committed on different occasions;</p>
<p>(c) prior similar misconduct established by a civil adjudication or by a failure to comply with an administrative order;</p>
<p>(d) whether the defendant was pending trial or sentencing on another charge at the time of the instant offense;</p>
<p>(e) prior similar adult criminal conduct not resulting in a criminal conviction.</p>
<p>A departure under this provision is warranted when the criminal history category significantly under-represents the seriousness of the defendant’s criminal history or the likelihood that the defendant will commit further crimes. Examples might include the case of a defendant who (1) had several previous foreign sentences for serious offenses, (2) had received a prior consolidated sentence of ten years for a series of serious assaults, (3) had a similar instance of large scale fraudulent misconduct established by an adjudication in a Securities and Exchange Commission enforcement proceeding, (4) committed the instant offense while on bail or pretrial release for another serious offense, or (5) for appropriate reasons, such as cooperation in the prosecution of other defendants, had previously received an extremely lenient sentence for a serious offense. The court may, after a review of all the relevant information, conclude that the defendant’s criminal history was significantly more serious than that of most defendants in the same criminal history category, and therefore consider an upward departure from the guidelines. However, a prior arrest record itself shall not be considered under §4A1.3.</p>
<p>There may be cases where the court concludes that a defendant’s criminal history category significantly over-represents the seriousness of a defendant’s criminal history or the likelihood that the defendant will commit further crimes. An example might include the case of a defendant with two minor misdemeanor convictions close to ten years prior to the instant offense and no other evidence of prior criminal behavior in the intervening period. The court may conclude that the defendant’s criminal history was significantly less serious than that of most defendants in the same criminal history category (Category II), and therefore consider a downward departure from the guidelines.</p>
<p>In considering a departure under this provision, the Commission intends that the court use, as a reference, the guideline range for a defendant with a higher or lower criminal history category, as applicable. For example, if the court concludes that the defendant’s criminal history category of III significantly under-represents the seriousness of the defendant’s criminal history, and that the seriousness of the defendant’s criminal history most closely resembles that of most defendants with Criminal History Category IV, the court should look to the guideline range specified for a defendant with Criminal History Category IV to guide its departure. The Commission contemplates that there may, on occasion, be a case of an egregious, serious criminal record in which even the guideline range for Criminal History Category VI is not adequate to reflect the seriousness of the defendant’s criminal history. In such a case, a departure above the guideline range for a defendant with Criminal History Category VI may be warranted. In determining whether an upward departure from Criminal History Category VI is warranted, the court should consider that the nature of the prior offenses rather than simply their number is often more indicative of the seriousness of the defendant’s criminal record. For example, a defendant with five prior sentences for very large-scale fraud offenses may have 15 criminal history points, within the range of points typical for Criminal History Category VI, yet have a substantially more serious criminal history overall because of the nature of the prior offenses. On the other hand, a defendant with nine prior 60‑day jail sentences for offenses such as petty larceny, prostitution, or possession of gambling slips has a higher number of criminal history points (18 points) than the typical Criminal History Category VI defendant, but not necessarily a more serious criminal history overall. Where the court determines that the extent and nature of the defendant’s criminal history, taken together, are sufficient to warrant an upward departure from Criminal History Category VI, the court should structure the departure by moving incrementally down the sentencing table to the next higher offense level in Criminal History Category VI until it finds a guideline range appropriate to the case.</p>
<p>However, this provision is not symmetrical. The lower limit of the range for Criminal History Category I is set for a first offender with the lowest risk of recidivism. Therefore, a departure below the lower limit of the guideline range for Criminal History Category I on the basis of the adequacy of criminal history cannot be appropriate.</p>

<p><em>Commentary</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Background</em>: This policy statement recognizes that the criminal history score is unlikely to take into account all the variations in the seriousness of criminal history that may occur. For example, a defendant with an extensive record of serious, assaultive conduct who had received what might now be considered extremely lenient treatment in the past might have the same criminal history category as a defendant who had a record of less serious conduct. Yet, the first defendant’s criminal history clearly may be more serious. This may be particularly true in the case of younger defendants (<em>e.g.</em>, defendants in their early twenties or younger) who are more likely to have received repeated lenient treatment, yet who may actually pose a greater risk of serious recidivism than older defendants. This policy statement authorizes the consideration of a departure from the guidelines in the limited circumstances where reliable information indicates that the criminal history category does not adequately reflect the seriousness of the defendant’s criminal history or likelihood of recidivism, and provides guidance for the consideration of such departures.&quot;,</p>

<p>&quot;§4A1.3. <em>Departures Based on Inadequacy of Criminal History Category</em> (Policy Statement)</p>
<p>(a) UPWARD DEPARTURES.—</p>
<p>(1) STANDARD FOR UPWARD DEPARTURE.—If reliable information indicates that the defendant’s criminal history category substantially under-represents the seriousness of the defendant’s criminal history or the likelihood that the defendant will commit other crimes, an upward departure may be warranted.</p>
<p>(2) TYPES OF INFORMATION FORMING THE BASIS FOR UPWARD DEPARTURE.—The information described in subsection (a) may include information concerning the following:</p>
<p>(A) Prior sentence(s) not used in computing the criminal history category (<em>e.g.</em>, sentences for foreign and tribal offenses).</p>
<p>(B) Prior sentence(s) of substantially more than one year imposed as a result of independent crimes committed on different occasions.</p>
<p>(C) Prior similar misconduct established by a civil adjudication or by a failure to comply with an administrative order.</p>
<p>(D) Whether the defendant was pending trial or sentencing on another charge at the time of the instant offense.</p>
<p>(E) Prior similar adult criminal conduct not resulting in a criminal conviction.</p>
<p>(3) PROHIBITION.—A prior arrest record itself shall not be considered for purposes of an upward departure under this policy statement.</p>
<p>(4) DETERMINATION OF EXTENT OF UPWARD DEPARTURE.—</p>
<p>(A) IN GENERAL.—Except as provided in subdivision (B), the court shall determine the extent of a departure under this subsection by using, as a reference, the criminal history category applicable to defendants whose criminal history or likelihood to recidivate most closely resembles that of the defendant’s.</p>
<p>(B) UPWARD DEPARTURES FROM CATEGORY VI.—In a case in which the court determines that the extent and nature of the defendant’s criminal history, taken together, are sufficient to warrant an upward departure from Criminal History Category VI, the court should structure the departure by moving incrementally down the sentencing table to the next higher offense level in Criminal History Category VI until it finds a guideline range appropriate to the case.</p>
<p>(b) DOWNWARD DEPARTURES.—</p>
<p>(1) STANDARD FOR DOWNWARD DEPARTURE.—If reliable information indicates that the defendant’s criminal history category substantially over-represents the seriousness of the defendant’s criminal history or the likelihood that the defendant will commit other crimes, a downward departure may be warranted.</p>
<p>(2) PROHIBITIONS.—</p>
<p>(A) CRIMINAL HISTORY CATEGORY I.—A departure below the lower limit of the applicable guideline range for Criminal History Category I is prohibited.</p>
<p>(B) ARMED CAREER CRIMINAL AND REPEAT AND DANGEROUS SEX OFFENDER.—A downward departure under this subsection is prohibited for (i) an armed career criminal within the meaning of §4B1.4 (Armed Career Criminal); and (ii) a repeat and dangerous sex offender against minors within the meaning of §4B1.5 (Repeat and Dangerous Sex Offender Against Minors).</p>
<p>(3) LIMITATIONS.—</p>
<p>(A) LIMITATION ON EXTENT OF DOWNWARD DEPARTURE FOR CAREER OFFENDER.—The extent of a downward departure under this subsection for a career offender within the meaning of §4B1.1 (Career Offender) may not exceed one criminal history category.</p>
<p>(B) LIMITATION ON APPLICABILITY OF §5C1.2 IN EVENT OF DOWNWARD DEPARTURE TO CATEGORY I.—A defendant whose criminal history category is Category I after receipt of a downward departure under this subsection does not meet the criterion of subsection (a)(1) of §5C1.2 (Limitation on Applicability of Statutory Maximum Sentences in Certain Cases) if, before receipt of the downward departure, the defendant had more than one criminal history point under §4A1.1 (Criminal History Category).</p>
<p>(c) WRITTEN SPECIFICATION OF BASIS FOR DEPARTURE.—In departing from the otherwise applicable criminal history category under this policy statement, the court shall specify in writing the following:</p>
<p>(1) In the case of an upward departure, the specific reasons why the applicable criminal history category substantially under-represents the seriousness of the defendant’s criminal history or the likelihood that the defendant will commit other crimes.</p>
<p>(2) In the case of a downward departure, the specific reasons why the applicable criminal history category substantially over-represents the seriousness of the defendant’s criminal history or the likelihood that the defendant will commit other crimes.</p>

<p>The Commission has determined that certain circumstances are not ordinarily relevant to the determination of whether a sentence should be outside the applicable guideline range. Unless expressly stated, this does not mean that the Commission views such circumstances as necessarily inappropriate to the determination of the sentence within the applicable guideline range or to the determination of various other incidents of an appropriate sentence (<em>e.g.</em>, the appropriate conditions of probation or supervised release). Furthermore, although these circumstances are not ordinarily relevant to the determination of whether a sentence should be outside the applicable guideline range, they may be relevant to this determination in exceptional cases. They also may be relevant if a combination of such circumstances makes the case an exceptional one, but only if each such circumstance is identified as an affirmative ground for departure and is present in the case to a substantial degree. <em>See</em> §5K2.0 (Grounds for Departure).</p>
<p>In addition, 28 U.S.C. § 994(e) requires the Commission to assure that its guidelines and policy statements reflect the general inappropriateness of considering the defendant’s education, vocational skills, employment record, and family ties and responsibilities in determining whether a term of imprisonment should be imposed or the length of a term of imprisonment.&quot;;</p>

<p>&quot;§5H1.4. <em>Physical Condition, Including Drug or Alcohol Dependence or Abuse</em> (Policy Statement)</p>
<p>Physical condition or appearance, including physique, is not ordinarily relevant in determining whether a sentence should be outside the applicable guideline range. However, an extraordinary physical impairment may be a reason to impose a sentence below the applicable guideline range; <em>e.g.</em>, in the case of a seriously infirm defendant, home detention may be as efficient as, and less costly than, imprisonment.</p>
<p>Drug or alcohol dependence or abuse is not a reason for imposing a sentence below the guidelines. Substance abuse is highly correlated to an increased propensity to commit crime. Due to this increased risk, it is highly recommended that a defendant who is incarcerated also be sentenced to supervised release with a requirement that the defendant participate in an appropriate substance abuse program (<em>see</em> §5D1.3(d)(4)). If participation in a substance abuse program is required, the length of supervised release should take into account the length of time necessary for the supervisory body to judge the success of the program.</p>
<p>Similarly, where a defendant who is a substance abuser is sentenced to probation, it is strongly recommended that the conditions of probation contain a requirement that the defendant participate in an appropriate substance abuse program (<em>see</em> §5B1.3(d)(4)).&quot;,</p>

<p>(B) <em>Departures Based on Loss of Caretaking or Financial Support</em>.—A departure under this policy statement based on the loss of caretaking or financial support of the defendant’s family requires, in addition to the court’s consideration of the non-exhaustive list of circumstances in subdivision (A), the presence of the following circumstances:</p>
<p>(i) The defendant’s service of a sentence within the applicable guideline range will cause a substantial, direct, and specific loss of essential caretaking, or essential financial support, to the defendant’s family.</p>
<p>(ii) The loss of caretaking or financial support substantially exceeds the harm ordinarily incident to incarceration for a similarly situated defendant. For example, the fact that the defendant’s family might incur some degree of financial hardship or suffer to some extent from the absence of a parent through incarceration is not in itself sufficient as a basis for departure because such hardship or suffering is of a sort ordinarily incident to incarceration.</p>
<p>(iii) The loss of caretaking or financial support is one for which no effective remedial or ameliorative programs reasonably are available, making the defendant’s caretaking or financial support irreplaceable to the defendant’s family.</p>

<p>(a) DOWNWARD DEPARTURES IN CRIMINAL CASES OTHER THAN CHILD CRIMES AND SEXUAL OFFENSES.—Under 18 U.S.C. § 3553(b), the sentencing court may impose a sentence outside the range established by the applicable guidelines, if the court finds ‘that there exists an aggravating or mitigating circumstance of a kind, or to a degree, not adequately taken into consideration by the Sentencing Commission in formulating the guidelines that should result in a sentence different from that described.’ Circumstances that may warrant departure from the guideline range pursuant to this provision cannot, by their very nature, be comprehensively listed and analyzed in advance. The decision as to whether and to what extent departure is warranted rests with the sentencing court on a case-specific basis. Nonetheless, this subpart seeks to aid the court by identifying some of the factors that the Commission has not been able to take into account fully in formulating the guidelines. Any case may involve factors in addition to those identified that have not been given adequate consideration by the Commission. Presence of any such factor may warrant departure from the guidelines, under some circumstances, in the discretion of the sentencing court. Similarly, the court may depart from the guidelines, even though the reason for departure is taken into consideration in determining the guideline range (<em>e.g.</em>, as a specific offense characteristic or other adjustment), if the court determines that, in light of unusual circumstances, the weight attached to that factor under the guidelines is inadequate or excessive.</p>
<p>Where, for example, the applicable offense guideline and adjustments do take into consideration a factor listed in this subpart, departure from the applicable guideline range is warranted only if the factor is present to a degree substantially in excess of that which ordinarily is involved in the offense. Thus, disruption of a governmental function, §5K2.7, would have to be quite serious to warrant departure from the guidelines when the applicable offense guideline is bribery or obstruction of justice. When the theft offense guideline is applicable, however, and the theft caused disruption of a governmental function, departure from the applicable guideline range more readily would be appropriate. Similarly, physical injury would not warrant departure from the guidelines when the robbery offense guideline is applicable because the robbery guideline includes a specific adjustment based on the extent of any injury. However, because the robbery guideline does not deal with injury to more than one victim, departure would be warranted if several persons were injured.</p>
<p>Also, a factor may be listed as a specific offense characteristic under one guideline but not under all guidelines. Simply because it was not listed does not mean that there may not be circumstances when that factor would be relevant to sentencing. For example, the use of a weapon has been listed as a specific offense characteristic under many guidelines, but not under other guidelines. Therefore, if a weapon is a relevant factor to sentencing under one of these other guidelines, the court may depart for this reason.</p>
<p>Finally, an offender characteristic or other circumstance that is, in the Commission’s view, ‘not ordinarily relevant’ in determining whether a sentence should be outside the applicable guideline range may be relevant to this determination if such characteristic or circumstance is present to an unusual degree and distinguishes the case from the ‘heartland’ cases covered by the guidelines.</p>
<p>(b) DOWNWARD DEPARTURES IN CHILD CRIMES AND SEXUAL OFFENSES.—Under 18 U.S.C. § 3553(b)(2), the sentencing court may impose a sentence below the range established by the applicable guidelines only if the court finds that there exists a mitigating circumstance of a kind, or to a degree, that—</p>
<p>(1) has been affirmatively and specifically identified as a permissible ground of downward departure in the sentencing guidelines or policy statements issued under section 994(a) of title 28, United States Code, taking account of any amendments to such sentencing guidelines or policy statements by act of Congress;</p>
<p>(2) has not adequately been taken into consideration by the Sentencing Commission in formulating the guidelines; and</p>
<p>(3) should result in a sentence different from that described.</p>
<p>The grounds enumerated in this Part K of Chapter Five are the sole grounds that have been affirmatively and specifically identified as a permissible ground of downward departure in these sentencing guidelines and policy statements. Thus, notwithstanding any other reference to authority to depart downward elsewhere in this Sentencing Manual, a ground of downward departure has not been affirmatively and specifically identified as a permissible ground of downward departure within the meaning of section 3553(b)(2) unless it is expressly enumerated in this Part K as a ground upon which a downward departure may be granted.</p>

<p><em>Commentary</em>*</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[*Section 401(m)(2)(C) of Public Law 108–21 directs the Commission to revise §5K2.0, within 180 days after the date of the enactment of that Public Law, or October 27, 2003, to conform §5K2.0 to changes made by that Public Law, including changes to the appellate standard of review for decisions to depart from the guidelines. That directive has not been implemented yet in the following commentary.]</p>
<p>The United States Supreme Court has determined that, in reviewing a district court’s decision to depart from the guidelines, appellate courts are to apply an abuse of discretion standard, because the decision to depart embodies the traditional exercise of discretion by the sentencing court. <em>Koon v. United States</em>, 518 U.S. 81 (1996). Furthermore,‘[b]efore a departure is permitted, certain aspects of the case must be found unusual enough for it to fall outside the heartland of cases in the Guideline. To resolve this question, the district court must make a refined assessment of the many facts bearing on the outcome, informed by its vantage point and day-to-day experience in criminal sentencing. Whether a given factor is present to a degree not adequately considered by the Commission, or whether a discouraged factor nonetheless justifies departure because it is present in some unusual or exceptional way, are matters determined in large part by comparison with the facts of other Guidelines cases. District Courts have an institutional advantage over appellate courts in making these sorts of determinations, especially as they see so many more Guidelines cases than appellate courts do.’ <em>Id</em>. at 98.</p>
<p>The last paragraph of subsection (a) sets forth the conditions under which an offender characteristic or other circumstance that is not ordinarily relevant to a departure from the applicable guideline range may be relevant to this determination. The Commission does not foreclose the possibility of an extraordinary case that, because of a combination of such characteristics or circumstances, differs significantly from the &quot;heartland&quot; cases covered by the guidelines in a way that is important to the statutory purposes of sentencing, even though none of the characteristics or circumstances individually distinguishes the case. However, the Commission believes that such cases will be extremely rare.</p>
<p>In the absence of a characteristic or circumstance that distinguishes a case as sufficiently atypical to warrant a sentence different from that called for under the guidelines, a sentence outside the guideline range is not authorized. <em>See</em> 18 U.S.C. § 3553(b). For example, dissatisfaction with the available sentencing range or a preference for a different sentence than that authorized by the guidelines is not an appropriate basis for a sentence outside the applicable guideline range.</p>
<p>Section 401(b)(1) of Public Law 108–21 directly amended this policy statement to add subsection (b), effective April 30, 2003.&quot;,</p>
<p>and inserting:</p>
<p>&quot;§5K2.0. <em>Grounds for Departure</em> (Policy Statement)</p>
<p>(a) UPWARD DEPARTURES IN GENERAL AND DOWNWARD DEPARTURES IN CRIMINAL CASES OTHER THAN CHILD CRIMES AND SEXUAL OFFENSES.—</p>
<p>(1) IN GENERAL.—The sentencing court may depart from the applicable guideline range if—</p>
<p>(A) in the case of offenses other than child crimes and sexual offenses, the court finds, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3553(b)(1), that there exists an aggravating or mitigating circumstance; or</p>
<p>(B) in the case of child crimes and sexual offenses, the court finds, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3553(b)(2)(A)(i), that there exists an aggravating circumstance,</p>
<p>of a kind, or to a degree, not adequately taken into consideration by the Sentencing Commission in formulating the guidelines that, in order to advance the objectives set forth in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(2), should result in a sentence different from that described.</p>
<p>(2) DEPARTURES BASED ON CIRCUMSTANCES OF A KIND NOT ADEQUATELY TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION.—</p>
<p>(A) IDENTIFIED CIRCUMSTANCES.—This subpart (Chapter Five, Part K, Subpart 2 (Other Grounds for Departure)) identifies some of the circumstances that the Commission may have not adequately taken into consideration in determining the applicable guideline range (<em>e.g</em>., as a specific offense characteristic or other adjustment). If any such circumstance is present in the case and has not adequately been taken into consideration in determining the applicable guideline range, a departure consistent with 18 U.S.C. § 3553(b) and the provisions of this subpart may be warranted.</p>
<p>(B) UNIDENTIFIED CIRCUMSTANCES.—A departure may be warranted in the exceptional case in which there is present a circumstance that the Commission has not identified in the guidelines but that nevertheless is relevant to determining the appropriate sentence.</p>
<p>(3) DEPARTURES BASED ON CIRCUMSTANCES PRESENT TO A DEGREE NOT ADEQUATELY TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION.—A departure may be warranted in an exceptional case, even though the circumstance that forms the basis for the departure is taken into consideration in determining the guideline range, if the court determines that such circumstance is present in the offense to a degree substantially in excess of, or substantially below, that which ordinarily is involved in that kind of offense.</p>
<p>(4) DEPARTURES BASED ON NOT ORDINARILY RELEVANT OFFENDER CHARACTERISTICS AND OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES.—An offender characteristic or other circumstance identified in Chapter Five, Part H (Offender Characteristics) or elsewhere in the guidelines as not ordinarily relevant in determining whether a departure is warranted may be relevant to this determination only if such offender characteristic or other circumstance is present to an exceptional degree.</p>
<p>(b) DOWNWARD DEPARTURES IN CHILD CRIMES AND SEXUAL OFFENSES.—Under 18 U.S.C. § 3553(b)(2)(A)(ii), the sentencing court may impose a sentence below the range established by the applicable guidelines only if the court finds that there exists a mitigating circumstance of a kind, or to a degree, that—</p>
<p>(1) has been affirmatively and specifically identified as a permissible ground of downward departure in the sentencing guidelines or policy statements issued under section 994(a) of title 28, United States Code, taking account of any amendments to such sentencing guidelines or policy statements by act of Congress;</p>
<p>(2) has not adequately been taken into consideration by the Sentencing Commission in formulating the guidelines; and</p>
<p>(3) should result in a sentence different from that described.</p>
<p>The grounds enumerated in this Part K of Chapter Five are the sole grounds that have been affirmatively and specifically identified as a permissible ground of downward departure in these sentencing guidelines and policy statements. Thus, notwithstanding any other reference to authority to depart downward elsewhere in this Sentencing Manual, a ground of downward departure has not been affirmatively and specifically identified as a permissible ground of downward departure within the meaning of section 3553(b)(2) unless it is expressly enumerated in this Part K as a ground upon which a downward departure may be granted.</p>
<p>(c) LIMITATION ON DEPARTURES BASED ON MULTIPLE CIRCUMSTANCES.—The court may depart from the applicable guideline range based on a combination of two or more offender characteristics or other circumstances, none of which independently is sufficient to provide a basis for departure, only if—</p>
<p>(1) such offender characteristics or other circumstances, taken together, make the case an exceptional one; and</p>
<p>(2) each such offender characteristic or other circumstance is—</p>
<p>(A) present to a substantial degree; and</p>
<p>(B) identified in the guidelines as a permissible ground for departure, even if such offender characteristic or other circumstance is not ordinarily relevant to a determination of whether a departure is warranted.</p>
<p>(d) PROHIBITED DEPARTURES.—Notwithstanding subsections (a) and (b) of this policy statement, or any other provision in the guidelines, the court may not depart from the applicable guideline range based on any of the following circumstances:</p>
<p>(1) Any circumstance specifically prohibited as a ground for departure in §§5H1.10 (Race, Sex, National Origin, Creed, Religion, and Socio-Economic Status), 5H1.12 (Lack of Guidance as a Youth and Similar Circumstances), the third and last sentences of 5H1.4 (Physical Condition, Including Drug or Alcohol Dependence or Abuse; Gambling Addiction), the last sentence of 5K2.12 (Coercion and Duress), and 5K2.19 (Post-Sentencing Rehabilitative Efforts).</p>
<p>(2) The defendant’s acceptance of responsibility for the offense, which may be taken into account only under §3E1.1 (Acceptance of Responsibility).</p>
<p>(3) The defendant’s aggravating or mitigating role in the offense, which may be taken into account only under §3B1.1 (Aggravating Role) or §3B1.2 (Mitigating Role), respectively.</p>
<p>(4) The defendant’s decision, in and of itself, to plead guilty to the offense or to enter a plea agreement with respect to the offense (<em>i.e</em>., a departure may not be based merely on the fact that the defendant decided to plead guilty or to enter into a plea agreement, but a departure may be based on justifiable, non-prohibited reasons as part of a sentence that is recommended, or agreed to, in the plea agreement and accepted by the court. <em>See</em> §6B1.2 (Standards for Acceptance of Plea Agreement).</p>
<p>(5) The defendant’s fulfillment of restitution obligations only to the extent required by law including the guidelines (<em>i.e</em>., a departure may not be based on unexceptional efforts to remedy the harm caused by the offense).</p>
<p>(6) Any other circumstance specifically prohibited as a ground for departure in the guidelines.</p>
<p>(e) REQUIREMENT OF SPECIFIC WRITTEN REASONS FOR DEPARTURE.—If the court departs from the applicable guideline range, it shall state, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3553(c), its specific reasons for departure in open court at the time of sentencing and, with limited exception in the case of statements received <em>in camera</em>, shall state those reasons with specificity in the written judgment and commitment order.</p>

<p><em>Commentary</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Application Notes</em>:</p>
<p>1. <em>Definitions</em>.—For purposes of this policy statement:</p>
<p>‘Circumstance’ includes, as appropriate, an offender characteristic or any other offense factor.</p>
<p>‘Depart’, ‘departure’, ‘downward departure’, and ‘upward departure’ have the meaning given those terms in Application Note 1 of the Commentary to §1B1.1 (Application Instructions).</p>
<p>2. <em>Scope of this Policy Statement</em>.—</p>
<p>(A) <em>Departures Covered by this Policy Statement</em>.—This policy statement covers departures from the applicable guideline range based on offense characteristics or offender characteristics of a kind, or to a degree, not adequately taken into consideration in determining that range. <em>See</em> 18 U.S.C. § 3553(b).</p>
<p>Subsection (a) of this policy statement applies to upward departures in all cases covered by the guidelines and to downward departures in all such cases except for downward departures in child crimes and sexual offenses.</p>
<p>Subsection (b) of this policy statement applies only to downward departures in child crimes and sexual offenses.</p>
<p>(B) <em>Departures Covered by Other Guidelines</em>.—This policy statement does not cover the following departures, which are addressed elsewhere in the guidelines: (i) departures based on the defendant’s criminal history (<em>see</em> Chapter Four (Criminal History and Criminal Livelihood), particularly §4A1.3 (Departures Based on Inadequacy of Criminal History Category)); (ii) departures based on the defendant’s substantial assistance to the authorities (<em>see</em> §5K1.1 (Substantial Assistance to Authorities)); and (iii) departures based on early disposition programs (<em>see</em> §5K3.1 (Early Disposition Programs)).</p>
<p>3. <em>Kinds and Expected Frequency of Departures under Subsection (a)</em>.—As set forth in subsection (a), there generally are two kinds of departures from the guidelines based on offense characteristics and/or offender characteristics: (A) departures based on circumstances of a kind not adequately taken into consideration in the guidelines; and (B) departures based on circumstances that are present to a degree not adequately taken into consideration in the guidelines.</p>
<p>(A) <em>Departures Based on Circumstances of a Kind Not Adequately Taken into Account in Guidelines</em>.—Subsection (a)(2) authorizes the court to depart if there exists an aggravating or a mitigating circumstance in a case under 18 U.S.C. § 3553(b)(1), or an aggravating circumstance in a case under 18 U.S.C. § 3553(b)(2)(A)(i), of a kind not adequately taken into consideration in the guidelines.</p>
<p>(i) <em>Identified Circumstances</em>.—This subpart (Chapter Five, Part K, Subpart 2) identifies several circumstances that the Commission may have not adequately taken into consideration in setting the offense level for certain cases. Offense guidelines in Chapter Two (Offense Conduct) and adjustments in Chapter Three (Adjustments) sometimes identify circumstances the Commission may have not adequately taken into consideration in setting the offense level for offenses covered by those guidelines. If the offense guideline in Chapter Two or an adjustment in Chapter Three does not adequately take that circumstance into consideration in setting the offense level for the offense, and only to the extent not adequately taken into consideration, a departure based on that circumstance may be warranted.</p>
<p>(ii) <em>Unidentified Circumstances</em>.—A case may involve circumstances, in addition to those identified by the guidelines, that have not adequately been taken into consideration by the Commission, and the presence of any such circumstance may warrant departure from the guidelines in that case. However, inasmuch as the Commission has continued to monitor and refine the guidelines since their inception to take into consideration relevant circumstances in sentencing, it is expected that departures based on such unidentified circumstances will occur rarely and only in exceptional cases.</p>
<p>(B) <em>Departures Based on Circumstances Present to a Degree Not Adequately Taken into Consideration in Guidelines</em>.—</p>
<p>(i) <em>In General</em>.—Subsection (a)(3) authorizes the court to depart if there exists an aggravating or a mitigating circumstance in a case under 18 U.S.C. § 3553(b)(1), or an aggravating circumstance in a case under 18 U.S.C. § 3553(b)(2)(A)(i), to a degree not adequately taken into consideration in the guidelines. However, inasmuch as the Commission has continued to monitor and refine the guidelines since their inception to determine the most appropriate weight to be accorded the mitigating and aggravating circumstances specified in the guidelines, it is expected that departures based on the weight accorded to any such circumstance will occur rarely and only in exceptional cases.</p>
<p>(ii) <em>Examples</em>.—As set forth in subsection (a)(3), if the applicable offense guideline and adjustments take into consideration a circumstance identified in this subpart, departure is warranted only if the circumstance is present to a degree substantially in excess of that which ordinarily is involved in the offense. Accordingly, a departure pursuant to §5K2.7 for the disruption of a governmental function would have to be substantial to warrant departure from the guidelines when the applicable offense guideline is bribery or obstruction of justice. When the guideline covering the mailing of injurious articles is applicable, however, and the offense caused disruption of a governmental function, departure from the applicable guideline range more readily would be appropriate. Similarly, physical injury would not warrant departure from the guidelines when the robbery offense guideline is applicable because the robbery guideline includes a specific adjustment based on the extent of any injury. However, because the robbery guideline does not deal with injury to more than one victim, departure may be warranted if several persons were injured.</p>
<p>(C) <em>Departures Based on Circumstances Identified as Not Ordinarily Relevant</em>.—Because certain circumstances are specified in the guidelines as not ordinarily relevant to sentencing (see, <em>e.g.</em>, Chapter Five, Part H (Specific Offender Characteristics)), a departure based on any one of such circumstances should occur only in exceptional cases, and only if the circumstance is present in the case to an exceptional degree. If two or more of such circumstances each is present in the case to a substantial degree, however, and taken together make the case an exceptional one, the court may consider whether a departure would be warranted pursuant to subsection (c). Departures based on a combination of not ordinarily relevant circumstances that are present to a substantial degree should occur extremely rarely and only in exceptional cases.</p>
<p>In addition, as required by subsection (e), each circumstance forming the basis for a departure described in this subdivision shall be stated with specificity in the written judgment and commitment order.</p>
<p>4. <em>Downward Departures in Child Crimes and Sexual Offenses</em>.—</p>
<p>(A) <em>Definition</em>.—For purposes of this policy statement, the term ‘child crimes and sexual offenses’ means offenses under any of the following: 18 U.S.C. § 1201 (involving a minor victim), 18 U.S.C. § 1591, or chapter 71, 109A, 110, or 117 of title 18, United States Code.</p>
<p>(B) <em>Standard for Departure</em>.—</p>
<p>(i) <em>Requirement of Affirmative and Specific Identification of Departure Ground</em>.—The standard for a downward departure in child crimes and sexual offenses differs from the standard for other departures under this policy statement in that it includes a requirement, set forth in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(b)(2)(A)(ii)(I) and subsection (b)(1) of this guideline, that any mitigating circumstance that forms the basis for such a downward departure be affirmatively and specifically identified as a ground for downward departure in this part (<em>i.e.</em>, Chapter Five, Part K).</p>
<p>(ii) <em>Application of Subsection (b)(2)</em>.—The commentary in Application Note 3 of this policy statement, except for the commentary in Application Note 3(A)(ii) relating to unidentified circumstances, shall apply to the court’s determination of whether a case meets the requirement, set forth in subsection 18 U.S.C. § 3553(b)(2)(A)(ii)(II) and subsection (b)(2) of this policy statement, that the mitigating circumstance forming the basis for a downward departure in child crimes and sexual offenses be of kind, or to a degree, not adequately taken into consideration by the Commission.</p>
<p>5. <em>Departures Based on Plea Agreements</em>.—Subsection (d)(4) prohibits a downward departure based only on the defendant’s decision, in and of itself, to plead guilty to the offense or to enter a plea agreement with respect to the offense. Even though a departure may not be based merely on the fact that the defendant agreed to plead guilty or enter a plea agreement, a departure may be based on justifiable, non-prohibited reasons for departure as part of a sentence that is recommended, or agreed to, in the plea agreement and accepted by the court. <em>See</em> §6B1.2 (Standards for Acceptance of Plea Agreements). In cases in which the court departs based on such reasons as set forth in the plea agreement, the court must state the reasons for departure with specificity in the written judgment and commitment order, as required by subsection (e).</p>
<p><em>Background</em>: This policy statement sets forth the standards for departing from the applicable guideline range based on offense and offender characteristics of a kind, or to a degree, not adequately considered by the Commission. Circumstances the Commission has determined are not ordinarily relevant to determining whether a departure is warranted or are prohibited as bases for departure are addressed in Chapter Five, Part H (Offender Characteristics) and in this policy statement. Other departures, such as those based on the defendant’s criminal history, the defendant’s substantial assistance to authorities, and early disposition programs, are addressed elsewhere in the guidelines.</p>
<p>As acknowledged by Congress in the Sentencing Reform Act and by the Commission when the first set of guidelines was promulgated, ‘it is difficult to prescribe a single set of guidelines that encompasses the vast range of human conduct potentially relevant to a sentencing decision.’ (<em>See</em> Historical Note to §1A1.1 (Authority)). Departures, therefore, perform an integral function in the sentencing guideline system. Departures permit courts to impose an appropriate sentence in the exceptional case in which mechanical application of the guidelines would fail to achieve the statutory purposes and goals of sentencing. Departures also help maintain ‘sufficient flexibility to permit individualized sentences when warranted by mitigating or aggravating factors not taken into account in the establishment of general sentencing practices.’ 28 U.S.C. § 991(b)(1)(B). By monitoring when courts depart from the guidelines and by analyzing their stated reasons for doing so, along with appellate cases reviewing these departures, the Commission can further refine the guidelines to specify more precisely when departures should and should not be permitted.</p>
<p>As reaffirmed in the Prosecutorial Remedies and Other Tools to end the Exploitation of Children Today Act of 2003 (the ‘PROTECT Act’, Public Law 108–21), circumstances warranting departure should be rare. Departures were never intended to permit sentencing courts to substitute their policy judgments for those of Congress and the Sentencing Commission. Departure in such circumstances would produce unwarranted sentencing disparity, which the Sentencing Reform Act was designed to avoid.</p>
<p>In order for appellate courts to fulfill their statutory duties under 18 U.S.C. § 3742 and for the Commission to fulfill its ongoing responsibility to refine the guidelines in light of information it receives on departures, it is essential that sentencing courts state with specificity the reasons for departure, as required by the PROTECT Act.</p>
<p>This policy statement, including its commentary, was substantially revised, effective October 27, 2003, in response to directives contained in the PROTECT Act, particularly the directive in section 401(m) of that Act to—</p>
<p>‘(1) review the grounds of downward departure that are authorized by the sentencing guidelines, policy statements, and official commentary of the Sentencing Commission; and</p>
<p>(2) promulgate, pursuant to section 994 of title 28, United States Code—</p>
<p>(A) appropriate amendments to the sentencing guidelines, policy statements, and official commentary to ensure that the incidence of downward departures is substantially reduced;</p>
<p>(B) a policy statement authorizing a departure pursuant to an early disposition program; and</p>
<p>(C) any other conforming amendments to the sentencing guidelines, policy statements, and official commentary of the Sentencing Commission necessitated by the Act, including a revision of ...section 5K2.0’.</p>
<p>The substantial revision of this policy statement in response to the PROTECT Act was intended to refine the standards applicable to departures while giving due regard for concepts, such as the ‘heartland’, that have evolved in departure jurisprudence over time.</p>
<p>Section 401(b)(1) of the PROTECT Act directly amended this policy statement to add subsection (b), effective April 30, 2003.&quot;;</p>
<p>by striking:</p>
<p>&quot;§5K2.10. <em>Victim’s Conduct</em> (Policy Statement)</p>
<p>If the victim’s wrongful conduct contributed significantly to provoking the offense behavior, the court may reduce the sentence below the guideline range to reflect the nature and circumstances of the offense. In deciding the extent of a sentence reduction, the court should consider:</p>
<p>(a) the size and strength of the victim, or other relevant physical characteristics, in comparison with those of the defendant;</p>
<p>(b) the persistence of the victim’s conduct and any efforts by the defendant to prevent confrontation;</p>
<p>(c) the danger reasonably perceived by the defendant, including the victim’s reputation for violence;</p>
<p>(d) the danger actually presented to the defendant by the victim; and</p>
<p>(e) any other relevant conduct by the victim that substantially contributed to the danger presented.</p>
<p>Victim misconduct ordinarily would not be sufficient to warrant application of this provision in the context of offenses under Chapter Two, Part A.3 (Criminal Sexual Abuse). In addition, this provision usually would not be relevant in the context of non-violent offenses. There may, however, be unusual circumstances in which substantial victim misconduct would warrant a reduced penalty in the case of a non-violent offense. For example, an extended course of provocation and harassment might lead a defendant to steal or destroy property in retaliation.&quot;,</p>
<p>and inserting:</p>
<p>&quot;§5K2.10. <em>Victim’s Conduct</em> (Policy Statement)</p>
<p>If the victim’s wrongful conduct contributed significantly to provoking the offense behavior, the court may reduce the sentence below the guideline range to reflect the nature and circumstances of the offense. In deciding whether a sentence reduction is warranted, and the extent of such reduction, the court should consider the following:</p>
<p>(1) The size and strength of the victim, or other relevant physical characteristics, in comparison with those of the defendant.</p>
<p>(2) The persistence of the victim’s conduct and any efforts by the defendant to prevent confrontation.</p>
<p>(3) The danger reasonably perceived by the defendant, including the victim’s reputation for violence.</p>
<p>(4) The danger actually presented to the defendant by the victim.</p>
<p>(5) Any other relevant conduct by the victim that substantially contributed to the danger presented.</p>
<p>(6) The proportionality and reasonableness of the defendant’s response to the victim’s provocation.</p>
<p>Victim misconduct ordinarily would not be sufficient to warrant application of this provision in the context of offenses under Chapter Two, Part A, Subpart 3 (Criminal Sexual Abuse). In addition, this provision usually would not be relevant in the context of non-violent offenses. There may, however, be unusual circumstances in which substantial victim misconduct would warrant a reduced penalty in the case of a non-violent offense. For example, an extended course of provocation and harassment might lead a defendant to steal or destroy property in retaliation.&quot;;</p>
<p>by striking:</p>
<p>&quot;§5K2.12. <em>Coercion and Duress</em> (Policy Statement)</p>
<p>If the defendant committed the offense because of serious coercion, blackmail or duress, under circumstances not amounting to a complete defense, the court may decrease the sentence below the applicable guideline range. The extent of the decrease ordinarily should depend on the reasonableness of the defendant’s actions and on the extent to which the conduct would have been less harmful under the circumstances as the defendant believed them to be. Ordinarily coercion will be sufficiently serious to warrant departure only when it involves a threat of physical injury, substantial damage to property or similar injury resulting from the unlawful action of a third party or from a natural emergency. The Commission considered the relevance of economic hardship and determined that personal financial difficulties and economic pressures upon a trade or business do not warrant a decrease in sentence.&quot;,</p>
<p>and inserting:</p>
<p>&quot;§5K2.12. <em>Coercion and Duress</em> (Policy Statement)</p>
<p>If the defendant committed the offense because of serious coercion, blackmail or duress, under circumstances not amounting to a complete defense, the court may decrease the sentence below the applicable guideline range. The extent of the decrease ordinarily should depend on the reasonableness of the defendant’s actions, on the proportionality of the defendant’s actions to the seriousness of coercion, blackmail, or duress involved, and on the extent to which the conduct would have been less harmful under the circumstances as the defendant believed them to be. Ordinarily coercion will be sufficiently serious to warrant departure only when it involves a threat of physical injury, substantial damage to property or similar injury resulting from the unlawful action of a third party or from a natural emergency. Notwithstanding this policy statement, personal financial difficulties and economic pressures upon a trade or business do not warrant a downward departure.&quot;;</p>
<p>by striking:</p>
<p>&quot;§5K2.13. <em>Diminished Capacity</em> (Policy Statement)</p>
<p>A sentence below the applicable guideline range may be warranted if the defendant committed the offense while suffering from a significantly reduced mental capacity. However, the court may not depart below the applicable guideline range if (1) the significantly reduced mental capacity was caused by the voluntary use of drugs or other intoxicants; (2) the facts and circumstances of the defendant’s offense indicate a need to protect the public because the offense involved actual violence or a serious threat of violence; (3) the defendant’s criminal history indicates a need to incarcerate the defendant to protect the public; or (4) the defendant has been convicted of an offense under chapter 71, 109A, 110, or 117, of title 18, United States Code. If a departure is warranted, the extent of the departure should reflect the extent to which the reduced mental capacity contributed to the commission of the offense.</p>
<p><em>Commentary</em></p>
<p><em>Application Note</em>:</p>
<p>1. For purposes of this policy statement—</p>
<p>&quot;Significantly reduced mental capacity&quot; means the defendant, although convicted, has a significantly impaired ability to (A) understand the wrongfulness of the behavior comprising the offense or to exercise the power of reason; or (B) control behavior that the defendant knows is wrongful.</p>
<p><em>Background</em>: Section 401(b)(5) of Public Law 108–21 directly amended this policy statement to add subdivision (4), effective April 30, 2003.&quot;,</p>
<p>and inserting:</p>
<p>&quot;§5K2.13. <em>Diminished Capacity</em> (Policy Statement)</p>
<p>A sentence below the applicable guideline range may be warranted if (1) the defendant committed the offense while suffering from a significantly reduced mental capacity; and (2) the significantly reduced mental capacity contributed substantially to the commission of the offense. Similarly, if a departure is warranted under this policy statement, the extent of the departure should reflect the extent to which the reduced mental capacity contributed to the commission of the offense.</p>
<p>However, the court may not depart below the applicable guideline range if (1) the significantly reduced mental capacity was caused by the voluntary use of drugs or other intoxicants; (2) the facts and circumstances of the defendant’s offense indicate a need to protect the public because the offense involved actual violence or a serious threat of violence; (3) the defendant’s criminal history indicates a need to incarcerate the defendant to protect the public; or (4) the defendant has been convicted of an offense under chapter 71, 109A, 110, or 117, of title 18, United States Code.</p>

<p><em>Commentary</em></p>
<p><em>Background</em>: This policy statement implements the directive to the Commission in section 401(m)(2)(B) of the Prosecutorial Remedies and Other Tools to end the Exploitation of Children Today Act of 2003 (the ‘PROTECT Act’, Public Law 108–21).&quot;.</p>

As set forth in subsection (d) of §5K2.0 (Grounds for Departure), however, the court may not depart below the applicable guideline range merely because of the defendant’s decision to plead guilty to the offense or to enter a plea agreement with respect to the offense.&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This emergency amendment continues the Commission’s work in the area of departures and implements the directive in section 401(m) of the &quot;Prosecutorial Remedies and Other Tools to end the Exploitation of Children Today Act of 2003&quot; or &quot;PROTECT Act,&quot; Pub. L. 108–21. The PROTECT Act was enacted on April 30, 2003, and directs the Commission, not later than 180 days after the enactment of the Act, to promulgate: (1) appropriate amendments to the sentencing guidelines, policy statements, and official commentary to ensure that the incidence of downward departures is substantially reduced; (2) a policy statement authorizing a downward departure of not more than 4 levels if the Government files a motion for such departure pursuant to an early disposition program authorized by the Attorney General and the United States Attorney for the district in which the court resides; (3) any other necessary conforming amendments, including a revision of paragraph 4(b) of Part A of Chapter One and a revision of §5K2.0 (Grounds for Departure). The analysis underlying this amendment will be set forth more fully in a forthcoming report to Congress.</p>
<p>The Commission anticipates that this amendment will substantially reduce the incidence of downward departures by prohibiting several factors as grounds for departure, restricting the availability of certain departures, clarifying when certain departures are appropriate, and limiting the extent of departure permissible for certain offenders. The amendment also reduces the incidence of downward departures generally by restructuring departure provisions throughout the Guidelines Manual to track more closely both the statutory criteria for imposing a sentence outside the guideline sentencing range and the newly enacted statutory requirement that reasons for departure be stated with specificity in the written order of judgment and commitment. <em>See</em> 18 U.S.C. §§ 3553 (Imposition of a sentence), 3742(e) (Review of a sentence). The Commission determined that requiring sentencing courts to document reasons for departure with greater specificity complements the findings required of sentencing courts by the PROTECT Act, increases the accountability of sentencing courts for departures by facilitating appellate review, and improves the Commission’s ability to monitor departure decisions and refine the guidelines as necessary.</p>
<p>The eight-part amendment makes modifications to §§5K2.0 (Grounds for Departure), 5H1.4 (Physical Condition, Including Drug or Alcohol Dependence or Abuse; Gambling Addiction), 5H1.6 (Family Ties and Responsibilities), 5H1.7 (Role in the Offense), 5H1.8 (Criminal History), 5K2.10 (Victim’s Conduct), 5K2.12 (Coercion and Duress), 5K2.13 (Diminished Capacity), 5K2.20 (Aberrant Behavior), 4A1.3 (Departures Based on Inadequacy of Criminal History Category), and 6B1.2 (Standards for Acceptance of Plea Agreements). The amendment also creates one new policy statement, §5K3.1 (Early Disposition Programs), and one new guideline, §1A1.1 (Authority), among other changes.</p>
<p>First, this amendment makes several significant modifications to §5K2.0 (Grounds for Departure) to limit, and in certain circumstances, to prohibit downward departures. The amendment generally restructures §5K2.0 to set forth more clearly the standards governing departures in order to facilitate and emphasize the analysis required of the court. The amendment does so by: (1) integrating throughout the policy statement the statutory language of 18 U.S.C. §§ 3553(b) and 3742(e), as amended by the PROTECT Act, which provide the statutory criteria for sentencing outside the guideline range; (2) adopting, when provided in the policy statement, a uniform qualitative description of the type of case in which a departure may be warranted, the “exceptional case”; (3) restating in the application notes and background commentary to §5K2.0 longstanding commentary in the Guidelines Manual, which was reaffirmed by the PROTECT Act, that the frequency of departures under §5K2.0 generally should be rare, and that certain types of departures under §5K2.0 should be extremely rare; and (4) deleting certain language in the commentary taken from <em>Koon v. United States</em>, 518 U.S. 81 (1996) that effectively was overruled by the PROTECT Act.</p>
<p>Accordingly, §5K2.0(a) sets forth the general governing principle that, in cases other than child crimes and sexual offenses, the sentencing court may depart if the court finds pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3553(b)(1) that there exists an aggravating or mitigating circumstance of a kind, or to a degree, not adequately taken into consideration by the Sentencing Commission that, in order to advance the objectives set forth in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(2), should result in a sentence different from a sentence within the applicable guideline range.</p>
<p>The amendment also prohibits several grounds for departure, in addition to the departure prohibitions in §5K2.0 for child crimes and sexual offenses enacted by the PROTECT Act, and other prohibitions elsewhere in the Guidelines Manual. The amendment creates a new subsection, §5K2.0(d), that clearly lists the forbidden departure grounds. These include several longstanding prohibitions, as well as a number of new prohibitions added by the amendment, specifically: (1) the defendant’s acceptance of responsibility; (2) the defendant’s aggravating or mitigating role in the offense; (3) the defendant’s decision, in itself, to plead guilty to the offense or to enter into a plea agreement with respect to the offense; and (4) the defendant’s fulfillment of restitution only to the extent required by law, including the guidelines. The Commission determined that these circumstances are never appropriate grounds for departure.</p>
<p>The amendment also revises §5K2.0 to restrict the availability of departures based on multiple circumstances, often referred to as a “combination of factors.” The Commission determined that heightened criteria are appropriate for cases in which no single offender characteristic or other circumstance independently is sufficient to provide a basis for departure. Under §5K2.0(c) a departure based on multiple circumstances can be based only on offender characteristics or other circumstances that are identified in the guidelines as permissible grounds for departure. Circumstances unmentioned in the guidelines, therefore, can no longer be used for a departure based on multiple circumstances pursuant to §5K2.0(c). In addition, in order to support a departure based on a combination of circumstances, each offender characteristic or other circumstance must be present individually to a substantial degree and must make the case exceptional when considered together. Emphasizing the Commission’s expectation as to the infrequency of such departures, the accompanying application note retains previously existing guidance and states that departures under §5K2.0(c) based on a combination of not ordinarily relevant circumstances should occur extremely rarely.</p>
<p>In addition, the amendment clarifies when a departure may be based on a circumstance present to a degree not adequately taken into consideration. Section 5K2.0(a)(3) provides that a departure may be warranted in an exceptional case, even though the circumstance that forms the basis for the departure is taken into consideration, only if the court determines that such circumstance is present to a degree substantially different from that ordinarily involved in that kind of offense.</p>
<p>The amendment also modifies §5K2.0 in two additional ways to underscore the need for courts to state with specificity their reasons for departure. First, §5K2.0(e) provides that if the court departs, it shall state, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3553(c), as amended by the PROTECT Act, its specific reasons for departure in open court at the time of sentencing and, with limited exception in the case of statements received <em>in camera</em>, shall state those factors with specificity in the written judgment and commitment order. Second, Application Note 5 provides that in cases in which the court departs based on reasons set forth in a plea agreement, the court must state the reasons for departure with specificity in the written judgment and commitment order.</p>
<p>Second, the amendment limits several departure provisions in Chapter Five, Part H (Specific Offender Characteristics). First, the amendment adds a prohibition to §5H1.4 (Physical Condition, Including Drug or Alcohol Dependence or Abuse; Gambling Addiction) against departures based on addiction to gambling and renames the policy statement accordingly. The Commission determined that addiction to gambling is never a relevant ground for departure.</p>
<p>The amendment limits the availability of departures pursuant to §5H1.6 (Family Ties and Responsibilities) by requiring the court to conduct certain more rigorous analyses. In determining whether a departure is warranted under this policy statement, a new application note instructs the court to consider the seriousness of the offense; the involvement in the offense, if any, of members of the defendant’s family; and the danger, if any to members of the defendant’s immediate family as a result of the offense.</p>
<p>In addition to considering those factors, the amendment further restricts family ties departures by adding an application note that establishes heightened criteria for departures based on loss of caretaking or financial support. In such cases, the court must find all of the following four circumstances: (1) that a sentence within the applicable guideline range will cause a substantial, direct, and specific loss of essential caretaking or essential financial support to the defendant’s family; (2) that such loss exceeds the harm ordinarily incident to incarceration; (3) that there are no effective remedial or ameliorative programs reasonably available, making the defendant’s caretaking or financial support irreplaceable to the defendant’s family; and (4) that the departure effectively will address the loss of caretaking or financial support. The Commission determined that these heightened criteria are appropriate and necessary in order to distinguish hardship or suffering that is ordinarily incident to incarceration from that which is exceptional.</p>
<p>The amendment also eliminates community ties as a separate ground for departure and renames §5H1.6 accordingly.</p>
<p>The amendment makes conforming modifications to §5H1.7 (Role in the Offense), reiterating that a defendant’s role in the offense is not a basis for departure, and to §5H1.8 (Criminal History), providing that the only grounds for departure based on the defendant’s criminal history are set forth in §4A1.3 (Departures Based on Inadequacy of Criminal History Category).</p>
<p>Third, the amendment limits several departure provisions in Chapter Five, Part K (Departures). The amendment adds a factor to §5K2.10 (Victim’s Conduct) that the court should consider when determining whether a departure is warranted based on victim’s conduct. The amendment provides that, in addition to five previously existing factors, the court should consider the proportionality and reasonableness of the defendant’s response to the victim’s provocation.</p>
<p>The amendment adds a similar factor to §5K2.12 (Coercion and Duress). The amendment provides that the extent of a departure based on coercion and duress ordinarily should depend on several considerations, including the proportionality of the defendant’s actions to the seriousness of the coercion, blackmail, or duress involved.</p>
<p>The amendment limits the availability of departures pursuant to §5K2.13 (Diminished Capacity) by adding a causation element. The amendment provides that in order to receive a departure for diminished capacity, the significantly reduced mental capacity must have contributed substantially to the commission of the offense. The amendment similarly limits the extent of departure by stating that the extent of the departure should reflect the extent to which the reduced mental capacity contributed to the commission of the offense.</p>
<p>The amendment significantly restructures §5K2.20 (Aberrant Behavior) and further restricts the availability of departures based on aberrant behavior. The Commission promulgated §5K2.20 effective November 1, 2000, in order to resolve a longstanding circuit conflict and more properly define when a departure based on aberrant behavior may be warranted. <em>See</em> Appendix C, amendment 603. A departure based on aberrant behavior may be warranted only if the defendant committed a single criminal occurrence or single criminal transaction that (1) was without significant planning; (2) was of limited duration; and (3) represents a marked deviation by the defendant from an otherwise law-abiding life.</p>
<p>The amendment provides greater emphasis to these strict requirements by moving them from an application note to the body of the policy statement. The amendment also gives the court greater guidance in applying these requirements with a new application note that clarifies that repetitious or significant, planned behavior does not meet the requirements for receiving a departure under §5K2.20. A fraud scheme, for example, generally would be prohibited from receiving a departure pursuant to §5K2.20 because such a scheme usually involves repetitive acts, rather than a single occurrence or single criminal transaction, as well as significant planning.</p>
<p>The amendment also further restricts the availability of departures based on aberrant behavior by adding several strict prohibitions to the list that has existed in §5K2.20 since its initial promulgation. Prior to this amendment, §5K2.20 prohibited the court from departing based on aberrant behavior if (1) the offense involved serious bodily injury or death; (2) the defendant discharged a firearm or otherwise used a firearm or a dangerous weapon; (3) the instant offense of conviction is a serious drug trafficking offense; (4) the defendant has more than one criminal history point, as determined under Chapter Four (Criminal History and Criminal Livelihood); or (5) the defendant has a prior federal, or state, felony conviction, regardless of whether the conviction is countable under Chapter Four.</p>
<p>The amendment gives greater prominence to those previously existing prohibitions and expands them in significant ways. The amendment eliminates defendants who have any significant prior criminal behavior from consideration for a departure pursuant to §5K2.20, regardless of whether such behavior is countable under Chapter Four, and even if such behavior is not a state or federal felony. In addition, the amendment expands the class of drug trafficking defendants prohibited from consideration for a departure pursuant to §5K2.20 by expanding the definition of &quot;serious drug trafficking offense.&quot; Specifically, the amendment expands the definition of &quot;serious drug trafficking offense&quot; in the accompanying application note to include any controlled substance offense under title 21, United States Code, other than simple possession under 21 U.S.C. § 844, that provides a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment of five years or greater, regardless of whether the defendant meets the criteria of §5C1.2 (Limitation on Applicability of Statutory Mandatory Minimum Sentences in Certain Cases). Prior to this amendment, only drug trafficking defendants who were subject to such mandatory minimum penalties and who did not meet the criteria set forth in §5C1.2 were precluded categorically from consideration for a departure under §5K2.20.</p>
<p>Fourth, the amendment substantially restructures §4A1.3 (Departures Based on Inadequacy of Criminal History Category) to set forth more clearly the standards governing departures based on criminal history, to prohibit and limit the extent of departures based on criminal history for certain offenders with significant criminal history, and to require written specification of the basis for a criminal history departure.</p>
<p>Section 4A1.3(a) provides that an upward departure may be warranted if reliable information indicates that the defendant’s criminal history category substantially under-represents the seriousness of the defendant’s criminal history or the likelihood that the defendant will commit other crimes. Section 4A1.3(a) also more clearly sets forth previously existing guidance regarding determination of the extent of an upward departure based on criminal history. Similarly, §4A1.3(b) provides that a downward departure may be warranted if reliable information indicates that the defendant’s criminal history category substantially over-represents the seriousness of the defendant’s criminal history or the likelihood that the defendant will commit other crimes.</p>
<p>The amendment, however, adds several prohibitions and limitations to the availability of downward departures based on criminal history. It prohibits a downward departure based on §4A1.3(b) if the defendant is an armed career criminal within the meaning of §4B1.3 (Armed Career Criminal) or a repeat and dangerous sex offender against minors within the meaning of §4B1.5 (Repeat and Dangerous Sex Offender Against Minors). The Commission determined that such offenders should never receive a criminal history-based downward departure.</p>
<p>Section 4A1.3(b) reiterates the longstanding prohibition against a departure below the lower limit of the applicable guideline range for Criminal History Category I.</p>
<p>Section 4A1.3(b) also contains certain limitations on the extent of departure available under this provision. Specifically, a downward departure pursuant to this section for a career offender within the meaning of §4B1.1 (Career Offender) may not exceed one criminal history category.</p>
<p>In addition, the amendment provides that a defendant whose criminal history category is Category I after receipt of a downward departure under §4A1.3(b) does not meet the criterion of subsection (a)(1) of §5C1.2 if, before receipt of the departure, the defendant had more than one criminal history point under §4A1.1 (Criminal History Category). Thus, a departure to Category I cannot qualify an otherwise ineligible defendant for relief from an applicable mandatory minimum sentence under §5C1.2, which is consistent with case law.</p>
<p>The amendment adds a new subsection, §4A1.3(c), that requires the court, in departing based on criminal history, to set forth in writing the specific reasons why the applicable criminal history category under-represents or over-represents the seriousness of the defendant’s criminal history or the likelihood that the defendant will commit other crimes. This specificity requirement is consistent with the PROTECT Act and is intended to facilitate both the necessary statutory and guideline departure analysis, as well as to improve the Commission’s ability to refine the criminal history guidelines in light of criminal history departure decisions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The amendment also makes conforming modifications to §4A1.1 and §5C1.2.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The amendment implements the directive at section 401(m)(2)(B) of the PROTECT Act by adding a new policy statement at §5K3.1 entitled Early Disposition Programs. The provision restates the language contained in the directive and provides that, upon motion of the Government, the court may depart downward not more than 4 levels pursuant to an early disposition program authorized by the Attorney General of the United States and the United States Attorney for the district in which the court resides. The Commission determined that implementing the directive in this manner is appropriate at this time, pending further study and monitoring of the implementation of early disposition programs.</p>
<p>The amendment revises subsections (b) and (c) of §6B1.2 (Standards for Acceptance of Plea Agreements) to require greater specificity in the sentencing documentation in a case involving a departure either recommended or agreed to in a Rule 11(c)(1)(B) or Rule 11(c)(1)(C) plea agreement. Specifically, if the court accepts such a plea agreement, and the recommended or agreed to sentence departs from the applicable guideline range for justifiable reasons, the amendment requires the court to set forth specifically those reasons in writing in the statement of reasons or judgment and commitment order. This specificity requirement is consistent with the PROTECT Act and is intended to facilitate the necessary statutory and guideline departure analysis, as well as to improve the Commission’s ability to understand the underlying reasons for departures in cases involving plea agreements.</p>
<p>The amendment creates a new guideline, §1A1.1 (Authority), that clearly sets forth the Commission’s authority to promulgate guidelines, policy statements, and commentary and implements the Protect Act directive requiring conforming amendments to paragraph 4(b) of Part A of Chapter One. In addition, the amendment moves <em>in</em> <em>toto</em> Part A of Chapter One, as in effect on November 1, 1987, to the commentary as a historical note. Part A of Chapter One was an introduction to the Guidelines Manual that explained a number of policy decisions made by the Commission when it promulgated the initial set of guidelines. This introduction was amended occasionally between 1987 and 2003. The Commission determined that in order to preserve its historical significance and context, the introduction should be returned to its original form and placed in a historical note. The Commission encourages review of this material. The amendment also incorporates relevant portions of paragraph 4(b) of Part A of the former introduction regarding departures in the background commentary to §5K2.0.</p>
<p>The amendment amends §1B1.1 (Application Instructions) to provide uniform definitions of departure, upward departure, and downward departure.</p>
<p>The amendment also makes technical amendments to §2A4.1 (Kidnapping, Abduction, Unlawful Restraint).</p>
<p>This amendment complements other significant policy initiatives affecting sentencing, including the statutory changes in sentencing law and guideline changes directly made by the PROTECT Act, and recent policies implemented by the Department of Justice. The Commission believes that these general policy changes, working together, will substantially reduce the incidence of downward departures. In addition to the significant modifications made by this amendment, the Commission has identified several aspects of the guidelines affecting departures that it intends to continue studying during the current amendment cycle and beyond, including aberrant behavior, criminal history, immigration, early disposition, or &quot;fast track,&quot; programs, and collateral consequences, among others.</p>

<p>Section 2A1.4(a)(2) is amended by striking &quot;14&quot; and inserting &quot;18&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This amendment responds to a concern that the federal sentencing guidelines do not adequately reflect the seriousness of involuntary manslaughter offenses. Specifically, the Department of Justice, some members of Congress, and an ad hoc advisory group formed by the Commission to address Native American sentencing guideline issues expressed concern that most federal involuntary manslaughter cases involve vehicular homicides, which analysis of Commission data confirmed. These commentators also indicated that these offenses appear to be underpunished, particularly when compared to comparable cases arising under state law. This disparity with state punishments has been confirmed by studies undertaken by the Commission. In addition, Congress increased the maximum statutory penalty for involuntary manslaughter from three to six years’ imprisonment in 1994.</p>
<p>In response to these concerns and the Commission’s analysis, this amendment increases the base offense level in §2A1.4(a)(2) for reckless involuntary manslaughter offenses from level 14 to level 18. This four level increase corresponds to an approximate 50 percent increase in sentence length for these offenses. This amendment also increases the base offense level in §2A4.1(a)(1) for criminally negligent involuntary manslaughter offenses from level 10 to level 12. The two level increase represents an approximate 25 percent increase in the sentence length for these offenses.</p>

<p><strong>Reason for Amendment</strong>: With this amendment the Commission continues its work to deter and punish economic and white collar crimes, building on its Economic Crime Package of 2001 and subsequent formation in early 2002 of an Ad Hoc Advisory Group on the Organizational Guidelines for sentencing corporations and other organizations. This 2003 amendment also implements directives in sections 805, 905, and 1104 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, Pub. L. 107–204 (the &quot;Act&quot;), by making several modifications to §§2B1.1 (Larceny, Embezzlement, and Other Forms of Theft; Offenses Involving Stolen Property; Property Damage or Destruction; Fraud and Deceit; Forgery; Offenses Involving Altered or Counterfeit Instruments Other than Counterfeit Bearer Obligations of the United States), 2J1.2 (Obstruction of Justice), and 2E5.3 (False Statements and Concealment of Facts in Relation to Documents Required by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act; Failure to Maintain and Falsification of Records Required by the Labor Management Reporting and Disclosure Act; Destruction and Failure to Maintain Corporate Audit Records), as well as conforming changes to §§2J1.1 (Contempt), 2J1.3 (Perjury or Subornation of Perjury; Bribery of Witness), and 2T4.1 (Tax Table). The amendment also responds to increased statutory penalties for existing crimes and several severely punished new crimes created by the Act.</p>
<p>The directives in the Act generally pertain to serious fraud and related offenses and obstruction of justice offenses. Congress gave the Commission emergency amendment authority to promulgate amendments addressing, among other things, officers and directors of publicly traded companies who commit fraud and related offenses, fraud offenses that endanger the solvency or financial security of a substantial number of victims, fraud offenses that involve significantly greater than 50 victims, and obstruction of justice offenses that involve the destruction of evidence. This amendment expands upon the temporary emergency amendment effective January 25, 2003, and repromulgates it as a permanent amendment.</p>
<p>First, the amendment modifies the base offense level in §2B1.1 to implement more fully the directive contained in section 905(b)(2) of the Act to consider whether the guidelines &quot;for violations of the sections amended by this Act are sufficient to deter and punish such offenses, and specifically, are adequate in view of the statutory increases in penalties contained in this Act.&quot; Section 903 of the Act, for example, quadrupled the statutory maximum penalties for wire fraud and mail fraud from five to 20 years’ imprisonment, while section 902 made attempts and conspiracies subject to these same heightened penalties. Specifically, the amendment provides a new higher alternative base offense level of level 7 if the defendant was convicted of an offense referenced to §2B1.1 and the offense carries a statutory maximum term of imprisonment of 20 years or more. The alternative base offense levels are intended to calibrate better the base guideline penalty to the seriousness of the wide variety of offenses referenced to that guideline, as reflected by statutory maximum penalties established by Congress.</p>
<p>For those offenses to which the higher alternative base offense will apply (including wire fraud and mail fraud), the effect of the amendment is to limit the availability of a probation only sentence in Zone A of the sentencing table to offenses involving loss amounts of $10,000 or less, assuming a two level reduction for acceptance of responsibility. Prior to the amendment, a Zone A sentence was available for all offenses sentenced under §2B1.1 involving loss amounts of $30,000 or less. Similarly, for those offenses for which the higher alternative base offense level will apply, the effect of the amendment is to require an imprisonment sentence in Zone D for offenses involving loss amounts of more than $70,000. Prior to the amendment, a Zone D sentence was required for all offenses sentenced under §2B1.1 involving loss amounts of more than $120,000.</p>
<p>Second, the amendment expands the loss table at §2B1.1(b)(1) to punish adequately offenses that cause catastrophic losses of magnitudes previously unforeseen, such as the serious corporate scandals that gave rise to several portions of the Act. Prior to the emergency amendment, the loss table at §2B1.1(b)(1) provided sentencing enhancements in two level increments up to a maximum of 26 levels for offenses in which the loss exceeded $100,000,000. The amendment adds two additional loss amount categories to the table; an increase of 28 levels for offenses in which the loss exceeded $200,000,000, and an increase of 30 levels for offenses in which the loss exceeded $400,000,000. These additions to the loss table address congressional concern regarding particularly extensive and serious fraud offenses and also more fully effectuate increases in statutory maximum penalties provided by the Act. The amendment also modifies the tax table in §2T4.1 in a similar manner to maintain the longstanding proportional relationship between the loss table in §2B1.1 and the tax table.</p>
<p>The amendment also adds a new factor to the general, enumerated factors that the court may consider in determining the amount of loss under §2B1.1(b)(1). Specifically, the amendment adds the reduction in the value of equity securities or other corporate assets that resulted from the offense to the list of general factors set forth in Application Note 3(C) of §2B1.1. This factor was added to provide courts additional guidance in determining loss in certain cases, particularly in complex white collar cases.</p>
<p>Third, the amendment addresses the directive contained in section 1104(b)(5) of the Act to &quot;ensure that the guideline offense levels and enhancements under United States Sentencing Guideline 2B1.1 (as in effect on the date of enactment of this Act) are sufficient for a fraud offense when the number of victims adversely involved is significantly greater than 50.&quot; The amendment implements this directive by expanding the existing enhancement at §2B1.1(b)(2) based on the number of victims involved in the offense. Prior to the emergency amendment, subsection (b)(2) provided a two level enhancement if the offense involved more than 10, but less than 50, victims (or was committed through mass-marketing), and a four level enhancement if the offense involved 50 or more victims. The amendment provides an additional two level increase, for a total of six levels, if the offense involved 250 or more victims. The Commission determined that an enhancement of this magnitude appropriately responds to the pertinent directive and accounts for the extensive nature of, and the large scale victimization caused by, such offenses.</p>
<p>Fourth, the amendment addresses directives contained in sections 805 and 1104 of the Act pertaining to securities and accounting fraud offenses and fraud offenses that endanger the solvency or financial security of a substantial number of victims. Specifically, section 805(a)(4) directs the Commission to ensure that &quot;a specific offense characteristic enhancing sentencing is provided under United States Sentencing Guideline 2B1.1 (as in effect on the date of enactment of this Act) for a fraud offense that endangers the solvency or financial security of a substantial number of victims.&quot; In addition, section 1104(b)(1) directs the Commission to &quot;ensure that the sentencing guidelines and policy statements reflect the serious nature of securities, pension, and accounting fraud and the need for aggressive and appropriate law enforcement action to prevent such offenses.&quot; The amendment implements these directives by expanding the scope of the existing enhancement at §2B1.1(b)(12)(B).</p>
<p>Prior to the emergency amendment, §2B1.1(b)(12)(B) provided a four level enhancement and a minimum offense level of level 24 if the offense substantially jeopardized the safety and soundness of a financial institution. The amendment expands the scope of this enhancement by providing two additional parts. The first part applies to offenses that substantially endanger the solvency or financial security of an organization that, at any time during the offense, was a publicly traded company or had 1,000 or more employees. The addition of this part reflects the Commission’s determination that such an offense undermines the public’s confidence in the securities and investment market much in the same manner as an offense that jeopardizes the safety and soundness of a financial institution undermines the public’s confidence in the banking system. This part also reflects the likelihood that an offense that endangers the solvency or financial security of an employer of this size will similarly affect a substantial number of individual victims, without requiring the court to determine whether the solvency or financial security of each individual victim was substantially endangered.</p>
<p>A corresponding application note for §2B1.1(b)(12)(B) sets forth a non-exhaustive list of factors that the court shall consider in determining whether the offense endangered the solvency or financial security of a publicly traded company or an organization with 1,000 or more employees. The list of factors that the court shall consider when applying the new enhancement includes references to insolvency, filing for bankruptcy, substantially reducing the value of the company’s stock, and substantially reducing the company’s workforce. As appropriate, the court may consider other factors not enumerated in the application note.</p>
<p>The amendment also modifies the application note to previously existing §2B1.1(b)(12)(B), the financial institutions enhancement, to be consistent structurally with the new part of the enhancement. Prior to the emergency amendment, the presence of any one of the factors enumerated in the application note would trigger the financial institutions enhancement under §2B1.1(b)(12)(B). Under the amendment, the application note to the financial institutions enhancement sets forth a non-exhaustive list of factors that the court shall consider in determining whether the offense substantially jeopardized the safety and soundness of a financial institution. The list of factors that the court shall consider when applying this enhancement includes references to insolvency, substantially reducing benefits to pensioners and insureds, and an inability to refund fully any deposit, payment, or investment on demand.</p>
<p>The second part added to §2B1.1(b)(12)(B) by the amendment applies to offenses that substantially endangered the solvency or financial security of 100 or more victims, regardless of whether a publicly traded company or other organization was affected by the offense. The Commission concluded that the specificity of the directive in section 805(a)(4) required an enhancement focused specifically on conduct that endangers the financial security of individual victims. Thus, use of this part of the enhancement will be appropriate in cases in which there is sufficient evidence for the court to determine that the amount of loss suffered by individual victims of the offense substantially endangered the solvency or financial security of those victims. The Commission also determined that the enhancement provided in §2B1.1(b)(12)(B) shall apply cumulatively with the enhancement at §2B1.1(b)(2), which is based solely on the number of victims involved in the offense, to reflect the particularly acute harm suffered by victims of offenses to which the new parts of subsection (b)(12)(B) apply. To account for the overlapping nature of such conduct in some cases, however, the Commission added a provision at subsection (b)(12)(C) that limits the cumulative impact of subsections (b)(2) and (b)(12)(B) to eight levels, except for application of the minimum offense level of level 24.</p>
<p>Fifth, the amendment addresses the directive contained at section 1104(a)(2) of the Act to &quot;consider the promulgation of new sentencing guidelines or amendments to existing sentencing guidelines to provide an enhancement for officers or directors of publicly traded corporations who commit fraud and related offenses.&quot; The emergency amendment implemented this directive by providing a new, four level enhancement that applies if the offense involved a violation of securities law and, at the time of the offense, the defendant was an officer or director of a publicly traded company.</p>
<p>The amendment expands the scope of this enhancement to cover registered brokers and dealers, associated persons of a broker or dealer, investment advisers, and associated persons of an investment adviser. The amendment also expands the scope of this enhancement to apply if the offense involves a violation of commodities law and, at the time of the offense, the defendant was an officer or director of a futures commission merchant or introducing broker, a commodities trading advisor, or a commodity pool operator. The Commission concluded that a four level enhancement appropriately reflects the culpability of offenders who occupy such positions and who are subject to heightened fiduciary duties imposed by securities law or commodities law similar to duties imposed on officers and directors of publicly traded corporations. Accordingly, the court is not required to determine specifically whether the defendant abused a position of trust in order for the enhancement to apply, and a corresponding application note provides that, in cases in which the new, four level enhancement applies, the existing two level enhancement for abuse of position of trust at §3B1.3 (Abuse of Position of Trust or Use of Special Skill) shall not apply.</p>
<p>The corresponding application note also expressly provides that the enhancement would apply regardless of whether the defendant was convicted under a specific securities fraud or commodities fraud statute (<em>e.g</em>., 18 U.S.C. § 1348, a new offense created by the Act specifically prohibiting securities fraud) or under a general fraud statute (<em>e.g</em>., 18 U.S.C. § 1341, prohibiting mail fraud), provided that the offense involved a violation of &quot;securities law&quot; or &quot;commodities law&quot; as defined in the application note.</p>
<p>Sixth, the amendment modifies §2J1.2 to address the directives pertaining to obstruction of justice offenses contained in sections 805 and 1104 of the Act. Specifically, section 805(a) of the Act directs the Commission to ensure that the base offense level and existing enhancements in §2J1.2 are sufficient to deter and punish obstruction of justice offenses generally, and specifically are adequate in cases involving the destruction, alteration, or fabrication of a large amount of evidence, a large number of participants, the selection of evidence that is particularly probative or essential to the investigation, more than minimal planning, or abuse of a special skill or a position of trust. Section 1104(b) of the Act further directs the Commission to ensure that the &quot;guideline offense levels and enhancements for an obstruction of justice offense are adequate in cases where documents or other physical evidence are actually destroyed or fabricated.&quot;</p>
<p>The amendment implements these directives by making two modifications to §2J1.2. First, the amendment increases the base offense level in §2J1.2 from level 12 to level 14. Second, the amendment adds a new two level enhancement to §2J1.2. This enhancement applies if the offense (1) involved the destruction, alteration, or fabrication of a substantial number of records, documents or tangible objects; (2) involved the selection of any essential or especially probative record, document, or tangible object to destroy or alter; or (3) was otherwise extensive in scope, planning, or preparation. The amendment also adds an upward departure provision for offenses sentenced under §2J1.2 that involve extreme acts of violence, for example, retaliating against a government witness by throwing acid in the witness’s face. The Commission determined that existing adjustments in Chapter Three for aggravating role, §3B1.1, and abuse of position of trust or use of special skill, §3B1.3, adequately account for those particular factors described in section 805(a) of the Act.</p>
<p>Seventh, the amendment also increases the base offense level in the perjury guideline, §2J1.3, from level 12 to level 14 in order to maintain the longstanding proportional relationship between the offense levels provided in the guidelines for perjury and obstruction of justice.</p>
<p>Eighth, the amendment addresses new offenses created by the Act. Section 1520 of title 18, United States Code, relating to destruction of corporate audit records, is referenced to §2E5.3. Section 1520 provides a statutory maximum penalty of ten years’ imprisonment for knowing and willful violations of document maintenance requirements as set forth in that section or in rules or regulations to be promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to that section. The amendment also expands the existing cross reference in §2E5.3(a)(2) specifically to cover fraud and obstruction of justice offenses. Accordingly, if a defendant violated 18 U.S.C. § 1520 in order to obstruct justice, the cross reference provision in §2E5.3 requires the court to apply §2J1.2 instead of §2E5.3. Other new offenses are listed in Appendix A (Statutory Index), as well as in the statutory provisions of the relevant guidelines.</p>
<p>Finally, the amendment amends the contempt guideline, §2J1.1, by adding an application note clarifying that (1) §2B1.1 is the most analogous guideline in a case involving a violation of a judicial order enjoining fraudulent behavior; and (2) the enhancement at §2B1.1(b)(7)(C) (pertaining to a violation of a prior, specific judicial order) ordinarily would apply in such a case.</p>

<p>Appendix A (Statutory Index) is amended by inserting after the line referenced to 18 U.S.C. § 2512 the following:</p>
<p>&quot;18 U.S.C. § 2701 2B1.1&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This amendment addresses the serious harm and invasion of privacy that can result from offenses involving the misuse of, or damage to, computers. It implements the directive in section 225(b) of the Homeland Security Act of 2002, Pub. L. 107–296, which required the Commission to review, and if appropriate amend, the guidelines and policy statements applicable to persons convicted of offenses under 18 U.S.C. § 1030 (fraud and related activity in connection with computers) to ensure that the guidelines and policy statements reflect the serious nature and growing incidence of such offenses and the need for an effective deterrent and appropriate punishment. The directive further requires the Commission to consider the extent to which eight specific factors were or were not accounted for by the guidelines. The amendment responds to the directive by making several changes to §§2B1.1 (Larceny, Embezzlement, and Other Forms of Theft; Offenses Involving Stolen Property; Property Damage or Destruction; Fraud and Deceit; Forgery; Offenses Involving Altered or Counterfeit Instruments Other than Counterfeit Bearer Obligations of the United States), 2B2.3 (Trespass), and 2B3.2 (Extortion by Force or Threat of Injury or Serious Damage). These changes are designed to supplement existing guidelines and policy statements and thereby ensure that offenses under 18 U.S.C. § 1030 are adequately addressed and punished.</p>
<p>First, the amendment adds a new specific offense characteristic at §2B1.1(b)(13) with three alternative enhancements of two, four, and six levels. The first enhancement provides a two level increase for convictions under 18 U.S.C. § 1030 that involve either (1) a computer system used to maintain or operate a critical infrastructure or used in furtherance of the administration of justice, national defense, or national security; or (2) an intent to obtain private personal information. The second enhancement provides a four level increase for a conviction under 18 U.S.C. § 1030(a)(5)(A)(i), which requires a heightened showing of intent to cause damage. The third enhancement provides a six level increase, with a minimum offense level of level 24, for a conviction under 18 U.S.C. § 1030 that resulted in a substantial disruption of a critical infrastructure. The graduated levels ensure incremental punishment for increasingly serious conduct, and were chosen in recognition of the fact that conduct supporting application of a more serious enhancement frequently will encompass behavior relevant to a lesser enhancement as well. Accordingly, the most serious applicable enhancement will apply in any particular case.</p>
<p>The minimum offense level of level 24 applicable to the third such enhancement was chosen to maintain parity with the minimum offense level that applies to an offense that substantially jeopardized the safety and soundness of a financial institution, substantially endangered the solvency or financial security of a publicly traded company or an organization of at least 1,000 employees, or substantially endangered the solvency or financial security of 100 or more victims. <em>See</em> §2B1.1(b)(12)(B). Because of the potential overlap in certain cases, the commentary provides that the enhancement at §2B1.1(b)(12)(B) will not apply in a case in which the conduct supporting the six level critical infrastructure enhancement is the only conduct that forms the basis for the §2B1.1(b)(12)(B) enhancement.</p>
<p>The minimum offense level of level 24 applicable to the third enhancement also reflects the fact that some offenders to whom the enhancement may apply will be subject to a statutory maximum penalty of five years’ imprisonment, <em>i.e.</em>, those convicted of an offense under 18 U.S.C. § 1030(a)(5)(A)(ii). To ensure that the most egregious cases involving critical infrastructure are adequately addressed, the amendment also provides an encouraged upward departure for cases in which the disruption of the critical infrastructure has a debilitating impact on national security, national economic security, national public health or safety, or any combination of these matters.</p>
<p>A definition of critical infrastructure is provided in the commentary. This definition is derived in part from the definition of critical infrastructure in the USA PATRIOT Act (<em>see</em> Pub. L. 107–56, section 1016; 42 U.S.C. § 5195c(e)) but was modified to ensure that the enhancement will apply to substantial disruptions of critical infrastructure that are regional, rather than national, in scope. Examples of critical infrastructures are provided.</p>
<p>Second, the amendment modifies the rule of construction relating to the calculation of loss in protected computer cases. This change was made to incorporate more fully the statutory definition of loss at 18 U.S.C. § 1030(e)(11), added as part of the USA PATRIOT Act, and to clarify its application to all 18 U.S.C. § 1030 offenses sentenced under §2B1.1.</p>
<p>Third, the amendment expands the upward departure note in §2B1.1. That note provides that an upward departure may be warranted if an offense caused or risked substantial non-monetary harm, including physical harm. The amendment adds a provision that expressly states that an upward departure would be warranted for an offense under 18 U.S.C. § 1030 involving damage to a protected computer that results in death.</p>
<p>Fourth, the amendment modifies §2B2.3, to which 18 U.S.C. § 1030(a)(3) (misdemeanor trespass on a government computer) offenses are referenced, and §2B3.2, to which 18 U.S.C. § 1030(a)(7) (extortionate demand to damage protected computer) offenses are referenced, to provide enhancements relating to computer systems used to maintain or operate a critical infrastructure, or by or for a government entity in furtherance of the administration of justice, national defense, or national security. The amendment expands the scope of existing enhancements to ensure that trespasses and extortions involving these types of important computer systems are addressed.</p>
<p>Finally, the amendment references offenses under 18 U.S.C. § 2701 (unlawful access to stored communications) to §2B1.1. Prior to the Act, a first offense under section 2701 was classified as a misdemeanor offense, and the guidelines did not reference the statute in Appendix A (Statutory Index). Given that the Act increased the penalties available for 18 U.S.C. § 2701 offenses, the amendment references the statute in Appendix A. Section 2701 offenses are referenced to §2B1.1 because such offenses involve the obtaining, altering, or denial of authorized access to stored wire or electronic communications, conduct that is related to fraud, theft, and property damage, which are covered by §2B1.1.</p>

<p>and in the line referenced to 42 U.S.C. § 300i-1 by striking &quot;, 2Q1.5&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This amendment is a three part amendment that (1) further responds to the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism (USA PATRIOT Act) Act of 2001, Pub. L. 107–56; (2) responds to the Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002, Pub. L. 107–188; and (3) responds to the Terrorist Bombings Preparedness and Response Act of 2002, Pub. L. 107–197.</p>
<p>First, this amendment makes changes to the money laundering and transactions structuring guidelines to complete work begun in 2002 to address the provisions of the USA PATRIOT Act. The amendment eliminates the six level enhancement for terrorism in §2S1.1 (Laundering of Monetary Instruments; Engaging in Monetary Transactions in Property Derived from Unlawful Activity) because such conduct is adequately accounted for by the terrorism adjustment at §3A1.4 (Terrorism). The terrorism adjustment at §3A1.4 applies if the offense is a felony that involved, or was intended to promote, a federal crime of terrorism as defined in 18 U.S.C. § 2332b(g)(5). Therefore, if the defendant knew or believed that any of the laundered funds were the proceeds of, or were intended to promote, an offense involving terrorism, as defined in §3A1.4, that adjustment will apply. This amendment also provides for the treatment of certain offenses under 18 U.S.C. § 1960. The amendment changes Appendix A (Statutory Index) to refer violations of 18 U.S.C. § 1960 to both §§2S1.1 and 2S1.3 (Structuring Transactions to Evade Reporting Requirements; Failure to Report Case or Monetary Transactions; Failure to File Currency and Monetary Instrument Report; Knowingly Filing False Reports; Bulk Cash Smuggling; Establishing or Maintaining Prohibited Accounts). Referring violations of 18 U.S.C. § 1960(b)(1)(C) to §2S1.1 is appropriate because the essence of this offense is money laundering, rather than structuring transactions to evade reporting requirements.</p>
<p>The amendment also raises the maximum offense level in §2X3.1 (Accessory After the Fact) from level 20 to level 30 for offenses in which the conduct involves harboring or concealing a fugitive involved in a terrorism offense. The Commission determined that the heightened maximum offense level of level 30 is appropriate for offenses involving the harboring of terrorists because of the relative seriousness of those offenses. Specifically, the heightened maximum offense level applies in any case in which the defendant is convicted under 18 U.S.C. § 2339 or § 2339A or in which the conduct involved harboring a person who committed any offense listed under those statutes, or who committed any offense involving or intending to promote a federal crime of terrorism as defined in 18 U.S.C. § 2332b(g)(5).</p>
<p>Second, the amendment responds to the Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002. The amendment refers certain new offenses involving biological agents and toxins to the guideline covering nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons and materials, §2M6.1 (Unlawful Production, Development, Acquisition, Stockpiling, Alteration, Use, Transfer, or Possession of Nuclear Material, Weapons, or Facilities, Biological Agents, Toxins, or Delivery Systems, Chemical Weapons, or Other Weapons of Mass Destruction; Attempt or Conspiracy).</p>
<p>The amendment also responds to amendments made to the Safe Drinking Water Act (42 U.S.C. § 300i-1(a)) made by section 403 of the Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002. Section 1432(a) of the Safe Drinking Water Act prohibits any person from tampering with a public water system. The statutory maximum penalty was increased from five years’ imprisonment to 20 years’ imprisonment. Section 1432(b) of the Act prohibits anyone from attempting or threatening to tamper with a public water system. The statutory maximum penalty was increased from three years’ imprisonment to ten years’ imprisonment.</p>
<p>The amendment consolidates §§2Q1.5 (Threatened Tampering with Public Water System) and 2Q1.4 (Tampering or Attempted Tampering with Public Water System). This consolidation reflects the similar manner in which threats to carry out a nuclear, biological, or chemical weapons offense are treated under §2M6.1. Three alternative base offense levels are provided for the substantive offense and for a threat to carry out the substantive offense, either accompanied or unaccompanied by other conduct evidencing an intent to carry out the threat.</p>
<p>The amendment also increases the base offense level for offenses involving tampering and threatened tampering with a public water system. The amendment increases the base offense level for tampering with a public water system from level 18 to level 26. The six level enhancement for the risk of death or serious bodily injury (in the predecessor guideline) is incorporated into the base offense level, as are two levels for bodily injury (similar to the treatment of this aggravated conduct in the consumer product tampering guideline). A graduated enhancement for serious or life-threatening bodily injury, modeled after the nuclear, biological, and chemical guideline and the consumer product tampering guideline, is added. Likewise, the base offense level for threatening to tamper with a public water system, without conduct evidencing an intent to carry out the threat, is increased from level 10 to level 16. A base offense level of level 22 is provided if there is conduct evidencing an intent to carry out the threat. For point of comparison, the existing base offense levels for threatening communications under §2A6.1 (Threatening or Harassing Communications) is level 12, and for threatened use of nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons under §2M6.1 is level 20. These substantial increases in the base offense levels for threatened tampering of a public water system are provided to ensure proportionality with similar offenses and to respond to the increased statutory maximum penalties made by section 403 of the Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002. Additionally, the enhancement in subsection (b)(2) regarding the disruption of the public water system has been expanded slightly to make it consistent with similar enhancements in other related guidelines, such as the nuclear, biological, and chemical guideline, §2M6.1.</p>
<p>This amendment adds an invited upward departure provision in §2B1.1 (Larceny, Embezzlement, and Other Forms of Theft; Offenses Involving Stolen Property; Property Damage or Destruction; Fraud and Deceit; Forgery; Offenses Involving Altered or Counterfeit Instruments Other than Counterfeit Bearer Obligations of the United States), to account for aggravating conduct that may occur in connection with an animal enterprise offense under 18 U.S.C. § 43. While reference only to that guideline generally continues to be appropriate for violations under 18 U.S.C. § 43, that guideline fails to account for aggravated situations in which serious bodily injury or death results. Although the property damage guideline contains an enhancement for the risk of serious bodily injury or death, there is no enhancement or cross reference in that guideline that would provide a higher offense level if actual serious bodily injury or death resulted. Given the highly unusual occurrence of death or serious bodily injury in property damage cases generally and the infrequency of these specific offenses, the amendment adds an invited upward departure provision in the commentary of §2B1.1 if death or serious bodily injury occurs in an offense under 18 U.S.C. § 43, or if substantial or significant scientific information or research is lost as part of such an offense.</p>
<p>Third, the amendment amends Appendix A (and the Statutory Provisions of the pertinent Chapter Two guidelines) to add three new offenses created by the Terrorist Bombings Convention Implementation Act of 2002, and provides conforming amendments within a number of Chapter Two guidelines to incorporate more fully the new offenses into the offense guidelines. Section 102 of the Act created a new offense at 18 U.S.C. § 2332f, which provides in subsection (a) that &quot;whoever unlawfully delivers, places, discharges, or detonates an explosive or other lethal device in, into, or against a place of public use, a state or government facility, a public transportation system, or an infrastructure facility (1) with the intent to cause death or serious bodily injury, or (2) with the intent to cause extensive destruction of such a place, facility, or system, where such destruction results in or is likely to result in major economic loss&quot; and in subsection (b) that &quot;whoever attempts or conspires to commit [such] an offense&quot; shall be punished as provided under 18 U.S.C. § 2332a(a). Section 2332a offenses currently are referenced to §§2K1.4 (Arson; Property Damage by Use of Explosives) and 2M6.1. The amendment refers this new offense to those guidelines as well. In addition, the amendment amends the alternative base offense levels in §2K1.4(a)(1) so that the base offense level of level 24 applies to targets of 18 U.S.C. § 2332f offenses, namely, state or government facilities, infrastructure facilities, public transportation systems and &quot;places of public use&quot;.</p>
<p>Section 202 of the Act created a new offense at 18 U.S.C. § 2339C. The amendment refers the new offense at 18 U.S.C. § 2339C(1)(A) to §2X2.1 (Aiding and Abetting). The new offense involves providing or collecting funds knowing or intending that the funds would be used to carry out any of a number of specified offenses. Accordingly, the amendment treats these offenses in the same manner as 18 U.S.C. § 2339A offenses, which aid and abet a predicate offense listed in the statute. An amendment is also made in §2X2.1 to provide a definition for the &quot;underlying offense&quot; that is aided and abetted.</p>
<p>The amendment also refers the new offense at 18 U.S.C. § 2339C(a)(1)(B) to §2M5.3 (Providing Material Support or Resources to Designated Foreign Terrorist Organizations). Reference to §2M5.3 is appropriate because this offense involves generally providing or collecting funds knowing or intending that the funds would be used to carry out an act which by its nature is a terrorist act (because it is meant to intimidate a civilian population or to compel a government or international organization to do something or to refrain from doing something). Therefore, the essence of the offense is the provision of material support to terrorists, which appropriately is referenced to §2M5.3. The amendment expands §2M5.3 to include not only designated foreign terrorist organizations but other terrorists as well.</p>
<p>Additionally, 18 U.S.C. § 2339C(c)(2) makes it unlawful in the United States, or outside the United States by a national of the United States or an entity organized under the laws of the United States, to knowingly conceal or disguise the nature, location, source, ownership, or control of any material support, resources, or funds knowing or intending that they were (1) provided in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2339B, or (2) provided or collected in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2339C(a)(1) or (2). The maximum term of imprisonment for a violation of subsection 18 U.S.C. § 2339C(c) is 10 years. The amendment references offenses under 18 U.S.C. § 2339C(c)(2)(A) to §2X3.1 (Accessory After the Fact), because the essence of such an offense is the concealment of resources that were known or intended to have been provided in violation of another substantive offense, namely, 18 U.S.C. § 2339B. An amendment is made in §2X3.1 to provide a definition of the &quot;underlying offense&quot; to which the defendant is an accessory.</p>
<p>The amendment references offenses under 18 U.S.C. § 2339C(c)(2)(B) to §§2M5.3 and 2X3.1. To the extent the offense involved knowingly concealing or disguising the nature, location, source, ownership, or control of any funds knowing or intending that they were provided or collected in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2339C(a)(1)(A), the offense should be sentenced under §2X3.1. This is because the concealment occurs with respect to funds the defendant knows are to be used, in full or in part, in order to carry out an act which constitutes any number of specified offenses. To the extent the offense involved knowingly concealing or disguising the nature, location, source, ownership, or control of any funds knowing or intending that they were provided or collected in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2339C(a)(1)(B), the offense should be sentenced under §2M5.3. This is because the concealment occurs with respect to material support the defendant knows is to be used, in full or in part, in order to carry out an act which by its nature is a terrorist act (because it is meant to intimidate a civilian population or to compel a government or international organization to do something or to refrain from doing something). A conforming amendment is added to the Statutory Provisions of §§2M5.3 and 2X3.1.</p>
<p>Finally, an amendment is made to §2K1.3 (Unlawful Receipt, Possession, or Transportation of Explosive Materials; Prohibited Transaction Involving Explosive Materials) to add an additional base offense level of level 18 for certain offenses committed under 18 U.S.C. § 842(p)(2) involving explosives, destructive devices, or weapons of mass destruction. The statute is referenced in Appendix A to §§2K1.3 and 2M6.1. The applicable offense levels at §2M6.1 are levels 42 and 28. The applicable base offense level at §2K1.3 is level 12. The base offense level of level 12 appears to be disproportionately low compared with other 20 year offenses and compared with the treatment of 18 U.S.C. § 842(p)(2) offenses under §2M6.1. This is especially true in light of the definition of destructive device, defined at 18 U.S.C. § 921(a)(4) to include any explosive, incendiary, or poison gas (1) bomb; (2) grenade; (3) rocket having a propellant charge of more than four ounces; (4) missile having an explosive or incendiary charge of more than one-quarter ounce; (5) mine; or (6) device similar to any of the devices described in the preceding clauses.</p>
<p>The amendment makes the enhancement at §2K1.3(b)(3) and the cross reference at §2K1.3(c)(1) applicable to 18 U.S.C. § 842(p)(2) offenses. In cases in which the defendant used or possessed any explosive material in connection with another felony offense or possessed or transferred any explosive material with knowledge, intent, or reason to believe that it would be used or possessed in connection with another felony offense, subsection (b)(3) provides a four level enhancement and a minimum offense level of level 18. Alternatively, the cross reference at subsection (c)(1) references such cases either to §2X1.1 (Attempt, Solicitation, or Conspiracy (Not Covered by a Specific Guideline)), or to the most analogous homicide guideline if death resulted, if the resulting offense level is greater. Application of both subsection (b)(3) and subsection (c)(1) to 18 U.S.C. § 842(p)(2) offenses is appropriate because of the defendant’s knowledge and/or intent that the defendant’s teaching would be used to carry out another felony.</p>

{id: 656, content:"<p><strong>656.</strong> <strong>Amendment:</strong> The heading of Part C of Chapter Two, amendments to the Introductory Commentary of Part C of Chapter Two, §§2C1.8, 3D1.2 and 5E1.2, effective January 25, 2003 (<em>see</em> USSC <em>Guidelines Manual</em> Appendix C (Volume II), Amendment 648), are repromulgated without change. Appendix A, effective January 25, 2003 (<em>see</em> USSC <em>Guidelines Manual</em> Appendix C (Volume II), Amendments 647 and 648; <em>see</em> <em>also</em> this document, Amendment 653), is repromulgated without change.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> The Commission promulgated an emergency amendment addressing the directive from Congress contained in the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002, Pub. L. 107–155, (the &quot;BCRA&quot;), with an effective date of January 25, 2003. (<em>See</em> Amendment 648.) This amendment repromulgates without change the emergency amendment as a permanent amendment.</p>
<p>This amendment implements the directive from Congress contained in the BCRA to the effect that the Commission &quot;promulgate a guideline, or amend an existing guideline ... , for penalties for violations of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 [the &quot;FECA&quot;] and related election laws ... .&quot; The BCRA significantly increased statutory penalties for campaign finance crimes, formerly misdemeanors under the FECA. The new statutory maximum term of imprisonment for even the least serious of these offenses is now two years, and for more serious offenses, the maximum term of imprisonment is five years.</p>
<p>To punish these offenses effectively, the Commission chose to create a new guideline at §2C1.8 (Making, Receiving, or Failing to Report a Contribution, Donation, or Expenditure in Violation of the Federal Election Campaign Act; Fraudulently Misrepresenting Campaign Authority; Soliciting or Receiving a Donation in Connection with an Election While on Certain Federal Property). The Commission opted against simply amending an existing guideline because it determined after review that the characteristics of election violation cases did not bear sufficient similarity to cases sentenced under any existing guideline. The offenses that will be sentenced under §2C1.8 include: violations of the statutory prohibitions against &quot;soft money&quot; (2 U.S.C. § 441i); restrictions on &quot;hard money&quot; contributions (2 U.S.C. § 441a); contributions by foreign nationals (2 U.S.C. § 441e); restrictions on &quot;electioneering communications&quot; (as defined in 2 U.S.C. § 434(f)(3)_C_); certain fraudulent misrepresentations (2 U.S.C. § 441h); and &quot;conduit contributions&quot; (2 U.S.C. § 441f).</p>
<p>The new guideline has a base offense level of level 8, which reflects the fact that these offenses, while they are somewhat similar to fraud offenses (sentenced under §2B1.1 (Larceny, Embezzlement, and Other Forms of Theft; Offenses Involving Stolen Property; Property Damage or Destruction; Fraud and Deceit; Forgery; Offenses Involving Altered or Counterfeit Instruments Other than Counterfeit Bearer Obligations of the United States) at a base offense level of level 6), nevertheless are more serious due to the additional harm, or the potential harm, of corrupting the elective process.</p>
<p>The new guideline provides five specific offense characteristics to ensure appropriate penalty enhancements for aggravating conduct that may occur during the commission of certain campaign finance offenses. First, the new guideline provides a specific offense characteristic, at §2C1.8(b)(1), that uses the fraud loss table in §2B1.1 incrementally to increase the offense level in proportion to the monetary amounts involved in the illegal transactions. This both assures proportionality with penalties for fraud offenses and responds to Congress’ directive to provide an enhancement for &quot;a large aggregate amount of illegal contributions.&quot;</p>
<p>Second, the new guideline provides alternative enhancements, at §2C1.8(b)(2), if the offense involved a foreign national (two levels) or a foreign government (four levels). These enhancements respond to another specific directive in the BCRA and reflect the seriousness of attempts by foreign entities to tamper with the United States’ election processes.</p>
<p>Third, the new guideline provides alternative enhancements of two levels each, at §2C1.8(b)(3), when the offense involves either &quot;governmental funds,&quot; defined broadly to include federal, state, or local funds, or an intent to derive &quot;a specific, identifiable non-monetary Federal benefit&quot; (<em>e.g.</em>, a presidential pardon). Each of these enhancements responds to specific directives of the BCRA.</p>
<p>Fourth, the new guideline provides a two level enhancement, at subsection (b)(4), when the offender engages in &quot;30 or more illegal transactions.&quot; After a review of all campaign finance cases in the Commission’s datafile, the Commission chose 30 transactions as the number best illustrative of a &quot;large number&quot; in that context. This enhancement also responds to a specific directive in the BCRA to the effect that the Commission provide enhanced sentencing for cases involving &quot;a large number of illegal transactions.&quot;</p>
<p>Fifth, the new guideline provides a four level enhancement, at §2C1.8(b)(5), if the offense involves the use of &quot;intimidation, threat of pecuniary or other harm, or coercion.&quot; This enhancement responds to information, received from the Federal Election Commission and the Public Integrity Section of the Department of Justice, which characterizes offenses of this type as some of the most aggravated offenses committed under the FECA.</p>
<p>The new guideline also provides a cross reference, at subsection _c_, which directs the sentencing court to apply either §2C1.1 (Offering, Giving, Soliciting, or Receiving a Bribe; Extortion Under Color of Official Right) or §2C1.2 (Offering, Giving, Soliciting, or Receiving a Gratuity), as appropriate, if the offense involved a bribe or a gratuity and the resulting offense level would be greater than that determined under §2C1.8.</p>
<p>Section 3D1.2 (Groups of Closely Related Counts) has been amended, consistent with the principles underlying the rules for grouping multiple counts of conviction, to include §2C1.8 offenses among those in which the offense level is determined largely on the basis of the total amount of harm or loss or some other measure of aggregate harm. (<em>See</em> §3D1.2(d)).</p>
<p>Finally, §5E1.2 (Fines for Individual Defendants) has been amended specifically to reflect fine provisions unique to the FECA. This part of the amendment also provides that the defendant’s participation in a conciliation agreement with the Federal Election Commission may be an appropriate factor for use in determining the specific fine within the applicable fine guideline range unless the defendant began negotiations with the Federal Election Commission only after the defendant became aware that the defendant was the subject of a criminal investigation.</p>

<p><strong>657.</strong> <strong>Amendment</strong>: Section 2D1.1(c) is amended in Note (B) of the &quot;*Notes to Drug Quantity Table&quot; by adding at the end the following new paragraph:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The term ‘Oxycodone (actual)’ refers to the weight of the controlled substance, itself, contained in the pill, capsule, or mixture.&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §2D1.1 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended in Note 9 by striking &quot;or &quot; after &quot;amphetamine,&quot;; and by inserting &quot;, or oxycodone&quot; after &quot;methamphetamine&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §2D1.1 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended in Note 10, in the Drug Equivalency Tables, in the subdivision captioned &quot;Schedule I or II Opiates*&quot; by striking &quot;1 gm of Oxycodone = 500 gm of marihuana&quot; and inserting &quot;1 gm of Oxycodone (actual) = 6700 gm of marihuana&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This amendment responds to proportionality issues in the sentencing of oxycodone trafficking offenses. Oxycodone is an opium alkaloid found in certain prescription pain relievers such as Percocet and OxyContin. This prescription drug generally is sold in pill form and, prior to this amendment, the sentencing guidelines established penalties for oxycodone trafficking based on the entire weight of the pill. The proportionality issues arise (1) because of the formulations of the different medicines; and (2) because different amounts of oxycodone are found in pills of identical weight.</p>
<p>As an example of the first issue, the drug Percocet contains, in addition to oxycodone, the non-prescription pain reliever acetaminophen. The weight of the oxycodone component accounts for a very small proportion of the total weight of the pill. In contrast, the weight of the oxycodone accounts for a substantially greater proportion of the weight of an OxyContin pill. To illustrate this difference, a Percocet pill containing five milligrams (mg) of oxycodone weighs approximately 550 mg with oxycodone accounting for 0.9 percent of the total weight of the pill. By comparison, the weight of an OxyContin pill containing 10 mg of oxycodone is approximately 135 mg with oxycodone accounting for 7.4 percent of the total weight. Consequently, prior to this amendment, trafficking 364 Percocet pills or 1,481 OxyContin pills resulted in the same five year sentence of imprisonment. Additionally, the total amount of the narcotic oxycodone involved in this example is vastly different depending on the drug. The 364 Percocets produce 1.8 grams of actual oxycodone while the 1,481 OxyContin pills produce 14.8 grams of oxycodone.</p>
<p>The second issue results from differences in the formulation of OxyContin. Three different amounts of oxycodone (10, 20, and 40 mg) are contained in pills of identical weight (135 mg). As a result, prior to this amendment, an individual trafficking in a particular number of OxyContin pills would receive the same sentence regardless of the amount of oxycodone contained in the pills.</p>
<p>To remedy these proportionality issues, the amendment changes the Drug Equivalency Tables in §2D1.1 (Unlawful Manufacturing, Importing, Exporting, or Trafficking (Including Possession with Intent to Commit These Offenses); Attempt or Conspiracy) to provide sentences for oxycodone offenses using the weight of the actual oxycodone instead of calculating the weight of the entire pill. The amendment equates 1 gram of actual oxycodone to 6,700 grams of marihuana. This equivalency keeps penalties for offenses involving 10 mg OxyContin pills identical to levels that existed prior to the amendment, substantially increases penalties for all other doses of OxyContin, and decreases somewhat the penalties for offenses involving Percocet.</p>

<p>(vii) ‘Sentence imposed’ has the meaning given the term ‘sentence of imprisonment’ in Application Note 2 and subsection (b) of §4A1.2 (Definitions and Instructions for Computing Criminal History), without regard to the date of the conviction. The length of the sentence imposed includes any term of imprisonment given upon revocation of probation, parole, or supervised release.</p>

<p>Appendix A (Statutory Index) is amended by striking the following:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&quot;8 U.S.C. § 1252(e) 2L1.2&quot;,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>and inserting the following:</p>
<p>&quot;8 U.S.C. § 1253 2L1.2&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> In 2001 the Commission comprehensively revised §2L1.2 (Unlawfully Entering or Remaining in the United States) to provide more graduated enhancements at subsection (b)(1) for illegal re-entrants previously deported after criminal convictions. In response to application issues raised by a number of judges, probation officers, defense attorneys, and prosecutors, particularly along the southwest border between the United States and Mexico, this amendment builds upon the 2001 amendment by clarifying the meaning of some of the terms used in §2L1.2(b)(1).</p>
<p>First, the amendment adds commentary to define the following offenses: &quot;alien smuggling&quot;, &quot;child pornography&quot;, and &quot;human trafficking.&quot; Prior to the amendment, these offenses received a 16 level increase but were not defined. The lack of definitions led to litigation regarding the meaning and scope of some of these terms. The Commission has determined that these offenses warrant application of the 16 level enhancement even though some of these offenses, as defined by the amendment, may not meet the statutory definition of an aggravated felony in 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43).</p>
<p>The amendment provides a definition of &quot;alien smuggling offense&quot; in a manner consistent with the &quot;aggravated felony&quot; definition in 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43)(N). This statutory definition excludes &quot;a first offense for which the alien has affirmatively shown that the alien committed the offense for the purpose of assisting, abetting, or aiding only the alien’s spouse, child, or parent (and no other person)&quot;. This definition generally is consistent with the guideline’s previous terminology of &quot;alien smuggling offense committed for profit,&quot; and results in a 16 level increase only for the most serious of such offenses. The new definition also responds to concerns about whether an alien smuggling offense includes the offenses of harboring or transporting aliens. By explicitly incorporating the statutory definition of alien smuggling within the guideline definition, the amendment, in effect, adopts the Fifth Circuit’s interpretation of &quot;alien smuggling&quot;. <em>See</em> <em>United States v. Solis-Campozano</em>, 312 F.3d 164 (5th Cir. 2002) (holding that &quot;alien smuggling offense&quot; was not limited to the &quot;offense of alien smuggling&quot; but includes transporting aliens brought into the country as well).</p>
<p>Second, the amendment adds commentary that clarifies the meaning of the term &quot;crime of violence&quot; by providing that the term &quot;means any of the following: murder, manslaughter, kidnapping, aggravated assault, forcible sex offenses, statutory rape, sexual abuse of a minor, robbery, arson, extortion, extortionate extension of credit, burglary of a dwelling, or any offense under federal, state, or local law that has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.&quot; The previous definition often led to confusion over whether the specified offenses listed in that definition, particularly sexual abuse of a minor and residential burglary, also had to include as an element of the offense &quot;the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.&quot; The amended definition makes clear that the enumerated offenses are always classified as &quot;crimes of violence,&quot; regardless of whether the prior offense expressly has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.</p>
<p>Third, the amendment adds commentary at Application Note 1(B)(vii) explaining that the term &quot;sentence imposed&quot; has the meaning given the term &quot;sentence of imprisonment&quot; in Application Note 2 and subsection (b) of §4A1.2 (Definitions and Instructions for Computing Criminal History), without regard to the date of the conviction. The length of the sentence of imprisonment includes any term of imprisonment given upon revocation of probation, parole, or supervised release. The Commission’s approach in clarifying this definition is consistent with the case law interpreting the term and the use of the term in Chapter Four of the guidelines. <em>See</em>, <em>e.g</em>., <em>United States v. Moreno-Cisneros</em>, 319 F.3d 456 (9th Cir. 2003) (holding that the length of the sentence of imprisonment includes any term of imprisonment given upon revocation of probation, parole, or supervised release); <em>United States v. Compian-Torres</em>, 320 F.3d 514 (5th Cir. 2003) (same). <em>Compare</em> <em>United States v. Hidalgo-Macias</em>, 300 F.3d 281 (2d Cir. 2002) (holding that the imposition of a sentence of imprisonment following revocation of probation is a modification of the original sentence and must be considered part of the sentence imposed for the original offense), <em>with</em> <em>United States v. Rodriguez-Arreola</em>, 313 F.3d 1064 (8th Cir. 2002) (holding that the term &quot;sentence imposed&quot; when applied to an indeterminate sentence is the maximum term that a defendant may serve).</p>
<p>Fourth, the amendment adds commentary providing that the enhancements in subsection (b)(1) do not apply to a conviction for an offense committed before the defendant was eighteen years of age, unless such conviction is classified as an adult conviction under the laws of the jurisdiction in which the defendant was convicted. This provision is consistent with the approach in Chapter Four of the guidelines.</p>
<p>The amendment also makes other minor technical and clarifying changes.</p>

{id: 659, content:"<p><strong>659.</strong> <strong>Amendment:</strong> Chapter Three, Part B, is amended by adding at the end the following new guideline:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;§3B1.5. <em>Use of Body Armor in Drug Trafficking Crimes and Crimes of Violence</em></p>
<p>If—</p>
<p>(1) the defendant was convicted of a drug trafficking crime or a crime of violence; and</p>
<p>(2) (apply the greater)—</p>
<p>(A) the offense involved the use of body armor, increase by 2 levels; or</p>
<p>(B) the defendant used body armor during the commission of the offense, in preparation for the offense, or in an attempt to avoid apprehension for the offense, increase by 4 levels.</p>
<p><em>Commentary</em></p>
<p><em>Application Notes</em>:</p>
<p>1. <em>Definitions</em>.—For purposes of this guideline:</p>
<p>‘Body armor’ means any product sold or offered for sale, in interstate or foreign commerce, as personal protective body covering intended to protect against gunfire, regardless of whether the product is to be worn alone or is sold as a complement to another product or garment. <em>See</em> 18 U.S.C. § 921(a)(35).</p>
<p>‘Crime of violence’ has the meaning given that term in 18 U.S.C. § 16.</p>
<p>‘Drug trafficking crime’ has the meaning given that term in 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(2).</p>
<p>‘Offense’ has the meaning given that term in Application Note 1 of the Commentary to §1B1.1 (Application Instructions).</p>
<p>‘Use’ means (A) active employment in a manner to protect the person from gunfire; or (B) use as a means of bartering. ‘Use’ does not mean mere possession (<em>e.g</em>., ‘use’ does not mean that the body armor was found in the trunk of the car but not used actively as protection). ‘Used’ means put into ‘use’ as defined in this paragraph.</p>
<p>2. <em>Application of Subdivision (2)(B)</em>.—Consistent with §1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct), the term ‘defendant’, for purposes of subdivision (2)(B), limits the accountability of the defendant to the defendant’s own conduct and conduct that the defendant aided or abetted, counseled, commanded, induced, procured, or willfully caused.</p>
<p><em>Background</em>: This guideline implements the directive in the James Guelff and Chris McCurley Body Armor Act of 2002 (section 11009(d) of the 21<sup>st</sup> Century Department of Justice Appropriations Authorization Act, Pub. L. 107–273).&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This amendment responds to the directive in section 11009 of the 21st Century Department of Justice Appropriations Authorization Act (the &quot;Act&quot;), Pub. L. 107–273. The directive requires the Sentencing Commission to review and amend the guidelines, as appropriate, to provide an appropriate sentencing enhancement for any crime of violence (as defined in 18 U.S.C. § 16) or drug trafficking crime (as defined in 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)) (including a crime of violence or drug trafficking crime that provides for an enhanced punishment if committed by the use of a deadly or dangerous weapon or device) in which the defendant used body armor. The Act included a sense of Congress that any such enhancement should be at least two levels.</p>
<p>In response to the directive, the amendment creates a new Chapter Three adjustment at §3B1.5 (Use of Body Armor in Drug Trafficking Crimes and Crimes of Violence). The new adjustment provides for the greater of a two level adjustment if the defendant was convicted of a crime of violence or a drug trafficking crime and the offense involved the use of body armor, or a four level adjustment if the defendant used body armor in preparation for, during the commission of, or in an attempt to avoid apprehension for, the offense.</p>
<p>An application note defines &quot;drug trafficking crime&quot; (as defined in 18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(2)). This definition includes any felony punishable under the Controlled Substances Act. The application note also defines &quot;crime of violence&quot; (as defined in 18 U.S.C. § 16). This definition includes offenses that involve the use or attempted use of physical force against property as well as persons. Both of these definitions are somewhat broader than the definitions of &quot;crime of violence&quot; and &quot;drug trafficking offense&quot; used in a number of other guidelines. The definition of &quot;body armor&quot; is the same as the statutory definition provided in 18 U.S.C. § 921(a)(35).</p>
<p>An application note makes clear that in order for §3B1.5 to apply, the body armor must be used, <em>i.e.</em>, actively employed either in a manner to protect the person from gunfire or as a means of bartering. Mere possession is insufficient to trigger the adjustment.</p>
<p>Another application note explains that in order for the heightened, four level adjustment to apply, the defendant must have used the body armor or aided, abetted, counseled, commanded, induced, procured, or willfully caused someone else to use the body armor.</p>

{id: 660, content:"<p><strong>660.</strong> <strong>Amendment:</strong> Section 5G1.3 is amended by striking subsection (b) as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;(b) If subsection (a) does not apply, and the undischarged term of imprisonment resulted from offense(s) that have been fully taken into account in the determination of the offense level for the instant offense, the sentence for the instant offense shall be imposed to run concurrently to the undischarged term of imprisonment.&quot;,</p>
<p>and inserting the following:</p>
<p>&quot;(b) If subsection (a) does not apply, and a term of imprisonment resulted from another offense that is relevant conduct to the instant offense of conviction under the provisions of subsections (a)(1), (a)(2), or (a)(3) of §1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct) and that was the basis for an increase in the offense level for the instant offense under Chapter Two (Offense Conduct) or Chapter Three (Adjustments), the sentence for the instant offense shall be imposed as follows:</p>
<p>(1) the court shall adjust the sentence for any period of imprisonment already served on the undischarged term of imprisonment if the court determines that such period of imprisonment will not be credited to the federal sentence by the Bureau of Prisons; and</p>
<p>(2) the sentence for the instant offense shall be imposed to run concurrently to the remainder of the undischarged term of imprisonment.&quot;.</p>
<p>Section 5G1.3(c) is amended by inserting &quot;involving an undischarged term of imprisonment&quot; after &quot;case&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §5G1.3 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended by striking Notes 2 through 7 as follows:</p>
<p>&quot;2. <em>Adjusted concurrent sentence - subsection (b) cases</em>. When a sentence is imposed pursuant to subsection (b), the court should adjust the sentence for any period of imprisonment already served as a result of the conduct taken into account in determining the guideline range for the instant offense if the court determines that period of imprisonment will not be credited to the federal sentence by the Bureau of Prisons. <em>Example</em>: The defendant is convicted of a federal offense charging the sale of 30 grams of cocaine. Under §1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct), the defendant is held accountable for the sale of an additional 15 grams of cocaine, an offense for which the defendant has been convicted and sentenced in state court. The defendant received a nine-month sentence of imprisonment for the state offense and has served six months on that sentence at the time of sentencing on the instant federal offense. The guideline range applicable to the defendant is 10-16 months (Chapter Two offense level of 14 for sale of 45 grams of cocaine; 2-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility; final offense level of 12; Criminal History Category I). The court determines that a sentence of 13 months provides the appropriate total punishment. Because the defendant has already served six months on the related state charge as of the date of sentencing on the instant federal offense, a sentence of seven months, imposed to run concurrently with the three months remaining on the defendant’s state sentence, achieves this result. For clarity, the court should note on the Judgment in a Criminal Case Order that the sentence imposed is not a departure from the guideline range because the defendant has been credited for guideline purposes under §5G1.3(b) with six months served in state custody that will not be credited to the federal sentence under 18 U.S.C. § 3585(b).</p>
<p>3. <em>Concurrent or consecutive sentence - subsection (c) cases</em>. In circumstances not covered under subsection (a) or (b), subsection (c) applies. Under this subsection, the court may impose a sentence concurrently, partially concurrently, or consecutively. To achieve a reasonable punishment and avoid unwarranted disparity, the court should consider the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. § 3584 (referencing 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)) and be cognizant of:</p>
<p>(a) the type (<em>e.g.</em>, determinate, indeterminate/parolable) and length of the prior undischarged sentence;</p>
<p>(b) the time served on the undischarged sentence and the time likely to be served before release;</p>
<p>(c) the fact that the prior undischarged sentence may have been imposed in state court</p>
<p>rather than federal court, or at a different time before the same or different federal court; and</p>
<p>(d) any other circumstance relevant to the determination of an appropriate sentence for the instant offense.</p>
<p>4. <em>Partially concurrent sentence</em>. In some cases under subsection (c), a partially concurrent sentence may achieve most appropriately the desired result. To impose a partially concurrent sentence, the court may provide in the Judgment in a Criminal Case Order that the sentence for the instant offense shall commence (A) when the defendant is released from the prior undischarged sentence, or (B) on a specified date, whichever is earlier. This order provides for a fully consecutive sentence if the defendant is released on the undischarged term of imprisonment on or before the date specified in the order, and a partially concurrent sentence if the defendant is not released on the undischarged term of imprisonment by that date.</p>
<p>5. <em>Complex situations</em>. Occasionally, the court may be faced with a complex case in which a defendant may be subject to multiple undischarged terms of imprisonment that seemingly call for the application of different rules. In such a case, the court may exercise its discretion in accordance with subsection (c) to fashion a sentence of appropriate length and structure it to run in any appropriate manner to achieve a reasonable punishment for the instant offense.</p>
<p>6. <em>Revocations</em>. If the defendant was on federal or state probation, parole, or supervised release at the time of the instant offense, and has had such probation, parole, or supervised release revoked, the sentence for the instant offense should be imposed to run consecutively to the term imposed for the violation of probation, parole, or supervised release in order to provide an incremental penalty for the violation of probation, parole, or supervised release. <em>See</em> §7B1.3 (Revocation of Probation or Supervised Release) (setting forth a policy that any imprisonment penalty imposed for violating probation or supervised release should be consecutive to any sentence of imprisonment being served or subsequently imposed).</p>
<p>7. <em>Downward Departure Provision</em>.—In the case of a discharged term of imprisonment, a downward departure is not prohibited if subsection (b) would have applied to that term of imprisonment had the term been undischarged. Any such departure should be fashioned to achieve a reasonable punishment for the instant offense.&quot;,</p>
<p>and inserting the following:</p>
<p>&quot;2. <em>Application of Subsection (b)</em>.—</p>
<p>(A) <em>In General</em>.—Subsection (b) applies in cases in which all of the prior offense (i) is relevant conduct to the instant offense under the provisions of subsection (a)(1), (a)(2), or (a)(3) of §1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct); and (ii) has resulted in an increase in the Chapter Two or Three offense level for the instant offense. Cases in which only part of the prior offense is relevant conduct to the instant offense are covered under subsection (c).</p>
<p>(B) <em>Inapplicability of Subsection (b)</em>.—Subsection (b) does not apply in cases in which the prior offense increased the Chapter Two or Three offense level for the instant offense but was not relevant conduct to the instant offense under §1B1.3(a)(1), (a)(2), or (a)(3) (<em>e.g.</em>, the prior offense is an aggravated felony for which the defendant received an increase under §2L1.2 (Unlawfully Entering or Remaining in the United States), or the prior offense was a crime of violence for which the defendant received an increased base offense level under §2K2.1 (Unlawful Receipt, Possession, or Transportation of Firearms or Ammunition; Prohibited Transactions Involving Firearms or Ammunition)).</p>
<p>(C) <em>Imposition of Sentence</em>.—If subsection (b) applies, and the court adjusts the sentence for a period of time already served, the court should note on the Judgement in a Criminal Case Order (i) the applicable subsection (<em>e.g.</em>, §5G1.3(b)); (ii) the amount of time by which the sentence is being adjusted; (iii) the undischarged term of imprisonment for which the adjustment is being given; and (iv) that the sentence imposed is a sentence reduction pursuant to §5G1.3(b) for a period of imprisonment that will not be credited by the Bureau of Prisons.</p>
<p>(D) <em>Example</em>.—The following is an example in which subsection (b) applies and an adjustment to the sentence is appropriate:</p>
<p>The defendant is convicted of a federal offense charging the sale of 40 grams of cocaine. Under §1B1.3, the defendant is held accountable for the sale of an additional 15 grams of cocaine, an offense for which the defendant has been convicted and sentenced in state court. The defendant received a nine-month sentence of imprisonment for the state offense and has served six months on that sentence at the time of sentencing on the instant federal offense. The guideline range applicable to the defendant is 12-18 months (Chapter Two offense level of level 16 for sale of 55 grams of cocaine; 3 level reduction for acceptance of responsibility; final offense level of level 13; Criminal History Category I). The court determines that a sentence of 13 months provides the appropriate total punishment. Because the defendant has already served six months on the related state charge as of the date of sentencing on the instant federal offense, a sentence of seven months, imposed to run concurrently with the three months remaining on the defendant’s state sentence, achieves this result.</p>
<p>3. <em>Application of Subsection (c)</em>.—</p>
<p>(A) <em>In General</em>.—Under subsection (c), the court may impose a sentence concurrently, partially concurrently, or consecutively to the undischarged term of imprisonment. In order to achieve a reasonable incremental punishment for the instant offense and avoid unwarranted disparity, the court should consider the following:</p>
<p>(i) the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. § 3584 (referencing 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a));</p>
<p>(ii) the type (<em>e.g.</em>, determinate, indeterminate/parolable) and length of the prior undischarged sentence;</p>
<p>(iii) the time served on the undischarged sentence and the time likely to be served before release;</p>
<p>(iv) the fact that the prior undischarged sentence may have been imposed in state court rather than federal court, or at a different time before the same or different federal court; and</p>
<p>(v) any other circumstance relevant to the determination of an appropriate sentence for the instant offense.</p>
<p>(B) <em>Partially Concurrent Sentence</em>.—In some cases under subsection (c), a partially concurrent sentence may achieve most appropriately the desired result. To impose a partially concurrent sentence, the court may provide in the Judgment in a Criminal Case Order that the sentence for the instant offense shall commence on the earlier of (i) when the defendant is released from the prior undischarged sentence; or (ii) on a specified date. This order provides for a fully consecutive sentence if the defendant is released on the undischarged term of imprisonment on or before the date specified in the order, and a partially concurrent sentence if the defendant is not released on the undischarged term of imprisonment by that date.</p>
<p>(C) <em>Undischarged Terms of Imprisonment Resulting from Revocations of Probation, Parole or Supervised Release</em>.—Subsection (c) applies in cases in which the defendant was on federal or state probation, parole, or supervised release at the time of the instant offense and has had such probation, parole, or supervised release revoked. Consistent with the policy set forth in Application Note 4 and subsection (f) of §7B1.3 (Revocation of Probation or Supervised Release), the Commission recommends that the sentence for the instant offense be imposed consecutively to the sentence imposed for the revocation.</p>
<p>(D) <em>Complex Situations</em>.—Occasionally, the court may be faced with a complex case in which a defendant may be subject to multiple undischarged terms of imprisonment that seemingly call for the application of different rules. In such a case, the court may exercise its discretion in accordance with subsection (c) to fashion a sentence of appropriate length and structure it to run in any appropriate manner to achieve a reasonable punishment for the instant offense.</p>
<p>(E) <em>Downward Departure</em>.—Unlike subsection (b), subsection (c) does not authorize an adjustment of the sentence for the instant offense for a period of imprisonment already served on the undischarged term of imprisonment. However, in an extraordinary case involving an undischarged term of imprisonment under subsection (c), it may be appropriate for the court to downwardly depart. This may occur, for example, in a case in which the defendant has served a very substantial period of imprisonment on an undischarged term of imprisonment that resulted from conduct only partially within the relevant conduct for the instant offense. In such a case, a downward departure may be warranted to ensure that the combined punishment is not increased unduly by the fortuity and timing of separate prosecutions and sentencings. Nevertheless, it is intended that a departure pursuant to this application note result in a sentence that ensures a reasonable incremental punishment for the instant offense of conviction.</p>
<p>To avoid confusion with the Bureau of Prisons’ exclusive authority provided under 18 U.S.C. § 3585(b) to grant credit for time served under certain circumstances, the Commission recommends that any downward departure under this application note be clearly stated on the Judgment in a Criminal Case Order as a downward departure pursuant to §5G1.3(c), rather than as a credit for time served.</p>
<p>4. <em>Downward Departure Provision</em>.—In the case of a discharged term of imprisonment, a downward departure is not prohibited if the defendant (A) has completed serving a term of imprisonment; and (B) subsection (b) would have provided an adjustment had that completed term of imprisonment been undischarged at the time of sentencing for the instant offense. <em>See</em> §5K2.23 (Discharged Terms of Imprisonment).&quot;.</p>
<p>Chapter Five, Part K, is amended by adding at the end the following new policy statement:</p>
<p>&quot;§5K2.23. <em>Discharged Terms of Imprisonment</em> (Policy Statement)</p>
<p>A sentence below the applicable guideline range may be appropriate if the defendant (1) has completed serving a term of imprisonment; and (2) subsection (b) of §5G1.3 (Imposition of a Sentence on a Defendant Subject to Undischarged Term of Imprisonment) would have provided an adjustment had that completed term of imprisonment been undischarged at the time of sentencing for the instant offense. Any such departure should be fashioned to achieve a reasonable punishment for the instant offense.&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Reason for Amendment:</strong> This amendment addresses a number of issues in §5G1.3 (Imposition of a Sentence on a Defendant Subject to an Undischarged Term of Imprisonment).</p>
<p>First, this amendment clarifies the rule for application of subsection (b) (mandating a concurrent term of imprisonment) with respect to a prior term of imprisonment by stating that subsection (b) shall apply only to prior offenses that are relevant conduct to the instant offense of conviction and that resulted in an increase in the offense level for the instant offense. By clarifying the application of subsection (b), this amendment addresses conflicting litigation regarding the meaning of &quot;fully taken into account.&quot; <em>Compare</em>, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>United States v. Garcia-Hernandez</em>, 237 F.3d 105, 109 (2d Cir. 2000) (determining that a prior offense is &quot;fully taken into account&quot; if and only if the guidelines provide for sentencing as if both the offense of conviction and the separate offense had been prosecuted in a single proceeding), <em>with</em> <em>United States v. Fuentes</em>, 107 F.3d 1515, 1524 (11th Cir. 1997) (finding that a prior offense has been &quot;fully taken into account&quot; when the prior offense is part of the same course of conduct, common scheme, or plan).</p>
<p>Second, this amendment addresses how this guideline applies in cases in which an instant offense is committed while the defendant is on federal or state probation, parole, or supervised release, and has had such probation, parole, or supervised release revoked. Under this amendment, the sentence for the instant offense may be imposed concurrently, partially concurrently, or consecutively to the undischarged term of imprisonment; however, the Commission recommends a consecutive sentence in this situation. This amendment also resolves a circuit conflict concerning whether the imposition of such sentence is required to be consecutive. The amendment follows holdings of the Second, Third, and Tenth Circuits stating that imposition of sentence for the instant offense is not required to be consecutive to the sentence imposed upon revocation of probation, parole, or supervised release. <em>See</em> <em>United States v. Maria</em>, 186 F.3d 65, 70-73 (2d Cir. 1999); <em>United States v. Swan</em>, 275 F.3d 272, 279-83 (3d Cir. 2002); <em>United States v. Tisdale</em>, 248 F.3d 964, 977-79 (10th Cir. 2001).</p>
<p>Third, this amendment provides a new downward departure provision in §5K2.23 (Discharged Terms of Imprisonment) regarding the effect of discharged terms of imprisonment. This provision replaces the departure provision previously set forth in Application Note 7 of §5G1.3. By placing the departure provision in Chapter Five, Part K, this amendment brings structural clarity to §5G1.3 because the guideline applies to undischarged, rather than discharged, terms of imprisonment. For ease of application, the new commentary in §5G1.3 provides a reference to §5K2.23.</p>
<p>Finally, this amendment addresses a circuit conflict regarding whether the sentencing court may grant &quot;credit&quot; or adjust the instant sentence for time served on a prior undischarged term covered under subsection (c). <em>Compare</em> <em>Ruggiano v. Reish</em>, 307 F.3d 121 (3d Cir. 2002) (federal sentencing court may grant such credit), <em>with</em> <em>United States v. Fermin</em>, 252 F.3d 102 (2d Cir. 2001) (court may not grant such credit). The amendment makes clear that the court may not adjust or give &quot;credit&quot; for time served on an undischarged term of imprisonment covered under subsection (c). However, the amendment adds commentary to §5G1.3 to provide that courts may consider a downward departure in an extraordinary case, in order to achieve a reasonable punishment for the instant offense.</p>

{id: 661, content:"<p><strong>661.</strong> <strong>Amendment:</strong> Section 1B1.1 is amended by inserting before subsection (a) the following new paragraph:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Except as specifically directed, the provisions of this manual are to be applied in the following order:&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §1B1.1 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended by striking Note 4 as follows:</p>
<p>&quot;4. The offense level adjustments from more than one specific offense characteristic within an offense guideline are cumulative (added together) unless the guideline specifies that only the greater (or greatest) is to be used. Within each specific offense characteristic subsection, however, the offense level adjustments are alternative; only the one that best describes the conduct is to be used. <em>E.g.</em>, in §2A2.2(b)(3), pertaining to degree of bodily injury, the subdivision that best describes the level of bodily injury is used; the adjustments for different degrees of bodily injury (subdivisions (A)-(E)) are not added together.</p>
<p>Absent an instruction to the contrary, the adjustments from different guideline sections are applied cumulatively (added together).&quot;,</p>
<p>and inserting the following:</p>
<p>&quot;4. (A) <em>Cumulative Application of Multiple Adjustments within One Guideline</em>.—The offense level adjustments from more than one specific offense characteristic within an offense guideline are applied cumulatively (added together) unless the guideline specifies that only the greater (or greatest) is to be used. Within each specific offense characteristic subsection, however, the offense level adjustments are alternative; only the one that best describes the conduct is to be used. For example, in §2A2.2(b)(3), pertaining to degree of bodily injury, the subdivision that best describes the level of bodily injury is used; the adjustments for different degrees of bodily injury (subdivisions (A)-(E)) are not added together.</p>
<p>(B) <em>Cumulative Application of Multiple Adjustments from Multiple Guidelines</em>.—Absent an instruction to the contrary, enhancements under Chapter Two, adjustments under Chapter Three, and determinations under Chapter Four are to be applied cumulatively. In some cases, such enhancements, adjustments, and determinations may be triggered by the same conduct. For example, shooting a police officer during the commission of a robbery may warrant an injury enhancement under §2B3.1(b)(3) and an official victim adjustment under §3A1.2, even though the enhancement and the adjustment both are triggered by the shooting of the officer.&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §1B1.1 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended by adding at the end the following:</p>
<p>&quot;(7) <em>Use of Abbreviated Guideline Titles</em>.—Whenever a guideline makes reference to another guideline, a parenthetical restatement of that other guideline’s heading accompanies the initial reference to that other guideline. This parenthetical is provided only for the convenience of the reader and is not intended to have substantive effect. In the case of lengthy guideline headings, such a parenthetical restatement of the guideline heading may be abbreviated for ease of reference. For example, references to §2B1.1 (Larceny, Embezzlement, and Other Forms of Theft; Offenses Involving Stolen Property; Property Damage or Destruction; Fraud and Deceit; Forgery; Offenses Involving Altered or Counterfeit Instruments Other than Counterfeit Bearer Obligations of the United States) may be abbreviated as follows: §2B1.1 (Theft, Property Destruction, and Fraud).&quot;.</p>
<p>The Commentary to §2A3.1 captioned &quot;Application Notes&quot; is amended in Note 1 in the paragraph beginning &quot;‘Prohibited sexual conduct’&quot; by striking the following:</p>
<p>&quot;‘Prohibited sexual conduct’ (A) means any sexual activity for which a person can be charged with a criminal offense; (B) includes the production of child pornography; and (C) does not include trafficking in, or possession of, child pornography.&quot;,</p>
<p>and inserting:</p>
<p>&quot;‘Prohibited sexual conduct’ means any sexual activity for which a person can be charged with a criminal offense. ‘Prohibited sexual conduct’ includes the production of child pornography, but does not include trafficking in, or possession of, child pornography.&quot;.</p>

It&quot;.</p>
<p>Appendix A (Statutory Index) is amended by inserting after the line referenced to 7 U.S.C. § 7734 the following new line:</p>
<p>&quot;7 U.S.C. § 8313 2N2.1&quot;;</p>
<p>by inserting after the line referenced to 15 U.S.C. § 1 the following new line:</p>

<p>Second, this amendment adds red phosphorus to the Chemical Quantity Table in §2D1.11 (Unlawfully Distributing, Importing, Exporting or Possessing a Listed Chemical) in response to a recent classification of red phosphorus as a List I chemical.</p>
<p>Third, this amendment conforms the departure provision in Application Note 6 of §2G2.1 (Sexually Exploiting a Minor by Production of Sexually Explicit Visual or Printed Material; Custodian Permitting Minor to Engage in Sexually Explicit Conduct; Advertisement for Minors to Engage in Production) to Application Note 12 of §2G1.1 (Promoting A Commercial Sex Act or Prohibited Sexual Conduct).</p>

<p>Fifth, this amendment restructures the definitions of &quot;prohibited sexual conduct&quot; in §§2A3.1 (Criminal Sexual Abuse; Attempt to Commit Criminal Sexual Abuse) and 4B1.5 (Repeat and Dangerous Sex Offender Against Minors) to eliminate possible ambiguity regarding the interaction of &quot;means&quot; and &quot;includes&quot;.</p>
<p>Finally, this amendment responds to new legislation and makes other technical amendments as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Amends Appendix A (Statutory Index) and §2N2.1 (Violations of Statutes and Regulations Dealing with any Food, Drug, Biological Product, Device, Cosmetic, or Agricultural Product) in response to new offenses created by the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002 (the &quot;Act&quot;), Pub. L. 107–171. The first new offense provides a statutory maximum of one year of imprisonment for violating the Animal Health Protection Act (Subtitle E of the Act), or for counterfeiting or destroying certain documents specified in the Animal Health Protection Act. The second new offense provides a statutory maximum term of imprisonment of five years for importing, entering, exporting, or moving any animal or article for distribution or sale. The Act also provides a statutory maximum of ten years’ imprisonment for a subsequent violation of either offense.</p>
<p>(2) Amends Appendix A and §2B1.1 (Larceny, Embezzlement, and Other Forms of Theft; Offenses Involving Stolen Property; Property Damage or Destruction; Fraud and Deceit; Forgery; Offenses Involving Altered or Counterfeit Instruments Other than Counterfeit Bearer Obligations of the United States) in response to a new offense (19 U.S.C. § 2401f) created by the Trade Act of 2002, Pub. L. 107–210. The new offense provides a statutory maximum term of imprisonment of one year for knowingly making a false statement of material fact for the purpose of obtaining or increasing a payment of federal adjustment assistance to qualifying agricultural commodity producers.</p>
<p>(3) Amends Appendix A, §§2C1.3 (Conflict of Interest; Payment or Receipt of Unauthorized Compensation) and 2K2.5 (Possession of Firearm or Dangerous Weapon in Federal Facility; Possession or Discharge of Firearm in School Zone) in response to the codification of title 40, United States Code, by Pub. L. 107–217. Section 5104(e)(1) of title 40, United States Code, prohibits anyone (except as authorized by the Capitol Police Board) from carrying or having readily accessible a firearm, dangerous weapon, explosive, or incendiary device on the Capitol Grounds or in any of the Capitol Buildings. The statutory maximum term of imprisonment is five years. The amendment references 40 U.S.C. § 5104(e)(1) to §2K2.5. Section 14309(a) of title 40, United States Code, prohibits certain conflicts of interests of members of the Appalachian Regional Commission and provides a statutory maximum term of imprisonment of two years. Section 14309(b) prohibits certain additional sources of salary and provides a statutory maximum term of imprisonment of one year. The amendment references 40 U.S.C. § 14309(a) and (b) to §2C1.3.</p>
<p>(4) Amends Appendix A and §2H2.1 (Obstructing an Election or Registration) to provide a guideline reference for offenses under 18 U.S.C. § 1015(f). Prior to this amendment, 18 U.S.C. § 1015 was referenced to §§2B1.1, 2J1.3 (Perjury or Subornation of Perjury; Bribery of Witness), 2L2.1 (Trafficking in a Document Relating to Naturalization, Citizenship, or Legal Resident Status, or a United States Passport; False Statement in Respect to the Citizenship or Immigration Status of Another; Fraudulent Marriage to Assist Alien to Evade Immigration Law), and 2L2.2 (Fraudulently Acquiring Documents Relating to Naturalization, Citizenship, or Legal Resident Status for Own Use; False Personation or Fraudulent Marriage by Alien to Evade Immigration Law; Fraudulently Acquiring or Improperly Using a United States Passport). However, 18 U.S.C. § 1015(f) specifically relates to knowingly making false statements in order to register to vote, or to vote, in a Federal, State, or local election. Accordingly, the amendment references 18 U.S.C. § 1015(f) to §2H2.1 (Obstructing an Election or Registration).</p>
<p>(5) Amends Appendix A and §2R1.1 (Bid-Rigging, Price-Fixing or Market-Allocation Agreements Among Competitors) in response to a new offense (15 U.S.C. § 3) created by section 14102 (the Antitrust Technical Corrections Act of 2002) of the 21<sup>st</sup> Century Department of Justice Appropriations Authorization Act, Pub. L. 107–273. The new offense provides a statutory maximum term of imprisonment of three years, and a maximum fine of $10,000,000 for a corporation, or $350,000 for an individual, for monopolizing, or attempting or conspiring to monopolize, any part of the trade or commerce in or between any states, or territories of the United States, or between any such states, or territories of the United States and any foreign nations.</p>
