      <h2>APPLYING THE GUIDELINES</h2>
      <a href="/guidelines/§1B1.1">Section 1B1.1</a> (Application Instructions)
      sets forth the instructions for determining the applicable guideline range
      and type of sentence to impose, in accordance with the Guidelines Manual.
      The following is a summary of the steps for applying the guidelines and is
      provided only for the convenience of the reader.
      <p>
        1 ► Refer to the <a href="/si">Statutory Index (Appendix A)</a> to
        determine the offense guideline section from Chapter Two (Offense
        Conduct) applicable to the offense of conviction. See{' '}
        <a href="/guidelines/§1B1.2">§1B1.2 (Applicable Guidelines)</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        2 ► In accordance with{' '}
        <a href="/guidelines/§1B1.3">§1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct)</a>, determine
        the base offense level and apply any appropriate specific offense
        characteristics, cross references, and special instructions contained in
        the particular guideline in Chapter Two, in the order listed.
      </p>
      <p>
        3 ► Apply as appropriate the adjustments related to victim, role in the
        offense, obstruction of justice, as well as additional statutory
        sentencing enhancements, as provided in{' '}
        <a href="/chapters/3/parts/A/guidelines">Part A</a>,{' '}
        <a href="/chapters/3/parts/B/guidelines">Part B</a>, and{' '}
        <a href="/chapters/3/parts/C/guidelines">Part C of Chapter Three</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        4 ► If there are multiple counts of conviction, repeat steps (1) through
        (3) for each count. Apply{' '}
        <a href="/chapters/3/parts/D/guidelines">Part D of Chapter Three</a> to
        group the various counts and adjust the offense level as appropriate.
      </p>
      <p>
        5 ► Apply any appropriate adjustment, for the defendant’s acceptance of
        responsibility, pursuant to{' '}
        <a href="/chapters/3/parts/E/guidelines">Part E of Chapter Three</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        6 ► Determine the defendant’s criminal history category as specified in{' '}
        <a href="/chapters/4/parts/A/guidelines">Part A of Chapter Four</a>.
        Determine any other applicable adjustments using{' '}
        <a href="/chapters/4/parts/B/guidelines">Part B of Chapter Four</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        7 ► Determine the applicable guideline range in{' '}
        <a href="/chapters/5/parts/A/guidelines">Part A of Chapter Five</a> by
        locating the cell in the Sentencing Table that is at the intersection of
        the offense level and criminal history category determined above.
      </p>
      <p>
        8 ► For the applicable guideline range, determine from Parts B through G
        of <a href="/chapters/5/parts">Chapter Five</a> the sentencing
        requirements and options related to probation, imprisonment, supervised
        release, restitution, fines, special assessments, and forfeitures.
      </p>
      <p>
        9 ► Consider the specific offender characteristics and departures
        provisions in <a href="/chapters/5/parts/H/guidelines">Part H</a> and{' '}
        <a href="/chapters/5/parts/K/guidelines">Part K</a> of Chapter Five, and
        any other policy statements or commentary in the guidelines that might
        warrant consideration.
      </p>
      <p>
        10 ► Consider the applicable factors in{' '}
        <a href="/ab/18U.S.C.§3553"> 18 U.S.C.§ 3553(a) </a> taken as a whole
        and determine sentence to impose.
