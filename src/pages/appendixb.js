        <strong>APPENDIX B</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>SELECTED SENTENCING STATUTES</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        This appendix sets forth the principal statutory provisions governing
        sentencing, the Sentencing Commission, and the drafting of sentencing
        guidelines, <strong>as of May 1, 2016</strong>, as follows:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          <strong>Title 18.</strong> First, it sets forth relevant provisions of
          title 18, United States Code (Crimes and Criminal Procedure), as
          extracted from the following chapters of title 18:
        </p>
        <p>● Chapter 227 (Sentences);</p>
        <p>● Chapter 229 (Postsentence Administration);</p>
        <p>● Chapter 232 (Miscellaneous Sentencing Provisions); and</p>
        <p>● Chapter 235 (Appeal).</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Title 28.</strong> Second, it sets forth relevant provisions
          of title 28, United States Code (Judiciary and Judicial Procedure), as
          extracted from the following chapter of title 28:
        </p>
        <p>● Chapter 58 (United States Sentencing Commission).</p>
        <p>
          <strong>
            Public Laws Governing the Commission and the Drafting of Sentencing
            Guidelines.
          </strong>{' '}
          Third, it sets forth other relevant provisions of freestanding public
          laws governing the Commission and the drafting of sentencing
          guidelines (<em>e.g.</em>, congressional directives). These provisions
          ordinarily appear in the United States Code in the notes following 28
          U.S.C. § 994. This appendix sets them forth separately and in fuller
          detail for ease of reference.
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        The legal authority for the Commission and the related authority and
        procedures for sentencing in federal courts have their legislative
        foundation in the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 (Chapter II of the
        Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984, Pub. L. 98–473, October 12,
        1984).
      </p>
      <p>
        These statutory provisions are presented in this appendix solely for the
        purpose of providing a reference to federal sentencing law as it stands
        as of <strong>May 1, 2016</strong>. For the sake of brevity, certain
        miscellaneous provisions are omitted. The Commission makes no
        representations concerning the accuracy of these provisions and
        recommends that authoritative sources be consulted where legal reliance
        is necessary.

        investigation of a defendant that is required pursuant to the provisions
        of Rule 32(c) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, and shall,
        before the imposition of sentence, report the results of the

        specified in subsection (a) or (c), desires more information than is
        otherwise available to it as a basis for determining the sentence to be
        imposed on a defendant found guilty of a misdemeanor or felony, it may
        order a study of the defendant. The study shall be conducted in the
        local community by qualified consultants unless the sentencing judge
        finds that there is a compelling reason for the study to be done by the
        Bureau of Prisons or there are no adequate professional resources
        available in the local community to perform the study. The period of the
        study shall be no more than sixty days. The order shall specify the
        additional information that the court needs before determining the
        sentence to be imposed. Such an order shall be treated for
        administrative purposes as a provisional sentence of imprisonment for
        the maximum term authorized by section 3581(b) for the offense
        committed. The study shall inquire into such matters as are specified by
        the court and any other matters that the Bureau of Prisons or the
        professional consultants believe are pertinent to the factors set forth
        in section 3553(a). The period of the study may, in the discretion of
        the court, be extended for an additional period of not more than sixty
        days. By the expiration of the period of the study, or by the expiration
        of any extension granted by the court, the United States marshal shall,
        if the defendant is in custody, return the defendant to the court for
        final sentencing. The Bureau of Prisons or the professional consultants
        shall provide the court with a written report of the pertinent results
        of the study and make to the court whatever recommendations the Bureau
        or the consultants believe will be helpful to a proper resolution of the
        case. The report shall include recommendations of the Bureau or the
        consultants concerning the guidelines and policy statements, promulgated
        by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 994(a), that they
        believe are applicable to the defendant’s case. After receiving the
        report and the recommendations, the court shall proceed finally to
        sentence the defendant in accordance with the sentencing alternatives
        and procedures available under this chapter.

        otherwise available to it as a basis for determining the mental
        condition of the defendant, the court may order the same psychiatric or

        defendant, the counsel for the defendant, and the attorney for the
        Government at least ten days prior to the date set for sentencing,
        unless this minimum period is waived by the defendant. The court shall

        court finds that there exists an aggravating or mitigating circumstance
        of a kind, or to a degree, not adequately taken into consideration by
        the Sentencing Commission in formulating the guidelines that should
        result in a sentence different from that described. In determining
        whether a circumstance was adequately taken into consideration, the
        court shall consider only the sentencing guidelines, policy statements,
        and official commentary of the Sentencing Commission. In the absence of
        an applicable sentencing guideline, the court shall impose an
        appropriate sentence, having due regard for the purposes set forth in
        subsection (a)(2). In the absence of an applicable sentencing guideline
        in the case of an offense other than a petty offense, the court shall
        also have due regard for the relationship of the sentence imposed to
        sentences prescribed by guidelines applicable to similar offenses and

          offense and that this assistance established a mitigating circumstance
          of a kind, or to a degree, not adequately taken into consideration by

        </strong>—Upon motion of the Government, the court shall have the
        authority to impose a sentence below a level established by statute as a
        minimum sentence so as to reflect a defendant’s substantial assistance
        in the investigation or prosecution of another person who has committed
        an offense. Such sentence shall be imposed in accordance with the
        guidelines and policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission
        pursuant to section 994 of title 28, United States Code.

        (21 U.S.C. 841, 844, 846) or section 1010 or 1013 of the Controlled
        Substances Import and Export Act (21 U.S.C. 960, 963), the court shall
        impose a sentence pursuant to guidelines promulgated by the United
        States Sentencing Commission under section 994 of title 28 without
        regard to any statutory minimum sentence, if the court finds at
        sentencing, after the Government has been afforded the opportunity to
        make a recommendation, that—
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          <strong>(1)</strong> the defendant does not have more than 1 criminal
          history point, as determined under the sentencing guidelines;
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(2)</strong> the defendant did not use violence or credible
          threats of violence or possess a firearm or other dangerous weapon (or
          induce another participant to do so) in connection with the offense;
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(3)</strong> the offense did not result in death or serious
          bodily injury to any person;

        <p>
          <strong>(4)</strong> the defendant was not an organizer, leader,
          manager, or supervisor of others in the offense, as determined under
          the sentencing guidelines and was not engaged in a continuing criminal
          enterprise, as defined in section 408 of the Controlled Substances
          Act; and
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(5)</strong> not later than the time of the sentencing
          hearing, the defendant has truthfully provided to the Government all
          information and evidence the defendant has concerning the offense or
          offenses that were part of the same course of conduct or of a common
          scheme or plan, but the fact that the defendant has no relevant or
          useful other information to provide or that the Government is already
          aware of the information shall not preclude a determination by the
          court that the defendant has complied with this requirement.

        defendant on probation, payment of the fine or adherence to the
        court‑established installment schedule shall be a condition of the
        probation.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>(b) Discretionary conditions.</strong>—The court may provide, as
        further conditions of a sentence of probation, to the extent that such
        conditions are reasonably related to the factors set forth in section
        3553(a)(1) and (a)(2) and to the extent that such conditions involve
        only such deprivations of liberty or property as are reasonably
        necessary for the purposes indicated in section 3553(a)(2), that the

          enforcement or probation officer with reasonable suspicion concerning

          person, and by any probation officer in the lawful discharge of the
          officer’s supervision functions.
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        <strong>(c) Modifications of conditions.</strong>—The court may modify,
        reduce, or enlarge the conditions of a sentence of probation at any time
        prior to the expiration or termination of the term of probation,
        pursuant to the provisions of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure
        relating to the modification of probation and the provisions applicable
        to the initial setting of the conditions of probation.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>(d) Written statement of conditions.</strong>—The court shall
        direct that the probation officer provide the defendant with a written
        statement that sets forth all the conditions to which the sentence is
        subject, and that is sufficiently clear and specific to serve as a guide
        for the defendant’s conduct and for such supervision as is required.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>(e) Results of Drug Testing.—</strong>The results of a drug test
        administered in accordance with subsection (a)(5) shall be subject to
        confirmation only if the results are positive, the defendant is subject
        to possible imprisonment for such failure, and either the defendant
        denies the accuracy of such test or there is some other reason to
        question the results of the test. A defendant who tests positive may be
        detained pending verification of a positive drug test result. A drug
        test confirmation shall be a urine drug test confirmed using gas
        chromatography/mass spectrometry techniques or such test as the Director
        of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts after
        consultation with the Secretary of Health and Human Services may
        determine to be of equivalent accuracy. The court shall consider whether
        the availability of appropriate substance abuse treatment programs, or
        an individual’s current or past participation in such programs, warrants
        an exception in accordance with United States Sentencing Commission
        guidelines from the rule of section 3565(b), when considering any action
        against a defendant who fails a drug test administered in accordance
        with subsection (a)(5).

        <strong>§ 3564. Running of a term of probation</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>(a) Commencement.</strong>—A term of probation commences on the
        day that the sentence of probation is imposed, unless otherwise ordered
        by the court.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>(b) Concurrence with other sentences.</strong>—Multiple terms of
        probation, whether imposed at the same time or at different times, run
        concurrently with each other. A term of probation runs concurrently with
        any Federal, State, or local term of probation, supervised release, or
        parole for another offense to which the defendant is subject or becomes
        subject during the term of probation. A term of probation does not run
        while the defendant is imprisoned in connection with a conviction for a
        Federal, State, or local crime unless the imprisonment is for a period
        of less than thirty consecutive days.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>(c) Early termination.</strong>—The court, after considering the
        factors set forth in section 3553(a) to the extent that they are
        applicable, may, pursuant to the provisions of the Federal Rules of
        Criminal Procedure relating to the modification of probation, terminate
        a term of probation previously ordered and discharge the defendant at
        any time in the case of a misdemeanor or an infraction or at any time
        after the expiration of one year of probation in the case of a felony,
        if it is satisfied that such action is warranted by the conduct of the
        defendant and the interest of justice.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>(d) Extension.</strong>—The court may, after a hearing, extend a
        term of probation, if less than the maximum authorized term was
        previously imposed, at any time prior to the expiration or termination
        of the term of probation, pursuant to the provisions applicable to the
        initial setting of the term of probation.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>(e) Subject to revocation.</strong>—A sentence of probation
        remains conditional and subject to revocation until its expiration or
        termination.
      </p>

      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>§ 3565. Revocation of probation</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>(a) Continuation or revocation.</strong>—If the defendant
        violates a condition of probation at any time prior to the expiration or
        termination of the term of probation, the court may, after a hearing
        pursuant to Rule 32.1 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, and
        after considering the factors set forth in section 3553(a) to the extent
        that they are applicable—
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          <strong>(1)</strong> continue him on probation, with or without
          extending the term or modifying or enlarging the conditions; or
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(2)</strong> revoke the sentence of probation and resentence
          the defendant under subchapter A.
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        <strong>
          (b) Mandatory revocation for possession of controlled substance or
          firearm or refusal to comply with drug testing.
        </strong>—If the defendant—
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          <strong>(1)</strong> possesses a controlled substance in violation of
          the condition set forth in section 3563(a)(3);
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(2)</strong> possesses a firearm, as such term is defined in
          section 921 of this title, in violation of Federal law, or otherwise
          violates a condition of probation prohibiting the defendant from
          possessing a firearm;
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(3)</strong> refuses to comply with drug testing, thereby
          violating the condition imposed by section 3563(a)(4); or
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(4)</strong> as a part of drug testing, tests positive for
          illegal controlled substances more than 3 times over the course of 1
          year;
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        the court shall revoke the sentence of probation and resentence the
        defendant under subchapter A to a sentence that includes a term of
        imprisonment.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>(c) Delayed revocation.</strong>—The power of the court to
        revoke a sentence of probation for violation of a condition of
        probation, and to impose another sentence, extends beyond the expiration
        of the term of probation for any period reasonably necessary for the
        adjudication of matters arising before its expiration if, prior to its
        expiration, a warrant or summons has been issued on the basis of an
        allegation of such a violation.

      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>(a) Factors to be considered.</strong>—In determining whether to
        impose a fine, and the amount, time for payment, and method of payment
        of a fine, the court shall consider, in addition to the factors set
        forth in section 3553(a)—
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          <strong>(1)</strong> the defendant’s income, earning capacity, and
          financial resources;
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(2)</strong> the burden that the fine will impose upon the
          defendant, any person who is financially dependent on the defendant,
          or any other person (including a government) that would be responsible
          for the welfare of any person financially dependent on the defendant,
          relative to the burden that alternative punishments would impose;
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(3)</strong> any pecuniary loss inflicted upon others as a
          result of the offense;
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(4)</strong> whether restitution is ordered or made and the
          amount of such restitution;
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(5)</strong> the need to deprive the defendant of illegally
          obtained gains from the offense;
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(6)</strong> the expected costs to the government of any
          imprisonment, supervised release, or probation component of the
          sentence;
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(7)</strong> whether the defendant can pass on to consumers or
          other persons the expense of the fine; and
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(8)</strong> if the defendant is an organization, the size of
          the organization and any measure taken by the organization to
          discipline any officer, director, employee, or agent of the
          organization responsible for the offense and to prevent a recurrence
          of such an offense.
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        <strong>(b) Fine not to impair ability to make restitution.</strong>—If,
        as a result of a conviction, the defendant has the obligation to make
        restitution to a victim of the offense, other than the United States,
        the court shall impose a fine or other monetary penalty only to the
        extent that such fine or penalty will not impair the ability of the
        defendant to make restitution.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>(c) Effect of finality of judgment.</strong>—Notwithstanding the
        fact that a sentence to pay a fine can subsequently be—
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          <strong>(1)</strong> modified or remitted under section 3573;
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(2)</strong> corrected under rule 35 of the Federal Rules of
          Criminal Procedure and section 3742; or
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(3)</strong> appealed and modified under section 3742;
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        a judgment that includes such a sentence is a final judgment for all
        other purposes.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>(d) Time, method of payment, and related items.</strong>—<strong>(1)</strong>{' '}
        A person sentenced to pay a fine or other monetary penalty, including
        restitution, shall make such payment immediately, unless, in the
        interest of justice, the court provides for payment on a date certain or
        in installments. If the court provides for payment in installments, the
        installments shall be in equal monthly payments over the period provided
        by the court, unless the court establishes another schedule.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>(2)</strong> If the judgment, or, in the case of a restitution
        order, the order, permits other than immediate payment, the length of
        time over which scheduled payments will be made shall be set by the
        court, but shall be the shortest time in which full payment can
        reasonably be made.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>(3)</strong> A judgment for a fine which permits payments in
        installments shall include a requirement that the defendant will notify
        the court of any material change in the defendant’s economic
        circumstances that might affect the defendant’s ability to pay the fine.
        Upon receipt of such notice the court may, on its own motion or the
        motion of any party, adjust the payment schedule, or require immediate
        payment in full, as the interests of justice require.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>(e) Alternative sentence precluded.</strong>—At the time a
        defendant is sentenced to pay a fine, the court may not impose an
        alternative sentence to be carried out if the fine is not paid.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>
          (f) Responsibility for payment of monetary obligation relating to
          organization.
        </strong>—If a sentence includes a fine, special assessment, restitution
        or other monetary obligation (including interest) with respect to an
        organization, each individual authorized to make disbursements for the
        organization has a duty to pay the obligation from assets of the
        organization. If such an obligation is imposed on a director, officer,
        shareholder, employee, or agent of an organization, payments may not be
        made, directly or indirectly, from assets of the organization, unless
        the court finds that such payment is expressly permissible under
        applicable State law.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>(g) Security for stayed fine.</strong>—If a sentence imposing a
        fine is stayed, the court shall, absent exceptional circumstances (as
        determined by the court)—
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          <strong>(1)</strong> require the defendant to deposit, in the registry
          of the district court, any amount of the fine that is due;
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(2)</strong> require the defendant to provide a bond or other
          security to ensure payment of the fine; or
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(3)</strong> restrain the defendant from transferring or
          dissipating assets.
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        <strong>(h) Delinquency.</strong>—A fine or payment of restitution is
        delinquent if a payment is more than 30 days late.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>(i) Default.</strong>—A fine or payment of restitution is in
        default if a payment is delinquent for more than 90 days.
        Notwithstanding any installment schedule, when a fine or payment of
        restitution is in default, the entire amount of the fine or restitution
        is due within 30 days after notification of the default, subject to the
        provisions of section 3613A.

        <strong>
          (a) Factors to be considered in imposing a term of imprisonment.
        </strong>—The court, in determining whether to impose a term of
        imprisonment, and, if a term of imprisonment is to be imposed, in
        determining the length of the term, shall consider the factors set forth
        in section 3553(a) to the extent that they are applicable, recognizing
        that imprisonment is not an appropriate means of promoting correction
        and rehabilitation. In determining whether to make a recommendation
        concerning the type of prison facility appropriate for the defendant,
        the court shall consider any pertinent policy statements issued by the
        Sentencing Commission pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 994(a)(2).
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>(b) Effect of finality of judgment.</strong>—Notwithstanding the

        <p>
          <strong>(3)</strong> appealed and modified, if outside the guideline
          range, pursuant to the provisions of section 3742;
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        a judgment of conviction that includes such a sentence constitutes a
        final judgment for all other purposes.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>
          (c) Modification of an imposed term of imprisonment.
        </strong>—The court may not modify a term of imprisonment once it has

          that does not exceed the unserved portion of the original term of
          imprisonment), after considering the factors set forth in section

          <strong>(ii)</strong> the defendant is at least 70 years of age, has
          served at least 30 year in prison, pursuant to a sentence imposed
          under section 3559(c), for the offense or offenses for which the
          defendant is currently imprisoned, and a determination has been made
          by the Director of the Bureau of Prisons that the defendant is not a
          danger to the safety of any other person or the community, as provided
          under section 3142(g);

          28 U.S.C. 994(o), upon motion of the defendant or the Director of the
          Bureau of Prisons, or on its own motion, the court may reduce the term
          of imprisonment, after considering the factors set forth in section
          3553(a) to the extent that they are applicable, if such a reduction is
          consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing

        association or communication with such person is for the purpose of

        be placed on a term of supervised release if such a term is required by
        statute or if the defendant has been convicted for the first time of a
        domestic violence crime as defined in section 3561(b).
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>(b) Authorized terms of supervised release.</strong>—Except as
        otherwise provided, the authorized terms of supervised release are—
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          <strong>(1)</strong> for a Class A or Class B felony, not more than
          five years;
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(2)</strong> for a Class C or Class D felony, not more than
          three years; and
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(3)</strong> for a Class E felony, or for a misdemeanor (other
          than a petty offense), not more than one year.
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        <strong>
          (c) Factors to be considered in including a term of supervised
          release.
        </strong>—The court, in determining whether to include a term of
        supervised release, and, if a term of supervised release is to be
        included, in determining the length of the term and the conditions of
        supervised release, shall consider the factors set forth in section
        3553(a)(1), (a)(2)(B), (a)(2)(C), (a)(2)(D), (a)(4), (a)(5), (a)(6), and
        (a)(7).
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>(d) Conditions of supervised release.</strong>—The court shall
        order, as an explicit condition of supervised release, that the
        defendant not commit another Federal, State, or local crime during the
        term of supervision and that the defendant not unlawfully possess a
        controlled substance. The court shall order as an explicit condition of
        supervised release for a defendant convicted for the first time of a
        domestic violence crime as defined in section 3561(b) that the defendant
        attend a public, private, or private nonprofit offender rehabilitation
        program that has been approved by the court, in consultation with a
        State Coalition Against Domestic Violence or other appropriate experts,
        if an approved program is readily available within a 50-mile radius of
        the legal residence of the defendant. The court shall order, as an
        explicit condition of supervised release for a person required to
        register under the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act, that
        the person comply with the requirements of that Act. The court shall
        order, as an explicit condition of supervised release, that the
        defendant cooperate in the collection of a DNA sample from the
        defendant, if the collection of such a sample is authorized pursuant to
        section 3 of the DNA Analysis Backlog Elimination Act of 2000. The court
        shall also order, as an explicit condition of supervised release, that
        the defendant refrain from any unlawful use of a controlled substance
        and submit to a drug test within 15 days of release on supervised
        release and at least 2 periodic drug tests thereafter (as determined by
        the court) for use of a controlled substance. The condition stated in
        the preceding sentence may be ameliorated or suspended by the court as
        provided in section 3563(a)(4). The results of a drug test administered
        in accordance with the preceding subsection shall be subject to
        confirmation only if the results are positive, the defendant is subject
        to possible imprisonment for such failure, and either the defendant
        denies the accuracy of such test or there is some other reason to
        question the results of the test. A drug test confirmation shall be a
        urine drug test confirmed using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry
        techniques or such test as the Director of the Administrative Office of
        the United States Courts after consultation with the Secretary of Health
        and Human Services may determine to be of equivalent accuracy. The court
        shall consider whether the availability of appropriate substance abuse
        treatment programs, or an individual’s current or past participation in
        such programs, warrants an exception in accordance with United States
        Sentencing Commission guidelines from the rule of section 3583(g) when
        considering any action against a defendant who fails a drug test. The
        court may order, as a further condition of supervised release, to the
        extent that such condition—
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          <strong>(1)</strong> is reasonably related to the factors set forth in
          section 3553(a)(1), (a)(2)(B), (a)(2)(C), and (a)(2)(D);
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(2)</strong> involves no greater deprivation of liberty than
          is reasonably necessary for the purposes set forth in section
          3553(a)(2)(B), (a)(2)(C), and (a)(2)(D); and
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(3)</strong> is consistent with any pertinent policy
          statements issued by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to 28 U.S.C.
          994(a);
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        any condition set forth as a discretionary condition of probation in
        section 3563(b) and any other condition it considers to be appropriate,
        provided, however that a condition set forth in subsection 3563(b)(10)
        shall be imposed only for a violation of a condition of supervised
        release in accordance with section 3583(e)(2) and only when facilities
        are available. If an alien defendant is subject to deportation, the
        court may provide, as a condition of supervised release, that he be
        deported and remain outside the United States, and may order that he be
        delivered to a duly authorized immigration official for such
        deportation. The court may order, as an explicit condition of supervised
        release for a person who is a felon and required to register under the
        Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act, that the person submit
        his person, and any property, house, residence, vehicle, papers,
        computer, other electronic communications or data storage devices or
        media, and effects to search at any time, with or without a warrant, by
        any law enforcement or probation officer with reasonable suspicion
        concerning a violation of a condition of supervised release or unlawful
        conduct by the person, and by any probation officer in the lawful
        discharge of the officer’s supervision functions.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>(e) Modification of conditions or revocation.</strong>—The court
        may, after considering the factors set forth in section 3553(a)(1),
        (a)(2)(B), (a)(2)(C), (a)(2)(D), (a)(4), (a)(5), (a)(6), and (a)(7)—

          release, pursuant to the provisions of the Federal Rules of Criminal
          Procedure relating to the modification of probation and the provisions
          applicable to the initial setting of the terms and conditions of
          post‑release supervision;
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(3)</strong> revoke a term of supervised release, and require
          the defendant to serve in prison all or part of the term of supervised
          release authorized by statute for the offense that resulted in such
          term of supervised release without credit for time previously served
          on postrelease supervision, if the court, pursuant to the Federal
          Rules of Criminal Procedure applicable to revocation of probation or
          supervised release, finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the
          defendant violated a condition of supervised release, except that a
          defendant whose term is revoked under this paragraph may not be
          required to serve on any such revocation more than 5 years in prison
          if the offense that resulted in the term of supervised release is a
          class A felony, more than 3 years in prison if such offense is a class
          B felony, more than 2 years in prison if such offense is a class C or
          D felony, or more than one year in any other case; or
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(4)</strong> order the defendant to remain at his place of
          residence during nonworking hours and, if the court so directs, to
          have compliance monitored by telephone or electronic signaling
          devices, except that an order under this paragraph may be imposed only
          as an alternative to incarceration.
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        <strong>(f) Written statement of conditions.</strong>—The court shall
        direct that the probation officer provide the defendant with a written
        statement that sets forth all the conditions to which the term of
        supervised release is subject, and that is sufficiently clear and
        specific to serve as a guide for the defendant’s conduct and for such
        supervision as is required.

        <strong>
          (g) Mandatory revocation for possession of controlled substance or
          firearm or for refusal to comply with drug testing.
        </strong>—If the defendant—
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          <strong>(1)</strong> possesses a controlled substance in violation of
          the condition set forth in subsection (d);
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(2)</strong> possesses a firearm, as such term is defined in
          section 921 of this title, in violation of Federal law, or otherwise
          violates a condition of supervised release prohibiting the defendant
          from possessing a firearm;

          year;

        the court shall revoke the term of supervised release and require the

        of imprisonment authorized under subsection (e)(3).
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>(h) Supervised release following revocation.</strong>—When a
        term of supervise release is revoked and the defendant is required to
        serve a term of imprisonment, the court may include a requirement that
        the defendant be placed on a term of supervised release after
        imprisonment. The length of such a term of supervised release shall not
        exceed the term of supervised release authorized by statute for the
        offense that resulted in the original term of supervised release, less
        any term of imprisonment that was imposed upon revocation of supervised
        release.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>(i) Delayed revocation.</strong>—The power of the court to
        revoke a term of supervised release for violation for a condition of
        supervised release, and to order the defendant to serve a term of
        imprisonment and, subject to the limitations in subsection (h), a
        further term of supervised release, extends beyond the expiration of the
        term of supervised release for any period reasonably necessary for the
        adjudication of matters arising before its expiration if, before its
        expiration, a warrant or summons has been issued on the basis of an
        allegation of such a violation.

        any term of years or life.

        or 117, or section 1201 or 1591, for which imprisonment for a term
        longer than 1 year can be imposed, the court shall revoke the term of
        supervised release and require the defendant to serve a term of
        imprisonment under subsection (e)(3) without regard to the exception

        <strong>(a) Imposition of concurrent or consecutive terms.</strong>—If
        multiple terms of imprisonment are imposed on a defendant at the same
        time, or if a term of imprisonment is imposed on a defendant who is
        already subject to an undischarged term of imprisonment, the terms may
        run concurrently or consecutively, except that the terms may not run
        consecutively for an attempt and for another offense that was the sole
        objective of the attempt. Multiple terms of imprisonment imposed at the
        same time run concurrently unless the court orders or the statute
        mandates that the terms are to run consecutively. Multiple terms of
        imprisonment imposed at different times run consecutively unless the
        court orders that the terms are to run concurrently.

        <strong>
          (b) Factors to be considered in imposing concurrent or consecutive
          terms.
        </strong>—The court, in determining whether the terms imposed are to be
        ordered to run concurrently or consecutively, shall consider, as to each
        offense for which a term of imprisonment is being imposed, the factors
        set forth in section 3553(a).

        <strong>
          (c) Treatment of multiple sentence as an aggregate.

        <strong>(a) Commencement of sentence.</strong>—A sentence to a term of
        imprisonment commences on the date the defendant is received in custody
        awaiting transportation to, or arrives voluntarily to commence service
        of sentence at, the official detention facility at which the sentence is
        to be served.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>(b) Credit for prior custody.</strong>—A defendant shall be
        given credit toward the service of a term of imprisonment for any time
        he has spent in official detention prior to the date the sentence
        commences—
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          <strong>(1)</strong> as a result of the offense for which the sentence
          was imposed; or
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(2)</strong> as a result of any other charge for which the
          defendant was arrested after the commission of the offense for which
          the sentence was imposed;

        <strong>§ 3621. Imprisonment of a convicted person</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>(a) Commitment to custody of Bureau of Prisons.</strong>—A
        person who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment pursuant to the
        provisions of subchapter D of chapter 227 shall be committed to the
        custody of the Bureau of Prisons until the expiration of the term
        imposed, or until earlier released for satisfactory behavior pursuant to
        the provisions of section 3624.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>(b) Place of imprisonment.</strong>—The Bureau of Prisons shall
        designate the place of the prisoner’s imprisonment. The Bureau may
        designate any available penal or correctional facility that meets
        minimum standards of health and habitability established by the Bureau,
        whether maintained by the Federal Government or otherwise and whether
        within or without the judicial district in which the person was
        convicted, that the Bureau determines to be appropriate and suitable,
        considering—
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          <strong>(1)</strong> the resources of the facility contemplated;
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(2)</strong> the nature and circumstances of the offense;
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(3)</strong> the history and characteristics of the prisoner;
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(4)</strong> any statement by the court that imposed the
          sentence—
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(A)</strong> concerning the purposes for which the sentence to
          imprisonment was determined to be warranted; or
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(B)</strong> recommending a type of penal or correctional
          facility as appropriate; and
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(5)</strong> any pertinent policy statement issued by the
          Sentencing Commission pursuant to section 994(a)(2) of title 28.
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        In designating the place of imprisonment or making transfers under this
        subsection, there shall be no favoritism given to prisoners of high
        social or economic status. The Bureau may at any time, having regard for
        the same matters, direct the transfer of a prisoner from one penal or
        correctional facility to another. The Bureau shall make available
        appropriate substance abuse treatment for each prisoner the Bureau
        determines has a treatable condition of substance addiction or abuse.
        Any order, recommendation, or request by a sentencing court that a
        convicted person serve a term of imprisonment in a community corrections
        facility shall have no binding effect on the authority of the Bureau
        under this section to determine or change the place of imprisonment of
        that person.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>(c) Delivery of order of commitment.</strong>—When a prisoner,
        pursuant to a court order, is placed in the custody of a person in
        charge of a penal or correctional facility, a copy of the order shall be
        delivered to such person as evidence of this authority to hold the
        prisoner, and the original order, with the return endorsed thereon,
        shall be returned to the court that issued it.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>(d) Delivery of prisoner for court appearances.</strong>—The
        United States marshal shall, without charge, bring a prisoner into court
        or return him to a prison facility on order of a court of the United
        States or on written request of an attorney for the Government.

          the Bureau shall periodically test the prisoner for substance abuse
          and discontinue such conditions on determining that substance abuse

        pertinent policy statement issued by the Sentencing Commission pursuant

        consistent with the public interest and if there is reasonable cause to
        believe that a prisoner will honor the trust to be imposed in him, by

        <strong>§ 3624. Release of a prisoner</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>(a) Date of release.</strong>—A prisoner shall be released by
        the Bureau of Prisons on the date of the expiration of the prisoner’s
        term of imprisonment, less any time credited toward the service of the
        prisoner’s sentence as provided in subsection (b). If the date for a
        prisoner’s release falls on a Saturday, a Sunday, or a legal holiday at
        the place of confinement, the prisoner may be released by the Bureau on
        the last preceding weekday.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>
          (b) Credit toward service of sentence for satisfactory behavior.
        </strong>—<strong>(1)</strong> Subject to paragraph (2), a prisoner who
        is serving a term of imprisonment of more than 1 year, other than a term
        of imprisonment for the duration of the prisoner’s life, may receive
        credit toward the service of the prisoner’s sentence, beyond the time
        served, of up to 54 days at the end of each year of the prisoner’s term
        of imprisonment, beginning at the end of the first year of the term,
        subject to determination by the Bureau of Prisons that, during that
        year, the prisoner has displayed exemplary compliance with institutional
        disciplinary regulations. Subject to paragraph (2), if the Bureau
        determines that, during that year, the prisoner has not satisfactorily
        complied with such institutional regulations, the prisoner shall receive
        no such credit toward service of the prisoner’s sentence or shall
        receive such lesser credit as the Bureau determines to be appropriate.
        In awarding credit under this section, the Bureau shall consider whether
        the prisoner, during the relevant period, has earned, or is making
        satisfactory progress toward earning, a high school diploma or an
        equivalent degree. Credit that has not been earned may not later be
        granted. Subject to paragraph (2), credit for the last year or portion
        of a year of the term of imprisonment shall be prorated and credited
        within the last six weeks of the sentence.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>(2)</strong> Notwithstanding any other law, credit awarded under
        this subsection after the date of enactment of the Prison Litigation
        Reform Act shall vest on the date the prisoner is released from custody.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>(3)</strong> The Attorney General shall ensure that the Bureau
        of Prisons has in effect an optional General Educational Development
        program for inmates who have not earned a high school diploma or its
        equivalent.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>(4)</strong> Exemptions to the General Educational Development
        requirement may be made as deemed appropriate by the Director of the
        Federal Bureau of Prisons.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>(c) Pre‑release custody.</strong>—<strong>(1) In general.—</strong>The
        Director of the Bureau of Prisons shall, to the extent practicable,
        ensure that a prisoner serving a term of imprisonment spends a portion
        of the final months of that term (not to exceed 12 months), under
        conditions that will afford that prisoner a reasonable opportunity to
        adjust to and prepare for the reentry of that prisoner into the
        community. Such conditions may include a community correctional
        facility.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>(2) Home confinement authority.—</strong>The authority under
        this subsection may be used to place a prisoner in home confinement for
        the shorter of 10 percent of the term of imprisonment of that prisoner
        or 6 months.

      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>(5) Reporting.—</strong>Not later than 1 year after the date of

      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>(6) Issuance of regulations.—</strong>The Director of the Bureau

      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          <strong>(A)</strong> conducted in a manner consistent with section
          3621(b) of this title;
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(B)</strong> determined on an individual basis; and
        </p>
        <p>

        <p>
          <strong>(1)</strong> suitable clothing;
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(2)</strong> an amount of money, not more than $500,
          determined by the Director to be consistent with the needs of the
          offender and the public interest, unless the Director determines that
          the financial position of the offender is such that no sum should be
          furnished; and
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(3)</strong> transportation to the place of the prisoner’s
          conviction, to the prisoner’s bona fide residence within the United
          States, or to such other place within the United States as may be
          authorized by the Director.
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        <strong>(e) Supervision after release.</strong>—A prisoner whose
        sentence includes a term of supervised release after imprisonment shall
        be released by the Bureau of Prisons to the supervision of a probation
        officer who shall, during the term imposed, supervise the person
        released to the degree warranted by the conditions specified by the
        sentencing court. The term of supervised release commences on the day
        the person is released from imprisonment and runs concurrently with any
        Federal, State, or local term of probation or supervised release or
        parole for another offense to which the person is subject or becomes
        subject during the term of supervised release. A term of supervised
        release does not run during any period in which the person is imprisoned
        in connection with a conviction for a Federal, State, or local crime
        unless the imprisonment is for a period of less than 30 consecutive
        days. Upon the release of a prisoner by the Bureau of Prisons to
        supervised release, the Bureau of Prisons shall notify such prisoner,
        verbally and in writing, of the requirement that the prisoner adhere to
        an installment schedule, not to exceed 2 years except in special
        circumstances, to pay for any fine imposed for the offense committed by
        such prisoner, and of the consequences of failure to pay such fines
        under sections 3611 through 3614 of this title.

        <strong>§ 3663. Order of restitution</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>(a)(1)(A)</strong> The court, when sentencing a defendant
        convicted of an offense under this title, section 401, 408(a), 409, 416,
        420, or 422(a) of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 841, 848(a),
        849, 856, 861, 863) (but in no case shall a participant in an offense
        under such sections be considered a victim of such offense under this
        section), or section 5124, 46312, 46502, or 46504 of title 49, other
        than an offense described in section 3663A(c), may order, in addition to
        or, in the case of a misdemeanor, in lieu of any other penalty
        authorized by law, that the defendant make restitution to any victim of
        such offense, or if the victim is deceased, to the victim’s estate. The
        court may also order, if agreed to by the parties in a plea agreement,
        restitution to persons other than the victim of the offense.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>(B)(i)</strong> The court, in determining whether to order
        restitution under this section, shall consider—
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>(I)</strong> the amount of the loss sustained by each victim as
        a result of the offense; and
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          <strong>(II)</strong> the financial resources of the defendant, the
          financial needs and earning ability of the defendant and the
          defendant’s dependents, and such other factors as the court deems
          appropriate.
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        <strong>(ii)</strong> To the extent that the court determines that the
        complication and prolongation of the sentencing process resulting from
        the fashioning of an order of restitution under this section outweighs
        the need to provide restitution to any victims, the court may decline to
        make such an order.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>(2)</strong> For the purposes of this section, the term “victim”
        means a person directly and proximately harmed as a result of the
        commission of an offense for which restitution may be ordered including,
        in the case of an offense that involves as an element a scheme,
        conspiracy, or pattern of criminal activity, any person directly harmed
        by the defendant’s criminal conduct in the course of the scheme,
        conspiracy, or pattern. In the case of a victim who is under 18 years of
        age, incompetent, incapacitated, or deceased, the legal guardian of the
        victim or representative of the victim’s estate, another family member,
        or any other person appointed as suitable by the court, may assume the
        victim’s rights under this section, but in no event shall the defendant
        be named as such representative or guardian.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>(3)</strong> The court may also order restitution in any
        criminal case to the extent agreed to by the parties in a plea
        agreement.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>(b)</strong> The order may require that such defendant—
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          <strong>(1)</strong> in the case of an offense resulting in damage to
          or loss or destruction of property of a victim of the offense—
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(A)</strong> return the property to the owner of the property
          or someone designated by the owner; or
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(B)</strong> if return of the property under subparagraph (A)
          is impossible, impractical, or inadequate, pay an amount equal to the
          greater of—
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(i)</strong> the value of the property on the date of the
          damage, loss, or destruction, or
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(ii)</strong> the value of the property on the date of
          sentencing,
        </p>
        <p>
          less the value (as of the date the property is returned) of any part
          of the property that is returned;

        <p>
          <strong>(2)</strong> in the case of an offense resulting in bodily
          injury to a victim including an offense under chapter 109A or chapter
          110—
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(A)</strong> pay an amount equal to the cost of necessary
          medical and related professional services and devices relating to
          physical, psychiatric, and psychological care, including nonmedical
          care and treatment rendered in accordance with a method of healing
          recognized by the law of the place of treatment;
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(B)</strong> pay an amount equal to the cost of necessary
          physical and occupational therapy and rehabilitation; and
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(C)</strong> reimburse the victim for income lost by such
          victim as a result of such offense;
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(3)</strong> in the case of an offense resulting in bodily
          injury also results in the death of a victim, pay an amount equal to
          the cost of necessary funeral and related services;
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(4)</strong> in any case, reimburse the victim for lost income
          and necessary child care, transportation, and other expenses related
          to participation in the investigation or prosecution of the offense or
          attendance at proceedings related to the offense;
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(5)</strong> in any case, if the victim (or if the victim is
          deceased, the victim’s estate) consents, make restitution in services
          in lieu of money, or make restitution to a person or organization
          designated by the victim or the estate; and
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(6)</strong> in the case of an offense under sections
          1028(a)(7) or 1028A(a) of this title, pay an amount equal to the value
          of the time reasonably spent by the victim in an attempt to remediate
          the intended or actual harm incurred by the victim from the offense.
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        <strong>(c)(1)</strong> Notwithstanding any other provision of law (but
        subject to the provisions of subsections (a)(1)(B) (i)(II) and (ii),
        when sentencing a defendant convicted of an offense described in section
        401, 408(a), 409, 416, 420, or 422(a) of the Controlled Substances Act
        (21 U.S.C. 841, 848(a), 849, 856, 861, 863), in which there is no
        identifiable victim, the court may order that the defendant make
        restitution in accordance with this subsection.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>(2)(A)</strong> An order of restitution under this subsection
        shall be based on the amount of public harm caused by the offense, as
        determined by the court in accordance with guidelines promulgated by the
        United States Sentencing Commission.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>(B)</strong> In no case shall the amount of restitution ordered
        under this subsection exceed the amount of the fine which may be ordered
        for the offense charged in the case.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>(3)</strong> Restitution under this subsection shall be
        distributed as follows:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          <strong>(A)</strong> 65 percent of the total amount of restitution
          shall be paid to the State entity designated to administer crime
          victim assistance in the State in which the crime occurred.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(B)</strong> 35 percent of the total amount of restitution
          shall be paid to the State entity designated to receive Federal
          substance abuse block grant funds.
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        <strong>(4)</strong> The court shall not make an award under this
        subsection if it appears likely that such award would interfere with a
        forfeiture under chapter 46 or chapter 96 of this title or under the
        Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 801 et seq.).
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>(5)</strong> Notwithstanding section 3612(c) or any other
        provision of law, a penalty assessment under section 3013 or a fine
        under subchapter C of chapter 227 shall take precedence over an order of
        restitution under this subsection.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>(6)</strong> Requests for community restitution under this
        subsection may be considered in all plea agreements negotiated by the
        United States.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>(7)(A)</strong> The United States Sentencing Commission shall
        promulgate guidelines to assist courts in determining the amount of
        restitution that may be ordered under this subsection.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>(B)</strong> No restitution shall be ordered under this
        subsection until such time as the Sentencing Commission promulgates
        guidelines pursuant to this paragraph.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>(d)</strong> An order of restitution made pursuant to this
        section shall be issued and enforced in accordance with section 3664.

          § 3663A. Mandatory restitution to victims of certain crimes
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>(a)(1)</strong> Notwithstanding any other provision of law, when
        sentencing a defendant convicted of an offense described in subsection
        (c), the court shall order, in addition to, or in the case of a
        misdemeanor, in addition to or in lieu of, any other penalty authorized
        by law, that the defendant make restitution to the victim of the offense
        or, if the victim is deceased, to the victim’s estate.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>(2)</strong> For the purposes of this section, the term “victim”
        means a person directly and proximately harmed as a result of the
        commission of an offense for which restitution may be ordered including,
        in the case of an offense that involves as an element a scheme,
        conspiracy, or pattern of criminal activity, any person directly harmed
        by the defendant’s criminal conduct in the course of the scheme,
        conspiracy, or pattern. In the case of a victim who is under 18 years of
        age, incompetent, incapacitated, or deceased, the legal guardian of the
        victim or representative of the victim’s estate, another family member,
        or any other person appointed as suitable by the court, may assume the
        victim’s rights under this section, but in no event shall the defendant
        be named as such representative or guardian.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>(3)</strong> The court shall also order, if agreed to by the
        parties in a plea agreement, restitution to persons other than the
        victim of the offense.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>(b)</strong> The order of restitution shall require that such
        defendant—
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          <strong>(1)</strong> in the case of an offense resulting in damage to
          or loss or destruction of property of a victim of the offense—
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(A)</strong> return the property to the owner of the property
          or someone designated by the owner; or
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(B)</strong> if return of the property under subparagraph (A)
          is impossible, impracticable, or inadequate, pay an amount equal to—
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(i)</strong> the greater of—
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(I)</strong> the value of the property on the date of the
          damage, loss, or destruction; or
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(II)</strong> the value of the property on the date of
          sentencing, less
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(ii)</strong> the value (as of the date the property is
          returned) of any part of the property that is returned;
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(2)</strong> in the case of an offense resulting in bodily
          injury to a victim—
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(A)</strong> pay an amount equal to the cost of necessary
          medical and related professional services and devices relating to
          physical, psychiatric, and psychological care, including nonmedical
          care and treatment rendered in accordance with a method of healing
          recognized by the law of the place of treatment;
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(B)</strong> pay an amount equal to the cost of necessary
          physical and occupational therapy and rehabilitation; and
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(C)</strong> reimburse the victim for income lost by such
          victim as a result of such offense;
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(3)</strong> in the case of an offense resulting in bodily
          injury that results in the death of the victim, pay an amount equal to
          the cost of necessary funeral and related services; and
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(4)</strong> in any case, reimburse the victim for lost income
          and necessary child care, transportation, and other expenses incurred
          during participation in the investigation or prosecution of the
          offense or attendance at proceedings related to the offense.
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        <strong>(c)(1)</strong> This section shall apply in all sentencing
        proceedings for convictions of, or plea agreements relating to charges
        for, any offense—
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          <strong>(A)</strong> that is—
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(i)</strong> a crime of violence, as defined in section 16;
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(ii)</strong> an offense against property under this title, or
          under section 416(a) of the Controlled Substance Act (21 U.S.C.
          856(a)), including any offense committed by fraud or deceit;
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(iii)</strong> an offense described in section 1365 (relating
          to tampering with consumer products); or
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(iv)</strong> an offense under section 670 (relating to theft
          of medical products); and
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(B)</strong> in which an identifiable victim or victims has
          suffered a physical injury or pecuniary loss.
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        <strong>(2)</strong> In the case of a plea agreement that does not
        result in a conviction for an offense described in paragraph (1), this
        section shall apply only if the plea specifically states that an offense
        listed under such paragraph gave rise to the plea agreement.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>(3)</strong> This section shall not apply in the case of an
        offense described in paragraph (1)(A)(ii) if the court finds, from facts
        on the record, that—
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          <strong>(A)</strong> the number of identifiable victims is so large as
          to make restitution impracticable; or
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(B)</strong> determining complex issues of fact related to the
          cause or amount of the victim’s losses would complicate or prolong the
          sentencing process to a degree that the need to provide restitution to
          any victim is outweighed by the burden on the sentencing process.
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        <strong>(d)</strong> An order of restitution under this section shall be
        issued and enforced in accordance with section 3664.

          § 3664. Procedure for issuance and enforcement of order of restitution
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>(a)</strong> For orders of restitution under this title, the
        court shall order the probation officer to obtain and include in its
        presentence report, or in a separate report, as the court may direct,
        information sufficient for the court to exercise its discretion in
        fashioning a restitution order. The report shall include, to the extent
        practicable, a complete accounting of the losses to each victim, any
        restitution owed pursuant to a plea agreement, and information relating
        to the economic circumstances of each defendant. If the number or
        identity of victims cannot be reasonably ascertained, or other
        circumstances exist that make this requirement clearly impracticable,
        the probation officer shall so inform the court.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>(b)</strong> The court shall disclose to both the defendant and
        the attorney for the Government all portions of the presentence or other
        report pertaining to the matters described in subsection (a) of this
        section.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>(c)</strong> The provisions of this chapter, chapter 227, and
        Rule 32(c) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure shall be the only
        rules applicable to proceedings under this section.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>(d)(1)</strong> Upon the request of the probation officer, but
        not later than 60 days prior to the date initially set for sentencing,
        the attorney for the Government, after consulting, to the extent
        practicable, with all identified victims, shall promptly provide the
        probation officer with a listing of the amounts subject to restitution.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>(2)</strong> The probation officer shall, prior to submitting
        the presentence report under subsection (a), to the extent practicable—
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          <strong>(A)</strong> provide notice to all identified victims of—
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(i)</strong> the offense or offenses of which the defendant
          was convicted;
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(ii)</strong> the amounts subject to restitution submitted to
          the probation officer;
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(iii)</strong> the opportunity of the victim to submit
          information to the probation officer concerning the amount of the
          victim’s losses;
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(iv)</strong> the scheduled date, time, and place of the
          sentencing hearing;
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(v)</strong> the availability of a lien in favor of the victim
          pursuant to subsection (m)(1)(B); and
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(vi)</strong> the opportunity of the victim to file with the
          probation officer a separate affidavit relating to the amount of the
          victim’s losses subject to restitution; and
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(B)</strong> provide the victim with an affidavit form to
          submit pursuant to subparagraph (A)(vi).
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        <strong>(3)</strong> Each defendant shall prepare and file with the
        probation officer an affidavit fully describing the financial resources
        of the defendant, including a complete listing of all assets owned or
        controlled by the defendant as of the date on which the defendant was
        arrested, the financial needs and earning ability of the defendant and
        the defendant’s dependents, and such other information that the court
        requires relating to such other factors as the court deems appropriate.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>(4)</strong> After reviewing the report of the probation
        officer, the court may require additional documentation or hear
        testimony. The privacy of any records filed, or testimony heard,
        pursuant to this section shall be maintained to the greatest extent
        possible, and such records may be filed or testimony heard in camera.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>(5)</strong> If the victim’s losses are not ascertainable by the
        date that is 10 days prior to sentencing, the attorney for the
        Government or the probation officer shall so inform the court, and the
        court shall set a date for the final determination of the victim’s
        losses, not to exceed 90 days after sentencing. If the victim
        subsequently discovers further losses, the victim shall have 60 days
        after discovery of those losses in which to petition the court for an
        amended restitution order. Such order may be granted only upon a showing
        of good cause for the failure to include such losses in the initial
        claim for restitutionary relief.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>(6)</strong> The court may refer any issue arising in connection
        with a proposed order of restitution to a magistrate judge or special
        master for proposed findings of fact and recommendations as to
        disposition, subject to a de novo determination of the issue by the
        court.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>(e)</strong> Any dispute as to the proper amount or type of
        restitution shall be resolved by the court by the preponderance of the
        evidence. The burden of demonstrating the amount of the loss sustained
        by a victim as a result of the offense shall be on the attorney for the
        Government. The burden of demonstrating the financial resources of the
        defendant and the financial needs of the defendant’s dependents, shall
        be on the defendant. The burden of demonstrating such other matters as
        the court deems appropriate shall be upon the party designated by the
        court as justice requires.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>(f)(1)(A)</strong> In each order of restitution, the court shall
        order restitution to each victim in the full amount of each victim’s
        losses as determined by the court and without consideration of the
        economic circumstances of the defendant.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>(B)</strong> In no case shall the fact that a victim has
        received or is entitled to receive compensation with respect to a loss
        from insurance or any other source be considered in determining the
        amount of restitution.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>(2)</strong> Upon determination of the amount of restitution
        owed to each victim, the court shall, pursuant to section 3572, specify
        in the restitution order the manner in which, and the schedule according
        to which, the restitution is to be paid, in consideration of—
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          <strong>(A)</strong> the financial resources and other assets of the
          defendant, including whether any of these assets are jointly
          controlled;
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(B)</strong> projected earnings and other income of the
          defendant; and
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(C)</strong> any financial obligations of the defendant;
          including obligations to dependents.
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        <strong>(3)(A)</strong> A restitution order may direct the defendant to
        make a single, lump‑sum payment, partial payments at specified
        intervals, in‑kind payments, or a combination of payments at specified
        intervals and in‑kind payments.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>(B)</strong> A restitution order may direct the defendant to
        make nominal periodic payments if the court finds from facts on the
        record that the economic circumstances of the defendant do not allow the
        payment of any amount of a restitution order, and do not allow for the
        payment of the full amount of a restitution order in the foreseeable
        future under any reasonable schedule of payments.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>(4)</strong> An in‑kind payment described in paragraph (3) may
        be in the form of—
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          <strong>(A)</strong> return of property;
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(B)</strong> replacement of property; or
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(C)</strong> if the victim agrees, services rendered to the
          victim or a person or organization other than the victim.
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        <strong>(g)(1)</strong> No victim shall be required to participate in
        any phase of a restitution order.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>(2)</strong> A victim may at any time assign the victim’s
        interest in restitution payments to the Crime Victims Fund in the
        Treasury without in any way impairing the obligation of the defendant to
        make such payments.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>(h)</strong> If the court finds that more than 1 defendant has
        contributed to the loss of a victim, the court may make each defendant
        liable for payment of the full amount of restitution or may apportion
        liability among the defendants to reflect the level of contribution to
        the victim’s loss and economic circumstances of each defendant.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>(i)</strong> If the court finds that more than 1 victim has
        sustained a loss requiring restitution by a defendant, the court may
        provide for a different payment schedule for each victim based on the
        type and amount of each victim’s loss and accounting for the economic
        circumstances of each victim. In any case in which the United States is
        a victim, the court shall ensure that all other victims receive full
        restitution before the United States receives any restitution.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>(j)(1)</strong> If a victim has received compensation from
        insurance or any other source with respect to a loss, the court shall
        order that restitution be paid to the person who provided or is
        obligated to provide the compensation, but the restitution order shall
        provide that all restitution of victims required by the order be paid to
        the victims before any restitution is paid to such a provider of
        compensation.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>(2)</strong> Any amount paid to a victim under an order of
        restitution shall be reduced by any amount later recovered as
        compensatory damages for the same loss by the victim in—
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          <strong>(A)</strong> any Federal civil proceeding; and
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(B)</strong> any State civil proceeding, to the extent
          provided by the law of the State.
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        <strong>(k)</strong> A restitution order shall provide that the
        defendant shall notify the court and the Attorney General of any
        material change in the defendant’s economic circumstances that might
        affect the defendant’s ability to pay restitution. The court may also
        accept notification of a material change in the defendant’s economic
        circumstances from the United States or from the victim. The Attorney
        General shall certify to the court that the victim or victims owed
        restitution by the defendant have been notified of the change in
        circumstances. Upon receipt of the notification, the court may, on its
        own motion, or the motion of any party, including the victim, adjust the
        payment schedule, or require immediate payment in full, as the interests
        of justice require.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>(l)</strong> A conviction of a defendant for an offense
        involving the act giving rise to an order of restitution shall estop the
        defendant from denying the essential allegations of that offense in any
        subsequent Federal civil proceeding or State civil proceeding, to the
        extent consistent with State law, brought by the victim.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>(m)(1)(A)(i)</strong> An order of restitution may be enforced by
        the United States in the manner provided for in subchapter C of chapter
        227 and subchapter B of chapter 229 of this title; or
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>(ii)</strong> by all other available and reasonable means.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>(B)</strong> At the request of a victim named in a restitution
        order, the clerk of the court shall issue an abstract of judgment
        certifying that a judgment has been entered in favor of such victim in
        the amount specified in the restitution order. Upon registering,
        recording, docketing, or indexing such abstract in accordance with the
        rules and requirements relating to judgments of the court of the State
        where the district court is located, the abstract of judgment shall be a
        lien on the property of the defendant located in such State in the same
        manner and to the same extent and under the same conditions as a
        judgment of a court of general jurisdiction in that State.

        pay a fine, receives substantial resources from any source, including
        inheritance, settlement, or other judgment, during a period of
        incarceration, such person shall be required to apply the value of such
        resources to any restitution or fine still owed.

      <p>
        <strong>(a) Appeal by a defendant.</strong>—A defendant may file a
        notice of appeal in the district court for review of an otherwise final
        sentence if the sentence—
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          <strong>(1)</strong> was imposed in violation of law;
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(2)</strong> was imposed as a result of an incorrect
          application of the sentencing guidelines; or
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(3)</strong> is greater than the sentence specified in the
          applicable guideline range to the extent that the sentence includes a
          greater fine or term of imprisonment, probation, or supervised release
          than the maximum established in the guideline range, or includes a
          more limiting condition of probation or supervised release under
          section 3563(b)(6) or (b)(11) than the maximum established in the
          guideline range; or
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(4)</strong> was imposed for an offense for which there is no
          sentencing guideline and is plainly unreasonable.
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        <strong>(b) Appeal by the Government.</strong>—The Government may file a
        notice of appeal in the district court for review of an otherwise final
        sentence if the sentence—
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          <strong>(1)</strong> was imposed in violation of law;
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>(3)</strong> is less than the sentence specified in the
          applicable guideline range to the extent that the sentence includes a
          lesser fine or term of imprisonment, probation, or supervised release

          less limiting condition of probation or supervised release under
          section 3563(b)(6) or (b)(11) than the minimum established in the
          guideline range; or
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(4)</strong> was imposed for an offense for which there is no
          sentencing guideline and is plainly unreasonable.
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        The Government may not further prosecute such appeal without the
        personal approval of the Attorney General, the Solicitor General, or a
        deputy solicitor general designated by the Solicitor General.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>(c) Plea agreements.</strong>—In the case of a plea agreement
        that includes a specific sentence under rule 11(e)(1)(C) of the Federal
        Rules of Criminal Procedure—
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          <strong>(1)</strong> a defendant may not file a notice of appeal under
          paragraph (3) or (4) of subsection (a) unless the sentence imposed is
          greater than the sentence set forth in such agreement; and
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(2)</strong> the Government may not file a notice of appeal
          under paragraph (3) or (4) of subsection (b) unless the sentence
          imposed is less than the sentence set forth in such agreement.
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        <strong>(d) Record on review.</strong>—If a notice of appeal is filed in
        the district court pursuant to subsection (a) or (b), the clerk shall
        certify to the court of appeals—
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          <strong>(1)</strong> that portion of the record in the case that is
          designated as pertinent by either of the parties;
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(2)</strong> the presentence report; and
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(3)</strong> the information submitted during the sentencing
          proceeding.
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        <strong>(e) Consideration.</strong>—Upon review of the record, the court
        of appeals shall determine whether the sentence—
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          <strong>(1)</strong> was imposed in violation of law;
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(2)</strong> was imposed as a result of an incorrect
          application of the sentencing guidelines;
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(3)</strong> is outside the applicable guideline range, and
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(A)</strong> the district court failed to provide the written
          statement of reasons required by section 3553(c);
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(B)</strong> the sentence departs from the applicable
          guideline range based on a factor that—
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(i)</strong> does not advance the objectives set forth in
          section 3553(a)(2); or
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(ii)</strong> is not authorized under section 3553(b); or
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(iii)</strong> is not justified by the facts of the case; or
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(C)</strong> the sentence departs to an unreasonable degree
          from the applicable guidelines range, having regard for the factors to
          be considered in imposing a sentence, as set forth in section 3553(a)
          of this title and the reasons for the imposition of the particular
          sentence, as stated by the district court pursuant to the provisions
          of section 3553(c); or
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(4)</strong> was imposed for an offense for which there is no
          applicable sentencing guideline and is plainly unreasonable.
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        The court of appeals shall give due regard to the opportunity of the
        district court to judge the credibility of the witnesses, and shall
        accept the findings of fact of the district court unless they are
        clearly erroneous and, except with respect to determinations under
        subsection (3)(A) or (3)(B), shall give due deference to the district
        court’s application of the guidelines to the facts. With respect to
        determinations under subsection (3)(A) or (3)(B), the court of appeals
        shall review de novo the district court’s application of the guidelines
        to the facts.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>(f) Decision and disposition.</strong>—If the court of appeals
        determines that—
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          <strong>(1)</strong> the sentence was imposed in violation of law or
          imposed as a result of an incorrect application of the sentencing
          guidelines, the court shall remand the case for further sentencing
          proceedings with such instructions as the court considers appropriate;
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(2)</strong> the sentence is outside the applicable guideline
          range and the district court failed to provide the required statement
          of reasons in the order of judgment and commitment, or the departure
          is based on an impermissible factor, or is to an unreasonable degree,
          or the sentence was imposed for an offense for which there is no
          applicable sentencing guideline and is plainly unreasonable, it shall
          state specific reasons for its conclusions and—
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(A)</strong> if it determines that the sentence is too high
          and the appeal has been filed under subsection (a), it shall set aside
          the sentence and remand the case for further sentencing proceedings
          with such instructions as the court considers appropriate, subject to
          subsection (g);
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(B)</strong> if it determines that the sentence is too low and
          the appeal has been filed under subsection (b), it shall set aside the
          sentence and remand the case for further sentencing proceedings with
          such instructions as the court considers appropriate, subject to
          subsection (g);
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(3)</strong> the sentence is not described in paragraph (1) or
          (2), it shall affirm the sentence.
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        <strong>(g) Sentencing upon remand.—</strong>A district court to which a
        case is remanded pursuant to subsection (f)(1) or (f)(2) shall
        resentence a defendant in accordance with section 3553 and with such
        instructions as may have been given by the court of appeals, except
        that—
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          <strong>(1)</strong> In determining the range referred to in
          subsection 3553(a)(4), the court shall apply the guidelines issued by
          the Sentencing Commission pursuant to section 994(a)(1) of title 28,
          United States Code, and that were in effect on the date of the
          previous sentencing of the defendant prior to the appeal, together
          with any amendments thereto by any act of Congress that was in effect
          on such date; and
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(2)</strong> The court shall not impose a sentence outside the
          applicable guidelines range except upon a ground that—
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(A)</strong> was specifically and affirmatively included in
          the written statement of reasons required by section 3553(c) in
          connection with the previous sentencing of the defendant prior to the
          appeal; and
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(B)</strong> was held by the court of appeals, in remanding
          the case, to be a permissible ground of departure.
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        <strong>(h) Application to a sentence by a magistrate.</strong>—An
        appeal of an otherwise final sentence imposed by a United States
        magistrate may be taken to a judge of the district court, and this
        section shall apply (except for the requirement of approval by the
        Attorney General or the Solicitor General in the case of a Government
        appeal) as though the appeal were to a court of appeals from a sentence
        imposed by a district court.

      <p>
        <strong>(i) Guideline not expressed as a range.</strong>—For the purpose
        of this section, the term “guideline range” includes a guideline range
        having the same upper and lower limits.

        <strong>(j) Definitions.—</strong>For purposes of this section—

      <blockquote>
        <p>
          <strong>(1)</strong> a factor is a “permissible” ground of departure
          if it—

        <p>
          <strong>(A)</strong> advances the objectives set forth in section
          3553(a)(2); and
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(B)</strong> is authorized under section 3553(b); and
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(C)</strong> is justified by the facts of the case; and
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(2)</strong> a factor is an “impermissible” ground of
          departure if it is not a permissible factor within the meaning of
          subsection (j)(1).

      <p>
        <strong>(a)</strong> There is established as an independent commission
        in the judicial branch of the United States a United States Sentencing
        Commission which shall consist of seven voting members and one nonvoting
        member. The President, after consultation with representatives of
        judges, prosecuting attorneys, defense attorneys, law enforcement
        officials, senior citizens, victims of crime, and others interested in
        the criminal justice process, shall appoint the voting members of the
        Commission, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, one of
        whom shall be appointed, by and with the advice and consent of the
        Senate, as the Chair and three of whom shall be designated by the
        President as Vice Chairs. At least 3 of the members shall be Federal
        judges selected after considering a list of six judges recommended to
        the President by the Judicial Conference of the United States. Not more
        than four of the members of the Commission shall be members of the same
        political party, and of the three Vice Chairs, no more than two shall be
        members of the same political party. The Attorney General, or the
        Attorney General’s designee, shall be an ex officio, nonvoting member of
        the Commission. The Chair, Vice Chairs, and members of the Commission
        shall be subject to removal from the Commission by the President only
        for neglect of duty or malfeasance in office or for other good cause
        shown.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>(b)</strong> The purposes of the United States Sentencing
        Commission are to—
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          <strong>(1)</strong> establish sentencing policies and practices for
          the Federal criminal justice system that—
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(A)</strong> assure the meeting of the purposes of sentencing
          as set forth in section 3553(a)(2) of title 18, United States Code;
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(B)</strong> provide certainty and fairness in meeting the
          purposes of sentencing, avoiding unwarranted sentencing disparities
          among defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of
          similar criminal conduct while maintaining sufficient flexibility to
          permit individualized sentences when warranted by mitigating or
          aggravating factors not taken into account in the establishment of
          general sentencing practices; and
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(C)</strong> reflect, to the extent practicable, advancement

        account the nature and capacity of the penal, correctional, and other
        facilities and services available, and shall make recommendations
        concerning any change or expansion in the nature or capacity of such
        facilities and services that might become necessary as a result of the
        guidelines promulgated pursuant to the provisions of this chapter. The
        sentencing guidelines prescribed under this chapter shall be formulated
        to minimize the likelihood that the Federal prison population will
        exceed the capacity of the Federal prisons, as determined by the
        Commission.

          of 1970 (21 U.S.C. 841 and 960), and that involved trafficking in a
          substantial quantity of a controlled substance.

        <strong>(j)</strong> The Commission shall insure that the guidelines
        reflect the general appropriateness of imposing a sentence other than
        imprisonment in cases in which the defendant is a first offender who has
        not been convicted of a crime of violence or an otherwise serious
        offense, and the general appropriateness of imposing a term of
        imprisonment on a person convicted of a crime of violence that results
        in serious bodily injury.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>(k)</strong> The Commission shall insure that the guidelines
        reflect the inappropriateness of imposing a sentence to a term of
        imprisonment for the purpose of rehabilitating the defendant or
        providing the defendant with needed educational or vocational training,
        medical care, or other correctional treatment.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>(l)</strong> The Commission shall insure that the guidelines
        promulgated pursuant to subsection (a)(1) reflect—
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          <strong>(1)</strong> the appropriateness of imposing an incremental
          penalty for each offense in a case in which a defendant is convicted
          of—
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(A)</strong> multiple offenses committed in the same course of
          conduct that result in the exercise of ancillary jurisdiction over one
          or more of the offenses; and
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(B)</strong> multiple offenses committed at different times,
          including those cases in which the subsequent offense is a violation
          of section 3146 (penalty for failure to appear) or is committed while
          the person is released pursuant to the provisions of section 3147
          (penalty for an offense committed while on release) of title 18; and
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(2)</strong> the general inappropriateness of imposing
          consecutive terms of imprisonment for an offense of conspiring to
          commit an offense or soliciting commission of an offense and for an
          offense that was the sole object of the conspiracy or solicitation.
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        <strong>(m)</strong> The Commission shall insure that the guidelines
        reflect the fact that, in many cases, current sentences do not
        accurately reflect the seriousness of the offense. This will require
        that, as a starting point in its development of the initial sets of
        guidelines for particular categories of cases, the Commission ascertain
        the average sentences imposed in such categories of cases prior to the
        creation of the Commission, and in cases involving sentences to terms of
        imprisonment, the length of such terms actually served. The Commission
        shall not be bound by such average sentences, and shall independently
        develop a sentencing range that is consistent with the purposes of
        sentencing described in section 3553(a)(2) of Title 18, United States
        Code.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>(n)</strong> The Commission shall assure that the guidelines
        reflect the general appropriateness of imposing a lower sentence than
        would otherwise be imposed, including a sentence that is lower than that
        established by statute as a minimum sentence, to take into account a
        defendant’s substantial assistance in the investigation or prosecution
        of another person who has committed an offense.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>(o)</strong> The Commission periodically shall review and
        revise, in consideration of comments and data coming to its attention,
        the guidelines promulgated pursuant to the provisions of this section.
        In fulfilling its duties and in exercising its powers, the Commission
        shall consult with authorities on, and individual and institutional
        representatives of, various aspects of the Federal criminal justice
        system. The United States Probation System, the Bureau of Prisons, the
        Judicial Conference of the United States, the Criminal Division of the
        United States Department of Justice, and a representative of the Federal
        Public Defenders shall submit to the Commission any observations,
        comments, or questions pertinent to the work of the Commission whenever
        they believe such communication would be useful, and shall, at least
        annually, submit to the Commission a written report commenting on the
        operation of the Commission’s guidelines, suggesting changes in the
        guidelines that appear to be warranted, and otherwise assessing the
        Commission’s work.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>(p)</strong> The Commission, at or after the beginning of a
        regular session of Congress, but not later than the first day of May,
        may promulgate under subsection (a) of this section and submit to
        Congress amendments to the guidelines and modifications to previously
        submitted amendments that have not taken effect, including modifications
        to the effective dates of such amendments. Such an amendment or
        modification shall be accompanied by a statement of the reasons therefor
        and shall take effect on a date specified by the Commission, which shall
        be no earlier than 180 days after being so submitted and no later than
        the first day of November of the calendar year in which the amendment or
        modification is submitted, except to the extent that the effective date
        is revised or the amendment is otherwise modified or disapproved by Act
        of Congress.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>(q)</strong> The Commission and the Bureau of Prisons shall
        submit to Congress an analysis and recommendations concerning maximum
        utilization of resources to deal effectively with the Federal prison
        population. Such report shall be based upon consideration of a variety
        of alternatives, including—
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          <strong>(1)</strong> modernization of existing facilities;
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(2)</strong> inmate classification and periodic review of such
          classification for use in placing inmates in the least restrictive
          facility necessary to ensure adequate security; and
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(3)</strong> use of existing Federal facilities, such as those
          currently within military jurisdiction.
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        <strong>(r)</strong> The Commission, not later than two years after the
        initial set of sentencing guidelines promulgated under subsection (a)
        goes into effect, and thereafter whenever it finds it advisable, shall
        recommend to the Congress that it raise or lower the grades, or
        otherwise modify the maximum penalties, of those offenses for which such
        an adjustment appears appropriate.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>(s)</strong> The Commission shall give due consideration to any
        petition filed by a defendant requesting modification of the guidelines
        utilized in the sentencing of such defendant, on the basis of changed
        circumstances unrelated to the defendant, including changes in—
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          <strong>(1)</strong> the community view of the gravity of the offense;
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(2)</strong> the public concern generated by the offense; and
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(3)</strong> the deterrent effect particular sentences may
          have on the commission of the offense by others.
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        <strong>(t)</strong> The Commission, in promulgating general policy
        statements regarding the sentencing modification provisions in section
        3582(c)(1)(A) of title 18, shall describe what should be considered
        extraordinary and compelling reasons for sentence reduction, including
        the criteria to be applied and a list of specific examples.
        Rehabilitation of the defendant alone shall not be considered an
        extraordinary and compelling reason.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>(u)</strong> If the Commission reduces the term of imprisonment
        recommended in the guidelines applicable to a particular offense or
        category of offenses, it shall specify in what circumstances and by what
        amount the sentences of prisoners serving terms of imprisonment for the
        offense may be reduced.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>(v)</strong> The Commission shall ensure that the general policy
        statements promulgated pursuant to subsection (a)(2) include a policy
        limiting consecutive terms of imprisonment for an offense involving a
        violation of a general prohibition and for an offense involving a
        violation of a specific prohibition encompassed within the general
        prohibition.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>(w)(1)</strong> The Chief Judge of each district court shall
        ensure that, within 30 days following entry of judgment in every
        criminal case, the sentencing court submits to the Commission, in a
        format approved and required by the Commission, a written report of the
        sentence, the offense for which it is imposed, the age, race, sex of the
        offender, and information regarding factors made relevant by the
        guidelines. The report shall also include—
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          <strong>(A)</strong> the judgment and commitment order;
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(B)</strong> the written statement of reasons for the sentence
          imposed (which shall include the reason for any departure from the
          otherwise applicable guideline range and which shall be stated on the
          written statement of reasons form issued by the Judicial Conference
          and approved by the United States Sentencing Commission);
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(C)</strong> any plea agreement;
        </p>

          <strong>(D)</strong> the indictment or other charging document;
        </p>

          <strong>(E)</strong> the presentence report; and
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(F)</strong> any other information as the Commission finds
          appropriate.
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        The information referred to in subparagraphs (A) through (F) shall be
        submitted by the sentencing court in a format approved and required by
        the Commission.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>(2)</strong> The Commission shall, upon request, make available
        to the House and Senate Committees on the Judiciary, the written reports
        and all underlying records accompanying those reports described in this
        section, as well as other records received from courts.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>(3)</strong> The Commission shall submit to Congress at least
        annually an analysis of these documents, any recommendations for
        legislation that the Commission concludes is warranted by that analysis,
        and an accounting of those districts that the Commission believes have
        not submitted the appropriate information and documents required by this
        section.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>(4)</strong> The Commission shall make available to the Attorney
        General, upon request, such data files as the Commission itself may
        assemble or maintain in electronic form as a result of the information
        submitted under paragraph (1). Such data files shall be made available
        in electronic form and shall include all data fields requested,
        including the identity of the sentencing judge.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>(x)</strong> The provisions of section 553 of title 5, relating
        to publication in the Federal Register and public hearing procedure,
        shall apply to the promulgation of guidelines pursuant to this section.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>(y)</strong> The Commission, in promulgating guidelines pursuant
        to subsection (a)(1), may include, as a component of a fine, the
        expected costs to the Government of any imprisonment, supervised
        release, or probation sentence that is ordered.

      <p>
        <strong>(a) Definition.—</strong>In this section, ‘hate crime’ means a
        crime in which the defendant intentionally selects a victim, or in the
        case of a property crime, the property that is the object of the crime,
        because of the actual or perceived race, color, religion, national
        origin, ethnicity, gender, gender identity, disability, or sexual
        orientation of any person.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>(b) Sentencing Enhancement.—</strong>Pursuant to section 994 of
        title 28, United States Code, the United States Sentencing Commission
        shall promulgate guidelines or amend existing guidelines to provide
        sentencing enhancements of not less than 3 offense levels for offenses
        that the finder of fact at trial determines beyond a reasonable doubt
        are hate crimes. In carrying out this section, the United States
        Sentencing Commission shall ensure that there is reasonable consistency
        with other guidelines, avoid duplicative punishments for substantially
        the same offense, and take into account any mitigating circumstances
        that might justify exceptions.”

        <strong>(a)</strong> <strong>Recommendations.—</strong>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          <strong>(1) In general.—</strong>The United States Sentencing
          Commission shall submit to Congress recommendations (and an
          explanation therefor), regarding changes to the statutes and
          sentencing guidelines governing sentences for unlawful manufacturing,
          importing, exporting, and trafficking of cocaine, and like offenses,
          including unlawful possession, possession with intent to commit any of
          the forgoing offenses, and attempt and conspiracy to commit any of the
          forgoing offenses. The recommendations shall reflect the following
          considerations—
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(A)</strong> the sentence imposed for trafficking in a
          quantity of crack cocaine should generally exceed the sentence imposed
          for trafficking in a like quantity of powder cocaine;
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(B)</strong> high-level wholesale cocaine traffickers,
          organizers, and leaders of criminal activities should generally
          receive longer sentences than low-level retail cocaine traffickers and
          those who played a minor or minimal role in such criminal activity;
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(C)</strong> if the Government establishes that a defendant
          who traffics in powder cocaine has knowledge that such cocaine will be
          converted into crack cocaine prior to its distribution to individual
          users, the defendant should be treated at sentencing as though the
          defendant had trafficked in crack cocaine; and
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(D)</strong> an enhanced sentence should generally be imposed
          on a defendant who, in the course of an offense described in this
          subsection—
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(i)</strong> murders or causes serious bodily injury to an
          individual;
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(ii)</strong> uses a dangerous weapon;
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(iii)</strong> uses or possesses a firearm;
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(iv)</strong> involves a juvenile or a woman who the defendant
          knows or should know to be pregnant;
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(v)</strong> engages in a continuing criminal enterprise or
          commits other criminal offenses in order to facilitate his drug
          trafficking activities;
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(vi)</strong> knows, or should know, that he is involving an
          unusually vulnerable person;
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(vii)</strong> restrains a victim;
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(viii)</strong> traffics in cocaine within 500 feet of a
          school;
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(ix)</strong> obstructs justice;
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(x)</strong> has a significant prior criminal record; or
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(xi)</strong> is an organizer or leader of drug trafficking
          activities involving five or more persons.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(2) Ratio.—</strong>The recommendations described in the
          preceding subsection shall propose revision of the drug quantity ratio
          of crack cocaine to powder cocaine under the relevant statutes and
          guidelines in a manner consistent with the ratios set for other drugs
          and consistent with the objectives set forth in section 3553(a) of
          title 28 United States Code.

      <p>
        <strong>(b) Study.—</strong>No later than May 1, 1996, the Department of
        Justice shall submit to the Judiciary Committees of the Senate and House
        of Representatives a report on the charging and plea practices of
        Federal prosecutors with respect to the offense of money laundering.
        Such study shall include an account of the steps taken or to be taken by
        the Justice Department to ensure consistency and appropriateness in the
        use of the money laundering statute. The Sentencing Commission shall
        submit to the Judiciary Committees comments on the study prepared by the
        Department of Justice.”

          or the administration of justice;
        </p>
        <p>

      <p>
        <strong>(a) In General.—</strong>Pursuant to its authority under section
        994(p) of title 28, United States Code, the United States Sentencing
        Commission shall review and, if appropriate, amend the Federal
        sentencing guidelines and policy statements applicable to persons
        convicted of offenses relating to the transmission or attempted
        transmission of a stolen trade secret outside of the United States or
        economic espionage, in order to reflect the intent of Congress that
        penalties for such offenses under the Federal sentencing guidelines and
        policy statements appropriately, reflect the seriousness of these
        offenses, account for the potential and actual harm caused by these
        offenses, and provide adequate deterrence against such offenses.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>(b) Requirements.—</strong>In carrying out this section, the
        United States Sentencing Commission shall—
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          <strong>(1)</strong> consider the extent to which the Federal
          sentencing guidelines and policy statements appropriately account for
          the simple misappropriation of a trade secret, including the
          sufficiency of the existing enhancement for these offenses to address
          the seriousness of this conduct;
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(2)</strong> consider whether additional enhancements in the
          Federal sentencing guidelines and policy statements are appropriate to
          account for—
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(A)</strong> the transmission or attempted transmission of a
          stolen trade secret outside of the United States; and
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(B)</strong> the transmission or attempted transmission of a
          stolen trade secret outside of the United States that is committed or
          attempted to be committed for the benefit of a foreign government,
          foreign instrumentality, or foreign agent;
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(3)</strong> ensure the Federal sentencing guidelines and
          policy statements reflect the seriousness of these offenses and the
          need to deter such conduct;
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(4)</strong> ensure reasonable consistency with other relevant
          directives, Federal sentencing guidelines and policy statements, and
          related Federal statutes;
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(5)</strong> make any necessary conforming changes to the
          Federal sentencing guidelines and policy statements; and
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(6)</strong> ensure that the Federal sentencing guidelines
          adequately meet the purposes of sentencing as set forth in section
          3553(a)(2) of title 18, United States Code.
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        <strong>(c) Consultation.—</strong>In carrying out the review required
        under this section, the Commission shall consult with individuals or
        groups representing law enforcement, owners of trade secrets, victims of
        economic espionage offenses, the United States Department of Justice,
        the United States Department of Homeland Security, the United States
        Department of State and the Office of the United States Trade
        Representative.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>(d) Review.—</strong>Not later than 180 days after the date of
        enactment of this Act, the Commission shall complete its consideration
        and review under this section.”
