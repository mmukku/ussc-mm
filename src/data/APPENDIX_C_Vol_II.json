The Commission identified mass-marketing as a\r\ncentral component of telemarketing fraud and also determined that there were other\r\nfraudulent schemes that relied on mass-marketing to perpetrate the offense (for example,\r\nInternet fraud). Accordingly, rather than provide a limited enhancement for telemarketing\r\nfraud only, the Commission determined that a generally applicable specific offense\r\ncharacteristic in the fraud guideline would better provide consistent and proportionate\r\nsentencing increases for similar types of fraud, while also ensuring increased sentences for\r\npersons who engage in mass-marketed telemarketing fraud.\r\nSecond, this amendment provides an increase for fraud offenses that involve conduct, such\r\nas sophisticated concealment, that makes it difficult for law enforcement authorities to\r\ndiscover the offense or apprehend the offenders. The new enhancement provides a two-level\r\nincrease and a \"floor\" offense level of level 12 in the fraud guideline and replaces the current\r\nenhancement for \"the use of foreign bank accounts or transactions to conceal the true nature\r\nor extent of fraudulent conduct.\" There are three alternative provisions to the enhancement.\r\nThe first two prongs address conduct that the Commission has been informed often relates\r\nto telemarketing fraud, although the conduct also may occur in connection with fraudulent\r\nschemes perpetrated by other means. Specifically, the Commission has been informed that\r\nfraudulent telemarketers increasingly are conducting their operations from Canada and other\r\nlocations outside the United States. Additionally, testimony offered at a Commission\r\nhearing on telemarketing fraud indicated that telemarketers often relocate their schemes to\r\nother jurisdictions once they know or suspect that enforcement authorities have discovered\r\nthe scheme. Both types of conduct are specifically covered by the new enhancement. The\r\nthird prong provides an increase if any offense covered by the fraud guideline otherwise\r\ninvolves sophisticated concealment. This prong addresses cases in which deliberate steps\r\nare taken to make the offense, or its extent, difficult to detect.\r\nThird, this amendment provides a two-level enhancement for conduct related to sophisticated\r\nconcealment of a tax offense. The primary purpose of this amendment is to conform the\r\nlanguage of the current enhancement for “sophisticated means” in the tax guidelines to the\r\nessentially equivalent language of the new sophisticated concealment enhancement provided\r\nin the fraud guideline. Additionally, the amendment resolves a circuit conflict regarding\r\nwhether the enhancement applies based on the personal conduct of the defendant or the\r\nAmendment 577 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003\r\n\r\noverall offense conduct for which the defendant is accountable. Consistent with the usual\r\nrelevant conduct rules, application of this new enhancement for sophisticated concealment\r\naccordingly is based on the overall offense conduct for which the defendant is accountable.","EffectiveDate":"Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1998."},{"Id":579,"Title":"Amendment 579","Text":"Section 2K2.1(a) is amended in subdivision (4) by striking \"the defendant\"\r\nafter \"20, if\"; in subdivision (4)(A) by inserting \"the defendant\" before \"had one\"; in\r\nsubdivision (4)(B) by striking \"is a prohibited person, and\"; and in subdivision (4)(B) by\r\ninserting \"; and the defendant (i) is a prohibited person; or (ii) is convicted under 18 U.S.C.\r\n§ 922(d)\" after \"§ 921(a)(30)\".\r\nSection 2K2.1(a)(6) is amended by inserting \"(A)\" after \"defendant\"; and by inserting \"; or\r\n(B) is convicted under 18 U.S.C. § 922(d)\" after \"person\".\r\nThe Commentary to §2K2.1 captioned \"Application Notes\" is amended in Note 6 by striking\r\n\"or\" before \"(vi)\"; and by inserting \"; or (vii) has been convicted in any court of a\r\nmisdemeanor crime of domestic violence as defined in 18 U.S.C. § 921(a)(33)\" after\r\n\"§ 922(d)(8)\".\r\nThe Commentary to §2K2.1 captioned \"Application Notes\" is amended in Note 12 in the first\r\nparagraph by striking \"924(j) or (k), or 26 U.S.C. § 5861(g) or (h)\" and inserting \"924 (l) or\r\n(m)\"; and in the second paragraph by striking \"only\" after \"if the\"; and by inserting \"or 26\r\nU.S.C. § 5861(g) or (h)\" after \"922(k)\".","Reason":"Reason for Amendment: This amendment has three purposes: (1) to change the definition\r\nof \"prohibited person\" in the firearms guideline so that it includes a person convicted of a\r\nmisdemeanor crime of domestic violence; (2) to provide the same base offense levels for\r\nboth a prohibited person and a person who is convicted under 18 U.S.C. § 922(d) of\r\ntransferring a firearm to a prohibited person; and (3) to make several technical and\r\nconforming changes to the firearms guideline.\r\nThe first part of the amendment amends Application Note 6 of §2K2.1 (Unlawful Receipt,\r\nPossession, or Transportation of Firearms or Ammunition; Prohibited Transactions Involving\r\nFirearms or Ammunition) to include a person convicted of a misdemeanor crime of domestic\r\nviolence within the scope of \"prohibited person\" for purposes of that guideline. It also\r\ndefines \"misdemeanor crime of domestic violence\" by reference to the new statutory\r\ndefinition of that term in 18 U.S.C. § 921(a).\r\nThis part of the amendment addresses section 658 of the Treasury, Postal Service, and\r\nGeneral Government Appropriations Act, Pub. L. 104–208, 110 Stat. 3009 (1996) (contained\r\nin the Omnibus Consolidated Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 1997). Section 658\r\namended 18 U.S.C. § 922(d) to prohibit the sale of a firearm or ammunition to a person who\r\nhas been convicted in any court of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence. It also\r\namended 18 U.S.C. § 922(g) to prohibit a person who has been convicted in any court of a\r\nmisdemeanor crime of domestic violence from transporting or receiving a firearm or\r\nammunition. Section 922(s)(3)(B)(i), which lists the information a person not licensed under\r\n18 U.S.C. § 923 must include in a statement to the handgun importer, manufacturer, or\r\ndealer, was amended to require certification that the person to whom the gun is transferred\r\nwas not convicted in any court of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence. Section 658\r\n\r\nalso amended 18 U.S.C. § 921(a) to define \"misdemeanor crime of domestic violence\".\r\nViolations of 18 U.S.C. § 922(d) and (g) are covered by §2K2.1. The new provisions at\r\n§ 922(d) (sale of a firearm to a \"prohibited person\") and § 922(g) (transporting, possession,\r\nand receipt of a firearm by a \"prohibited person\") affect Application Note 6 of §2K2.1,\r\nwhich defines \"prohibited person\". This part of the amendment conforms Application Note\r\n6 of §2K2.1 to the new statutory provisions.\r\nThe second part of this amendment increases the base offense level for a defendant who is\r\nconvicted under 18 U.S.C. § 922(d), which prohibits the transfer of a firearm to a prohibited\r\nperson. Specifically, this part amends the two alternative base offense levels that pertain to\r\nprohibited persons in the firearms guideline in order to make those offense levels applicable\r\nto the person who transfers the firearm to the prohibited person. A person who is convicted\r\nunder 18 U.S.C. § 922(d) has been shown beyond a reasonable doubt either to have known,\r\nor to have had reasonable cause to believe, that the transferee was a prohibited person.\r\nThe third part of this amendment makes two technical and conforming changes in\r\nApplication Note 12 of §2K2.1. First, the amendment corrects statutory references to 18\r\nU.S.C. § 924(j) and (k), which were added as a result of the Violent Crime Control and Law\r\nEnforcement Act of 1994, Pub. L. 103–322, 108 Stat. 1796 (1994). In the Economic\r\nEspionage Act of 1996, Pub. L. 104–294, 110 Stat. 3488 (1996), Congress again amended\r\n18 U.S.C. § 924 and redesignated the provisions as subsections (l) and (m). The amendment\r\nconforms Application Note 12 to that redesignation. Second, the amendment corrects the\r\nmisplacement of the reference to 26 U.S.C. § 5861(g) and (h).","EffectiveDate":"Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1998."},{"Id":580,"Title":"Amendment 580","Text":"The Commentary to §2J1.6 captioned \"Application Notes\" is amended in\r\nNote 3 in the first paragraph by striking \"3D1.2\" and inserting \"3D1.1\"; and by striking the\r\nsecond paragraph in its entirety as follows:\r\n\"Otherwise, in the case of a conviction on both the underlying offense and the\r\nfailure to appear, the failure to appear is treated under §3C1.1 (Obstructing or\r\nImpeding the Administration of Justice) as an obstruction of the underlying offense;\r\nand the failure to appear count and the count(s) for the underlying offense are\r\ngrouped together under §3D1.2(c). Note that although 18 U.S.C. § 3146(b)(2) does\r\nnot require a sentence of imprisonment on a failure to appear count, it does require\r\nthat any sentence of imprisonment on a failure to appear count be imposed\r\nconsecutively to any other sentence of imprisonment. Therefore, in such cases, the\r\ncombined sentence must be constructed to provide a ‘total punishment’ that satisfies\r\nthe requirements both of §5G1.2 (Sentencing on Multiple Counts of Conviction) and\r\n18 U.S.C. § 3146(b)(2). For example, where the combined applicable guideline\r\nrange for both counts is 30-37 months and the court determines a ‘total punishment’\r\nof 36 months is appropriate, a sentence of thirty months for the underlying offense\r\nplus a consecutive six months sentence for the failure to appear count would satisfy\r\nthese requirements.\",\r\nand inserting the following as the new second paragraph:\r\n\"In the case of a conviction on both the underlying offense and the failure to appear,\r\nAmendment 579 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003\r\n\r\nthe failure to appear is treated under §3C1.1 (Obstructing or Impeding the\r\nAdministration of Justice) as an obstruction of the underlying offense, and the\r\nfailure to appear count and the count or counts for the underlying offense are\r\ngrouped together under §3D1.2(c). (Note that 18 U.S.C. § 3146(b)(2) does not\r\nrequire a sentence of imprisonment on a failure to appear count, although if a\r\nsentence of imprisonment on the failure to appear count is imposed, the statute\r\nrequires that the sentence be imposed to run consecutively to any other sentence of\r\nimprisonment. Therefore, unlike a count in which the statute mandates both a\r\nminimum and a consecutive sentence of imprisonment, the grouping rules of\r\n§§3D1.1-3D1.5 apply. See §3D1.1(b), comment. (n.1), and §3D1.2, comment.\r\n(n.1).) The combined sentence will then be constructed to provide a ‘total\r\npunishment’ that satisfies the requirements both of §5G1.2 (Sentencing on Multiple\r\nCounts of Conviction) and 18 U.S.C. § 3146(b)(2). For example, if the combined\r\napplicable guideline range for both counts is 30-37 months and the court determines\r\nthat a ‘total punishment’ of 36 months is appropriate, a sentence of 30 months for\r\nthe underlying offense plus a consecutive six months’ sentence for the failure to\r\nappear count would satisfy these requirements. (Note that the combination of this\r\ninstruction and increasing the offense level for the obstructive, failure to appear\r\nconduct has the effect of ensuring an incremental, consecutive punishment for the\r\nfailure to appear count, as required by 18 U.S.C. § 3146(b)(2).)\".\r\nThe Commentary to §2J1.6 captioned \"Application Notes\" is amended by redesignating Note\r\n4 as Note 5; and by inserting the following as new Note 4:\r\n\"4.

A\r\nconviction for 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) (use of firearm in commission of a crime\r\nof violence) provides a common example. In the case of a conviction under\r\n18 U.S.C. § 924(c), the specific offense characteristic for weapon use in the\r\nprimary offense is to be disregarded to avoid double counting. See\r\nCommentary to §2K2.4 (Use of Firearm, Armor-Piercing Ammunition, or\r\nExplosive During or in Relation to Certain Crimes). Example: The\r\ndefendant is convicted of one count of bank robbery (18 U.S.C. § 2113),\r\nand one count of use of a firearm in the commission of a crime of violence\r\n(18 U.S.C. § 924(c)). The two counts are not grouped together, and the\r\noffense level for the bank robbery count is computed without application of\r\nan enhancement for weapon possession or use. The mandatory five-year\r\nsentence on the weapon-use count runs consecutively, as required by law.\r\nSee §5G1.2(a).\",\r\nand inserting the following:\r\nAmendment 579 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003\r\n\r\n\"1. Subsection (b) applies if a statute (A) specifies a term of imprisonment to\r\nbe imposed; and (B) requires that such term of imprisonment be imposed\r\nto run consecutively to any other term of imprisonment. See, e.g., 18\r\nU.S.C. § 924(c) (requiring mandatory term of five years to run\r\nconsecutively). The multiple count rules set out under this Part do not\r\napply to a count of conviction covered by subsection (b). However, a count\r\ncovered by subsection (b) may affect the offense level determination for\r\nother counts. For example, a defendant is convicted of one count of bank\r\nrobbery (18 U.S.C. § 2113), and one count of use of a firearm in the\r\ncommission of a crime of violence (18 U.S.C. § 924(c)). The two counts\r\nare not grouped together pursuant to this guideline, and, to avoid\r\nunwarranted double counting, the offense level for the bank robbery count\r\nunder §2B3.1 (Robbery) is computed without application of the\r\nenhancement for weapon possession or use as otherwise required by\r\nsubsection (b)(2) of that guideline.

First, this amendment amends the\r\ncommentary in the contempt guideline, §2J1.1, pertaining to offenses under 18 U.S.C. § 228\r\ninvolving the willful failure to pay court-ordered child support. The commentary notes that\r\nthe contempt guideline applies to second and subsequent offenses under 18 U.S.C. § 228\r\nbecause a first offense is a Class B misdemeanor not covered by the guidelines.\r\nHowever, in the Deadbeat Parents Punishment Act of 1998, Pub. L. 105–187, Congress\r\namended 18 U.S.C. § 228 to add two new violations of that section (found at 18 U.S.C.\r\n§ 228(a)(2) and (3)) and to make even the first offense under those new violations a felony\r\nthat would be subject to the guidelines. Accordingly, the commentary in the contempt\r\nguideline is amended to reflect that it is only the first offense under a violation of 18 U.S.C.\r\n§ 228(a)(1) that is not covered by the guideline.\r\nSecond, this amendment updates and corrects the background commentary of §2C1.4, the\r\nguideline that covers offenses involving unlawful compensation for federal employees and\r\nbank officials. Currently the background commentary states that 18 U.S.C. § 209 (involving\r\nthe unlawful supplementation of the salary of various federal employees) and 18 U.S.C.\r\n§1909 (prohibiting bank examiners from performing any service for compensation for banks\r\nor bank officials) both are misdemeanors for which the maximum term of imprisonment is\r\none year.

Such violations are similar to copyright offenses and are therefore covered by this\r\nguideline.\".\r\nA replacement guideline with accompanying commentary is inserted as §2B5.3 (Criminal\r\nInfringement of Copyright or Trademark).","Reason":"Reason for Amendment: This amendment is in response to section 2(g) of the No\r\nElectronic Theft (NET) Act of 1997, Pub. L. 105–147 (\"the Act\"). The Act directs the\r\nCommission to ensure that the applicable guideline range for intellectual property offenses\r\n(including offenses set forth at section 506(a) of title 17, United States Code, and sections\r\n2319, 2319A, and 2320 of title 18, United States Code) is \"sufficiently stringent to deter such\r\na crime.\" It also more specifically requires that the guidelines \"provide for consideration of\r\nthe retail value and quantity of the items with respect to which the intellectual property\r\noffense was committed.\"\r\nThe amendment responds to the directives, first, by making changes to the monetary\r\ncalculation found in the copyright and trademark infringement guideline, §2B5.3. In\r\naddition, the amendment makes a number of other modifications to the infringement\r\nguideline, including the addition of several mitigating and aggravating factors, as further\r\nmeans of providing just and proportionate punishment while also seeking to achieve\r\nsufficient deterrence.\r\nThe monetary calculation in §2B5.3(b)(1), similar to the loss enhancement in the theft and\r\nfraud guidelines, serves as an approximation of the pecuniary harm caused by the offense\r\nand is a principal factor in determining the offense level for intellectual property offenses.\r\nPrior to this amendment, the monetary calculation for all intellectual property crimes was\r\nbased on the retail value of the infringing item multiplied by the quantity of infringing items.\r\nIn response to the directive, the Commission refashioned this enhancement so as to use the\r\nretail value of the infringed item, multiplied by the number of infringing items, as a means\r\nof approximating the pecuniary harm for cases in which that calculation is believed most\r\nlikely to provide a reasonable estimate of the resulting harm. Use of that calculation is\r\nbelieved to provide a reasonable approximation for those classes of infringement cases in\r\nwhich it is highly likely that the sale of an infringing item results in a displaced sale of the\r\nlegitimate, infringed item. The amendment also requires that the retail value of the infringed\r\nitem, multiplied by the number of infringing items, be used in certain other cases for reasons\r\nof practicality.\r\nHowever, based upon a review of cases sentenced under the former §2B5.3 over two years,\r\nthe Commission further determined that using the above formula likely would overstate\r\nsubstantially the pecuniary harm caused to copyright and trademark owners in some cases\r\ncurrently sentenced under the guideline. For those cases, a one-to-one correlation between\r\nthe sale of infringing items and the displaced sale of legitimate, infringed items is unlikely\r\nbecause the inferior quality of the infringing item and/or the greatly discounted price at\r\nwhich it is sold suggests that many purchasers of infringing items would not, or could not,\r\nhave purchased the infringed item in the absence of the availability of the infringing item.\r\nNovember 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II Amendment 590\r\n\r\nThe Commission therefore determined that, for these latter classes of cases (referred to in\r\nApplication Note 2(B)), the retail value of the infringing item, multiplied by the number of\r\nthose items, provides a more reasonable approximation of lost revenues to the copyright or\r\ntrademark owner, and hence, of the pecuniary harm resulting from the offense.\r\nThis amendment also increases the base offense level from level 6 to level 8. The two-level\r\nincrease in the base offense level brings the infringement guideline more in line with offense\r\nlevels that would pertain under the fraud guideline, §2F1.1, assuming applicability under that\r\nguideline of the two-level enhancement for more than minimal planning. Based on a review\r\nof cases sentenced under the infringement guideline, if a more than minimal planning\r\nenhancement did exist in that guideline, it would apply in the vast majority of such cases\r\nbecause they involve this kind of aggravating conduct. Rather than provide a separate\r\nenhancement within the revised guideline for \"more than minimal planning\" conduct, the\r\nCommission determined that the infringement guideline should incorporate this type of\r\nconduct into the base offense level.\r\nThis amendment also provides an enhancement of two levels, and a minimum offense level\r\nof level 12, if the offense involved the manufacture, importation, or uploading of infringing\r\nitems. The Commission determined that defendants who engage in such conduct are more\r\nculpable than other intellectual property offenders because they place infringing items into\r\nthe stream of commerce, thereby enabling others to infringe the copyright or trademark. A\r\nreview of cases sentenced under the guideline indicated applicability of this enhancement\r\nto approximately two-thirds of the cases.\r\nThis amendment also provides a two-level downward adjustment (but not less than offense\r\nlevel 8) if the offense was not committed for commercial advantage or private financial gain.\r\nThis adjustment reflects the fact that the Act establishes lower statutory penalties for offenses\r\nthat were not committed for commercial advantage or private financial gain.\r\nThis amendment also provides an enhancement of two levels, and a minimum offense level\r\nof level 13, if the offense involved the conscious or reckless risk of serious bodily injury or\r\npossession of a dangerous weapon in connection with the offense. Testimony received by\r\nthe Commission indicated that the conscious or reckless risk of serious bodily injury may\r\noccur in some cases involving counterfeit consumer products. The Commission determined\r\nthat this kind of aggravating conduct in connection with infringement cases should be treated\r\nunder the guidelines in the same way it is treated in connection with fraud cases; therefore,\r\nthis enhancement is consistent with an identical provision in the fraud guideline.\r\nThe amendment also contains an application note expressly providing that the adjustment\r\nin §3B1.3 (Abuse of Position of Trust or Use of Special Skill) will apply if the defendant de-\r\nencrypted or otherwise circumvented a technological security measure to gain initial access\r\nto an infringed item. As stated in the background commentary to §3B1.3, persons who use\r\nsuch a special skill to facilitate or commit a crime generally are viewed as more culpable.\r\nFinally, this amendment contains two encouraged upward departure provisions. The\r\nCommission received public comment that indicated that infringement may cause substantial\r\nharm to the reputation of the copyright or trademark owner that is not accounted for in the\r\nmonetary calculation.

See United States v. Smith, 186 F.3d 290 (3d\r\nCir. 1999) (determining that §2F1.1 (Fraud and Deceit) was most appropriate guideline\r\nrather than the listed guideline of §2S1.1 (Laundering of Monetary Instruments)); United\r\nStates v.

The clarification is\r\nintended to emphasize that the sentencing court must apply the offense guideline referenced\r\nin the Statutory Index for the statute of conviction unless the case falls within the limited\r\n\"stipulation\" exception set forth in §1B1.2(a). Therefore, in order for the enhanced penalties\r\nin §2D1.2 to apply, the defendant must be convicted of an offense referenced to §2D1.2,\r\nrather than simply have engaged in conduct described by that guideline. Furthermore, the\r\namendment deletes Application Note 3 of §1B1.2 (Applicable Guidelines), which provided\r\nthat in many instances it would be appropriate for the court to consider the actual conduct\r\nof the offender, even if such conduct did not constitute an element of the offense. This\r\napplication note describes a consideration that is more appropriate when applying §1B1.3\r\n(Relevant Conduct), and its current placement in §1B1.2 apparently has caused confusion\r\nin applying that guideline’s principles to determine the offense conduct guideline in Chapter\r\nTwo most appropriate for the offense of conviction. In particular, the note has been used by\r\nsome courts to permit a court to decline to use the offense guideline referenced in the\r\nStatutory Index in cases that were allegedly \"atypical\" or \"outside the heartland.\" See United\r\nStates v.

See Chapter Five, Part K (Departures).\r\n3. Subsection (b)(1) is intended to have broad application and is to be applied\r\nwhenever the victim is entrusted to the defendant, whether temporarily or\r\npermanently. For example, teachers, day care providers, baby-sitters, or\r\nother temporary caretakers are among those who would be subject to this\r\nenhancement. In determining whether to apply this enhancement, the court\r\nshould look to the actual relationship that existed between the defendant and\r\nthe victim and not simply to the legal status of the defendant-victim\r\nrelationship.\r\n4.

Subsection (b)(2)(A) is intended to apply only\r\nto misrepresentations made directly to the victim or to a person who\r\nexercises custody, care, or supervisory control of the victim. Accordingly,\r\nthe enhancement in subsection (b)(2)(A) would not apply to a\r\nmisrepresentation made by a participant to an airline representative in the\r\ncourse of making travel arrangements for the victim.\r\nThe misrepresentation to which the enhancement in subsection (b)(2)(A)\r\nAmendment 592 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003\r\n\r\nmay apply includes misrepresentation of a participant’s name, age,\r\noccupation, gender, or status, as long as the misrepresentation was made\r\nwith the intent to (A) persuade, induce, entice, or coerce the victim to\r\nengage in prohibited sexual conduct; or (B) facilitate transportation or\r\ntravel, by the victim or a participant, to engage in prohibited sexual conduct.\r\nAccordingly, use of a computer screen name, without such intent, would not\r\nbe a sufficient basis for application of the enhancement.\r\nIn determining whether subsection (b)(2)(B) applies, the court should\r\nclosely consider the facts of the case to determine whether a participant’s\r\ninfluence over the victim compromised the voluntariness of the victim’s\r\nbehavior.\r\nIn a case in which a participant is at least 10 years older than the victim,\r\nthere shall be a rebuttable presumption, for purposes of subsection\r\n(b)(2)(B), that such participant unduly influenced the victim to engage in\r\nprohibited sexual conduct.

Subsection (c)(1) provides a cross reference to §2A3.1 (Criminal Sexual\r\nAbuse; Attempt to Commit Criminal Sexual Abuse) if the offense involved\r\ncriminal sexual abuse or attempt to commit criminal sexual abuse, as\r\ndefined in 18 U.S.C. § 2241 or § 2242. For example, the cross reference to\r\n§2A3.1 shall apply if (A) the victim had not attained the age of 12 years\r\n(see 18 U.S.C. § 2241(c)); (B) the victim had attained the age of 12 years\r\nbut not attained the age of 16 years, and was placed in fear of death, serious\r\nbodily injury, or kidnaping (see 18 U.S.C. § 2241(a),(c)); or (C) the victim\r\nwas threatened or placed in fear other than fear of death, serious bodily\r\ninjury, or kidnaping (see 18 U.S.C. § 2242(1)).\r\n8. If the defendant’s criminal history includes a prior sentence for conduct that\r\nis similar to the instant offense, an upward departure may be warranted.\r\nBackground: This section applies to offenses involving the criminal sexual abuse\r\nof an individual who had not attained the age of 16 years. While this section applies\r\nNovember 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II Amendment 592\r\n\r\nto consensual sexual acts prosecuted under 18 U.S.C. § 2243(a) that would be lawful\r\nbut for the age of the victim, it also applies to cases, prosecuted under 18 U.S.C. §\r\n2243(a) or chapter 117 of title 18, United States Code, in which a participant took\r\nactive measure(s) to unduly influence the victim to engage in prohibited sexual\r\nconduct and, thus, the voluntariness of the victim’s behavior was compromised. A\r\ntwo-level enhancement is provided in subsection (b)(2) for such cases. It is assumed\r\nthat at least a four-year age difference exists between the victim and the defendant,\r\nas specified in 18 U.S.C. § 2243(a). A two-level enhancement is provided in\r\nsubsection (b)(1) for a defendant who victimizes a minor under his supervision or\r\ncare. However, if the victim had not attained the age of 12 years, §2A3.1 (Criminal\r\nSexual Abuse; Attempt to Commit Criminal Sexual Abuse) will apply, regardless\r\nof the ‘consent’ of the victim.\".\r\nSection 2A3.3 is amended by inserting after subsection (a) the following:\r\n\"(b) Specific Offense Characteristics\r\n(1) If the offense involved the knowing misrepresentation of a\r\nparticipant’s identity to (A) persuade, induce, entice, or coerce a\r\nminor to engage in prohibited sexual conduct; or (B) facilitate\r\ntransportation or travel, by a minor or a participant, to engage in\r\nprohibited sexual conduct, increase by 2 levels.\r\n(2) If a computer or an Internet-access device was used to (A)\r\npersuade, induce, entice, or coerce a minor to engage in prohibited\r\nsexual conduct; or (B) facilitate transportation or travel, by a minor\r\nor a participant, to engage in prohibited sexual conduct, increase by\r\n2 levels.\".\r\nThe Commentary to §2A3.3 captioned \"Application Notes\" is amended by striking Note 1\r\nin its entirety and inserting the following:\r\n\"1.

Accordingly, the\r\nenhancement in subsection (b)(4) would not apply to a misrepresentation\r\nmade by a participant to an airline representative in the course of making\r\ntravel arrangements for the minor.\r\nThe misrepresentation to which the enhancement in subsection (b)(4) may\r\napply includes misrepresentation of a participant’s name, age, occupation,\r\ngender, or status, as long as the misrepresentation was made with the intent\r\nto (A) persuade, induce, entice, or coerce a minor to engage in prohibited\r\nsexual conduct; or (B) facilitate transportation or travel, by a minor or a\r\nparticipant, to engage in prohibited sexual conduct. Accordingly, use of a\r\ncomputer screen name, without such intent, would not be a sufficient basis\r\nfor application of the enhancement.\r\n7. Subsection (b)(5) provides an enhancement if a computer or an Internet-\r\naccess device was used to (A) persuade, induce, entice, or coerce a minor\r\nto engage in prohibited sexual conduct; or (B) facilitate transportation or\r\ntravel, by a minor or a participant, to engage in prohibited sexual conduct.\r\nSubsection (b)(5) is intended to apply only to the use of a computer or an\r\nInternet-access device to communicate directly with a minor or with a\r\nperson who exercises custody, care, or supervisory control of the minor.\r\nAccordingly, the enhancement would not apply to the use of a computer or\r\nan Internet-access device to obtain airline tickets for the minor from an\r\nairline’s Internet site.\".\r\nChapter Two, Part G, Subpart One is amended by striking the text of the title to Subpart One\r\nin its entirety and inserting the following:\r\n\"PROMOTING PROSTITUTION OR PROHIBITED SEXUAL CONDUCT\";\r\nand by striking §2G1.1 in its entirety and inserting the following:\r\n\"§2G1.1.

If the offense\r\ninvolved criminal sexual abuse of a minor who\r\nhad not attained the age of 12 years, §2A3.1 shall\r\napply, regardless of the ‘consent’ of the victim.\r\n(3) If the offense did not involve promoting\r\nprostitution, and neither subsection (c)(1) nor\r\n(c)(2) is applicable, apply §2A3.2 (Criminal\r\nSexual Abuse of a Minor Under the Age of\r\nSixteen Years (Statutory Rape) or Attempt to\r\nCommit Such Acts) or §2A3.4 (Abusive Sexual\r\nContact or Attempt to Commit Abusive Sexual\r\nContact), as appropriate.\r\n(d) Special Instruction\r\n(1) If the offense involved more than one victim,\r\nChapter Three, Part D (Multiple Counts) shall be\r\napplied as if the promoting of prostitution or\r\nprohibited sexual conduct in respect to each victim\r\nhad been contained in a separate count of\r\nconviction.\r\nCommentary\r\nStatutory Provisions: 8 U.S.C. § 1328; 18 U.S.C. §§ 2421, 2422, 2423(a), 2425.\r\nApplication Notes:\r\n1. For purposes of this guideline—\r\n‘Minor’ means an individual who had not attained the age of 18 years.\r\n‘Participant’ has the meaning given that term in Application Note 1 of\r\n§3B1.1 (Aggravating Role).\r\nAmendment 592 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003\r\n\r\n‘Prohibited sexual conduct’ has the meaning given that term in Application\r\nNote 1 of §2A3.1 (Criminal Sexual Abuse; Attempt to Commit Criminal\r\nSexual Abuse).\r\n‘Promoting prostitution’ means persuading, inducing, enticing, or coercing\r\na person to engage in prostitution, or to travel to engage in, prostitution.\r\n‘Victim’ means a person transported, persuaded, induced, enticed, or\r\ncoerced to engage in, or travel for the purpose of engaging in, prostitution\r\nor prohibited sexual conduct, whether or not the person consented to the\r\nprostitution or prohibited sexual conduct. Accordingly, ‘victim’ may\r\ninclude an undercover law enforcement officer.\r\n2. Subsection (b)(1) provides an enhancement for physical force, or coercion,\r\nthat occurs as part of a prostitution offense and anticipates no bodily injury.\r\nIf bodily injury results, an upward departure may be warranted. See\r\nChapter Five, Part K (Departures). For purposes of subsection (b)(1),\r\n‘coercion’ includes any form of conduct that negates the voluntariness of\r\nthe behavior of the victim. This enhancement would apply, for example, in\r\na case in which the ability of the victim to appraise or control conduct was\r\nsubstantially impaired by drugs or alcohol. In the case of an adult victim,\r\nrather than a victim less than 18 years of age, this characteristic generally\r\nwill not apply if the drug or alcohol was voluntarily taken.\r\n3. For the purposes of §3B1.1 (Aggravating Role), a victim, as defined in this\r\nguideline, is considered a participant only if that victim assisted in the\r\npromoting of prostitution or prohibited sexual conduct in respect to another\r\nvictim.\r\n4. For the purposes of Chapter Three, Part D (Multiple Counts), each person\r\ntransported, persuaded, induced, enticed, or coerced to engage in, or travel\r\nto engage in, prostitution or prohibited sexual conduct is to be treated as a\r\nseparate victim. Consequently, multiple counts involving more than one\r\nvictim are not to be grouped together under §3D1.2 (Groups of Closely-\r\nRelated Counts). In addition, subsection (d)(1) directs that if the relevant\r\nconduct of an offense of conviction includes the promoting of prostitution\r\nor prohibited sexual conduct in respect to more than one victim, whether\r\nspecifically cited in the count of conviction, each such victim shall be\r\ntreated as if contained in a separate count of conviction.\r\n5. Subsection (b)(3) is intended to have broad application and includes\r\noffenses involving a victim less than 18 years of age entrusted to the\r\ndefendant, whether temporarily or permanently. For example, teachers, day\r\ncare providers, baby-sitters, or other temporary caretakers are among those\r\nwho would be subject to this enhancement. In determining whether to\r\napply this enhancement, the court should look to the actual relationship that\r\nexisted between the defendant and the victim and not simply to the legal\r\nstatus of the defendant-victim relationship.\r\n6. If the enhancement in subsection (b)(3) applies, do not apply subsection\r\nNovember 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II Amendment 592\r\n\r\n(b)(4) or §3B1.3 (Abuse of Position of Trust or Use of Special Skill).\r\n7. The enhancement in subsection (b)(4)(A) applies in cases involving the\r\nmisrepresentation of a participant’s identity to persuade, induce, entice,\r\ncoerce, or facilitate the travel of, a minor to engage in prostitution.\r\nSubsection (b)(4)(A) is intended to apply only to misrepresentations made\r\ndirectly to a minor or to a person who exercises custody, care, or\r\nsupervisory control of the minor. Accordingly, the enhancement in\r\nsubsection (b)(4)(A) would not apply to a misrepresentation made by a\r\nparticipant to an airline representative in the course of making travel\r\narrangements for the minor.\r\nThe misrepresentation to which the enhancement in subsection (b)(4)(A)\r\nmay apply includes misrepresentation of a participant’s name, age,\r\noccupation, gender, or status, as long as the misrepresentation was made\r\nwith the intent to persuade, induce, entice, coerce, or facilitate the travel of,\r\na minor to engage in prostitution. Accordingly, use of a computer screen\r\nname, without such intent, would not be a sufficient basis for application of\r\nthe enhancement.\r\nIn determining whether subsection (b)(4)(B) applies, the court should\r\nclosely consider the facts of the case to determine whether a participant’s\r\ninfluence over the minor compromised the voluntariness of the minor’s\r\nbehavior.\r\nIn a case in which a participant is at least 10 years older than the minor,\r\nthere shall be a rebuttable presumption, for purposes of subsection\r\n(b)(4)(B), that such participant unduly influenced the minor to engage in\r\nprostitution. In such a case, some degree of undue influence can be\r\npresumed because of the substantial difference in age between the\r\nparticipant and the minor.\r\n8. Subsection (b)(5) provides an enhancement if a computer or an Internet-\r\naccess device was used to (A) persuade, induce, entice, coerce, or facilitate\r\nthe travel of, a minor to engage in prostitution; or (B) entice, encourage,\r\noffer, or solicit a person to engage in prohibited sexual conduct with a\r\nminor. Subsection (b)(5)(A) is intended to apply only to the use of a\r\ncomputer or an Internet-access device to communicate directly with a minor\r\nor with a person who exercises custody, care, or supervisory control of the\r\nminor. Accordingly, the enhancement in subsection (b)(5)(A) would not\r\napply to the use of a computer or an Internet-access device to obtain airline\r\ntickets for the minor from an airline’s Internet site.\r\n9. The cross reference in subsection (c)(1) is to be construed broadly to\r\ninclude all instances in which the offense involved employing, using,\r\npersuading, inducing, enticing, coercing, transporting, permitting, or\r\noffering or seeking by notice or advertisement, a person less than 18 years\r\nof age to engage in sexually explicit conduct for the purpose of producing\r\nany visual depiction of such conduct. For purposes of subsection (c)(1),\r\n‘sexually explicit conduct’ has the meaning given that term in 18 U.S.C.\r\nAmendment 592 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003\r\n\r\n§ 2256.\r\n10. Subsection (c)(2) provides a cross reference to §2A3.1 (Criminal Sexual\r\nAbuse; Attempt to Commit Criminal Sexual Abuse) if the offense involved\r\ncriminal sexual abuse or attempt to commit criminal sexual abuse, as\r\ndefined in 18 U.S.C. § 2241 or § 2242. For example, the cross reference to\r\n§2A3.1 shall apply if the offense involved criminal sexual abuse; and (A)\r\nthe victim had not attained the age of 12 years (see 18 U.S.C. § 2241(c));\r\n(B) the victim had attained the age of 12 years but had not attained the age\r\nof 16 years, and was placed in fear of death, serious bodily injury, or\r\nkidnaping (see 18 U.S.C. § 2241(a),(c)); or (C) the victim was threatened\r\nor placed in fear other than fear of death, serious bodily injury, or kidnaping\r\n(see 18 U.S.C. § 2242(1)).\r\n11. The cross reference in subsection (c)(3) addresses the case in which the\r\noffense did not involve promoting prostitution, neither subsection (c)(1) nor\r\n(c)(2) is applicable, and the offense involved prohibited sexual conduct\r\nother than the conduct covered by subsection (c)(1) or (c)(2). In such case,\r\nthe guideline for the underlying prohibited sexual conduct is to be used; i.e.,\r\n§2A3.2 (Criminal Sexual Abuse of a Minor Under the Age of Sixteen Years\r\n(Statutory Rape) or Attempt to Commit Such Acts) or §2A3.4 (Abusive\r\nSexual Contact or Attempt to Commit Abusive Sexual Contact).\r\nBackground: This guideline covers offenses under chapter 117 of title 18, United\r\nStates Code. Those offenses involve promoting prostitution or prohibited sexual\r\nconduct through a variety of means. Offenses that involve promoting prostitution\r\nunder chapter 117 of such title are sentenced under this guideline, unless other\r\nprohibited sexual conduct occurs as part of the prostitution offense, in which case\r\none of the cross references would apply. Offenses under chapter 117 of such title\r\nthat do not involve promoting prostitution are to be sentenced under §2G2.1\r\n(Sexually Exploiting a Minor by Production of Sexually Explicit Visual or Printed\r\nMaterial; Custodian Permitting Minor to Engage in Sexually Explicit Conduct;\r\nAdvertisement for Minors to Engage in Production), §2A3.1 (Criminal Sexual\r\nAbuse; Attempt to Commit Criminal Sexual Abuse), §2A3.2 (Criminal Sexual\r\nAbuse of a Minor Under the Age of Sixteen Years (Statutory Rape) or Attempt to\r\nCommit Such Acts) or §2A3.4 (Abusive Sexual Contact or Attempt to Commit\r\nAbusive Sexual Contact), as appropriate, pursuant to the cross references provided\r\nin subsection (c).\".\r\nSection 2G2.1(b) is amended by striking subdivision (3) in its entirety and inserting the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\"(3) If, for the purpose of producing sexually explicit material, the offense\r\ninvolved (A) the knowing misrepresentation of a participant’s identity to\r\npersuade, induce, entice, coerce, or facilitate the travel of, a minor to engage\r\nsexually explicit conduct; or (B) the use of a computer or an Internet-access\r\ndevice to (i) persuade, induce, entice, coerce, or facilitate the travel of, a\r\nminor to engage in sexually explicit conduct, or to otherwise solicit\r\nparticipation by a minor in such conduct; or (ii) solicit participation with\r\na minor in sexually explicit conduct, increase by 2 levels.\".\r\nNovember 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II Amendment 592\r\n\r\nThe Commentary to §2G2.1 captioned \"Application Notes\" is amended by redesignating\r\nNotes 1 through 3 as Notes 2 through 4, respectively; by inserting before redesignated Note\r\n2 (formerly Note 1) the following:\r\n\"1. For purposes of this guideline, ‘minor’ means an individual who had not\r\nattained the age of 18 years.\";\r\nand by adding at the end the following:\r\n\"5.

Subsection\r\n(b)(3)(A) is intended to apply only to misrepresentations made directly to\r\na minor or to a person who exercises custody, care, or supervisory control\r\nof the minor. Accordingly, the enhancement in subsection (b)(3)(A) would\r\nnot apply to a misrepresentation made by a participant to an airline\r\nrepresentative in the course of making travel arrangements for the minor.\r\nThe misrepresentation to which the enhancement in subsection (b)(3)(A)\r\nmay apply includes misrepresentation of a participant’s name, age,\r\noccupation, gender, or status, as long as the misrepresentation was made\r\nwith the intent to persuade, induce, entice, coerce, or facilitate the travel of,\r\na minor to engage in sexually explicit conduct for the purpose of producing\r\nsexually explicit material. Accordingly, use of a computer screen name,\r\nwithout such intent, would not be a sufficient basis for application of the\r\nenhancement.\r\nSubsection (b)(3)(B)(i) provides an enhancement if a computer or an\r\nInternet-access device was used to persuade, induce, entice, coerce, or\r\nfacilitate the travel of, a minor to engage in sexually explicit conduct for the\r\npurpose of producing sexually explicit material or otherwise to solicit\r\nparticipation by a minor in such conduct for such purpose. Subsection\r\n(b)(3)(B)(i) is intended to apply only to the use of a computer or an\r\nInternet-access device to communicate directly with a minor or with a\r\nperson who exercises custody, care, or supervisory control of the minor.\r\nAccordingly, the enhancement would not apply to the use of a computer or\r\nan Internet-access device to obtain airline tickets for the minor from an\r\nairline’s Internet site.\".\r\nSection 2G2.2(b) is amended by striking subdivision (2) in its entirety and inserting the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\"(2) (Apply the Greatest) If the offense involved:\r\n(A) Distribution for pecuniary gain, increase by the number of levels\r\nfrom the table in §2F1.1 (Fraud and Deceit) corresponding to the\r\nretail value of the material, but by not less than 5 levels.\r\n(B) Distribution for the receipt, or expectation of receipt, of a thing of\r\nAmendment 592 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003\r\n\r\nvalue, but not for pecuniary gain, increase by 5 levels.\r\n(C) Distribution to a minor, increase by 5 levels.\r\n(D) Distribution to a minor that was intended to persuade, induce,\r\nentice, coerce, or facilitate the travel of, the minor to engage in\r\nprohibited sexual conduct, increase by 7 levels.\r\n(E) Distribution other than distribution described in subdivisions (A)\r\nthrough (D), increase by 2 levels.\".\r\nThe Commentary to §2G2.2 captioned \"Application Notes\" is amended by striking Note 1\r\nin its entirety and inserting the following:\r\n\"1.

The amendment is promulgated\r\nprimarily in response to the Protection of Children from Sexual Predators Act of 1998, Pub.\r\nL. 105–314 (the \"Act\"), which contained several directives to the Commission.\r\nFirst, the amendment addresses the Act’s directives to provide enhancements to the\r\nguidelines covering aggravated sexual abuse, sexual abuse, and sexual abuse of a minor if\r\n(1) the defendant used a computer with the intent to persuade, induce, entice, coerce, or\r\nfacilitate the transport of a minor to engage in any prohibited sexual activity; and (2) the\r\ndefendant knowingly misrepresented the defendant’s actual identity with the intent to\r\npersuade, induce, entice, coerce, or facilitate the transport of a minor to engage in any\r\nNovember 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II Amendment 592\r\n\r\nprohibited sexual conduct. The legislative history of the Act indicates congressional intent\r\nto ensure that persons who misrepresent themselves to a minor, or use computers or Internet-\r\naccess devices to locate and gain access to a minor, are severely punished.\r\nIn response to these directives, the amendment provides separate, cumulative two-level\r\nenhancements in the sexual abuse guidelines, §§2A3.2 (Criminal Sexual Abuse of a Minor\r\nUnder the Age of Sixteen Years (Statutory Rape) or Attempt to Commit Such Acts), 2A3.3\r\n(Criminal Sexual Abuse of a Ward), and 2A3.4 (Abusive Sexual Contact), and in §2G1.1\r\n(Promoting Prostitution or Prohibited Sexual Conduct) for (1) the use of a computer or\r\nInternet-access device with the intent to persuade, induce, entice, coerce, or facilitate the\r\ntransport of a minor to engage in any prohibited sexual conduct; and (2) misrepresentation\r\nof a criminally responsible person’s identity with such an intent. The Commission has\r\ndetermined that, for offenses sentenced under these guidelines, the use of a computer or\r\nInternet-access device and the misrepresentation of identity represent separate, additional\r\nharms and increase the culpability of a defendant or criminal participant who engages, or\r\nattempts to engage, in such conduct. With respect to §§2A3.1 (Criminal Sexual Abuse;\r\nAttempt to Commit Criminal Sexual Abuse) and 2G2.1 (Sexually Exploiting a Minor by\r\nProduction of Sexually Explicit Visual or Printed Material), the amendment treats these two\r\ntypes of aggravating conduct as alternative triggers for one enhancement. In these\r\nguidelines, the substantially higher base offense levels and other specific offense\r\ncharacteristics provide alternative guideline mechanisms to account, at least in part, for these\r\nharms and the defendant’s increased culpability. Accordingly, the Commission determined\r\nthat, in these guidelines, a single, two-level increase for the use of a computer or\r\nmisrepresentation adequately addresses the increased seriousness of these offenses.\r\nSecond, this amendment responds to the directive in the Act to provide a sentencing\r\nenhancement for offenses under chapter 117 of title 18, United States Code (relating to the\r\ntransportation of minors for illegal sexual activity), while ensuring that the sentences,\r\nguidelines, and policy statements for offenders convicted of such offenses are appropriately\r\nsevere and reasonably consistent with the other relevant directives and the relevant existing\r\nguidelines. In furtherance of this directive, the Commission initiated a comprehensive\r\nexamination of §§2A3.2 and 2G1.1, the guidelines under which most cases prosecuted under\r\nsuch chapter are sentenced. The Commission intends to continue its comprehensive review\r\nof these guidelines and other guidelines that cover chapter 117 offenses in the next\r\namendment cycle.\r\nThe amendment implements the directive to provide an enhancement for chapter 117\r\noffenses, in part, through the enhancements provided in §§2A3.2 and 2G1.1 for\r\nmisrepresentation of identity and use of a computer to facilitate such offenses. In addition,\r\nthe amendment provides an alternative basis for a sentencing enhancement if a participant\r\notherwise unduly influenced the victim to engage in prohibited sexual conduct. Despite the\r\nfact that §2A3.2 nominally applies to consensual sexual acts with a person who had not\r\nattained the age of 16 years, Commission data indicated that many of the cases sentenced\r\nunder §2A3.2, directly or via a cross reference from §2G1.1, involve some aspect of undue\r\ninfluence over the victim on the part of the defendant or other criminally responsible person.\r\nAnalysis of these cases revealed conduct such as coercion, enticement, or other forms of\r\nundue influence by the defendant that compromised the voluntariness of the victim’s\r\nbehavior and, accordingly, increased the defendant’s culpability for the crime. This prong\r\nof the new enhancement is designed to allow courts to consider closely the facts of the\r\nindividual case. Furthermore, a rebuttable presumption is created that the offense involved\r\nAmendment 592 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003\r\n\r\nundue influence if a participant was at least 10 years older than the victim. Data reviewed\r\nby the Commission suggested that such a presumption is appropriate because persons who\r\nare much older than a minor are frequently in a position to manipulate the minor due to\r\nincreased knowledge, influence, and resources.\r\nAs a result of the Commission’s comprehensive assessment of §§2A3.2 and 2G1.1, the\r\namendment also makes several other modifications to these guidelines. The amendment\r\nprovides, in §2A3.2, an alternative base offense level of level 18 if the offense involved a\r\nviolation of chapter 117 of title 18, United States Code. This alternative base offense level\r\nmore fully implements a directive in the Sex Crimes Against Children Prevention Act of\r\n1995, Pub. L. 104–71, to provide at least a three-level increase for offenses under 18 U.S.C.\r\n§ 2423(a) involving the transportation of minors for prostitution or other prohibited sexual\r\nconduct. However, the amendment also provides for a three-level decrease if a defendant\r\nreceives the higher alternative base offense level of level 18 and none of certain listed\r\naggravating specific offense characteristics apply. This reduction recognizes that not all\r\ndefendants convicted under chapter 117 have necessarily engaged in a more aggravated form\r\nof statutory rape conduct. The amendment also adds several definitions to §2A3.2, including\r\nclarifying that \"victim\" includes an undercover police officer who represents to the\r\nperpetrator of the offense that the officer was under the age of 16 years. This change was\r\nmade to ensure that offenders who are apprehended in an undercover operation are\r\nappropriately punished. In §2G1.1, the amendment reallocates, without substantive change,\r\nfive offense levels from subsection (b)(2) to the base offense level, for offenses involving\r\na minor. Section 2G1.1(b)(1) also is amended to clarify that the offense must have involved\r\nprostitution in order for the enhancement for coercion, threats, or drugs to apply. The\r\namendment also clarifies that, in §§2A3.2(c)(1) and 2G1.1(c)(2), the cross reference to\r\n§2A3.1 shall apply if the offense involved criminal sexual abuse of a minor under the age\r\nof 12 years, regardless of the \"consent\" of the victim. Review of Commission data indicated\r\nthat the cross reference to §2A3.1 currently is not being applied in many cases in which the\r\noffense conduct suggests it should. In both §§2A3.2 and 2G1.1, the amendment also\r\nprecludes application of the new enhancement for misrepresentation of identity and/or undue\r\ninfluence if the victim is in the custody, care, or supervisory control of the defendant.\r\nThird, the amendment addresses the directive in the Act to clarify that the term \"distribution\r\nof pornography\" applies to the distribution of pornography for both monetary remuneration\r\nand a non-pecuniary interest. In response to the directive, the amendment modifies the\r\nenhancement in §2G2.2 (Trafficking in Material Involving the Sexual Exploitation of a\r\nMinor), relating to the distribution of child pornographic material, as well as a similar\r\nenhancement in §2G3.1 (Importing, Mailing, or Transporting Obscene Matter; Transferring\r\nObscene Matter to a Minor), relating to the distribution of obscene material. For each of\r\nthese enhancements, the amendment (1) modifies the definition of \"distribution\" to mean any\r\nact, including production, transportation, and possession with intent to distribute, related to\r\nthe transfer of the material, regardless of whether it was for pecuniary gain; and (2) provides\r\nfor varying levels of enhancement depending upon the purpose and audience of the\r\ndistribution. These varying levels are intended to respond to increased congressional\r\nconcerns, as indicated in the legislative history of the Act, that pedophiles, including those\r\nwho use the Internet, are using child pornographic and obscene material to desensitize\r\nchildren to sexual activity, to convince children that sexual activity involving children is\r\nnormal, and to entice children to engage in sexual activity.\r\nFourth, the amendment clarifies the meaning of the term \"item\" in subsection (b)(2) of\r\n\r\n§2G2.4 (Possession of Materials Depicting a Minor Engaged in Sexually Explicit Conduct).\r\nThat subsection provides a two-level enhancement if the offense involved possession of ten\r\nor more items of child pornography. The amendment adopts the holding of all circuits that\r\nhave addressed the matter that a computer file qualifies as an item for purposes of the\r\nenhancement. The amendment also provides for an invited upward departure if the offense\r\ninvolves a large number of visual depictions of child pornography, regardless of the number\r\nof \"items\" involved. This provision invites courts to depart upward in cases in which a\r\nparticular item, such as a book or a computer file, contains an unusually large number of\r\npornographic images involving children.\r\nFifth, the amendment addresses the new offense of transferring obscene matter to a minor,\r\ncodified at 18 U.S.C. § 1470, by referencing the offense in the Statutory Index (Appendix\r\nA) to §2G3.1.\r\nSixth, the amendment addresses the new offense of prohibiting the knowing transmittal of\r\nidentifying information about minors for criminal sexual purposes, codified at 18 U.S.C.\r\n§ 2425, by referencing the new offense in the Statutory Index to §2G1.1.","EffectiveDate":"Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2000."},{"Id":594,"Title":"Amendment 594","Text":"Section 2B5.3, effective May 1, 2000 (see Amendment 590, supra), is\r\nrepromulgated, with minor editorial changes, as follows:\r\n\"§2B5.3.

For\r\nadditional statutory provision(s), see Appendix A (Statutory Index).\r\nApplication Notes:\r\n1. Definitions.—For purposes of this guideline:\r\n‘Commercial advantage or private financial gain’ means the receipt, or\r\nexpectation of receipt, of anything of value, including other protected\r\nworks.\r\n‘Infringed item’ means the copyrighted or trademarked item with respect to\r\nwhich the crime against intellectual property was committed.\r\n‘Infringing item’ means the item that violates the copyright or trademark\r\nlaws.\r\n‘Uploading’ means making an infringing item available on the Internet or\r\na similar electronic bulletin board with the intent to enable other persons to\r\ndownload or otherwise copy, or have access to, the infringing item.\r\n2. Determination of Infringement Amount.—This note applies to the\r\ndetermination of the infringement amount for purposes of subsection (b)(1).\r\n(A) Use of Retail Value of Infringed Item.—The infringement amount\r\nis the retail value of the infringed item, multiplied by the number\r\nof infringing items, in a case involving any of the following:\r\n(i) The infringing item (I) is, or appears to a reasonably\r\ninformed purchaser to be, identical or substantially\r\nequivalent to the infringed item; or (II) is a digital or\r\nelectronic reproduction of the infringed item.\r\n(ii) The retail price of the infringing item is not less than 75%\r\nof the retail price of the infringed item.\r\n(iii) The retail value of the infringing item is difficult or\r\nimpossible to determine without unduly complicating or\r\nprolonging the sentencing proceeding.\r\n(iv) The offense involves the illegal interception of a satellite\r\ncable transmission in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2511. (In a\r\ncase involving such an offense, the ‘retail value of the\r\ninfringed item’ is the price the user of the transmission\r\nwould have paid to lawfully receive that transmission, and\r\nthe ‘infringed item’ is the satellite transmission rather than\r\nthe intercepting device.)\r\nNovember 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II Amendment 593\r\n\r\n(v) The retail value of the infringed item provides a more\r\naccurate assessment of the pecuniary harm to the copyright\r\nor trademark owner than does the retail value of the\r\ninfringing item.\r\n(B) Use of Retail Value of Infringing Item.—The infringement amount\r\nis the retail value of the infringing item, multiplied by the number\r\nof infringing items, in any case not covered by subdivision (A) of\r\nthis Application Note, including a case involving the unlawful\r\nrecording of a musical performance in violation of 18 U.S.C.\r\n§ 2319A.\r\n(C) Retail Value Defined.—For purposes of this Application Note, the\r\n‘retail value’ of an infringed item or an infringing item is the retail\r\nprice of that item in the market in which it is sold.\r\n(D) Determination of Infringement Amount in Cases Involving a\r\nVariety of Infringing Items.—In a case involving a variety of\r\ninfringing items, the infringement amount is the sum of all\r\ncalculations made for those items under subdivisions (A) and (B)\r\nof this Application Note. For example, if the defendant sold both\r\ncounterfeit videotapes that are identical in quality to the infringed\r\nvideotapes and obviously inferior counterfeit handbags, the\r\ninfringement amount, for purposes of subsection (b)(1), is the sum\r\nof the infringement amount calculated with respect to the\r\ncounterfeit videotapes under subdivision (A)(i) (i.e., the quantity of\r\nthe infringing videotapes multiplied by the retail value of the\r\ninfringed videotapes) and the infringement amount calculated with\r\nrespect to the counterfeit handbags under subdivision (B) (i.e., the\r\nquantity of the infringing handbags multiplied by the retail value\r\nof the infringing handbags).\r\n3. Uploading.—With respect to uploading, subsection (b)(2) applies only to\r\nuploading with the intent to enable other persons to download or otherwise\r\ncopy, or have access to, the infringing item. For example, this subsection\r\napplies in the case of illegally uploading copyrighted software to an Internet\r\nsite, but it does not apply in the case of downloading or installing that\r\nsoftware on a hard drive on the defendant’s personal computer.\r\n4. Application of §3B1.3.—If the defendant de-encrypted or otherwise\r\ncircumvented a technological security measure to gain initial access to an\r\ninfringed item, an adjustment under §3B1.3 (Abuse of Position of Trust or\r\nUse of Special Skill) shall apply.\r\n5. Upward Departure Considerations.—If the offense level determined under\r\nthis guideline substantially understates the seriousness of the offense, an\r\nupward departure may be warranted. The following is a non-exhaustive list\r\nof factors that the court may consider in determining whether an upward\r\ndeparture may be warranted:\r\nAmendment 593 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003\r\n\r\n(A) The offense involved substantial harm to the reputation of the\r\ncopyright or trademark owner.\r\n(B) The offense was committed in connection with, or in furtherance\r\nof, the criminal activities of a national, or international, organized\r\ncriminal enterprise.\r\nBackground: This guideline treats copyright and trademark violations much like\r\ntheft and fraud. Similar to the sentences for theft and fraud offenses, the sentences\r\nfor defendants convicted of intellectual property offenses should reflect the nature\r\nand magnitude of the pecuniary harm caused by their crimes. Accordingly, similar\r\nto the loss enhancement in the theft and fraud guidelines, the infringement amount\r\nin subsection (b)(1) serves as a principal factor in determining the offense level for\r\nintellectual property offenses.\r\nSubsection (b)(1) implements section 2(g) of the No Electronic Theft (NET)\r\nAct of 1997, Pub. L. 105–147, by using the retail value of the infringed item,\r\nmultiplied by the number of infringing items, to determine the pecuniary harm for\r\ncases in which use of the retail value of the infringed item is a reasonable estimate\r\nof that harm. For cases referred to in Application Note 2(B), the Commission\r\ndetermined that use of the retail value of the infringed item would overstate the\r\npecuniary harm or otherwise be inappropriate. In these types of cases, use of the\r\nretail value of the infringing item, multiplied by the number of those items, is a more\r\nreasonable estimate of the resulting pecuniary harm.\r\nSection 2511 of title 18, United States Code, as amended by the Electronic\r\nCommunications Act of 1986, prohibits the interception of satellite transmission for\r\npurposes of direct or indirect commercial advantage or private financial gain. Such\r\nviolations are similar to copyright offenses and are therefore covered by this\r\nguideline.\".","Reason":"Reason for Amendment: This amendment is in response to section 2(g) of the No\r\nElectronic Theft (NET) Act of 1997, Pub. L. 105–147 (\"the Act\"). The Act directs the\r\nCommission to ensure that the applicable guideline range for intellectual property offenses\r\n(including offenses set forth at section 506(a) of title 17, United States Code, and sections\r\n2319, 2319A, and 2320 of title 18, United States Code) is \"sufficiently stringent to deter such\r\na crime.\" It also more specifically requires that the guidelines \"provide for consideration of\r\nthe retail value and quantity of the items with respect to which the intellectual property\r\noffense was committed.\"\r\nThe amendment responds to the directives by making changes to the monetary calculation\r\nfound in §2B5.3 (Criminal Infringement of Copyright or Trademark). In addition, the\r\namendment makes a number of other modifications to the infringement guideline, including\r\nthe addition of several mitigating and aggravating factors, as further means of providing just\r\nand proportionate punishment while also seeking to achieve sufficient deterrence.\r\nThe monetary calculation in §2B5.3(b)(1), similar to the loss enhancement in the theft and\r\nfraud guidelines, serves as an approximation of the pecuniary harm caused by the offense\r\nand is a principal factor in determining the offense level for intellectual property offenses.\r\nPrior to this amendment, the monetary calculation for all intellectual property crimes was\r\n\r\nbased on the retail value of the infringing item multiplied by the quantity of infringing items.\r\nIn response to the directive, the Commission refashioned this enhancement so as to use the\r\nretail value of the infringed item, multiplied by the number of infringing items, as a means\r\nof approximating the pecuniary harm for cases in which that calculation is believed most\r\nlikely to provide a reasonable estimate of the resulting harm. Use of that calculation is\r\nbelieved to provide a reasonable approximation for those classes of infringement cases in\r\nwhich it is highly likely that the sale of an infringing item results in a displaced sale of the\r\nlegitimate, infringed item. The amendment also requires that the retail value of the infringed\r\nitem, multiplied by the number of infringing items, be used in certain other cases for reasons\r\nof practicality.\r\nHowever, based upon a review of cases sentenced under the former §2B5.3 over two years,\r\nthe Commission further determined that using the above formula likely would overstate\r\nsubstantially the pecuniary harm caused to copyright and trademark owners in some cases\r\ncurrently sentenced under the guideline. For those cases, a one-to-one correlation between\r\nthe sale of infringing items and the displaced sale of legitimate, infringed items is unlikely\r\nbecause the inferior quality of the infringing item and/or the greatly discounted price at\r\nwhich it is sold suggests that many purchasers of infringing items would not, or could not,\r\nhave purchased the infringed item in the absence of the availability of the infringing item.\r\nThe Commission therefore determined that, for these latter classes of cases (referred to in\r\nApplication Note 2(B)), the retail value of the infringing item, multiplied by the number of\r\nthose items, provides a more reasonable approximation of lost revenues to the copyright or\r\ntrademark owner, and hence, of the pecuniary harm resulting from the offense.\r\nThis amendment also increases the base offense level from level 6 to level 8. The two-level\r\nincrease in the base offense level brings the infringement guideline more in line with offense\r\nlevels that would pertain under §2F1.1 (Fraud and Deceit), assuming applicability under that\r\nguideline of the two-level enhancement for more than minimal planning. Based on a review\r\nof cases sentenced under the infringement guideline, if a more than minimal planning\r\nenhancement did exist in that guideline, it would apply in the vast majority of such cases\r\nbecause they involve this kind of aggravating conduct. Rather than provide a separate\r\nenhancement within the revised guideline for \"more than minimal planning\" conduct, the\r\nCommission determined that the infringement guideline should incorporate this type of\r\nconduct into the base offense level.\r\nThis amendment also provides an enhancement of two levels, and a minimum offense level\r\nof level 12, if the offense involved the manufacture, importation, or uploading of infringing\r\nitems. The Commission determined that defendants who engage in such conduct are more\r\nculpable than other intellectual property offenders because they place infringing items into\r\nthe stream of commerce, thereby enabling others to infringe the copyright or trademark. A\r\nreview of cases sentenced under the guideline indicated applicability of this enhancement\r\nto approximately two-thirds of the cases.\r\nThis amendment also provides a two-level downward adjustment (but to a resulting offense\r\nlevel that is not less than offense level 8) if the offense was not committed for commercial\r\nadvantage or private financial gain. This adjustment reflects the fact that the Act establishes\r\nlower statutory penalties for offenses that were not committed for commercial advantage or\r\nprivate financial gain.\r\nThis amendment also provides an enhancement of two levels, and a minimum offense level\r\nAmendment 593 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003\r\n\r\nof level 13, if the offense involved the conscious or reckless risk of serious bodily injury or\r\npossession of a dangerous weapon in connection with the offense. Testimony received by\r\nthe Commission indicated that the conscious or reckless risk of serious bodily injury may\r\noccur in some cases involving counterfeit consumer products. The Commission determined\r\nthat this kind of aggravating conduct in connection with infringement cases should be treated\r\nunder the guidelines in the same way it is treated in connection with fraud cases; therefore,\r\nthis enhancement is consistent with an identical provision in the fraud guideline.\r\nThe amendment also contains an application note expressly providing that the adjustment\r\nin §3B1.3 (Abuse of Position of Trust or Use of Special Skill) shall apply if the defendant\r\nde-encrypted or otherwise circumvented a technological security measure to gain initial\r\naccess to an infringed item. As stated in the background commentary to §3B1.3, persons\r\nwho use such a special skill to facilitate or commit a crime generally are viewed as more\r\nculpable.\r\nFinally, this amendment contains two encouraged upward departure provisions. The\r\nCommission received public comment that indicated that infringement may cause substantial\r\nharm to the reputation of the copyright or trademark owner that is not accounted for in the\r\nmonetary calculation. Public comment also indicated that some copyright and trademark\r\noffenses are committed in connection with, or in furtherance of, the criminal activities of\r\ncertain organized crime enterprises. The amendment invites the court to consider an\r\nappropriate upward departure if either of these aggravating circumstances are present.\r\nPursuant to the emergency amendment authority of the Act, this amendment previously was\r\npromulgated as a temporary measure effective May 1, 2000.

This subsection focuses principally on an aggravated form of identity\r\ntheft known as ‘affirmative identity theft’ or ‘breeding,’ in which a defendant uses\r\nanother individual’s name, social security number, or some other form of\r\nidentification (the ‘means of identification’) to ‘breed’ (i.e., produce or obtain) new\r\nor additional forms of identification. Because 18 U.S.C. § 1028(d) broadly defines\r\n‘means of identification,’ the new or additional forms of identification can include\r\nitems such as a driver’s license, a credit card, or a bank loan. This subsection\r\nprovides a minimum offense level of level 12, in part, because of the seriousness of\r\nthe offense. The minimum offense level accounts for the fact that the means of\r\nidentification that were ‘bred’ (i.e., produced or obtained) often are within the\r\ndefendant’s exclusive control, making it difficult for the individual victim to detect\r\nthat the victim’s identity has been ‘stolen.’ Generally, the victim does not become\r\nNovember 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II Amendment 596\r\n\r\naware of the offense until certain harms have already occurred (e.g., a damaged\r\ncredit rating or inability to obtain a loan). The minimum offense level also accounts\r\nfor the non-monetary harm associated with these types of offenses, much of which\r\nmay be difficult or impossible to quantify (e.g., harm to the individual’s reputation\r\nor credit rating, inconvenience, and other difficulties resulting from the offense).\r\nThe legislative history of the Identity Theft and Assumption Deterrence Act of 1998\r\nindicates that Congress was especially concerned with providing increased\r\npunishment for this type of harm.\r\nSubsection (b)(6) implements, in a broader form, the instruction to the\r\nCommission in section 6(c)(2) of Public Law 105–184.\r\nSubsection (b)(7)(B) implements, in a broader form, the instruction to the\r\nCommission in section 110512 of Public Law 103–322.\r\nSubsection (b)(8)(A) implements, in a broader form, the instruction to the\r\nCommission in section 961(m) of Public Law 101–73.\r\nSubsection (b)(8)(B) implements the instruction to the Commission in\r\nsection 2507 of Public Law 101–647.\r\nSubsection (c) implements the instruction to the Commission in section\r\n805(c) of Public Law 104–132.\".","Reason":"Reason for Amendment: This is a five-part amendment. First, this amendment provides\r\na two-level increase and a minimum offense level of level 12 for offenses involving (1) the\r\npossession or use of equipment that is used to manufacture access devices; (2) the production\r\nof, or trafficking in, unauthorized and counterfeit access devices, such as stolen credit cards\r\nand cloned wireless telephones; or (3) affirmative identity theft (i.e., unlawfully producing\r\nfrom any means of identification any other means of identification). Affirmative identity\r\ntheft, referred to in the research and analysis conducted by the Commission as the \"breeding\"\r\nof identification means, will result in an enhanced penalty in any case in which there is a\r\ntransfer or use of another person’s means of identification unlawfully to produce or \"breed\"\r\nadditional means of identification, or in which there is the possession of five or more means\r\nof identification that were unlawfully produced.\r\nSecond, this amendment provides a rebuttable presumption that the offense involved more\r\nthan minimal planning, and it contains a rule to avoid \"double counting\" between the\r\nexisting enhancement for \"sophisticated means\" based on the same conduct.\r\nThird, the amendment provides a revised minimum loss rule for offenses involving\r\ncounterfeit or unauthorized access devices. Specifically, this rule requires that a minimum\r\nloss amount of $500 per access device be used when calculating the loss involved in the\r\noffense. However, for offenses that involve only the possession, and not the use, of a means\r\nof telecommunications access that identifies a specific telecommunications instrument or\r\ntelecommunications account (e.g., an ESN/MIN pair used to obtain telecommunications\r\nservice in a wireless telephone), the rule provides a minimum loss amount of $100 per\r\nunused means.\r\nFourth, this amendment provides an encouraged upward departure if the offense level does\r\nAmendment 596 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003\r\n\r\nnot adequately reflect the seriousness of the offense conduct. Examples of cases in which\r\na departure may be warranted include those in which (1) an identity theft caused substantial\r\nharm to the victim’s reputation or credit record; (2) an individual is arrested, or is denied a\r\njob, because of a misidentification that results from an identity theft; or (3) a defendant\r\nessentially assumed the victim’s identity.\r\nFifth, this amendment incorporates the statutory definitions of 18 U.S.C. §§ 1028 and 1029,\r\nalthough it also broadens the definitions of \"counterfeit access device\" and \"device-making\r\nequipment\" for guideline purposes.\r\nThis amendment responds to the directives to the Commission contained in section 4 of the\r\nIdentity Theft and Assumption Deterrence Act of 1998, Pub. L. 105–318(b)(1) (\"ITADA\")\r\nand section 2 of the Wireless Telephone Protection Act, Pub. L. 105–172 (\"WTPA\"). For\r\nthe reasons discussed below and because of the overlap in some of the statutory definitions\r\nin the ITADA and the WTPA (particularly \"access device,\" \"telecommunication identifying\r\ninformation,\" and \"means of identification\"), enhancements have been consolidated into a\r\nsingle guideline amendment.\r\nThe ITADA and the WTPA directed the Commission to \"review and amend the Federal\r\nsentencing guidelines and the policy statements of the Commission\" to provide appropriate\r\npunishment for identity theft offenses under 18 U.S.C. § 1028 and for offenses under 18\r\nU.S.C. § 1029 related to the cloning of wireless telephones.\r\nThe WTPA directed the Commission to review, among other factors, \"the range of conduct\r\ncovered by\" cloning offenses. Although cloned telephones may be possessed and used in\r\nconnection with a variety of offenses, the Commission determined that the possession or use\r\nof a cloned phone does not necessarily increase the seriousness of the underlying offense.\r\nHowever, the Commission decided that offenders who manufacture or distribute cloned\r\ntelephones are more culpable than offenders who only possess them. Accordingly, the new\r\nenhancements at §2F1.1(b)(5)(A) and (B) recognize that such offenders warrant greater\r\npunishment. However, to ensure that the guidelines apply consistently to similarly serious\r\nconduct regardless of the technology employed, this amendment provides for a broader\r\nenhancement that applies to the manufacture or distribution of any access device, including\r\na cloned telephone.\r\nThe ITADA directed the Commission to assess certain specific factors in its consideration\r\nof appropriate penalties for identity theft, including: the number of victims; the harm to a\r\nvictim’s reputation and inconvenience caused by the offense; the number of means of\r\nidentification, identification documents, or false identification documents involved in the\r\noffense; the range of offense conduct; and, the adequacy of the value of loss to an individual\r\nvictim as a measure for establishing penalties.\r\nIn conducting research pursuant to the ITADA, the Commission learned that identity theft,\r\nas defined broadly under the new statutory provisions at 18 U.S.C. §§ 1028(a)(7) and\r\n1028(d)(3), occurs along a continuum of offense conduct. The most basic type of identity\r\ntheft occurs when a thief steals a wallet and uses a stolen credit card to make a purchase or\r\nforges a signature to cash a stolen check. However, after analyzing the legislative history\r\nof the ITADA and Commission data, the Commission determined that the more aggravated\r\nand sophisticated forms of identity theft, about which Congress seemed particularly\r\nconcerned, should be the focus of enhanced punishment under the guidelines. Such offense\r\n\r\nconduct, which generally occurs within the context of financial and credit account take-\r\novers, involves affirmative activity to generate or \"breed\" another level of identification\r\nmeans without the knowledge of the individual victim whose identification means are\r\nmisused, purloined, or \"taken over\". This activity is considered more sophisticated because\r\nof the additional steps the perpetrator takes to \"breed\" additional means of identification in\r\norder to conceal and continue the fraudulent conduct. Such sophisticated conduct makes\r\ndetection by both the individual and institutional victims much more difficult. It also has the\r\npotential to increase harm, both monetary and non-monetary, to the individual victims (about\r\nwhom Congress was particularly concerned in enacting the ITADA), and can result in\r\nsubstantial disruption of record-keeping by governmental agencies and private financial\r\ninstitutions upon which the stream of commerce depends. Thus, the Commission determined\r\nthat this aggravated offense conduct, in contrast to the most basic forms of identity theft,\r\nmerits enhanced punishment.\r\nAccordingly, amended section §2F1.1(b)(5)(C) recognizes that the conduct of generating or\r\n\"breeding\" identification means warrants substantial additional penalties. The minimum\r\noffense level of level 12 accounts for the fact that the defendant in an identity theft case\r\ntypically has exclusive control over the \"bred\" means of identification, making it difficult\r\nfor the individual victim to detect that the victim’s identity has been stolen until substantial\r\nharms (e.g., a damaged credit rating) have occurred. The minimum offense level also\r\naccounts for the non-monetary harms associated with identity theft (e.g., harm to reputation\r\nor credit rating), which typically are difficult to quantify. However, for cases in which the\r\nnature and scope of the harm to an individual victim is so egregious that the two-level\r\nenhancement and minimum offense level provide insufficient punishment, the amendment\r\ninvites an upward departure.\r\nThe WTPA directed the Commission to review \"the extent to which the value of the loss\r\ncaused by the offenses. . . is an adequate measure for establishing penalties. . . .\" The\r\namendment provides a minimum loss rule in §2F1.1 that extends to all access devices, not\r\njust to cloned wireless telephones. In so doing, similar fraud cases will be treated similarly\r\nregardless of the technology or type of access device used in the offense. Additionally, the\r\nCommission’s research and data supported increasing the minimum loss amount, previously\r\nprovided only in §2B1.1 (Larceny, Embezzlement, and Other Forms of Theft), from $100\r\nto $500 per access device. However, the data were insufficient to support using this\r\nincreased amount in cases that involve only the possession, and not the use, of means of\r\ntelecommunications access that identify a specific telecommunications instrument or account\r\n(e.g., ESN/MIN pairs of wireless telephones). (An example of such a case is a defendant\r\nwho possesses a list of ESN/MIN pairs but has not used any of those pairs to clone wireless\r\ntelephones.) For such cases, the Commission decided that the minimum loss amount should\r\nbe $100 per unused means.","EffectiveDate":"Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2000."},{"Id":598,"Title":"Amendment 598","Text":"Section 2F1.1(b), as amended by Amendment 595 (see supra), is further\r\namended in subdivision (4) by striking \"; or\" after \"agency\" and inserting a semicolon; by\r\ninserting \"a misrepresentation or other fraudulent action during the course of a bankruptcy\r\nproceeding; or (C) a\" after \"(B)\"; and by inserting \"prior, specific\" before \"judicial\".\r\nThe Commentary to §2F1.1 captioned \"Application Notes\", as amended by Amendment 595\r\n(see supra), is further amended by striking Note 6 in its entirety and inserting the following:\r\nAmendment 596 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003\r\n\r\n\"6.

Compare United States v.

Carrozella, 105 F. 3d 796 (2d Cir. 1997) (district court erred in enhancing\r\nthe sentence for violation of judicial process in the case of a defendant who filed false\r\naccounts in probate court).\r\nThe majority of circuits have held that the current enhancement applies to a defendant who\r\n\r\nconceals assets in a bankruptcy case because the conduct violates a judicial order or violates\r\njudicial process. Commission data indicate that, in fiscal year 1998, 41 defendants received\r\nan increase for either \"violation of a judicial order . . . or misrepresentation of a charitable\r\norganization.\" The data did not distinguish between the two parts of the enhancement.\r\nThis amendment creates a separate and distinct basis for a two-level enhancement under the\r\nfraud guideline for a misrepresentation or false statement made in the course of a bankruptcy\r\nproceeding. Additionally, the existing enhancement and its accompanying commentary are\r\nmodified to make clear that, in order for the enhancement to apply in a fraud case not\r\ninvolving a bankruptcy proceeding, there must be a false statement in violation of a specific,\r\nprior order. Therefore, any case involving a bankruptcy fraud will result in a two-level\r\nenhancement, but in the case of a non-bankruptcy fraud, the enhancement will apply only\r\nif a defendant was given prior notice of a particular action.

Accordingly, the guideline\r\nsentence for a defendant convicted under 18 U.S.C. § 844(h) is the term\r\nrequired by the statute, and the guideline sentence for a defendant convicted\r\nunder 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) or § 929(a) is the minimum term required by the\r\nrelevant statute. Each of 18 U.S.C. §§ 844(h), 924(c), and 929(a) requires\r\na term of imprisonment imposed under this section to run consecutively to\r\nany other term of imprisonment.\r\nA sentence above the minimum term required by 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) or\r\nAmendment 598 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003\r\n\r\n§ 929(a) is an upward departure from the guideline sentence. A departure\r\nmay be warranted, for example, to reflect the seriousness of the defendant’s\r\ncriminal history, particularly in a case in which the defendant is convicted\r\nof an 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) or § 929(a) offense and has at least two prior\r\nfelony convictions for a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense\r\nthat would have resulted in application of §4B1.1 (Career Offender) if that\r\nguideline applied to these offenses. See Application Note 3.\".\r\nThe Commentary to §2K2.4 captioned \"Background\" is amended by striking the first\r\nsentence in its entirety and inserting the following:\r\n\"Section 844(h) of title 18, United States Code, provides a mandatory term of\r\nimprisonment. Sections 924(c) and 929(a) of title 18, United States Code, provide\r\nmandatory minimum terms of imprisonment.

The Act to\r\nThrottle the Criminal Use of Guns, Pub. L. 105–386, changed the penalty provisions in 18\r\nU.S.C. § 924(c) from fixed terms of years to ranges of \"not less than\" various terms of years.\r\nThis effectively establishes mandatory minimum terms of imprisonment with implicit\r\nmaximum terms of life. Section 929(a) of title 18, United States Code, contains similar\r\nprovisions. Section 2K2.4 continues to provide that, in both cases, the term of imprisonment\r\nimposed under the statute should be determined independently of the usual guideline\r\napplication rules and the sentence imposed should run consecutively to any other term of\r\nimprisonment. See §5G1.2(a). However, §2K2.4 previously stated that the term of\r\nimprisonment was that \"required by statute.\" Because two of the statutes indexed to the\r\nguideline now provide for terms of a range of years, questions arose as to whether any\r\nsentence within the statutorily authorized range complied with the guidelines.\r\nThe amendment clarifies that the guideline sentence is the minimum term required by the\r\nstatute of conviction, that a term greater than this minimum is an upward departure and\r\nshould be imposed using the normal standards and procedures that apply to departures from\r\nthe guideline range, and that such upward departures are invited under certain circumstances.\r\nSee 18 U.S.C. § 3553(b). For example, career offenders who are convicted both of an\r\n\r\noffense under 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) and of an underlying crime of violence or drug trafficking\r\ntypically will receive lengthy guideline sentences. This amendment modifies Application\r\nNote 1 of §2K2.4 to encourage an upward departure in the unusual circumstance in which\r\nan offender is convicted only of 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) and would have qualified as a career\r\noffender if that guideline applied to such convictions, or in other unusual circumstances in\r\nwhich the sentence in a particular case does not adequately reflect the seriousness of the\r\ndefendant’s criminal history. Because 18 U.S.C. § 844(h) still provides for fixed terms of\r\nimprisonment, the amendment differentiates it from the two statutes that provide for terms\r\nof a range of years.\r\nThe amendment also contains technical and conforming changes: §§3D1.1 (Procedure for\r\nDetermining Offense Level on Multiple Counts) and 5G1.2 (Sentencing on Multiple Counts\r\nof Conviction) are revised to reflect a change to the penalty provision of 18 U.S.C. § 924(c).","EffectiveDate":"Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2000."},{"Id":600,"Title":"Amendment 600","Text":"The Commentary to §2K2.4 captioned \"Application Notes\" is amended in\r\nNote 2 in the second paragraph by striking \"paragraph\" after \"preceding\" and inserting\r\n\"paragraphs\"; and by striking the first paragraph in its entirety and inserting the following:\r\n\"If a sentence under this guideline is imposed in conjunction with a sentence for an\r\nunderlying offense, do not apply any specific offense characteristic for possession,\r\nbrandishing, use, or discharge of an explosive or firearm when determining the\r\nsentence for the underlying offense. A sentence under this guideline accounts for\r\nany explosive or weapon enhancement for the underlying offense of conviction,\r\nincluding any such enhancement that would apply based on conduct for which the\r\ndefendant is accountable under §1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct). Do not apply any\r\nweapon enhancement in the guideline for the underlying offense, for example, if (A)\r\na co-defendant, as part of the jointly undertaken criminal activity, possessed a\r\nfirearm different from the one for which the defendant was convicted under 18\r\nU.S.C. § 924(c); or (B) in an ongoing drug trafficking offense, the defendant\r\npossessed a firearm other than the one for which the defendant was convicted under\r\n18 U.S.C. § 924(c). However, if a defendant is convicted of two armed bank\r\nrobberies, but is convicted under 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) in connection with only one of\r\nthe robberies, a weapon enhancement would apply to the bank robbery which was\r\nnot the basis for the 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) conviction.\r\nIf the explosive or weapon that was possessed, brandished, used, or discharged in\r\nthe course of the underlying offense also results in a conviction that would subject\r\nthe defendant to an enhancement under §2K1.3(b)(3) (pertaining to possession of\r\nexplosive material in connection with another felony offense) or §2K2.1(b)(5)\r\n(pertaining to possession of any firearm or ammunition in connection with another\r\nfelony offense), do not apply that enhancement. A sentence under this guideline\r\naccounts for the conduct covered by these enhancements because of the relatedness\r\nof that conduct to the conduct that forms the basis for the conviction under 18\r\nU.S.C. § 844(h), § 924(c) or § 929(a). For example, if in addition to a conviction\r\nfor an underlying offense of armed bank robbery, the defendant was convicted of\r\nbeing a felon in possession under 18 U.S.C. § 922(g), the enhancement under\r\nAmendment 599 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003\r\n\r\n§2K2.1(b)(5) would not apply.\".\r\nThe Commentary to §2K2.4 captioned \"Application Notes\", as amended by Amendment 600\r\n(see supra), is further amended in Note 5 (formerly Note 4) in the third sentence by inserting\r\n\"brandishing,\" after \"possession,\".\r\nThe Commentary to §2K2.4 captioned \"Background\" is amended in the second sentence by\r\ninserting \"brandishing,\" after \"use,\".","Reason":"Reason for Amendment: This amendment expands the commentary in Application Note\r\n2 of §2K2.4 (Use of Firearm, Armor-Piercing Ammunition, or Explosive During or in\r\nRelation to Certain Crimes) to clarify under what circumstances defendants sentenced for\r\nviolations of 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) in conjunction with convictions for other offenses may\r\nreceive weapon enhancements contained in the guidelines for those other offenses. The\r\namendment directs that no guideline weapon enhancement should be applied when\r\ndetermining the sentence for the crime of violence or drug trafficking offense underlying the\r\n18 U.S.C. § 924(c) conviction, nor for any conduct with respect to that offense for which the\r\ndefendant is accountable under §1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct). Guideline weapon\r\nenhancements may be applied, however, when determining the sentence for counts of\r\nconviction outside the scope of relevant conduct for the underlying offense (e.g., a\r\nconviction for a second armed bank robbery for which no 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) conviction was\r\nobtained).\r\nFor similar reasons, this amendment also expands the application note to clarify that\r\noffenders who receive a sentence under §2K2.4 should not receive enhancements under\r\n§2K1.3(b)(3) (pertaining to explosive material connected with another offense), or\r\n§2K2.1(b)(5) (pertaining to firearms or ammunition possessed, used, or transferred in\r\nconnection with another offense) with respect to any weapon, ammunition, or explosive\r\nconnected to the offense underlying the count of conviction sentenced under §2K2.4.\r\nThe purposes of this amendment are to (1) avoid unwarranted disparity and duplicative\r\npunishment; and (2) conform application of guideline weapon enhancements with general\r\nguideline principles. The relevant application note to §2K2.4 previously stated that if a\r\nsentence was imposed under §2K2.4 in conjunction with a sentence for \"an underlying\r\noffense,\" no weapon enhancement should be applied with respect to the guideline for the\r\nunderlying offense. Some courts interpreted \"underlying offense\" narrowly to mean only\r\nthe \"crime of violence\" or \"drug trafficking offense\" that forms the basis for the 18 U.S.C.\r\n§ 924(c) conviction. See, e.g., United States v. Flennory,145 F.3d 1264, 1268-69 (11th Cir.\r\n1998), cert. denied, 119 S.Ct. 1130 (1999). But see United States v. Smith, 196 F.3d 676,\r\n679-82 (6th Cir. 1999) (a conviction under 18 U.S.C. § 922(g) qualifies as an \"underlying\r\noffense,\" and thus, application of the enhancement in §2K2.1(b)(5) was impermissible\r\ndouble-counting). In other cases, offenders have received both the mandated statutory\r\npenalty and a guideline weapon enhancement in circumstances in which the guidelines\r\ngenerally would require a single weapon enhancement. See United States v. Gonzalez, 183\r\nF.3d 1315, 1325-26 (11th Cir.), cert. denied, 120 S.Ct. 996 (2000) (both statutory and\r\nguideline increases may be imposed if defendant and accomplice used different weapons as\r\npart of a joint undertaking); United States v. Willett, 90 F.3d 404, 407-08 (9th Cir. 1996)\r\n(not double counting to apply both increases for separate weapons possessed by defendant).\r\nBut see United States v. Knobloch, 131 F.3d 366, 372 (3d Cir. 1996) (error to apply\r\nguideline enhancement in addition to statutory penalty \"even if the section 924(c)(1)\r\n\r\nsentence is for a different weapon than the weapon upon which the enhancement is\r\npredicated.\").\r\nThe amendment clarifies application of the commentary, consistent with the definition of\r\n\"offense\" found in §1B1.1 (Application Note 1(l)) and with general guideline principles. It\r\naddresses disparate application arising from conflicting interpretations of the current\r\nguideline in different courts, and is intended to avoid the duplicative punishment that results\r\nwhen sentences are increased under both the statutes and the guidelines for substantially the\r\nsame harm.\r\nFinally, Application Notes 2 and 4 and the Background Commentary of §2K2.4 are revised\r\nto reflect changes to 18 U.S.C. § 924(c), made by the Act to Throttle the Criminal Use of\r\nGuns, Pub.

In\r\nSims, the Eighth Circuit concluded that a rule allowing a departure at resentencing based on\r\npost-sentencing rehabilitation would result in unwarranted disparity because resentencing\r\nwould be a fortuitous event benefitting only some defendants; would reinstate a parole-like\r\nsystem; and would interfere with the authority of the Bureau of Prisons to award good-time\r\ncredits. See Sims, 174 F.3d at 912-13; Rhodes, 145 F.3d at 1384 (Silberman, J., dissenting).\r\nThe Commission determined that post-sentencing rehabilitative efforts should not provide\r\na basis for a downward departure when resentencing a defendant initially sentenced to a term\r\nof imprisonment because such a departure would (1) be inconsistent with policies established\r\nby Congress under the Sentencing Reform Act, including the provisions of 18 U.S.C. §\r\n3624(b) for reducing the time to be served by an imprisoned person; and (2) inequitably\r\nbenefit only those few who gain the opportunity to be resentenced de novo, while others,\r\nwhose rehabilitative efforts may have been more substantial, could not benefit simply\r\n\r\nbecause they chose not to appeal or appealed unsuccessfully. Additionally, prohibition on\r\ndownward departure for post-sentencing rehabilitative efforts is consistent with Commission\r\npolicies expressed in §1B1.10 (Reduction in Term of Imprisonment as a Result of Amended\r\nGuideline Range). This amendment does not restrict departures based on extraordinary post-\r\noffense rehabilitative efforts prior to sentencing.

For purposes of this policy statement—\r\n‘Aberrant behavior’ means a single criminal occurrence or single criminal\r\ntransaction that (A) was committed without significant planning; (B) was\r\nof limited duration; and (C) represents a marked deviation by the defendant\r\nfrom an otherwise law-abiding life.\r\n‘Dangerous weapon,’ ‘firearm,’ ‘otherwise used,’ and ‘serious bodily\r\ninjury’ have the meaning given those terms in the Commentary to\r\nAmendment 603 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003\r\n\r\n§1B1.1(Application Instructions).\r\n‘Serious drug trafficking offense’ means any controlled substance offense\r\nunder title 21, United States Code, other than simple possession under 21\r\nU.S.C. § 844, that, because the defendant does not meet the criteria under\r\n§5C1.2 (Limitation on Applicability of Statutory Mandatory Minimum\r\nSentences in Certain Cases), results in the imposition of a mandatory\r\nminimum term of imprisonment upon the defendant.\r\n2. In determining whether the court should depart on the basis of aberrant\r\nbehavior, the court may consider the defendant’s (A) mental and emotional\r\nconditions; (B) employment record; (C) record of prior good works; (D)\r\nmotivation for committing the offense; and (E) efforts to mitigate the effects\r\nof the offense.\".","Reason":"Reason for Amendment: This amendment responds to a circuit conflict regarding whether,\r\nfor purposes of downward departure from the guideline range, a \"single act of aberrant\r\nbehavior\" (Chapter One, Part A, Subpart 4(d)) includes multiple acts occurring over a period\r\nof time. Compare United States v. Grandmaison, 77 F.3d 555 (1st Cir. 1996) (Sentencing\r\nCommission intended the word \"single\" to refer to the crime committed; therefore, \"single\r\nacts of aberrant behavior\" include multiple acts leading up to the commission of the crime;\r\nthe district court should review the totality of circumstances); Zecevic v.

Takai, 941 F.2d 738 (9th Cir. 1991) (\"single\r\nact\" refers to the particular action that is criminal, even though a whole series of acts lead up\r\nto the commission of the crime); United States v. Pena, 930 F.2d 1486 (10th Cir. 1991)\r\n(aberrational nature of the defendant’s conduct and other circumstances justified departure),\r\nwith United States v. Marcello, 13 F.3d 752 (3d Cir. 1994) (single act of aberrant behavior\r\nrequires a spontaneous, thoughtless, single act involving lack of planning); United States v.\r\nGlick, 946 F.2d 335 (4th Cir. 1991) (conduct over a ten-week period involving a number of\r\nactions and extensive planning was not \"single act of aberrant behavior\"); United States v.\r\nWilliams, 974 F.2d 25 (5th Cir. 1992) (a single act of aberrant behavior is generally\r\nspontaneous or thoughtless); United States v. Carey, 895 F.2d 318 (7th Cir. 1990) (single act\r\nof aberrant behavior contemplates a spontaneous and seemingly thoughtless act rather than\r\none which was the result of substantial planning); United States v. Garlich, 951 F.2d 161\r\n(8th Cir. 1991) (fraud spanning one year and several transactions was not a \"single act of\r\naberrant behavior\"); United States v. Withrow, 85 F.3d 527 (11th Cir. 1996) (a single act of\r\naberrant behavior is not established unless the defendant is a first-time offender and the\r\ncrime was a thoughtless act rather than one that was the result of substantial planning);\r\nUnited States v. Dyce, 78 F.3d 610 (D.C. Cir.), amd. on reh. 91 F.3d 1462 (D.C. Cir. 1996)\r\n(same).\r\nThis amendment addresses the circuit conflict but does not adopt in toto either the majority\r\nor minority circuit view on this issue. As a threshold matter, this amendment provides that\r\nthe departure is available only in an extraordinary case. However, the amendment defines\r\nand describes \"aberrant behavior\" more flexibly than the interpretation of existing guideline\r\nlanguage followed by the majority of circuits that have allowed a departure for aberrant\r\nbehavior only in a case involving a single act that was spontaneous and seemingly\r\nthoughtless. The Commission concluded that this application of the current language in\r\n\r\nChapter One is overly restrictive and may preclude departures for aberrant behavior in\r\ncircumstances in which such a departure might be warranted. For this reason, the\r\nCommission attempted to slightly relax the \"single act\" rule in some respects, and provide\r\nguidance and limitations regarding what can be considered aberrant behavior. At the same\r\ntime, the Commission also chose not to adopt the \"totality of circumstances\" approach\r\nendorsed by the minority of circuits, concluding that the latter approach is overly broad and\r\nvague. The Commission anticipates that this compromise amendment will not broadly\r\nexpand departures for aberrant behavior.\r\nThe amendment creates a new policy statement and accompanying commentary in Chapter\r\nFive, Part K (Departures) that sets forth the parameters of conduct and criminal history that\r\nthe Commission believes appropriately may warrant departure as \"aberrant behavior.\" The\r\npolicy statement provides, in pertinent part, that \"‘aberrant behavior’ means a single criminal\r\noccurrence or single criminal transaction.\" The Commission intends that the phrases \"single\r\ncriminal occurrence\" and \"single criminal transaction\" will be somewhat broader than \"single\r\nact\", but will be limited in potential applicability to offenses (1) committed without\r\nsignificant planning; (2) of limited duration; and (3) that represent a marked deviation by the\r\ndefendant from an otherwise law-abiding life. For offense conduct to be considered for\r\ndeparture as aberrant behavior, the offense conduct must, at a minimum, have these\r\ncharacteristics. The Commission chose these characteristics after reviewing case law and\r\npublic comment that indicated some support for the appropriateness of these factors.\r\nThe policy statement places significant restrictions on the type of offense and the criminal\r\nhistory of the offender that can be considered for this departure. The restrictions on the type\r\nof offense that can qualify reflect a Commission concern that certain offense conduct is so\r\nserious that a departure premised on a finding of aberrant behavior should not be available\r\nto those offenders who engage in such conduct. Similarly, the restrictions on criminal\r\nhistory reflect a Commission view that defendants with significant prior criminal records\r\nshould not qualify for a departure premised on the aberrant nature of their current conduct.\r\nThe Commission recognizes that a number of other factors may have some relevance in\r\nevaluating the appropriateness of a departure based on aberrant behavior. Some of the\r\nrelevant factors identified in the case law and public comment are listed in an application\r\nnote.","EffectiveDate":"Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2000."},{"Id":605,"Title":"Amendment 605","Text":"The Commentary to §1B1.4 captioned \"Background\" is amended by striking:\r\n\".

According to the majority of circuits, the sentencing court,\r\nin determining the sentence to impose within the guideline range, or whether a departure\r\nfrom the guidelines is warranted, may consider without limitation any information\r\nconcerning the background, character and conduct of the defendant, unless otherwise\r\nprohibited by law. See §1B1.4 (Information to be Used in Imposing Sentence) and 18\r\nU.S.C. § 3661. These courts hold that §6B1.2 (Standards for Acceptance of Plea\r\nAgreements) does not prohibit a court from considering conduct underlying counts dismissed\r\npursuant to a plea agreement. The minority circuit view holds that a departure based on\r\nconduct uncharged or dismissed in the context of a plea agreement is inappropriate. Courts\r\nholding the minority view emphasize the need to protect the expectations of the parties to\r\nthe plea agreement. Compare United States v. Figaro, 935 F.2d 4 (1st Cir. 1991) (allowing\r\nupward departure based on uncharged conduct); United States v. Kim, 896 F.2d 678 (2d Cir.\r\n1990) (allowing upward departure based on related conduct that formed the basis of\r\ndismissed counts and based on prior similar misconduct not resulting in conviction); United\r\nStates v.

Ct. 243 (1997) (allowing upward\r\ndeparture based on dismissed counts if the conduct underlying the dismissed counts is related\r\nto the offense of conviction conduct) (citing United States v.

L. 104–237. Specifically, the amendment amends\r\n§§2D1.11 and 2D1.12 (Unlawful Possession, Manufacture, Distribution, or Importation of\r\nProhibited Flask or Equipment) to add an enhancement for environmental damage associated\r\nwith methamphetamine offenses. The Commission previously had intended to amend these\r\nguidelines in this manner, but due to a technical oversight, the final amendment did not\r\nimplement that intent.\r\nThe Act directed the Commission to determine whether the guidelines adequately punish\r\nenvironmental violations occurring in connection with precursor chemical offenses under 21\r\nU.S.C. § 841(d) and (g) (sentenced under §2D1.11), and manufacturing equipment offenses\r\nunder 21 U.S.C. § 843(a)(6) and (7) (sentenced under §2D1.12). On February 25, 1997, the\r\nCommission published two options to provide an increase for environmental damage\r\nassociated with the manufacture of methamphetamine, the first by a specific offense\r\ncharacteristic, the second by an invited upward departure. See 62 Fed. Reg. 8487 (proposed\r\nAmendment 605 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003\r\n\r\nFeb. 25, 1997). Both options proposed to make amendments to §§2D1.11, 2D1.12, and\r\n2D1.13. Additionally, although the directive did not address manufacturing offenses under\r\n21 U.S.C. § 841(a), the Commission elected to use its broader guideline promulgation\r\nauthority under 28 U.S.C. § 994(a) to ensure that environmental violations occurring in\r\nconnection with this more frequently occurring offense were treated similarly. Accordingly,\r\nthe published options also included amendments to §2D1.1 (Unlawful Manufacturing,\r\nImporting, Exporting, or Trafficking).\r\nThe published options were revised prior to final action by the Commission. However, in\r\nthe revision that was presented to the Commission for promulgation in late April 1997,\r\namendments to §§2D1.11 and 2D1.12 mistakenly were omitted from the option to provide\r\na specific offense characteristic, although that revision did refer to §§2D1.11 and 2D1.12 in\r\nthe synopsis and included amendments to these guidelines in the upward departure option.\r\n(The revision did not include any amendments to guideline §2D1.13, covering record-\r\nkeeping offenses, because, upon further examination, it seemed unlikely that offenses\r\nsentenced under this guideline would involve environmental damage.) Accordingly, when\r\nthe Commission voted to adopt the option providing the specific offense characteristic for\r\n§§2D1.1, 2D1.11, and 2D1.12, the vote effectively was limited to what was before the\r\nCommission, i.e., an environmental damage enhancement for §2D1.1 only. This amendment\r\ncorrects that error and makes minor, conforming changes to the relevant application note in\r\n§2D1.1.\r\nThird, the amendment updates the Statutory Provisions of §2K2.1 (Unlawful Receipt,\r\nPossession, or Transportation of Firearms or Ammunition) to conform to statutory re-\r\ndesignations made to 18 U.S.C. § 924 (and already conformed in Appendix A (Statutory\r\nIndex)).\r\nFinally, the amendment updates §§5B1.3 (Conditions of Probation) and 5D1.3 (Conditions\r\nof Supervised Release). Effective November 26, 1998, 18 U.S.C. §§ 3563(a) and 3583(a)\r\nwere amended to add a new mandatory condition of probation and supervised release\r\nrequiring a person convicted of a sexual offense described in 18 U.S.C. § 4042(c)(4)\r\n(enumerating several sex offenses) to report to the probation officer the person’s address and\r\nany subsequent change of address, and to register as a sex offender in the state in which the\r\nperson resides. See section 115 of Departments of Commerce, Justice, and State, the\r\nJudiciary, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1998 (Pub. L. 105–119). Because the\r\neffective date of this change was later than the effective date of the last issued Guidelines\r\nManual (November 1, 1998), the Commission did not amend §§5B1.3 and 5D1.3 to reflect\r\nthe new condition. However, the Commission did provide a footnote in each guideline\r\nsetting forth the new condition and alerting the user as to the date on which the condition\r\nbecame effective.

L. 106–878.\r\nThe Act requires the Commission to promulgate amendments under emergency amendment\r\nauthority. Although the Act generally provides that the Commission shall promulgate\r\nvarious amendments \"as soon as practicable,\" the substantial risk directive specifically\r\nAmendment 608 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003\r\n\r\nrequires that the amendment implementing the directive shall apply \"to any offense occurring\r\non or after the date that is 60 days after the date of the enactment\" of the Act.\r\nThe directive instructs the Commission to amend the federal sentencing guidelines with\r\nrespect to any offense relating to the manufacture, attempt to manufacture, or conspiracy to\r\nmanufacture amphetamine or methamphetamine in (1) the Controlled Substances Act (21\r\nU.S.C. § 801 et seq.); (2) the Controlled Substances Import and Export Act (21 U.S.C. § 951\r\net seq.); or (3) the Maritime Drug Law Enforcement Act (46 U.S.C. App. § 1901 et seq.).\r\nThe Act requires the Commission, in carrying out the substantial risk directive, to provide\r\nthe following enhancements—\r\n(A) if the offense created a substantial risk of harm to human life (other than a life\r\ndescribed in subparagraph (B)) or the environment, increase the base offense level\r\nfor the offense—\r\n(i) by not less than 3 offense levels above the applicable level in effect on\r\nthe date of the enactment of this Act; or\r\n(ii) if the resulting base offense level after an increase under clause (i)\r\nwould be less than level 27, to not less than level 27; or\r\n(B) if the offense created a substantial risk of harm to the life of a minor or\r\nincompetent, increase the base offense level for the offense—\r\n(i) by not less than 6 offense levels above the applicable level in effect on\r\nthe date of the enactment of this Act; or\r\n(ii) if the resulting base offense level after an increase under clause (i)\r\nwould be less than level 30, to not less than level 30.\r\nThe pertinent aspects of this amendment are as follows:\r\n(1) Guidelines Amended.—The amendment provides new enhancements in §§2D1.1\r\n(Unlawful Manufacturing, Importing, Exporting, or Trafficking) and 2D1.10 (Endangering\r\nHuman Life While Illegally Manufacturing a Controlled Substance) that also apply in the\r\ncase of an attempt or a conspiracy to manufacture amphetamine or methamphetamine. The\r\namendment does not amend §2D1.11 (Unlawfully Distributing, Importing, Exporting or\r\nPossessing a Listed Chemical) or §2D1.12 (Unlawful Possession, Manufacture, Distribution,\r\nor Importation or Prohibited Flask or Equipment). Although offenses that involve the\r\nmanufacture of amphetamine or methamphetamine also are referenced in Appendix (A)\r\n(Statutory Index) to §§2D1.11 and 2D1.12, the cross reference in these guidelines, which\r\napplies if the offense involved the manufacture of a controlled substance, will result in\r\napplication of §2D1.1 and accordingly, the new enhancements.\r\n(2) Structure.—The basic structure of the amendment to §§2D1.1 and 2D1.10 tracks the\r\nstructure of the directive. Accordingly, in §2D1.1, the amendment provides a three-level\r\nincrease and a minimum offense level of level 27 if the offense (A) involved the manufacture\r\nof amphetamine or methamphetamine; and (B) created a substantial risk of either harm to\r\nhuman life or the environment. For offenses that created a substantial risk of harm to the life\r\n\r\nof a minor or an incompetent, the amendment provides a six-level increase and a minimum\r\noffense level of 30.\r\nHowever, the structure of the amendment in §2D1.10 differs from that in §2D1.1 with\r\nrespect to the first prong of the enhancement (regarding substantial risk of harm to human\r\nlife or to the environment). Specifically, the amendment provides a three-level increase and\r\na minimum offense level of level 27 if the offense involved the manufacture of amphetamine\r\nor methamphetamine without making application of the enhancement dependent upon\r\nwhether the offense also involved a substantial risk of either harm to human life or the\r\nenvironment. Consideration of whether the offense involved a substantial risk of harm to\r\nhuman life is unnecessary because §2D1.10 applies only to convictions under 21 U.S.C. §\r\n858, and the creation of a substantial risk of harm to human life is an element of a § 858\r\noffense. Therefore, the base offense level already takes into account the substantial risk of\r\nharm to human life. Consideration of whether the offense involved a substantial risk of harm\r\nto the environment is unnecessary because the directive predicated application of the\r\nenhancement on substantial risk of harm either to human life or to the environment, and the\r\ncreation of a substantial risk of harm to human life is necessarily present because it is an\r\nelement of the offense.\r\n(3) Determining \"Substantial Risk of Harm\".—Neither the directive nor any statutory\r\nprovision defines \"substantial risk of harm\". Based on an analysis of relevant case law that\r\ninterpreted \"substantial risk of harm\", the amendment provides commentary setting forth\r\nfactors that may be relevant in determining whether a particular offense created a substantial\r\nrisk of harm.\r\n(4) Definitions.—The definition of \"incompetent\" is modeled after several state statutes,\r\nwhich proved useful for purposes of this amendment.\r\nThe definition of \"minor\" has the meaning given that term in Application Note 1 of the\r\nCommentary to §2A3.1 (Criminal Sexual Abuse).","EffectiveDate":"Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is December 16, 2000."},{"Id":610,"Title":"Amendment 610","Text":"The Commentary to §2D1.1 captioned \"Application Notes\" is amended in\r\nNote 10 in the Drug Equivalency Tables in the subdivision captioned \"LSD, PCP, and Other\r\nSchedule I and II Hallucinogens (and their immediate precursors)*\" in the line referenced\r\nto \"MDA\" by striking \"50 gm\" and inserting \"500 gm\"; in the line referenced to \"MDMA\"\r\nby striking \"35 gm\" and inserting \"500 gm\"; in the line referenced \"MDEA\" by striking \"30\r\ngm\" and inserting \"500 gm\"; and by inserting \"1 gm of Paramethoxymethamphetamine/PMA\r\n= 500 gm of marihuana\" after the line referenced to \"MDEA\".","Reason":"Reason for Amendment: This amendment addresses the directive in the Ecstasy Anti-\r\nProliferation Act of 2000 (the \"Act\"), section 3664 of Pub. L. 106–310, which instructs the\r\nCommission to provide, under emergency amendment authority, increased penalties for the\r\nmanufacture, importation, exportation, or trafficking of Ecstasy. The directive specifically\r\nrequires the Commission to increase the base offense level for 3,4-\r\nMethylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), 3,4-Methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA),\r\n3,4-Methylenedioxy-N-ethylamphetamine (MDEA), Paramethoxymethamphetamine (PMA),\r\nand any other controlled substance that is marketed as Ecstasy and that has either a chemical\r\nstructure similar to MDMA or an effect on the central nervous system substantially similar\r\nAmendment 609 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003\r\n\r\nto or greater than MDMA.\r\nThe amendment addresses the directive by amending the Drug Equivalency Table in §2D1.1,\r\nApplication Note 10, to increase substantially the marihuana equivalencies for the specified\r\ncontrolled substances, which has the effect of substantially increasing the penalties for\r\noffenses involving Ecstasy. The new penalties for Ecstasy trafficking provide penalties\r\nwhich, gram for gram, are more severe than those for powder cocaine. Currently under the\r\nDrug Equivalency Table, one gram of powder cocaine has a marihuana equivalency of 200\r\ngrams. This amendment sets the marihuana equivalency for one gram of Ecstasy at 500\r\ngrams.\r\nThere are a combination of reasons why the Commission has substantially increased the\r\npenalties in response to the congressional directive. Much evidence received by the\r\nCommission indicated that Ecstasy: (1) has powerful pharmacological effects; (2) has the\r\ncapacity to cause lasting physical harms, including brain damage; and (3) is being abused\r\nby rapidly increasing numbers of teenagers and young adults. Indeed, the market for Ecstasy\r\nis overwhelmingly comprised of people under the age of 25 years.\r\nBefore voting to promulgate this amendment, the Commission considered whether the\r\npenalty levels for Ecstasy should be set at the same levels as for heroin (i.e., one gram of\r\nheroin has a marihuana equivalency of 1000 grams) and decided that somewhat lesser\r\npenalties were appropriate for Ecstasy for a number of reasons: (1) the potential for addiction\r\nis greater with heroin; (2) heroin distribution often involves violence while, at this time,\r\nviolence is not reported in Ecstasy markets; (3) because it is a narcotic and is often injected,\r\nthe risk of death from overdose is much greater from heroin; and (4) because heroin is often\r\ninjected, there are more secondary health consequences, such as infections and the\r\ntransmission of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis.\r\nFinally, based on information regarding Ecstasy trafficking patterns, the penalty levels\r\nchosen are appropriate and sufficient to target serious and high-level traffickers and to\r\nprovide appropriate punishment, deterrence, and incentives for cooperation. The penalty\r\nlevels chosen for Ecstasy offenses provide five year sentences for serious traffickers (those\r\nwhose relevant conduct involved at least 800 pills) and ten year sentences for high-level\r\ntraffickers (those whose relevant conduct involved at least 8,000 pills).","EffectiveDate":"Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is May 1, 2001."},{"Id":611,"Title":"Amendment 611","Text":"Section 2D1.1(c)(1) is amended by inserting after the fifth entry the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\"15 KG or more of Amphetamine, or 1.5 KG or more of Amphetamine (actual);\".\r\nSection 2D1.1(c)(2) is amended by inserting after the fifth entry the following:\r\n\"At least 5 KG but less than 15 KG of Amphetamine, or at least 500 G but less than 1.5 KG\r\nof Amphetamine (actual);\".\r\nSection 2D1.1(c)(3) is amended by inserting after the fifth entry the following:\r\n\"At least 1.5 KG but less than 5 KG of Amphetamine, or at least 150 G but less than 500 G\r\nNovember 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II Amendment 610\r\n\r\nof Amphetamine (actual);\".\r\nSection 2D1.1(c)(4) is amended by inserting after the fifth entry the following:\r\n\"At least 500 G but less than 1.5 KG of Amphetamine, or at least 50 G but less than 150 G\r\nof Amphetamine (actual);\".\r\nSection 2D1.1(c)(5) is amended by inserting after the fifth entry the following:\r\n\"At least 350 G but less than 500 G of Amphetamine, or at least 35 G but less than 50 G of\r\nAmphetamine (actual);\".\r\nSection 2D1.1(c)(6) is amended by inserting after the fifth entry the following:\r\n\"At least 200 G but less than 350 G of Amphetamine, or at least 20 G but less than 35 G of\r\nAmphetamine (actual);\".\r\nSection 2D1.1(c)(7) is amended by inserting after the fifth entry the following:\r\n\"At least 50 G but less than 200 G of Amphetamine, or at least 5 G but less than 20 G of\r\nAmphetamine (actual);\".\r\nSection 2D1.1(c)(8) is amended by inserting after the fifth entry the following:\r\n\"At least 40 G but less than 50 G of Amphetamine, or at least 4 G but less than 5 G of\r\nAmphetamine (actual);\".\r\nSection 2D1.1(c)(9) is amended by inserting after the fifth entry the following:\r\n\"At least 30 G but less than 40 G of Amphetamine, or at least 3 G but less than 4 G of\r\nAmphetamine (actual);\".\r\nSection 2D1.1(c)(10) is amended by inserting after the fifth entry the following:\r\n\"At least 20 G but less than 30 G of Amphetamine, or at least 2 G but less than 3 G of\r\nAmphetamine (actual);\".\r\nSection 2D1.1(c)(11) is amended by inserting after the fifth entry the following:\r\n\"At least 10 G but less than 20 G of Amphetamine, or at least 1 G but less than 2 G of\r\nAmphetamine (actual);\".\r\nSection 2D1.1(c)(12) is amended by inserting after the fifth entry the following:\r\n\"At least 5 G but less than 10 G of Amphetamine, or at least 500 MG but less than 1 G of\r\nAmphetamine (actual);\".\r\nSection 2D1.1(c)(13) is amended by inserting after the fifth entry the following:\r\n\"At least 2.5 G but less than 5 G of Amphetamine, or at least 250 MG but less than 500 MG\r\nAmendment 610 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003\r\n\r\nof Amphetamine (actual);\".\r\nSection 2D1.1(c)(14) is amended by inserting after the fifth entry the following:\r\n\"Less than 2.5 G of Amphetamine, or less than 250 MG of Amphetamine (actual);\".\r\nSection 2D1.1(c) is amended in Note (B) of the \"Notes to Drug Quantity Table\" by inserting\r\n\", ‘Amphetamine (actual)’,\" after \"terms ‘PCP (actual)’\"; by inserting \", amphetamine,\" after\r\n\"substance containing PCP\"; and by inserting \", amphetamine (actual),\" after \"weight of the\r\nPCP (actual)\".\r\nThe Commentary to §2D1.1 captioned \"Application Notes\" is amended in Note 9 by\r\ninserting \", amphetamine,\" after \"PCP\".\r\nThe Commentary to §2D1.1 captioned \"Application Notes\" is amended in Note 10 in the\r\nDrug Equivalency Tables in the subdivision captioned \"Cocaine and Other Schedule I and\r\nII Stimulants (and their immediate precursors)*\" by striking \"200 gm\" after \"1 gm of\r\nAmphetamine =\" and inserting \"2 kg\"; and by inserting \"1 gm of Amphetamine (Actual) =\r\n20 kg of marihuana\" after the line referenced to \"Amphetamine\".","Reason":"Reason for Amendment: This emergency amendment implements the directive in the\r\nMethamphetamine Anti-Proliferation Act of 2000, section 3611 of Pub.

In any other\r\ncase, the quantities should be added together (using the List I Chemical\r\nEquivalency Table) for the purpose of calculating the base offense level.\r\nExamples:\r\n(a) The defendant was in possession of five kilograms of ephedrine\r\nand 300 grams of hydriodic acid. Ephedrine and hydriodic acid\r\ntypically are used together in the same manufacturing process to\r\nmanufacture methamphetamine. Therefore, the base offense level\r\nfor each listed chemical is calculated separately and the list I\r\nchemical with the higher base offense level is used. Five kilograms\r\nof ephedrine result in a base offense level of 26; 300 grams of\r\nhydriodic acid result in a base offense level of 16. In this case, the\r\nbase offense level would be 26.\r\n(b) The defendant was in possession of five kilograms of ephedrine\r\nand two kilograms of phenylacetic acid. Although both of these\r\nchemicals are used to manufacture methamphetamine, they are not\r\nused together in the same manufacturing process. Therefore, the\r\nquantity of phenylacetic acid should be converted to an ephedrine\r\nequivalency using the List I Chemical Equivalency Table and then\r\nadded to the quantity of ephedrine. In this case, the two kilograms\r\nof phenylacetic acid convert to two kilograms of ephedrine (see\r\nList I Chemical Equivalency Table), resulting in a total equivalency\r\nof seven kilograms of ephedrine.\",\r\nand inserting the following:\r\nNovember 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II Amendment 611\r\n\r\n\"4. Cases Involving Multiple Chemicals.—\r\n(A) Determining the Base Offense Level for Two or More\r\nChemicals.—Except as provided in subdivision (B), if the offense\r\ninvolves two or more chemicals, use the quantity of the single\r\nchemical that results in the greatest offense level, regardless of\r\nwhether the chemicals are set forth in different tables or in different\r\ncategories (i.e., list I or list II) under subsections (d) and (e) of this\r\nguideline.\r\nExample: The defendant was in possession of five kilograms of\r\nephedrine and 300 grams of hydriodic acid. Ephedrine and\r\nhydriodic acid typically are used together in the same\r\nmanufacturing process to manufacture methamphetamine. The\r\nbase offense level for each chemical is calculated separately and the\r\nchemical with the higher base offense level is used. Five kilograms\r\nof ephedrine result in a base offense level of level 38; 300 grams of\r\nhydriodic acid result in a base offense level of level 26. In this\r\ncase, the base offense level would be level 38.\r\n(B) Determining the Base Offense Level for Offenses involving\r\nEphedrine, Pseudoephedrine, or Phenylpropanolamine.—If the\r\noffense involves two or more chemicals each of which is set forth\r\nin the Ephedrine, Pseudoephedrine, and Phenylpropanolamine\r\nQuantity Table, (i) aggregate the quantities of all such\r\nchemicals, and (ii) determine the base offense level corresponding\r\nto the aggregate quantity.\r\nExample: The defendant was in possession of 80 grams of\r\nephedrine and 50 grams of phenylpropanolamine, an aggregate\r\nquantity of 130 grams of such chemicals. The base offense level\r\ncorresponding to that aggregate quantity is level 32.\r\n(C) Upward Departure.—In a case involving two or more chemicals\r\nused to manufacture different controlled substances, or to\r\nmanufacture one controlled substance by different manufacturing\r\nprocesses, an upward departure may be warranted if the offense\r\nlevel does not adequately address the seriousness of the offense.\".\r\nThe Commentary to §2D1.11 captioned \"Application Notes\" is amended by striking Notes\r\n5 and 6 in their entirety as follows:\r\n\"5. Where there are multiple list II chemicals, all quantities of the same list II\r\nchemical are added together for purposes of determining the base offense\r\nlevel. However, quantities of different list II chemicals are not aggregated\r\n(see Note B to the Chemical Quantity Table). Thus, where multiple list II\r\nchemicals are involved in the offense, the base offense level is determined\r\nby using the base offense level for the single list II chemical resulting in the\r\ngreatest base offense level. For example, in the case of an offense involving\r\nseven kilograms of methyl ethyl ketone and eight kilograms of acetone, the\r\nAmendment 611 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003\r\n\r\nbase offense level for the methyl ethyl ketone is 12 and the base offense\r\nlevel for the acetone is 14; therefore, the base offense level is 14.\r\n6. Where both list I chemicals and list II chemicals are involved, use the\r\ngreater of the base offense level for the list I chemicals or the list II\r\nchemicals (see Note C to the Chemical Quantity Table).\";\r\nand by redesignating Notes 7 and 8 as Notes 5 and 6, respectively.\r\nThe Commentary to §2D1.11 captioned \"Background\" is amended in the first sentence by\r\ninserting \"(including ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, and phenylpropanolamine)\" after \"list I\r\nchemicals\".\r\nThe Commentary to 2D1.1 captioned \"Application Notes\" is amended in Note 10 in the\r\n\"Drug Equivalency Tables\" by inserting after the subdivision captioned \"Schedule V\r\nSubstances******\" the following new subdivision:\r\n\"List I Chemicals (relating to the manufacture of amphetamine or\r\nmethamphetamine)*******\r\n1 gm of Ephedrine = 10 kg of marihuana\r\n1 gm of Phenylpropanolamine = 10 kg of marihuana\r\n1 gm of Pseudoephedrine = 10 kg of marihuana\r\n*******Provided, that in a case involving ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, or\r\nphenylpropanolamine tablets, use the weight of the ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, or\r\nphenylpropanolamine contained in the tablets, not the weight of the entire tablets,\r\nin calculating the base offense level.\".","Reason":"Reason for Amendment: This amendment is in response to the three-part directive in\r\nsection 3651 of the Methamphetamine Anti-Proliferation Act of 2000, Pub. L. 106–310 (the\r\n\"Act\"), regarding enhanced punishment for trafficking in List I chemicals. That section\r\nrequires the Commission to promulgate an amendment implementing the directive under\r\nemergency amendment authority.\r\nFirst, this amendment provides a new chemical quantity table specifically for ephedrine,\r\npseudoephedrine, and phenylpropanolamine (PPA). The table ties the base offense levels\r\nfor these chemicals to the base offense levels for methamphetamine (actual) set forth in\r\n§2D1.1, assuming a 50 percent actual yield of the controlled substance from the chemicals.\r\n(Methamphetamine (actual) is used rather than methamphetamine mixture because\r\nephedrine, pseudoephedrine, and PPA produce methamphetamine (actual)). This yield is\r\nbased on information provided by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) that the\r\ntypical yield of these substances for clandestine laboratories is 50 to 75 percent.\r\nThis new chemical quantity table has a maximum base offense level of level 38 (as opposed\r\nto a maximum base offense level of level 30 for all other precursor chemicals). Providing\r\na maximum base offense level of level 38 complies with the directive to establish penalties\r\nfor these precursors that \"correspond to the quantity of controlled substance that could have\r\nreasonably been manufactured using the quantity of ephedrine, phenylpropanolamine, or\r\npseudoephedrine possessed or distributed.\" Additionally, this adjustment will have an\r\nNovember 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II Amendment 611\r\n\r\nimpact on the relationship between §§2D1.1 and 2D1.11 by eliminating the six-level\r\ndistinction that currently exists between offenses that involve intent to manufacture\r\nmethamphetamine and offenses that involve an attempt to manufacture methamphetamine,\r\nat least for offenses involving ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, and PPA.\r\nThis amendment eliminates the Ephedrine Equivalency Table in §2D1.11 and, in its place,\r\nprovides an instruction for the court to determine the base offense level in cases involving\r\nmultiple precursors (other than ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, or PPA) by using the quantity\r\nof the single chemical resulting in the greatest offense level. An upward departure is\r\nprovided for cases in which the offense level does not adequately address the seriousness of\r\nthe offense.\r\nHowever, this amendment provides an exception to the rule for offenses that involve a\r\ncombination of ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, or PPA because these chemicals often are used\r\nin the same manufacturing process. In a case that involves two or more of these chemicals,\r\nthe base offense level will be determined using the total quantity of these chemicals\r\ninvolved. The purpose of this exception is twofold: (1) any of the three primary precursors\r\nin the same table can be combined without difficulty; and (2) studies conducted by the DEA\r\nindicate that because the manufacturing process for amphetamine and methamphetamine is\r\nidentical, there are cases in which the different precursors are included in the same batch of\r\ndrugs. If the chemical is PPA, amphetamine results; and if the chemical is ephedrine,\r\nmethamphetamine results.\r\nSecond, the amendment adds to the Drug Equivalency Tables in §2D1.1 a conversion table\r\nfor these precursor chemicals, providing for a 50 percent conversion ratio. This is based on\r\ndata from the DEA that the actual yield from ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, or PPA typically\r\nis in the range of 50 to 75 percent. The purpose of this part of the amendment is to achieve\r\nthe same punishment level (as is achieved by the first part of this amendment) for an offense\r\ninvolving any of these precursor chemicals when such offense involved the manufacture of\r\nmethamphetamine and, as a result, is sentenced under §2D1.1 pursuant to the cross reference\r\nin §2D1.11.\r\nThird, this amendment increases the base offense level for Benzaldehyde, Hydriodic Acid,\r\nMethylamine, Nitroethane, and Norpseudoephedrine by re-calibrating these levels to the\r\nappropriate quantity of methamphetamine (actual) that could be produced assuming a 50\r\npercent yield of chemical to drug and retaining a cap at level 30. Previously, these\r\nchemicals had been linked to methamphetamine (mixture) penalty levels. Based on a study\r\nconducted by the DEA, ephedrine and pseudoepehdrine are the primary precursors used to\r\nmake methamphetamine in the United States. Phenylproponolamine is the primary precursor\r\nused to make amphetamine. Unlike the five additional List I chemicals, the chemical\r\nstructures of ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, and PPA are so similar to the resulting drug (i.e.,\r\nmethamphetamine or amphetamine) that the manufacture of methamphetamine or\r\namphetamine from ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, or PPA is a very simple one-step synthesis\r\nwhich anyone can perform using a variety of chemical reagents. The manufacture of\r\nmethamphetamine or amphetamine from the five additional List I chemicals is a more\r\ncomplex process which requires a heightened level of expertise.","EffectiveDate":"Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is May 1, 2001."},{"Id":613,"Title":"Amendment 613","Text":"The Commentary to §2G1.1 captioned \"Statutory Provisions\" is amended by\r\nAmendment 611 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003\r\n\r\ninserting \"1591,\" before \"2421\".\r\nThe Commentary to §2G1.1 captioned \"Application Notes\" is amended in Note 2 in the\r\nfourth sentence by adding \"(B)\" after \"purposes of subsection (b)(1)\".\r\nThe Commentary to §2G1.1 captioned \"Application Notes\" is amended by adding at the end\r\nthe following:\r\n\"12.

This\r\namendment is in response to the directive found at section 112(b) of the Victims of\r\nTrafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000 (the \"Act\"), Pub. L. 106–386. The\r\nCommission expects to consider further revisions and additions to the specific offense\r\ncharacteristics and punishment levels for these offenses, such as the possibility of providing\r\nan alternative base offense level in §2G1.1 (Promoting Prostitution or Prohibited Sexual\r\nConduct) for convictions under 18 U.S.C. § 1591 involving victims under the age of 14\r\nyears.\r\nThe directive confers emergency authority on the Commission to amend the federal\r\nsentencing guidelines to reflect changes to 18 U.S.C. §§ 1581(a) (Peonage), 1583\r\n(Enticement into Slavery), and 1584 (Sale into Involuntary Servitude). The Commission\r\nalso is directed to consider how to address four new statutes: 18 U.S.C. §§ 1589 (Forced\r\nLabor); 1590 (Trafficking with Respect to Peonage, Involuntary Servitude or Forced Labor);\r\n1591 (Sex Trafficking of Children by Force, Fraud or Coercion); and 1592 (Unlawful\r\nConduct with Respect to Documents in Furtherance of Peonage, Involuntary Servitude or\r\nForced Labor).\r\nSpecifically, the Commission is directed to \"review and, if appropriate, amend the sentencing\r\nguidelines applicable to . . . the trafficking of persons including . . . peonage, involuntary\r\nservitude, slave trade offenses, and possession, transfer or sale of false immigration\r\n\r\ndocuments in furtherance of trafficking, and the Fair Labor Standards Act and the Migrant\r\nand Seasonal Agricultural Worker Protection Act.\"\r\nThe Commission further is directed to \"take all appropriate measures to ensure that these\r\nsentencing guidelines . . . are sufficiently stringent to deter and adequately reflect the heinous\r\nnature of these offenses.\" The Commission also is directed to \"consider providing\r\nsentencing enhancements\" in cases which involve: (1) a large number of victims; (2) a\r\npattern of continued and flagrant violations; (3) the use or threatened use of a dangerous\r\nweapon; or (4) the death or bodily injury of any person.\r\nTo address this multi-faceted directive, this amendment makes changes to several existing\r\nguidelines and creates a new guideline for criminal violations of the Migrant and Seasonal\r\nAgricultural Worker Protection Act. Although the directive instructs the Commission to\r\namend the guidelines applicable to the Fair Labor Standards Act (29 U.S.C. § 201 et. seq.),\r\na criminal violation of the Fair Labor Standards Act is only a Class B misdemeanor. See 29\r\nU.S.C. § 216. Thus, the guidelines are not applicable to those offenses.\r\nThe amendment references the new offense at 18 U.S.C. § 1591 to §2G1.1. Section 1591\r\npunishes a defendant who participates in the transporting or harboring of a person, or who\r\nbenefits from participating in such a venture, with the knowledge that force, fraud, or\r\ncoercion will be used to cause that person to engage in a commercial sex act or with\r\nknowledge that the person is not 18 years old and will be forced to engage in a commercial\r\nsex act. Despite the statute’s inclusion in a chapter of title 18 devoted mainly to peonage\r\noffenses, section 1591 offenses are more analogous to the offenses referenced to the\r\nprostitution guideline.\r\nSection 1591 cases alternatively have been referred in Appendix A to §2G2.1 (Sexually\r\nExploiting a Minor by Production of Sexually Explicit Visual or Printed Material; Custodian\r\nPermitting Minor to Engage in Sexually Explicit Conduct; Advertisement for Minors to\r\nEngage in Production). This has been done in anticipation that some portion of section 1591\r\ncases will involve children being forced or coerced to engage in commercial sex acts for the\r\npurpose of producing pornography. Such offenses, as recognized by the higher base offense\r\nlevel at §2G2.1, are more serious because they both involve specific harm to an individual\r\nvictim and further an additional criminal purpose, namely, commercial pornography.\r\nThe amendment maintains the view that §2H4.1 (Peonage, Involuntary Servitude, and Slave\r\nTrade) continues to be an appropriate tool for determining sentences for violations of 18\r\nU.S.C. §§ 1581, 1583, and 1584. Section 2H4.1 also is designed to cover offenses under\r\nthree new statutes, 18 U.S.C. §§ 1589, 1590, and 1592. Section 1589 punishes defendants\r\nwho provide or obtain the labor or services of another by the use of threats of serious harm\r\nor physical restraint against a person, or by a scheme or plan intended to make the person\r\nbelieve that if he or she did not perform the labor or services, he or she would suffer physical\r\nrestraint or serious harm. This statute also applies to defendants who provide or obtain labor\r\nor services of another by abusing or threatening abuse of the law or the legal process. See\r\n18 U.S.C. § 1589.\r\nSection 1590 punishes defendants who harbor, transport, or are otherwise involved in\r\nobtaining, a person for labor or services. Section 1592 punishes a defendant who knowingly\r\npossesses, destroys, or removes an actual passport, other immigration document, or\r\ngovernment identification document of another person in the course of a violation of § 1581\r\nAmendment 612 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003\r\n\r\n(peonage), § 1583 (enticement into slavery), § 1584 (sale into involuntary servitude), § 1589\r\n(forced labor), § 1590 (trafficking with respect to these offenses), § 1591 (sex trafficking of\r\nchildren by force, fraud or coercion), or § 1594(a) (attempts to violate these offenses).\r\nSection 1592 also punishes a defendant who, with intent to violate § 1581, § 1583, § 1584,\r\n§ 1589, § 1590, or § 1591, knowingly possesses, destroys, or removes an actual passport,\r\nother immigration document, or government identification document of another person.\r\nThese statutes prohibit the types of behaviors that have been traditionally sentenced under\r\n§2H4.1.\r\nThe amendment provides an alternative, less punitive base offense level of level 18 for those\r\nwho violate 18 U.S.C. § 1592, an offense which limits participation in peonage cases to the\r\ndestruction or wrongful confiscation of a passport or other immigration document. This\r\nalternative, lower base level reflects the lower statutory maximum sentence for § 1592\r\noffenses (i.e., 5 years).\r\nSection 2H4.1(b)(2) has been expanded to provide a 4-level increase if a dangerous weapon\r\nwas used and a 2-level increase if a dangerous weapon was brandished or its use was\r\nthreatened. Currently, only actual use of a dangerous weapon is covered. This change\r\nreflects the directive to consider an enhancement for the \"use or threatened use of a\r\ndangerous weapon.\" The commentary to §2H4.1 is amended to clarify that the threatened\r\nuse of a dangerous weapon applies regardless of whether a dangerous weapon was actually\r\npresent.\r\nThe amendment also creates a new guideline, §2H4.2 (Willful Violations of the Migrant and\r\nSeasonal Agricultural Worker Protection Act), in response to the directive to amend the\r\nguidelines applicable to such offenses. These offenses, which have a statutory maximum\r\nsentence of one year imprisonment for first offenses and three years’ imprisonment for\r\nsubsequent offenses, currently are not referred to any specific guideline. The amendment\r\nprovides a base offense level of level 6 in recognition of the low statutory maximum\r\nsentences set for these cases by Congress. Further, these offenses typically involve\r\nviolations of regulatory provisions. Setting the base offense level at level 6 provides\r\nconsistency with guidelines for other regulatory offenses. See, e.g., §§2N2.1 (Violations of\r\nStatutes and Regulations Dealing With Any Food, Drug, Biological Product, Device,\r\nCosmetic, or Agricultural Product) and 2N3.1 (Odometer Laws and Regulations).\r\nSubsections (b)(1), an enhancement for bodily injury, and (b)(2), an enhancement applicable\r\nto defendants who commit the instant offense after previously sustaining a civil penalty for\r\nsimilar misconduct, have been established to respond to the directive that the Commission\r\nconsider sentencing enhancement for these offense characteristics. This section addresses\r\nthe Department of Justice’s and the Department of Labor’s concern regarding prior\r\nadministrative and civil adjudications.\r\nThis amendment also addresses that portion of section 112 of the Act that amends chapter\r\n77 of title 18, United States Code, to provide mandatory restitution for peonage and\r\ninvoluntary servitude offenses. The amendment amends §5E1.1 (Restitution) to include a\r\nreference to 18 U.S.C. § 1593 in the guideline provision regarding mandatory restitution.\r\nBy enactment of various sentencing enhancements and encouraged upward departures for\r\nareas of concern identified by Congress, the Commission has provided for more severe\r\nsentences for perpetrators of human trafficking offenses in keeping with the conclusion that\r\nthe offenses covered by this amendment are both heinous in nature and being committed\r\nNovember 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II Amendment 614\r\n\r\nwith rapidly increasing frequency.","EffectiveDate":"Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is May 1, 2001."},{"Id":614,"Title":"Amendment 614","Text":"The Commentary to §1B1.2 captioned \"Application Notes\" is amended in\r\nNote 1 in the third sentence of the first paragraph by inserting \"(written or made orally on\r\nthe record)\" after \"agreement\".\r\nThe Commentary to §1B1.2 captioned \"Application Notes\" is amended in Note 1 by striking\r\nthe first two sentences of the third paragraph as follows:\r\n\"However, there is a limited exception to this general rule.

Application of Subsection (b)(2).—In a case involving a dangerous weapon\r\nwith intent to cause bodily injury, the court shall apply both the base\r\noffense level and subsection (b)(2).\r\n3. More than Minimal Planning.—For purposes of subsection (b)(1), ‘more\r\nthan minimal planning’ means more planning than is typical for commission\r\nof the offense in a simple form. ‘More than minimal planning’ also exists\r\nif significant affirmative steps were taken to conceal the offense, other than\r\nconduct to which §3C1.1 (Obstructing or Impeding the Administration of\r\nJustice) applies. For example, waiting to commit the offense when no\r\nwitnesses were present would not alone constitute more than minimal\r\nplanning. By contrast, luring the victim to a specific location or wearing a\r\nski mask to prevent identification would constitute more than minimal\r\nplanning.\".\r\nThe Commentary to §2A2.2 captioned \"Background\" is amended by striking the text of the\r\nbackground as follows:\r\n\" This section applies to serious (aggravated) assaults. Such offenses\r\noccasionally may involve planning or be committed for hire. Consequently, the\r\nstructure follows §2A2.1.\r\nThere are a number of federal provisions that address varying degrees of\r\nassault and battery. The punishments under these statutes differ considerably, even\r\namong provisions directed to substantially similar conduct. For example, if the\r\nassault is upon certain federal officers ‘while engaged in or on account of . . .\r\nofficial duties,’ the maximum term of imprisonment under 18 U.S.C. § 111 is three\r\nyears. If a dangerous weapon is used in the assault on a federal officer, the\r\nmaximum term of imprisonment is ten years. However, if the same weapon is used\r\nto assault a person not otherwise specifically protected, the maximum term of\r\nimprisonment under 18 U.S.C. § 113(c) is five years. If the assault results in serious\r\nbodily injury, the maximum term of imprisonment under 18 U.S.C. § 113(f) is ten\r\nyears, unless the injury constitutes maiming by scalding, corrosive, or caustic\r\nsubstances under 18 U.S.C. § 114, in which case the maximum term of\r\nimprisonment is twenty years.\",\r\nand inserting the following:\r\n\" This guideline covers felonious assaults that are more serious than minor\r\nassaults because of the presence of an aggravating factor, i.e., serious bodily injury,\r\nthe involvement of a dangerous weapon with intent to cause bodily injury, or the\r\nintent to commit another felony. Such offenses occasionally may involve planning\r\nor be committed for hire. Consequently, the structure follows §2A2.1 (Assault with\r\nIntent to Commit Murder; Attempted Murder). This guideline also covers attempted\r\nmanslaughter and assault with intent to commit manslaughter. Assault with intent\r\nAmendment 614 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003\r\n\r\nto commit murder is covered by §2A2.1.

It applies to offenders whose instant offense of conviction is\r\na sex offense committed against a minor victim. The relevant criminal provisions\r\nprovide for increased statutory maximum penalties for repeat sex offenders and\r\nmake those increased statutory maximum penalties available if the defendant\r\npreviously was convicted of any of several federal and state sex offenses (see 18\r\nU.S.C. §§ 2247, 2426).

L. 105–314\r\n(the \"Act\"), which contains several directives to the Commission. In furtherance of the\r\ndirectives, the Commission initiated a comprehensive examination of the guidelines under\r\nwhich most sex crimes are sentenced. Amendment 592, effective November 1, 2000,\r\naddressed a number of these directives. (See Amendment 592.)\r\nThe first part of the amendment addresses the Act’s directive to increase penalties in any\r\ncase in which the defendant engaged in a pattern of activity of sexual abuse or sexual\r\nexploitation of a minor. In response to this directive, the amendment provides a new Chapter\r\nFour (Criminal History and Criminal Livelihood) guideline, §4B1.5 (Repeat and Dangerous\r\nSex Offender Against Minors), that focuses on repeat child sex offenders. This new\r\nguideline works in a coordinated manner with §4B1.1 (Career Offender) and creates a tiered\r\napproach to punishing repeat child sex offenders.\r\nThe first tier, in §4B1.5(a), aims to incapacitate repeat child sex offenders who have an\r\ninstant offense of conviction of sexual abuse of a minor and a prior felony conviction for\r\nsexual abuse of a minor (but to whom §4B1.1 does not apply). This provision subjects a\r\ndefendant to the greater of the offense level determined under Chapters Two and Three or\r\nthe offense level obtained from a table that, like the table in §4B1.1, bases the applicable\r\noffense level on the statutory maximum for the offense. In addition, the defendant is subject\r\nto an enhanced criminal history category of not less than Category V, similar to §4B1.1\r\n(which provides for Category VI). By statute, defendants convicted of a federal sex offense\r\nare subject to twice the statutory maximum penalty for a subsequent sex offense conviction.\r\nThis guideline provision effectuates the Commission’s and Congress's intent to punish repeat\r\nchild sex offenders severely.\r\nThe second tier, in §4B1.5(b), provides a five-level increase in the offense level and a\r\nminimum offense level of level 22 for defendants who are not subject to either §4B1.1 or to\r\n§4B1.5(a) and who have engaged in a pattern of activity involving prohibited sexual conduct\r\nwith minors. This part of the guideline does not rely on prior convictions to increase the\r\npenalty for those who have a pattern of activity of sexual abuse or exploitation of a minor.\r\nThe pattern of activity enhancement requires that the defendant engaged in prohibited sexual\r\nconduct on at least two separate occasions and that at least two minors were victims of the\r\nsexual conduct. This provision is similar to the existing five-level pattern of activity\r\nenhancement in subsection (b)(4) of §2G2.2 (Trafficking in Material Involving the Sexual\r\nExploitation of a Minor; Receiving, Transporting, Shipping, or Advertising Material\r\nInvolving the Sexual Exploitation of a Minor; Possessing Material Involving the Sexual\r\nExploitation of a Minor with Intent to Traffic) and effectuates the Commission’s and\r\nCongress’s intent to punish severely offenders who engage in a pattern of activity involving\r\nthe sexual abuse or exploitation of minors.\r\nConforming amendments are made to the criminal sexual abuse guidelines in Chapter Two,\r\nAmendment 615 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003\r\n\r\nPart A, Subpart 3 to delete the upward departure provisions for prior sentences for similar\r\nconduct; that factor is now taken into account in the new guideline.\r\nIn addition to creating a new guideline, this part of the amendment also modifies §5D1.2\r\n(Term of Supervised Release) to provide that the recommended term of supervised release\r\nfor a defendant convicted of a sex crime is the maximum term authorized by statute.\r\nAmendments to §§5B1.3 (Conditions of Probation) and 5D1.3 (Conditions of Supervised\r\nRelease) effectuate the Commission’s intent that offenders who commit sex crimes receive\r\nappropriate treatment and monitoring.\r\nThe second part of the amendment addresses a circuit conflict regarding whether multiple\r\ncounts of possession, receipt, or transportation of images containing child pornography\r\nshould be grouped together pursuant to subsection (a) or (b) of §3D1.2 (Groups of Closely\r\nRelated Counts). Resolution of the conflict depends, in part, on determining who is the\r\nvictim of the offense: the child depicted in the pornography images or society as a whole.\r\nSix circuits have held that the child depicted is the victim, and, therefore, that the counts are\r\nnot grouped. See United States v. Norris, 159 F.3d 926 (5th Cir. 1998); United States v.\r\nHibbler, 159 F.3d 233 (6th Cir. 1998); United States v. Ketcham, 80 F.3d 789 (3d Cir.\r\n1996); United States v. Rugh, 968 F.2d 750 (8th Cir. 1992); United States v. Boos, 127 F.3d\r\n1207 (9th Cir. 1997), cert. denied, 522 U.S. 1066 (1998); and United States v. Tillmon, 195\r\nF.3d 640 (11th Cir. 1999). In contrast, one circuit has held that society as a whole is the\r\nvictim of these types of offenses, and, therefore, that one count of interstate transportation\r\nof child pornography does not group with a count of interstate transportation of a minor with\r\nintent to engage in illegal sexual activity in a case in which the child portrayed in the\r\npornography was the same child transported. See United States v. Toler, 901 F.2d 399 (4th\r\nCir. 1990).\r\nIn addressing the circuit conflict, the Commission adopted a position that provides for\r\ngrouping of multiple counts of child pornography distribution, receipt, and possession\r\npursuant to §3D1.2(d). Grouping multiple counts of these offenses pursuant to §3D1.2(d)\r\nis appropriate because these offenses typically are continuous and ongoing enterprises. This\r\ngrouping provision does not require the determination of whether counts involve the same\r\nvictim in order to calculate a combined adjusted offense level for multiple counts of\r\nconviction which, particularly in these kinds of cases, could be complex and time\r\nconsuming. Consistent with the provisions of subsection (a)(2) of §1B1.3 (Relevant\r\nConduct), this approach provides that additional images of child pornography (often\r\ninvolved in the case, but outside of the offense of conviction) shall be considered by the\r\ncourt in determining the appropriate sentence for the defendant if the conduct related to those\r\nimages is part of the same course of conduct or common scheme or plan.\r\nThe third part of the amendment makes several modifications to §2A3.2 (Criminal Sexual\r\nAbuse of a Minor Under the Age of Sixteen Years (Statutory Rape) or Attempt to Commit\r\nSuch Acts). The amendment responds to the directive in the Act to provide an enhancement\r\nfor offenses under chapter 117 of title 18, United States Code, involving the transportation\r\nof minors for prostitution or prohibited sexual conduct. The amendment increases the\r\noffense levels in §2A3.2 and in §2A3.4 (Abusive Sexual Contact or Attempt to Commit\r\nAbusive Sexual Contact). The Act focuses on those individuals who travel to meet or\r\ntransport minors for illegal sexual activity by providing increased statutory maximum\r\npenalties for those individuals. In response, the increase in penalties in these guidelines were\r\ngeared toward those individuals. Specifically, the amendment distinguishes between chapter\r\n\r\n117 offenses that involve the commission of a sexual act or sexual contact and those offenses\r\n(e.g., sting cases) that do not, by providing an alternative base offense level in §2A3.2 for\r\nchapter 117 offenses that also involve the commission of a sexual act or sexual contact that\r\nis three levels greater (i.e., level 24) than the base offense level applicable to chapter 117\r\noffenses that do not involve a sexual act or sexual contact.\r\nThe amendment provides a three-level increase in the base offense level for offenses\r\nsentenced under §2A3.2, such that the base offense level (1) for statutory rape\r\nunaccompanied by aggravating conduct is increased from level 15 to level 18; (2) for a\r\nchapter 117 offense (unaccompanied by a sexual act or sexual contact) is increased from\r\nlevel 18 to level 21; and (3) for a chapter 117 offense (accompanied by a sexual act or sexual\r\ncontact) results in a base offense level of level 24. The amendment reflects the seriousness\r\naccorded criminal sexual abuse offenses by Congress, which provided for statutory\r\nmaximum penalties of 15 years’ imprisonment (or 30 years’ imprisonment with a prior\r\nconviction for a sex crime). A defendant who transmits child pornography to a minor as a\r\nmeans of enticing the minor to engage in illegal sexual activity will receive a sentence\r\nincrease when that defendant subsequently travels across state lines to engage in illegal\r\nsexual activity with that minor. Therefore, this increase also maintains the proportionality\r\nbetween §§2A3.2 and 2G2.2.\r\nThe third part of the amendment also makes conforming changes to §2A3.2 to ensure that\r\nsome chapter 117 offenses that do not include aggravating conduct receive the offense level\r\napplicable to statutory rape in its basic form. Technical changes made by the amendment\r\n(such as the addition of headings and the reordering of applications notes) are not intended\r\nto have substantive effect.","EffectiveDate":"Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2001."},{"Id":617,"Title":"Amendment 617","Text":"Section 2A6.2(a) is amended by striking \"14\" and inserting \"18\".\r\nSection 2A6.2(c) is amended by striking subdivision (1) as follows:\r\n\"(1) If the offense involved conduct covered by another offense guideline from\r\nChapter Two, Part A (Offenses Against the Person), apply that offense\r\nguideline, if the resulting offense level is greater than that determined\r\nabove.\",\r\nand inserting the following:\r\n\"(1) If the offense involved the commission of another criminal offense, apply\r\nthe offense guideline from Chapter Two, Part A (Offenses Against the\r\nPerson) most applicable to that other criminal offense, if the resulting\r\noffense level is greater than that determined above.\".\r\nThe Commentary to §2A6.2 captioned \"Application Notes\" is amended in Note 1 by striking\r\nthe 1-em dash and inserting a colon; and by striking the last paragraph as follows:\r\n\"‘Stalking’ means traveling with the intent to injure or harass another person and,\r\nin the course of, or as a result of, such travel, placing the person in reasonable fear\r\nof death or serious bodily injury to the person or the person’s immediate family.\r\nAmendment 615 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003\r\n\r\nSee 18 U.S.C. § 2261A. ‘Immediate family’ has the meaning set forth in 18 U.S.C.\r\n§ 115(c)(2).\",\r\nand inserting the following:\r\n\"‘Stalking’ means (A) traveling with the intent to kill, injure, harass, or intimidate\r\nanother person and, in the course of, or as a result of, such travel, placing the person\r\nin reasonable fear of death or serious bodily injury to that person or an immediate\r\nfamily member of that person; or (B) using the mail or any facility of interstate or\r\nforeign commerce to engage in a course of conduct that places that person in\r\nreasonable fear of the death of, or serious bodily injury to, that person or an\r\nimmediate family member of that person.

L 106–386 (the \"Act\"). That section\r\namends 18 U.S.C. §§ 2261, 2261A, and 2262 to broaden the reach of those statutes to\r\ninclude international travel to stalk, commit domestic violence, or violate a protective order.\r\nSection 2261A also is amended to broaden the category of persons protected by this statute\r\nto include intimate partners of the person stalked. The Act also creates a new offense at\r\nsection 2261A(2) that prohibits the use of the mail or any facility of interstate or foreign\r\ncommerce to commit a stalking offense. Several technical changes were also made to these\r\nstatutes.\r\nThe Act includes a directive to the Commission to amend the federal sentencing guidelines\r\nto reflect the changes made to 18 U.S.C. § 2261, with specific consideration to be given to\r\nthe following factors: (1) whether the guidelines relating to stalking offenses should be\r\nmodified in light of the amendment made by this subsection; and (2) whether any changes\r\nthe Commission may make to the guidelines pursuant to clause (1) should also be made with\r\nrespect to offenses under chapter 110A of title 18, United States Code (stalking and domestic\r\nviolence offenses).\r\nFor several reasons, the amendment refers the new stalking by mail offense, like other\r\nstalking offenses, to §2A6.2 (Stalking or Domestic Violence). First, the statutory penalties\r\nfor stalking by mail are the same as the statutory penalties for other stalking offenses.\r\nSecond, although there was some consideration to refer this new offense to §2A6.1\r\n(Threatening or Harassing Communications), stalking by mail offenses differ significantly\r\nfrom threatening communications in that the former require the defendant’s intent to kill, or\r\ninjure a person, or place a person in reasonable fear of death or serious bodily injury. Third,\r\nNovember 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II Amendment 616\r\n\r\nreferencing stalking by mail offenses to §2A6.1 could result in these offenses receiving\r\nhigher penalties than other stalking offenses. For example, a defendant who writes a\r\nthreatening letter, violates a protective order, and engages in some conduct evidencing an\r\nintent to carry out such threat, would receive an offense level of level 20 under §2A6.1. A\r\ndefendant who engages in stalking by mail, violates a protective order, and actually commits\r\nbodily injury on the person who is the subject of the protection order would have received,\r\nprior to this amendment, an offense level of level 18 under §2A6.2. This amendment reflects\r\nthe policy judgment that the second defendant should receive punishment equal to, or\r\nperhaps greater than, that received by the first defendant. Accordingly, because of concern\r\nfor proportionality in sentencing stalking and domestic violence offenses relative to other\r\ncrimes, such as threatening or harassing communications, this amendment increases the base\r\noffense level in §2A6.2 from level 14 to level 18. Setting the base offense level at level 18\r\nfor stalking and domestic violence crimes ensures that these offenses are sentenced at or\r\nabove the offense levels for offenses involving threatening and harassing communications.\r\nThe amendment also conforms the definition of \"stalking\" in Application Note 1 of §2A6.2\r\nto the statutory changes made by the Act. Additionally, the amendment modifies the\r\nlanguage of subsection (c) in §2A6.2 to clarify application of the cross reference. This\r\nchange is consistent with the amendment to Application Note 3 of §1B1.5 (Interpretation of\r\nReferences to Other Offense Guidelines), which also clarifies the operation of cross\r\nreferences generally.\r\nThese revisions are designed to clarify that, unless otherwise specified, cross references in\r\nChapter Two (Offense Conduct) are to be determined consistently with the provisions of\r\n§1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct). Therefore, in a case in which the guideline includes a reference\r\nto use another guideline if the conduct involved another offense, the other offense includes\r\nconduct that may be a state or local offense and conduct that occurred under circumstances\r\nthat would constitute a federal offense had the conduct taken place within the territorial or\r\nmaritime jurisdiction of the United States.","EffectiveDate":"Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2001."},{"Id":618,"Title":"Amendment 618","Text":"Chapter Two is amended by striking the heading to Part B, the heading to\r\nSubpart 1 of Part B, and the Introductory Commentary to such subpart as follows:\r\n\" PART B - OFFENSES INVOLVING PROPERTY\r\n1.

For additional\r\nstatutory provision(s), see Appendix A (Statutory Index).\r\nApplication Notes:\r\n1. ‘More than minimal planning,’ ‘firearm,’ and ‘destructive device’ are\r\ndefined in the Commentary to §1B1.1 (Application Instructions).\r\n‘Trade secret’ is defined in 18 U.S.C. § 1839(3).\r\n‘Foreign instrumentality’ and ‘foreign agent’ are defined in 18 U.S.C. §\r\n1839(1) and (2), respectively.\r\n‘National cemetery’ means a cemetery (A) established under section 2400\r\nof title 38, United States Code; or (B) under the jurisdiction of the Secretary\r\nof the Army, the Secretary of the Navy, the Secretary of the Air Force, or\r\nthe Secretary of the Interior.\r\n2. ‘Loss’ means the value of the property taken, damaged, or destroyed.\r\nOrdinarily, when property is taken or destroyed the loss is the fair market\r\nvalue of the particular property at issue. Where the market value is difficult\r\nto ascertain or inadequate to measure harm to the victim, the court may\r\nmeasure loss in some other way, such as reasonable replacement cost to the\r\nvictim. Loss does not include the interest that could have been earned had\r\nthe funds not been stolen. When property is damaged, the loss is the cost\r\nof repairs, not to exceed the loss had the property been destroyed.\r\nExamples: (1) In the case of a theft of a check or money order, the loss is\r\nNovember 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II Amendment 617\r\n\r\nthe loss that would have occurred if the check or money order had been\r\ncashed. (2) In the case of a defendant apprehended taking a vehicle, the\r\nloss is the value of the vehicle even if the vehicle is recovered immediately.\r\nIf the offense involved making a fraudulent loan or credit card application,\r\nor other unlawful conduct involving a loan, a counterfeit access device, or\r\nan unauthorized access device, the loss is to be determined in accordance\r\nwith the Commentary to §2F1.1 (Fraud and Deceit). For example, in\r\naccordance with Application Note 17 of the Commentary to §2F1.1, in a\r\ncase involving an unauthorized access device (such as a stolen credit card),\r\nloss includes any unauthorized charge(s) made with the access device. In\r\nsuch a case, the loss shall be not less than $500 per unauthorized access\r\ndevice. For purposes of this application note, ‘counterfeit access device’\r\nand ‘unauthorized access device’ have the meaning given those terms in 18\r\nU.S.C. § 1029(e)(2) and (e)(3), respectively.\r\nIn certain cases, an offense may involve a series of transactions without a\r\ncorresponding increase in loss. For example, a defendant may embezzle\r\n$5,000 from a bank and conceal this embezzlement by shifting this amount\r\nfrom one account to another in a series of nine transactions over a six-\r\nmonth period. In this example, the loss is $5,000 (the amount taken), not\r\n$45,000 (the sum of the nine transactions), because the additional\r\ntransactions did not increase the actual or potential loss.\r\nIn stolen property offenses (receiving, transporting, transferring,\r\ntransmitting, or possessing stolen property), the loss is the value of the\r\nstolen property determined as in a theft offense.\r\nIn an offense involving unlawfully accessing, or exceeding authorized\r\naccess to, a ‘protected computer’ as defined in 18 U.S.C. § 1030(e)(2)(A)\r\nor (B), ‘loss’ includes the reasonable cost to the victim of conducting a\r\ndamage assessment, restoring the system and data to their condition prior\r\nto the offense, and any lost revenue due to interruption of service.\r\nIn the case of a partially completed offense (e.g., an offense involving a\r\ncompleted theft that is part of a larger, attempted theft), the offense level is\r\nto be determined in accordance with the provisions of §2X1.1 (Attempt,\r\nSolicitation, or Conspiracy) whether the conviction is for the substantive\r\noffense, the inchoate offense (attempt, solicitation, or conspiracy), or both;\r\nsee Application Note 4 in the Commentary to §2X1.1.\r\n3. For the purposes of subsection (b)(1), the loss need not be determined with\r\nprecision. The court need only make a reasonable estimate of the loss,\r\ngiven the available information. This estimate, for example, may be based\r\nupon the approximate number of victims and the average loss to each\r\nvictim, or on more general factors such as the scope and duration of the\r\noffense.\r\n4. Controlled substances should be valued at their estimated street value.\r\nAmendment 617 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003\r\n\r\n5. ‘Undelivered United States mail’ means mail that has not actually been\r\nreceived by the addressee or his agent (e.g., it includes mail that is in the\r\naddressee’s mail box).\r\n6. ‘From the person of another’ refers to property, taken without the use of\r\nforce, that was being held by another person or was within arms’ reach.\r\nExamples include pick-pocketing or non-forcible purse-snatching, such as\r\nthe theft of a purse from a shopping cart.\r\n7. Subsection (b)(5), referring to an ‘organized scheme to steal vehicles or\r\nvehicle parts,’ provides an alternative minimum measure of loss in the case\r\nof an ongoing, sophisticated operation such as an auto theft ring or ‘chop\r\nshop.’ ‘Vehicles’ refers to all forms of vehicles, including aircraft and\r\nwatercraft.\r\n8. ‘Financial institution,’ as used in this guideline, is defined to include any\r\ninstitution described in 18 U.S.C. §§ 20, 656, 657, 1005-1007, and 1014;\r\nany state or foreign bank, trust company, credit union, insurance company,\r\ninvestment company, mutual fund, savings (building and loan) association,\r\nunion or employee pension fund; any health, medical or hospital insurance\r\nassociation; brokers and dealers registered, or required to be registered, with\r\nthe Securities and Exchange Commission; futures commodity merchants\r\nand commodity pool operators registered, or required to be registered, with\r\nthe Commodity Futures Trading Commission; and any similar entity,\r\nwhether or not insured by the federal government. ‘Union or employee\r\npension fund’ and ‘any health, medical, or hospital insurance association,’\r\nas used above, primarily include large pension funds that serve many\r\nindividuals (e.g., pension funds of large national and international\r\norganizations, unions, and corporations doing substantial interstate\r\nbusiness), and associations that undertake to provide pension, disability, or\r\nother benefits (e.g., medical or hospitalization insurance) to large numbers\r\nof persons.\r\n9. An offense shall be deemed to have ‘substantially jeopardized the safety\r\nand soundness of a financial institution’ if, as a consequence of the offense,\r\nthe institution became insolvent; substantially reduced benefits to\r\npensioners or insureds; was unable on demand to refund fully any deposit,\r\npayment, or investment; was so depleted of its assets as to be forced to\r\nmerge with another institution in order to continue active operations; or was\r\nplaced in substantial jeopardy of any of the above.\r\n10. ‘The defendant derived more than $1,000,000 in gross receipts from the\r\noffense,’ as used in subsection (b)(6)(B), generally means that the gross\r\nreceipts to the defendant individually, rather than to all participants,\r\nexceeded $1,000,000. ‘Gross receipts from the offense’ includes all\r\nproperty, real or personal, tangible or intangible, which is obtained directly\r\nor indirectly as a result of such offense. See 18 U.S.C. § 982(a)(4).\r\n11. If the defendant is convicted under 18 U.S.C. § 225 (relating to a continuing\r\nfinancial crimes enterprise), the offense level is that applicable to the\r\nNovember 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II Amendment 617\r\n\r\nunderlying series of offenses comprising the ‘continuing financial crimes\r\nenterprise.’\r\n12. If subsection (b)(6)(A) or (B) applies, there shall be a rebuttable\r\npresumption that the offense involved ‘more than minimal planning.’\r\n13. If the offense involved theft or embezzlement from an employee pension or\r\nwelfare benefit plan (a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 664) and the defendant was\r\na fiduciary of the benefit plan, an adjustment under §3B1.3 (Abuse of\r\nPosition of Trust or Use of Special Skill) will apply. ‘Fiduciary of the\r\nbenefit plan’ is defined in 29 U.S.C. § 1002(21)(A) to mean a person who\r\nexercises any discretionary authority or control in respect to the\r\nmanagement of such plan or exercises authority or control in respect to\r\nmanagement or disposition of its assets, or who renders investment advice\r\nfor a fee or other direct or indirect compensation with respect to any\r\nmoneys or other property of such plan, or has any authority or responsibility\r\nto do so, or who has any discretionary authority or responsibility in the\r\nadministration of such plan.\r\nIf the offense involved theft or embezzlement from a labor union (a\r\nviolation of 29 U.S.C. § 501(c)) and the defendant was a union officer or\r\noccupied a position of trust in the union as set forth in 29 U.S.C. § 501(a),\r\nan adjustment under §3B1.3 (Abuse of Position of Trust or Use of Special\r\nSkill) will apply.\r\n14. In cases where the loss determined under subsection (b)(1) does not fully\r\ncapture the harmfulness of the conduct, an upward departure may be\r\nwarranted. For example, the theft of personal information or writings (e.g.,\r\nmedical records, educational records, a diary) may involve a substantial\r\ninvasion of a privacy interest that would not be addressed by the monetary\r\nloss provisions of subsection (b)(1).\r\n15. In cases involving theft of information from a ‘protected computer’, as\r\ndefined in 18 U.S.C. § 1030(e)(2)(A) or (B), an upward departure may be\r\nwarranted where the defendant sought the stolen information to further a\r\nbroader criminal purpose.\r\nBackground: The value of the property stolen plays an important role in\r\ndetermining sentences for theft and other offenses involving stolen property because\r\nit is an indicator of both the harm to the victim and the gain to the defendant.\r\nBecause of the structure of the Sentencing Table (Chapter 5, Part A), subsection\r\n(b)(1) results in an overlapping range of enhancements based on the loss.\r\nThe guidelines provide an enhancement for more than minimal planning,\r\nwhich includes most offense behavior involving affirmative acts on multiple\r\noccasions. Planning and repeated acts are indicative of an intention and potential\r\nto do considerable harm. Also, planning is often related to increased difficulties of\r\ndetection and proof.\r\nConsistent with statutory distinctions, an increased minimum offense level\r\nAmendment 617 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003\r\n\r\nis provided for the theft of undelivered mail. Theft of undelivered mail interferes\r\nwith a governmental function, and the scope of the theft may be difficult to\r\nascertain.\r\nTheft from the person of another, such as pickpocketing or non-forcible\r\npurse-snatching, receives an enhanced sentence because of the increased risk of\r\nphysical injury. This guideline does not include an enhancement for thefts from the\r\nperson by means of force or fear; such crimes are robberies.\r\nA minimum offense level of 14 is provided for offenses involving an\r\norganized scheme to steal vehicles or vehicle parts. Typically, the scope of such\r\nactivity is substantial (i.e., the value of the stolen property, combined with an\r\nenhancement for ‘more than minimal planning’ would itself result in an offense\r\nlevel of at least 14), but the value of the property is particularly difficult to ascertain\r\nin individual cases because the stolen property is rapidly resold or otherwise\r\ndisposed of in the course of the offense. Therefore, the specific offense\r\ncharacteristic of ‘organized scheme’ is used as an alternative to ‘loss’ in setting the\r\noffense level.\r\nSubsection (b)(6)(A) implements, in a broader form, the instruction to the\r\nCommission in section 961(m) of Public Law 101-73.\r\nSubsection (b)(6)(B) implements the instruction to the Commission in\r\nsection 2507 of Public Law 101-647.\r\nSubsection (b)(8) implements the instruction to the Commission in section\r\n2 of Public Law 105–101.\".\r\nA replacement guideline with accompanying commentary is inserted as §2B1.1 (Larceny,\r\nEmbezzlement, and Other Forms of Theft; Offenses Involving Stolen Property; Property\r\nDamage or Destruction; Fraud and Deceit; Forgery; Offenses Involving Altered or\r\nCounterfeit Instruments Other than Counterfeit Bearer Obligations of the United States).\r\nChapter Two, Part B is amended by striking §2B1.3 and its accompanying commentary as\r\nfollows:\r\n\"§2B1.3.

For\r\nadditional statutory provision(s), see Appendix A (Statutory Index).\r\nApplication Notes:\r\n1. ‘More than minimal planning’ is defined in the Commentary to §1B1.1\r\n(Application Instructions).\r\n‘National cemetery’ means a cemetery (A) established under section 2400\r\nof title 38, United States Code; or (B) under the jurisdiction of the Secretary\r\nof the Army, the Secretary of the Navy, the Secretary of the Air Force, or\r\nthe Secretary of the Interior.\r\n2. Valuation of loss is discussed in the Commentary to §2B1.1 (Larceny,\r\nEmbezzlement, and Other Forms of Theft).\r\n3. ‘Undelivered United States mail’ means mail that has not been received by\r\nthe addressee or his agent (e.g., it includes mail that is in the addressee’s\r\nmailbox).\r\n4. In some cases, the monetary value of the property damaged or destroyed\r\nmay not adequately reflect the extent of the harm caused. For example, the\r\ndestruction of a $500 telephone line or interference with a\r\ntelecommunications network may cause an interruption in service to\r\nthousands of people for several hours, with attendant life-threatening delay\r\nin the delivery of emergency medical treatment or disruption of other\r\nimportant governmental or private services. In such cases, an upward\r\nAmendment 617 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003\r\n\r\ndeparture may be warranted. See §§5K2.2 (Physical Injury), 5K2.7\r\n(Disruption of Governmental Function), and 5K2.14 (Public Welfare).\r\nBackground: Subsection (b)(4) implements the instruction to the Commission in\r\nsection 2 of Public Law 105–101.\r\nSubsection (d) implements the instruction to the Commission in section\r\n805(c) of Public Law 104-132.\".\r\nChapter Two is amended by striking Part F in its entirety as follows:\r\n\"PART F - OFFENSES INVOLVING FRAUD OR DECEIT\r\n§2F1.1.

If the resulting offense level\r\nis less than level 24, increase to level 24.\r\n(c) Special Instruction\r\n(1) If the defendant is convicted under 18 U.S.C. §\r\n1030(a)(4), the minimum guideline sentence,\r\nnotwithstanding any other adjustment, shall be six\r\nmonths’ imprisonment.\r\nCommentary\r\nStatutory Provisions: 7 U.S.C. §§ 6, 6b, 6c, 6h, 6o, 13, 23; 15 U.S.C. §§ 50, 77e,\r\n77q, 77x, 78j, 78ff, 80b-6, 1644; 18 U.S.C. §§ 225, 285-289, 471-473, 500, 510,\r\n659, 1001-1008, 1010-1014, 1016-1022, 1025, 1026, 1028, 1029, 1030(a)(4), 1031,\r\n1341-1344, 2314, 2315. For additional statutory provision(s), see Appendix A\r\n(Statutory Index).\r\nApplication Notes:\r\n1. The adjustments in §2F1.1(b)(4) are alternative rather than cumulative. If\r\nin a particular case, however, both of the enumerated factors applied, an\r\nupward departure might be warranted.\r\n2. ‘More than minimal planning’ (subsection (b)(2)(A)) is defined in the\r\nCommentary to §1B1.1 (Application Instructions).\r\n3. ‘Mass-marketing,’ as used in subsection (b)(3), means a plan, program,\r\npromotion, or campaign that is conducted through solicitation by telephone,\r\nmail, the Internet, or other means to induce a large number of persons to (A)\r\npurchase goods or services; (B) participate in a contest or sweepstakes; or\r\n(C) invest for financial profit. The enhancement would apply, for example,\r\nif the defendant conducted or participated in a telemarketing campaign that\r\nsolicited a large number of individuals to purchase fraudulent life insurance\r\npolicies.\r\n4. ‘Scheme to defraud more than one victim,’ as used in subsection (b)(2)(B),\r\nrefers to a design or plan to obtain something of value from more than one\r\nNovember 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II Amendment 617\r\n\r\nperson. In this context, \"victim\" refers to the person or entity from which\r\nthe funds are to come directly. Thus, a wire fraud in which a single\r\ntelephone call was made to three distinct individuals to get each of them to\r\ninvest in a pyramid scheme would involve a scheme to defraud more than\r\none victim, but passing a fraudulently endorsed check would not, even\r\nthough the maker, payee and/or payor all might be considered victims for\r\nother purposes, such as restitution.\r\n5. Subsection (b)(4)(A) provides an adjustment for a misrepresentation that the\r\ndefendant was acting on behalf of a charitable, educational, religious or\r\npolitical organization, or a government agency. Examples of conduct to\r\nwhich this factor applies would include a group of defendants who solicit\r\ncontributions to a non-existent famine relief organization by mail, a\r\ndefendant who diverts donations for a religiously affiliated school by\r\ntelephone solicitations to church members in which the defendant falsely\r\nclaims to be a fund-raiser for the school, or a defendant who poses as a\r\nfederal collection agent in order to collect a delinquent student loan.\r\n6. Subsection (b)(4)(C) provides an enhancement if the defendant commits a\r\nfraud in contravention of a prior, official judicial or administrative warning,\r\nin the form of an order, injunction, decree, or process, to take or not to take\r\na specified action. A defendant who does not comply with such a prior,\r\nofficial judicial or administrative warning demonstrates aggravated criminal\r\nintent and deserves additional punishment. If it is established that an entity\r\nthe defendant controlled was a party to the prior proceeding that resulted in\r\nthe official judicial or administrative action, and the defendant had\r\nknowledge of that prior decree or order, this enhancement applies even if\r\nthe defendant was not a specifically named party in that prior case. For\r\nexample, a defendant whose business previously was enjoined from selling\r\na dangerous product, but who nonetheless engaged in fraudulent conduct to\r\nsell the product, is subject to this enhancement. This enhancement does not\r\napply if the same conduct resulted in an enhancement pursuant to a\r\nprovision found elsewhere in the guidelines (e.g., a violation of a condition\r\nof release addressed in §2J1.7 (Commission of Offense While on Release)\r\nor a violation of probation addressed in §4A1.1 (Criminal History\r\nCategory)).\r\nIf the conduct that forms the basis for an enhancement under (b)(4)(B) or\r\n(C) is the only conduct that forms the basis for an adjustment under §3C1.1\r\n(Obstruction of Justice), do not apply an adjustment under §3C1.1.\r\n7. Some fraudulent schemes may result in multiple-count indictments,\r\ndepending on the technical elements of the offense. The cumulative loss\r\nproduced by a common scheme or course of conduct should be used in\r\ndetermining the offense level, regardless of the number of counts of\r\nconviction. See Chapter Three, Part D (Multiple Counts).\r\n8. Valuation of loss is discussed in the Commentary to §2B1.1 (Larceny,\r\nEmbezzlement, and Other Forms of Theft). As in theft cases, loss is the\r\nvalue of the money, property, or services unlawfully taken; it does not, for\r\nAmendment 617 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003\r\n\r\nexample, include interest the victim could have earned on such funds had\r\nthe offense not occurred. Consistent with the provisions of §2X1.1\r\n(Attempt, Solicitation, or Conspiracy), if an intended loss that the defendant\r\nwas attempting to inflict can be determined, this figure will be used if it is\r\ngreater than the actual loss. Frequently, loss in a fraud case will be the\r\nsame as in a theft case. For example, if the fraud consisted of selling or\r\nattempting to sell $40,000 in worthless securities, or representing that a\r\nforged check for $40,000 was genuine, the loss would be $40,000.\r\nThere are, however, instances where additional factors are to be considered\r\nin determining the loss or intended loss:\r\n(a) Fraud Involving Misrepresentation of the Value of an Item or\r\nProduct Substitution\r\nA fraud may involve the misrepresentation of the value of an item\r\nthat does have some value (in contrast to an item that is worthless).\r\nWhere, for example, a defendant fraudulently represents that stock\r\nis worth $40,000 and the stock is worth only $10,000, the loss is\r\nthe amount by which the stock was overvalued (i.e., $30,000). In\r\na case involving a misrepresentation concerning the quality of a\r\nconsumer product, the loss is the difference between the amount\r\npaid by the victim for the product and the amount for which the\r\nvictim could resell the product received.\r\n(b) Fraudulent Loan Application and Contract Procurement Cases\r\nIn fraudulent loan application cases and contract procurement\r\ncases, the loss is the actual loss to the victim (or if the loss has not\r\nyet come about, the expected loss). For example, if a defendant\r\nfraudulently obtains a loan by misrepresenting the value of his\r\nassets, the loss is the amount of the loan not repaid at the time the\r\noffense is discovered, reduced by the amount the lending institution\r\nhas recovered (or can expect to recover) from any assets pledged to\r\nsecure the loan. However, where the intended loss is greater than\r\nthe actual loss, the intended loss is to be used.\r\nIn some cases, the loss determined above may significantly\r\nunderstate or overstate the seriousness of the defendant’s conduct.\r\nFor example, where the defendant substantially understated his\r\ndebts to obtain a loan, which he nevertheless repaid, the loss\r\ndetermined above (zero loss) will tend not to reflect adequately the\r\nrisk of loss created by the defendant’s conduct. Conversely, a\r\ndefendant may understate his debts to a limited degree to obtain a\r\nloan (e.g., to expand a grain export business), which he genuinely\r\nexpected to repay and for which he would have qualified at a\r\nhigher interest rate had he made truthful disclosure, but he is unable\r\nto repay the loan because of some unforeseen event (e.g., an\r\nembargo imposed on grain exports) which would have caused a\r\ndefault in any event. In such a case, the loss determined above may\r\nNovember 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II Amendment 617\r\n\r\noverstate the seriousness of the defendant’s conduct. Where the\r\nloss determined above significantly understates or overstates the\r\nseriousness of the defendant’s conduct, an upward or downward\r\ndeparture may be warranted.\r\n(c) Consequential Damages in Procurement Fraud and Product\r\nSubstitution Cases\r\nIn contrast to other types of cases, loss in a procurement fraud or\r\nproduct substitution case includes not only direct damages, but also\r\nconsequential damages that were reasonably foreseeable. For\r\nexample, in a case involving a defense product substitution offense,\r\nthe loss includes the government’s reasonably foreseeable costs of\r\nmaking substitute transactions and handling or disposing of the\r\nproduct delivered or retrofitting the product so that it can be used\r\nfor its intended purpose, plus the government’s reasonably\r\nforeseeable cost of rectifying the actual or potential disruption to\r\ngovernment operations caused by the product substitution.\r\nSimilarly, in the case of fraud affecting a defense contract award,\r\nloss includes the reasonably foreseeable administrative cost to the\r\ngovernment and other participants of repeating or correcting the\r\nprocurement action affected, plus any increased cost to procure the\r\nproduct or service involved that was reasonably foreseeable.\r\nInclusion of reasonably foreseeable consequential damages directly\r\nin the calculation of loss in procurement fraud and product\r\nsubstitution cases reflects that such damages frequently are\r\nsubstantial in such cases.\r\n(d) Diversion of Government Program Benefits\r\nIn a case involving diversion of government program benefits, loss\r\nis the value of the benefits diverted from intended recipients or\r\nuses.\r\n(e) Davis-Bacon Act Cases\r\nIn a case involving a Davis-Bacon Act violation (a violation of 40\r\nU.S.C. § 276a, criminally prosecuted under 18 U.S.C. § 1001), the\r\nloss is the difference between the legally required and actual wages\r\npaid.\r\n9. For the purposes of subsection (b)(1), the loss need not be determined with\r\nprecision. The court need only make a reasonable estimate of the loss,\r\ngiven the available information. This estimate, for example, may be based\r\non the approximate number of victims and an estimate of the average loss\r\nto each victim, or on more general factors, such as the nature and duration\r\nof the fraud and the revenues generated by similar operations. The\r\noffender’s gain from committing the fraud is an alternative estimate that\r\nordinarily will underestimate the loss.\r\nAmendment 617 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003\r\n\r\n10. In the case of a partially completed offense (e.g., an offense involving a\r\ncompleted fraud that is part of a larger, attempted fraud), the offense level\r\nis to be determined in accordance with the provisions of §2X1.1 (Attempt,\r\nSolicitation, or Conspiracy) whether the conviction is for the substantive\r\noffense, the inchoate offense (attempt, solicitation, or conspiracy), or both;\r\nsee Application Note 4 in the Commentary to §2X1.1.\r\n11. In cases in which the loss determined under subsection (b)(1) does not fully\r\ncapture the harmfulness and seriousness of the conduct, an upward\r\ndeparture may be warranted. Examples may include the following:\r\n(a) a primary objective of the fraud was non-monetary; or the fraud\r\ncaused or risked reasonably foreseeable, substantial non-monetary\r\nharm;\r\n(b) false statements were made for the purpose of facilitating some\r\nother crime;\r\n(c) the offense caused reasonably foreseeable, physical or\r\npsychological harm or severe emotional trauma;\r\n(d) the offense endangered national security or military readiness;\r\n(e) the offense caused a loss of confidence in an important institution;\r\n(f) the offense involved the knowing endangerment of the solvency of\r\none or more victims.\r\nIn a few instances, the loss determined under subsection (b)(1) may\r\noverstate the seriousness of the offense. This may occur, for example,\r\nwhere a defendant attempted to negotiate an instrument that was so\r\nobviously fraudulent that no one would seriously consider honoring it. In\r\nsuch cases, a downward departure may be warranted.\r\n12. Offenses involving access devices, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 1028 and\r\n1029, are also covered by this guideline. In such a case, an upward\r\ndeparture may be warranted where the actual loss does not adequately\r\nreflect the seriousness of the conduct.\r\nOffenses involving identification documents, false identification documents,\r\nand means of identification, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1028, also are\r\ncovered by this guideline. If the primary purpose of the offense was to\r\nviolate, or assist another to violate, the law pertaining to naturalization,\r\ncitizenship, or legal resident status, apply §2L2.1 (Trafficking in a\r\nDocument Relating to Naturalization) or §2L2.2 (Fraudulently Acquiring\r\nDocuments Relating to Naturalization), as appropriate, rather than §2F1.1.\r\n13. If the fraud exploited vulnerable victims, an enhancement will apply. See\r\n§3A1.1 (Hate Crime Motivation or Vulnerable Victim).\r\nNovember 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II Amendment 617\r\n\r\n14. Sometimes, offenses involving fraudulent statements are prosecuted under\r\n18 U.S.C. § 1001, or a similarly general statute, although the offense is also\r\ncovered by a more specific statute. Examples include false entries\r\nregarding currency transactions, for which §2S1.3 would be more apt, and\r\nfalse statements to a customs officer, for which §2T3.1 likely would be\r\nmore apt. In certain other cases, the mail or wire fraud statutes, or other\r\nrelatively broad statutes, are used primarily as jurisdictional bases for the\r\nprosecution of other offenses. For example, a state arson offense where a\r\nfraudulent insurance claim was mailed might be prosecuted as mail fraud.\r\nWhere the indictment or information setting forth the count of conviction\r\n(or a stipulation as described in §1B1.2(a)) establishes an offense more\r\naptly covered by another guideline, apply that guideline rather than §2F1.1.\r\nOtherwise, in such cases, §2F1.1 is to be applied, but a departure from the\r\nguidelines may be considered.\r\n15. For purposes of subsection (b)(5)—\r\n‘Counterfeit access device’ (A) has the meaning given that term in 18\r\nU.S.C. § 1029(e)(2); and (B) also includes a telecommunications instrument\r\nthat has been modified or altered to obtain unauthorized use of\r\ntelecommunications service. ‘Telecommunications service’ has the\r\nmeaning given that term in 18 U.S.C. § 1029(e)(9).\r\n‘Device-making equipment’ (A) has the meaning given that term in 18\r\nU.S.C. § 1029(e)(6); and (B) also includes (i) any hardware or software that\r\nhas been configured as described in 18 U.S.C. § 1029(a)(9); and (ii) a\r\nscanning receiver referred to in 18 U.S.C. § 1029(a)(8). ‘Scanning receiver’\r\nhas the meaning given that term in 18 U.S.C. § 1029(e)(8).\r\n‘Means of identification’ has the meaning given that term in 18 U.S.C.\r\n§ 1028(d)(3), except that such means of identification shall be of an actual\r\n(i.e., not fictitious) individual other than the defendant or a person for\r\nwhose conduct the defendant is accountable under §1B1.3 (Relevant\r\nConduct).\r\n‘Produce’ includes manufacture, design, alter, authenticate, duplicate, or\r\nassemble. ‘Production’ includes manufacture, design, alteration,\r\nauthentication, duplication, or assembly.\r\n‘Unauthorized access device’ has the meaning given that term in 18 U.S.C.\r\n§ 1029(e)(3).\r\n16. Subsection (b)(5)(C)(i) applies in a case in which a means of identification\r\nof an individual other than the defendant (or a person for whose conduct the\r\ndefendant is accountable under §1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct)) is used without\r\nthat individual’s authorization unlawfully to produce or obtain another\r\nmeans of identification.\r\nExamples of conduct to which this subsection should apply are as follows:\r\nAmendment 617 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003\r\n\r\n(A) A defendant obtains an individual’s name and social security\r\nnumber from a source (e.g., from a piece of mail taken from the\r\nindividual’s mailbox) and obtains a bank loan in that individual’s\r\nname. In this example, the account number of the bank loan is the\r\nother means of identification that has been obtained unlawfully.\r\n(B) A defendant obtains an individual’s name and address from a\r\nsource (e.g., from a driver’s license in a stolen wallet) and applies\r\nfor, obtains, and subsequently uses a credit card in that individual’s\r\nname. In this example, the credit card is the other means of\r\nidentification that has been obtained unlawfully.\r\nExamples of conduct to which subsection (b)(5)(C)(i) should not apply are\r\nas follows:\r\n(A) A defendant uses a credit card from a stolen wallet only to make a\r\npurchase. In such a case, the defendant has not used the stolen\r\ncredit card to obtain another means of identification.\r\n(B) A defendant forges another individual’s signature to cash a stolen\r\ncheck. Forging another individual’s signature is not producing\r\nanother means of identification.\r\nSubsection (b)(5)(C)(ii) applies in any case in which the offense involved\r\nthe possession of 5 or more means of identification that unlawfully were\r\nproduced or obtained, regardless of the number of individuals in whose\r\nname (or other identifying information) the means of identification were so\r\nproduced or so obtained.\r\nIn a case involving unlawfully produced or unlawfully obtained means of\r\nidentification, an upward departure may be warranted if the offense level\r\ndoes not adequately address the seriousness of the offense. Examples may\r\ninclude the following:\r\n(A) The offense caused substantial harm to the victim’s reputation or\r\ncredit record, or the victim suffered a substantial inconvenience\r\nrelated to repairing the victim’s reputation or a damaged credit\r\nrecord.\r\n(B) An individual whose means of identification the defendant used to\r\nobtain unlawful means of identification is erroneously arrested or\r\ndenied a job because an arrest record has been made in the\r\nindividual’s name.\r\n(C) The defendant produced or obtained numerous means of\r\nidentification with respect to one individual and essentially\r\nassumed that individual’s identity.\r\n17. In a case involving any counterfeit access device or unauthorized access\r\ndevice, loss includes any unauthorized charges made with the counterfeit\r\nNovember 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II Amendment 617\r\n\r\naccess device or unauthorized access device. In any such case, loss shall be\r\nnot less than $500 per access device. However, if the unauthorized access\r\ndevice is a means of telecommunications access that identifies a specific\r\ntelecommunications instrument or telecommunications account (including\r\nan electronic serial number/mobile identification number (ESN/MIN) pair),\r\nand that means was only possessed, and not used, during the commission\r\nof the offense, loss shall be not less than $100 per unused means. For\r\npurposes of this application note, ‘counterfeit access device’ and\r\n‘unauthorized access device’ have the meaning given those terms in\r\nApplication Note 15.\r\n18. For purposes of subsection (b)(6)(B), ‘United States’ means each of the 50\r\nstates, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the\r\nUnited States Virgin Islands, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, and\r\nAmerican Samoa.\r\nFor purposes of subsection (b)(6)(C), ‘sophisticated means’ means\r\nespecially complex or especially intricate offense conduct pertaining to the\r\nexecution or concealment of an offense. For example, in a telemarketing\r\nscheme, locating the main office of the scheme in one jurisdiction but\r\nlocating soliciting operations in another jurisdiction would ordinarily\r\nindicate sophisticated means. Conduct such as hiding assets or transactions,\r\nor both, through the use of fictitious entities, corporate shells, or offshore\r\nbank accounts also ordinarily would indicate sophisticated means.\r\nThe enhancement for sophisticated means under subsection (b)(6)(C)\r\nrequires conduct that is significantly more complex or intricate than the\r\nconduct that may form the basis for an enhancement for more than minimal\r\nplanning under subsection (b)(2)(A).\r\nIf the conduct that forms the basis for an enhancement under subsection\r\n(b)(6) is the only conduct that forms the basis for an adjustment under\r\n§3C1.1 (Obstruction of Justice), do not apply an adjustment under §3C1.1.\r\n19. ‘Financial institution,’ as used in this guideline, is defined to include any\r\ninstitution described in 18 U.S.C. §§ 20, 656, 657, 1005-1007, and 1014;\r\nany state or foreign bank, trust company, credit union, insurance company,\r\ninvestment company, mutual fund, savings (building and loan) association,\r\nunion or employee pension fund; any health, medical or hospital insurance\r\nassociation; brokers and dealers registered, or required to be registered, with\r\nthe Securities and Exchange Commission; futures commodity merchants\r\nand commodity pool operators registered, or required to be registered, with\r\nthe Commodity Futures Trading Commission; and any similar entity,\r\nwhether or not insured by the federal government. ‘Union or employee\r\npension fund’ and ‘any health, medical, or hospital insurance association,’\r\nas used above, primarily include large pension funds that serve many\r\nindividuals (e.g., pension funds of large national and international\r\norganizations, unions, and corporations doing substantial interstate\r\nbusiness), and associations that undertake to provide pension, disability, or\r\nother benefits (e.g., medical or hospitalization insurance) to large numbers\r\nAmendment 617 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003\r\n\r\nof persons.\r\n20. An offense shall be deemed to have ‘substantially jeopardized the safety\r\nand soundness of a financial institution’ if, as a consequence of the offense,\r\nthe institution became insolvent; substantially reduced benefits to\r\npensioners or insureds; was unable on demand to refund fully any deposit,\r\npayment, or investment; was so depleted of its assets as to be forced to\r\nmerge with another institution in order to continue active operations; or was\r\nplaced in substantial jeopardy of any of the above.\r\n21. ‘The defendant derived more than $1,000,000 in gross receipts from the\r\noffense,’ as used in subsection (b)(8)(B), generally means that the gross\r\nreceipts to the defendant individually, rather than to all participants,\r\nexceeded $1,000,000. ‘Gross receipts from the offense’ includes all\r\nproperty, real or personal, tangible or intangible, which is obtained directly\r\nor indirectly as a result of such offense. See 18 U.S.C. § 982(a)(4).\r\n22. If the defendant is convicted under 18 U.S.C. § 225 (relating to a continuing\r\nfinancial crimes enterprise), the offense level is that applicable to the\r\nunderlying series of offenses comprising the ‘continuing financial crimes\r\nenterprise.’\r\n23. If subsection (b)(5), subsection (b)(8)(A), or subsection (b)(8)(B) applies,\r\nthere shall be a rebuttable presumption that the offense also involved more\r\nthan minimal planning for purposes of subsection (b)(2).\r\nIf the conduct that forms the basis for an enhancement under subsection\r\n(b)(5) is the only conduct that forms the basis of an enhancement under\r\nsubsection (b)(6), do not apply an enhancement under subsection (b)(6).\r\nBackground: This guideline is designed to apply to a wide variety of fraud cases.\r\nThe statutory maximum term of imprisonment for most such offenses is five years.\r\nThe guideline does not link offense characteristics to specific code sections.\r\nBecause federal fraud statutes are so broadly written, a single pattern of offense\r\nconduct usually can be prosecuted under several code sections, as a result of which\r\nthe offense of conviction may be somewhat arbitrary. Furthermore, most fraud\r\nstatutes cover a broad range of conduct with extreme variation in severity.\r\nEmpirical analyses of pre-guidelines practice showed that the most\r\nimportant factors that determined sentence length were the amount of loss and\r\nwhether the offense was an isolated crime of opportunity or was sophisticated or\r\nrepeated. Accordingly, although they are imperfect, these are the primary factors\r\nupon which the guideline has been based.\r\nThe extent to which an offense is planned or sophisticated is important in\r\nassessing its potential harmfulness and the dangerousness of the offender,\r\nindependent of the actual harm. A complex scheme or repeated incidents of fraud\r\nare indicative of an intention and potential to do considerable harm. In pre-\r\nguidelines practice, this factor had a significant impact, especially in frauds\r\ninvolving small losses. Accordingly, the guideline specifies a 2-level enhancement\r\nNovember 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II Amendment 617\r\n\r\nwhen this factor is present.\r\nUse of false pretenses involving charitable causes and government agencies\r\nenhances the sentences of defendants who take advantage of victims’ trust in\r\ngovernment or law enforcement agencies or their generosity and charitable motives.\r\nTaking advantage of a victim’s self-interest does not mitigate the seriousness of\r\nfraudulent conduct. However, defendants who exploit victims’ charitable impulses\r\nor trust in government create particular social harm. The commission of a fraud in\r\nthe course of a bankruptcy proceeding subjects the defendant to an enhanced\r\nsentence because that fraudulent conduct undermines the bankruptcy process as well\r\nas harms others with an interest in the bankruptcy estate.\r\nOffenses that involve the use of transactions or accounts outside the United\r\nStates in an effort to conceal illicit profits and criminal conduct involve a\r\nparticularly high level of sophistication and complexity. These offenses are difficult\r\nto detect and require costly investigations and prosecutions. Diplomatic processes\r\noften must be used to secure testimony and evidence beyond the jurisdiction of\r\nUnited States courts. Consequently, a minimum level of 12 is provided for these\r\noffenses.\r\nSubsections (b)(5)(A) and(B) implement the instruction to the Commission\r\nin section 4 of the Wireless Telephone Protection Act, Public Law 105–172.\r\nSubsection (b)(5)(C) implements the directive to the Commission in section\r\n4 of the Identity Theft and Assumption Deterrence Act of 1998, Public Law\r\n105–318. This subsection focuses principally on an aggravated form of identity\r\ntheft known as ‘affirmative identity theft’ or ‘breeding,’ in which a defendant uses\r\nanother individual’s name, social security number, or some other form of\r\nidentification (the ‘means of identification’) to ‘breed’ (i.e., produce or obtain) new\r\nor additional forms of identification. Because 18 U.S.C. § 1028(d) broadly defines\r\n‘means of identification,’ the new or additional forms of identification can include\r\nitems such as a driver’s license, a credit card, or a bank loan. This subsection\r\nprovides a minimum offense level of level 12, in part, because of the seriousness of\r\nthe offense. The minimum offense level accounts for the fact that the means of\r\nidentification that were ‘bred’ (i.e., produced or obtained) often are within the\r\ndefendant’s exclusive control, making it difficult for the individual victim to detect\r\nthat the victim’s identity has been ‘stolen.’ Generally, the victim does not become\r\naware of the offense until certain harms have already occurred (e.g., a damaged\r\ncredit rating or inability to obtain a loan). The minimum offense level also accounts\r\nfor the non-monetary harm associated with these types of offenses, much of which\r\nmay be difficult or impossible to quantify (e.g., harm to the individual’s reputation\r\nor credit rating, inconvenience, and other difficulties resulting from the offense).\r\nThe legislative history of the Identity Theft and Assumption Deterrence Act of 1998\r\nindicates that Congress was especially concerned with providing increased\r\npunishment for this type of harm.\r\nSubsection (b)(6) implements, in a broader form, the instruction to the\r\nCommission in section 6(c)(2) of Public Law 105–184.\r\nSubsection (b)(7)(B) implements, in a broader form, the instruction to the\r\nAmendment 617 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003\r\n\r\nCommission in section 110512 of Public Law 103–322.\r\nSubsection (b)(8)(A) implements, in a broader form, the instruction to the\r\nCommission in section 961(m) of Public Law 101–73.\r\nSubsection (b)(8)(B) implements the instruction to the Commission in\r\nsection 2507 of Public Law 101–647.\r\nSubsection (c) implements the instruction to the Commission in section\r\n805(c) of Public Law 104–132.\r\n§2F1.2.

Section 3B1.3 (Abuse of Position of Trust or Use of Special Skill) should\r\nbe applied only if the defendant occupied and abused a position of special\r\ntrust. Examples might include a corporate president or an attorney who\r\nmisused information regarding a planned but unannounced takeover\r\nattempt. It typically would not apply to an ordinary ‘tippee.’\r\nBackground: This guideline applies to certain violations of Rule 10b-5 that are\r\ncommonly referred to as ‘insider trading.’ Insider trading is treated essentially as\r\na sophisticated fraud. Because the victims and their losses are difficult if not\r\nimpossible to identify, the gain, i.e., the total increase in value realized through\r\ntrading in securities by the defendant and persons acting in concert with him or to\r\nwhom he provided inside information, is employed instead of the victims’ losses.\r\nCertain other offenses, e.g., 7 U.S.C. § 13(e), that involve misuse of inside\r\ninformation for personal gain also may appropriately be covered by this guideline.\".\r\nChapter Two, Part B, Subpart 1, is amended by adding at the end the following:\r\n\"§2B1.4. Insider Trading\r\n(a) Base Offense Level: 8\r\nNovember 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II Amendment 617\r\n\r\n(b) Specific Offense Characteristic\r\n(1) If the gain resulting from the offense exceeded\r\n$5,000, increase by the number of levels from the\r\ntable in §2B1.1 (Theft, Property Destruction, and\r\nFraud) corresponding to that amount.\r\nCommentary\r\nStatutory Provisions: 15 U.S.C. § 78j and 17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5.

Application of Subsection of §3B1.3.—Section 3B1.3 (Abuse of Position\r\nof Trust or Use of Special Skill) should be applied only if the defendant\r\noccupied and abused a position of special trust.

Consequently, this adjustment will apply especially\r\nfrequently in property offenses.\r\nIn an assault, for example, waiting to commit the offense when no witnesses\r\nwere present would not alone constitute more than minimal planning. By\r\ncontrast, luring the victim to a specific location, or wearing a ski mask to\r\nprevent identification, would constitute more than minimal planning.\r\nAmendment 617 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003\r\n\r\nIn a commercial burglary, for example, checking the area to make sure no\r\nwitnesses were present would not alone constitute more than minimal\r\nplanning.

Similarly, fashioning a special\r\ndevice to conceal the property, or obtaining information on delivery dates\r\nso that an especially valuable item could be obtained, would constitute more\r\nthan minimal planning.\r\nIn an embezzlement, a single taking accomplished by a false book entry\r\nwould constitute only minimal planning.

The\r\nmajor parts of the amendment are: (1) consolidation of the theft, property destruction, and\r\nfraud guidelines; (2) a revised, common loss table for the consolidated guideline, and a\r\nsimilar table for tax offenses; (3) a revised, common definition of loss for the consolidated\r\nguideline; (4) revisions to guidelines that refer to the loss table in the consolidated guideline;\r\n(5) technical and conforming amendments; and (6) amendments regarding tax loss.\r\nConsolidation of Theft, Property Destruction, and Fraud; Miscellaneous Revisions\r\nThe first part of this amendment consolidates the guidelines for theft, §2B1.1 (Larceny,\r\nEmbezzlement, and Other Forms of Theft; Receiving, Transporting, Transferring,\r\nTransmitting, or Possessing Stolen Property), property destruction, §2B1.3 (Property\r\nDamage or Destruction), and fraud, §2F1.1 (Fraud and Deceit; Forgery; Offenses Involving\r\nAltered or Counterfeit Instruments Other than Counterfeit Bearer Obligations of the United\r\nStates) into one guideline, §2B1.1 (Theft, Property Destruction, and Fraud). Consolidation\r\nwill provide similar treatment for similar offenses for which pecuniary harm is a major factor\r\nin determining the offense level and, therefore, decrease unwarranted sentencing disparity\r\nthat may be caused by undue complexity in the guidelines. Consolidation addresses\r\nconcerns raised over several years by probation officers, judges, and practitioners about the\r\ndifficulties of determining for particular cases, whether to apply §2B1.1 or §2F1.1 and the\r\ndisparate sentencing outcomes that can result depending on that decision. Commentators\r\nhave noted that inasmuch as theft and fraud offenses are conceptually similar, there is no\r\nstrong reason to sentence them differently.\r\nThe base offense level for the consolidated guideline is level 6. This maintains the base\r\noffense level for fraud offenses, but represents a two-level increase for theft and property\r\ndestruction offenses, which prior to this amendment was level 4. The increase of two levels\r\nin the base offense levels for theft and property destruction offenses will have minimal\r\nimpact for low-level theft offenses involving offenders in criminal history Category I or\r\nCategory II. Commission analysis indicates that only a few defendants will move from Zone\r\nA (where probation without conditions of confinement is possible) to Zone B or Zone C, and\r\nthose that are moved into a zone at higher offense levels in the Sentencing Table generally\r\nwill have criminal history categories above Category I. As a result, the Commission decided\r\nagainst promulgating a two-level reduction for offenses involving loss amounts less than\r\n$2,000.\r\nThe amendment deletes the two-level enhancement for more than minimal planning\r\npreviously at §§2B1.1(b)(4)(A) and 2F1.1(b)(2)(A). The two-fold reason for this change\r\nwas to obviate the need for judicial fact-finding about this frequently occurring enhancement\r\nand to avoid the potential overlap between the more than minimal planning enhancement and\r\nthe sophisticated means enhancement previously at §2F1.1(b)(6) and now, by this\r\namendment, at §2B1.1(b)(8).\r\nNovember 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II Amendment 617\r\n\r\nThe amendment also eliminates the alternative prong of the more than minimal planning\r\nenhancement, at §2F1.1(b)(2)(B) prior to this amendment, which provided a two-level\r\nincrease if the offense involved more than one victim. The amendment replaces this\r\nenhancement with a specific offense characteristic for offenses that involved large numbers\r\nof victims. This change addresses three concerns. First, as a result of the consolidation, the\r\nmore-than-one-victim enhancement, if retained, would apply in cases that, prior to this\r\namendment, were not subject to such an enhancement. Second, a two-level increase in every\r\ncase involving more than one victim is arguably inconsistent with the approach in subsection\r\n(b)(2) of §3A1.1 (Hate Crime Motivation or Vulnerable Victim), which provides a two-level\r\nincrease if the offense involved a large number of vulnerable victims. Third, in practice, the\r\nmore than minimal planning enhancement was so closely linked with this enhancement that\r\nthe decision to eliminate the former argues strongly for also eliminating the latter.\r\nThe amendment provides a two-level enhancement for offenses involving ten or more, but\r\nfewer than 50, victims, and a four-level increase for offenses involving 50 or more victims.\r\nThis provision is designed to provide a measured increment that results in increased\r\npunishment for offenses involving larger numbers of victims. Its applicability to those cases\r\nin which victims, both individuals and organizations, sustain an actual loss under subsection\r\n(b)(1) or sustain bodily injury.\r\nA special rule is provided for application of the victim enhancement for offenses involving\r\nUnited States mail because of (i) the unique proof problems often attendant to such offenses,\r\n(ii) the frequently significant, but difficult to quantify, non-monetary losses in such offenses,\r\nand (iii) the importance of maintaining the integrity of the United States mail.\r\nIn addition, the amendment moves the mass-marketing enhancement into the new victim-\r\nrelated specific offense characteristic, as an alternative to the two-level adjustment for more\r\nthan ten, but fewer than 50, victims. The provision is retained to remain responsive to the\r\ncongressional directive that led to its original promulgation and reflects the Commission’s\r\nexpectation that most telemarketing cases, or similar mass-marketing cases, will have at least\r\nten victims and, receive this enhancement. The mass-marketing alternative enhancement\r\nalso will continue to apply in cases in which mass-marketing has been used to target a large\r\nnumber of persons, regardless of the number of persons who have sustained an actual loss\r\nor injury.\r\nIn addition, the amendment provides that if a victim enhancement applies, the enhancement\r\nunder §3A1.1(b)(2) for \"a large number of vulnerable victims\" does not also apply because\r\nthe more serious conduct already would have resulted in a higher penalty level.\r\nIn response to issues raised in a circuit conflict, the amendment revises the commentary\r\nrelated to subsection (b)(4)(B) of §2B1.1 to clarify the meaning of \"person in the business\r\nof receiving and selling stolen property.\" The amendment addresses an issue that has arisen\r\nin case law regarding what conduct receives a defendant for the 4-level enhancement.\r\nIn determining the meaning of \"in the business of\", some circuits apply what has been\r\ntermed the \"fence test\", under which the court must consider (1) if the stolen property was\r\nbought and sold, and (2) to what extent the stolen property transactions encouraged others\r\nto commit property crimes. Other circuits have adopted the \"totality of the circumstances\r\ntest\" that focuses on the regularity and sophistication of the defendant's operation. Compare\r\nUnited States v. Esquivel, 919 F.2d 957 (5th Cir. 1990), with United States v. St. Cyr, 997\r\nAmendment 617 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003\r\n\r\nF.2d 698 (1st Cir. 1992). Under either test, courts consider the sophistication and regularity\r\nof the business as well as the control, volume, turnover, relationship with thieves, and\r\nconnections with buyers. Although the factors considered by all of these circuits are similar,\r\nthe approaches are different.\r\nAfter consideration, the Commission adopted the totality of circumstances approach because\r\nit is more objective and more properly targets the conduct of the individual who is actually\r\nin the business of fencing. See United States v. St. Cyr, supra.\r\nIn addition, this amendment resolves a circuit conflict regarding the scope of the\r\nenhancement in the consolidated guideline for a misrepresentation that the defendant was\r\nacting on behalf of a charitable, educational, religious, or political organization, or a\r\ngovernment agency. (Prior to this amendment, the enhancement was at subsection (b)(4)(A)\r\nof §2F1.1). The conflict concerns whether the misrepresentation enhancement applies only\r\nin cases in which the defendant does not have any authority to act on behalf of the covered\r\norganization or government agency or if it applies more broadly to cases in which the\r\ndefendant has a legitimate connection to the covered organization or government agency, but\r\nmisrepresents that the defendant is acting solely on behalf of that organization or agency.\r\nCompare, e.g., United States v. Marcum, 16 F.3d 599 (4th Cir. 1994) (enhancement\r\nappropriate even though defendant did not misrepresent his authority to act on behalf of the\r\norganization but rather only misrepresented that he was conducting an activity wholly on\r\nbehalf of the organization), with United States v. Frazier, 53 F.3d 1105 (10th Cir. 1995)\r\n(application of the enhancement is limited to cases in which the defendant exploits the victim\r\nby claiming to have authority which in fact does not exist).\r\nThe amendment follows the broader view of the Fourth Circuit. It provides for application\r\nof the enhancement, now, by this amendment, at §2B1.1(b)(7)(A), if the defendant falsely\r\nrepresented that the defendant was acting to obtain a benefit for a covered organization or\r\nagency when, in fact, the defendant intended to divert all or part of that benefit (for example,\r\nfor the defendant’s personal gain), regardless of whether the defendant actually was\r\nassociated with the organization or government agency. The Commission determined that\r\nthe enhancement was appropriate in such cases because the representation that the defendant\r\nwas acting to obtain a benefit for the organization enables the defendant to commit the\r\noffense. In the case of an employee who also holds a position of trust, the amendment\r\nprovides an application note instructing the court not to apply §3B1.3 (Abuse of Position of\r\nTrust or Use of Special Skill) if the same conduct forms the basis both for the enhancement\r\nand the adjustment in §3B1.3.\r\nThe amendment implements the directive in section 3 of the College Scholarship Fraud\r\nPrevention Act of 2000, Public Law 106–420, by providing an additional alternative\r\nenhancement that applies if the offense involves a misrepresentation to a consumer in\r\nconnection with obtaining, providing, or furnishing financial assistance for an institution of\r\nhigher education. The enhancement targets the provider of the financial assistance or\r\nscholarship services, not the individual applicant for such assistance or scholarship,\r\nconsistent with the intent of the legislation.\r\nThis amendment makes two minor substantive changes to the enhancement for conscious or\r\nreckless risk of serious bodily injury, now, by this amendment, at subsection (b)(11)(A).\r\nFirst, it increases the minimum offense level from level 13 to level 14 to promote\r\nproportionality within this guideline. For example, within the theft and fraud guidelines\r\nNovember 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II Amendment 617\r\n\r\nprior to this amendment, there were other specific offense characteristics that had a higher\r\nfloor offense level than the risk of bodily injury enhancement: (1) \"chop shops\" (level 14);\r\n(2) jeopardizing the solvency of a financial institution (level 24); and (3) personally\r\nreceiving more than $1,000,000 from a financial institution (level 24). Second, it inserts\r\n\"death\" before the term \"or serious bodily injury\" to clarify that the risk of the greater harm\r\nalso is covered. Including risk of death also provides consistency with similar provisions in\r\nother parts of the Guidelines Manual, where risk of death is always included with risk of\r\nserious bodily injury.\r\nThe amendment modifies the four-level increase and minimum offense level of level 24 for\r\na defendant who personally derives more than $1,000,000 in gross receipts from an offense\r\nthat affected a financial institution, now, by this amendment, at subsection (b)(12)(A). The\r\namendment retains the minimum offense level but reduces the four-level enhancement to two\r\nlevels because of the increased offense levels that will result from the loss table for the\r\nconsolidated guideline. The two-level increase was retained because elimination of the\r\nenhancement entirely would not provide an appropriate punishment for those offenders\r\ninvolved with losses that are in the $1,000,000 to $2,500,000 range of loss.\r\nThe enhancement also was modified to address issues about what it means to \"affect\" a\r\nfinancial institution and how to apply the enhancement to a case in which there are more than\r\none financial institution involved. Accordingly, the revised provision focuses on whether\r\nthe defendant derived more than $1,000,000 in gross receipts from one or more financial\r\ninstitutions as a result of the offense.\r\nThe amendment includes a new cross reference (subsection (c)(3)) that is more generally\r\napplicable and intended to apply whenever a broadly applicable fraud statute is used to reach\r\nconduct that is addressed more specifically in another Chapter Two guideline. Prior to this\r\namendment, the fraud guideline contained an application note that instructed the user to\r\nmove to another, more appropriate Chapter Two guideline, under specified circumstances.\r\nAlthough this note was not a cross reference, but rather a reminder of the principles\r\nenunciated in §1B1.2, it operated like a cross reference in the sense that it required use of a\r\ndifferent guideline.\r\nThis amendment also makes a minor revision (adding \"in a broader form\") to the background\r\ncommentary regarding the implementation of the directive in section 2507 of Public Law\r\n101–647, nullifying the effect of United States v. Tomasino, 206 F. 3d 739 (7th Cir. 2000).\r\nLoss Tables\r\nThe amendment provides revised loss tables for this consolidated guideline and for the tax\r\noffense guidelines. A principle feature of the new tables is that they expand the previously\r\nexisting one-level increments into two-level increments, thus increasing the range of losses\r\nthat correspond to an individual increment, compressing the table, and reducing fact-finding.\r\nThe new loss tables also provide substantial increases in penalties for moderate and higher\r\nloss amounts, even, for fraud and theft offenses, notwithstanding the elimination of the two-\r\nlevel enhancement for more than minimal planning. These higher penalty levels respond to\r\ncomments received from the Department of Justice, the Criminal Law Committee of the\r\nJudicial Conference, and others, that the offenses sentenced under the guidelines\r\nconsolidated by this amendment under-punish individuals involved with moderate and high\r\nloss amounts, relative to penalty levels for offenses of similar seriousness sentenced under\r\nAmendment 617 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003\r\n\r\nother guidelines.\r\nSome offenders accountable for relatively low dollar losses will receive slightly lower\r\noffense levels under the new loss table for the consolidated guideline because of (1) the\r\nelimination of the enhancement for more than minimal planning; (2) the change from one-\r\nlevel to two-level increments for increasing loss amounts; (3) the selection of the breakpoints\r\nfor the loss increments (including $5,000 as the first loss amount that results in an increase);\r\nand (4) the slope chosen for the relationship between increases in loss amount and increases\r\nin offense level at the lower loss amounts. This amendment reflects a decision by the\r\nCommission that this effect on penalty levels at lower loss amounts is appropriate for several\r\nreasons: (1) the lower offense levels provide appropriate deterrence and punishment,\r\ngenerally, (2) at lower offense levels more defendants will be subject to the court’s ability\r\nto fashion sentencing alternatives as appropriate (see, e.g., §5C1.1 (Imposition of a Term of\r\nImprisonment)); and (3) these penalty levels may facilitate the payment of restitution.\r\nThe loss table for the consolidated guideline provides the first of incremental increases for\r\ncases in which loss exceeds $5,000, rather than $2,000 provided previously in §2F1.1, or\r\n$100 provided previously in §2B1.1. The Commission believes this will reduce the fact-\r\nfinding burden on courts for less serious offenses that are generally subject to greater\r\nsentencing flexibility because of the availability of alternatives to incarceration.\r\nThe amendment also provides a revised loss table in §2T4.1 (Tax Table) for tax offenses that\r\nensures significantly higher penalty levels for offenses involving moderate and high tax loss\r\nin a similar manner and degree as the loss table for the consolidated guideline. The new table\r\nis designed to reflect more appropriately the seriousness of tax offenses and to maintain\r\nproportionality with the offenses sentenced under the consolidated guideline.\r\nThe tax loss table is similar to the loss table for the consolidated guideline, except it does not\r\nreduce generally any sentences for offenders involved with lower loss amounts. The tax\r\ntable provides its first increment for loss at $2,000, rather than the $5,000 threshold under\r\nthe consolidated guideline (and the $1,700 threshold under the tax loss table prior to this\r\namendment). These differences are intended to avoid unintended decreases that would occur\r\notherwise. The increases in the new tax loss table for offenders involved with lower loss\r\namounts are intended to maintain the long-standing treatment of tax offenses relative to theft\r\nand fraud offenses.\r\nDefinition of Loss\r\nThis amendment provides a new definition of loss applicable to offenses previously\r\nsentenced under §§2B1.1, 2B1.3, and 2F1.1. The revised definition makes clarifying and\r\nsubstantive revisions to the definitions of loss previously in the commentary to §§2B1.1 and\r\n2F1.1, resolves a number of circuit conflicts, addresses a variety of application issues, and\r\npromotes consistency in application.\r\nSignificantly, the new definition of loss retains the core rule that loss is the greater of actual\r\nand intended loss. The Commission concluded that, for cases in which intended loss is\r\ngreater than actual loss, the intended loss is a more appropriate initial measure of the\r\nculpability of the offender. Conversely, in cases which the actual loss is greater, that amount\r\nis a more appropriate measure of the seriousness of the offense.\r\nNovember 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II Amendment 617\r\n\r\nA definition is provided for intended loss that is consistent with the rule regarding the\r\ninteraction of actual and intended loss.\r\nThe amendment includes a resolution of the circuit conflict relating to the meaning and\r\napplication of intended loss.\r\nThe amendment resolves the conflict to provide that intended loss includes unlikely or\r\nimpossible losses that are intended, because their inclusion better reflects the culpability of\r\nthe offender. Compare United States v. Geevers, 226 F.3d 186 (3d Cir. 2000) (agreeing with\r\nthe majority of circuits holding that impossibility is not in and of itself a limit on the\r\nintended loss for purposes of calculating sentences under the guidelines . . . impossibility\r\ndoes not require a sentencing court to lower its calculations of intended loss); and United\r\nStates v. Coffman, 94 F.3d 330 (7th Cir. 1996) (rejecting the argument that a loss that cannot\r\npossibly occur cannot be intended); United States v. Koenig, 952 F.2d 267 (9th Cir. 1991)\r\n(holding that §2F1.1 only requires a calculation of intended loss and does not require a\r\nfinding that the intentions were realistic); United States v. Klisser, 190 F. 3d 34, 36 (2d Cir.\r\n1999) (same); United States v. Blitz, 151 F. 3d 1002, 1010 (9th Cir. 1998) (same); United\r\nStates v. Studevent, 116 F. 3d 1559, 1563 (D.C. Cir. 1997) (same); United States v. Wai-\r\nKeung, 115 F. 3d 874, 877 (11th Cir. 1997) (same), with United States v. Galbraith, 20 F. 3d\r\n1054, 1059 (10th Cir. 1993) (because intended loss only includes losses that are possible, in\r\nan undercover sting operation the intended loss is zero); and United States v. Watkins, 994\r\nF.2d 1192, 1196 (6th Cir. 1993) (holding that a limitation on the broad reach of the intended\r\nloss rule is that the intended loss must have been possible to be considered relevant).\r\nAccordingly, concepts such as \"economic reality\" or \"amounts put at risk\" will no longer be\r\nconsiderations in the determination of intended loss. See United States v. Bonanno, 146\r\nF.3d 502 (7th Cir. 1998) (holding that the relevant inquiry is how much the scheme put at\r\nrisk); and United States v. Wells, 127 F. 3d 739 (8th Cir. 1997) (citing United States v.\r\nMorris, 18 F.3d 562 (8th Cir. 1994)) (holding that intended loss properly was measured by\r\nthe possible loss the defendant intended, and did not hinge on actual or net loss).\r\nThis amendment also resolves differing circuit interpretations of the standard of causation\r\napplicable for actual loss, an issue that was not addressed expressly in the prior definition\r\nof actual loss. Various circuits recognized three arguably inconsistent standards for loss\r\ncausation. First, §1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct) provides that a defendant is responsible for all\r\nlosses – foreseen or unforeseen – that result from the defendant’s actions or that result from\r\nthe foreseeable actions of co-participants. See United States v. Sarno, 73 F.3d 1470 (9th Cir.\r\n1995) (holding that \"[a] sentence calculated pursuant to the loss tables . . . is properly based\r\non actual loss notwithstanding the fact that this loss may be greater than the intended,\r\nexpected or foreseeable loss\"), cert. denied, 518 U.S. 1020 (1996); and United States v.\r\nLopreato, 83 F.3d 571 (2d Cir. 1996) (holding that in a bribery case, the defendant is\r\nresponsible for all losses, foreseeable or not). A second view is premised on the fact that\r\nprior to this amendment commentary in §2F1.1 limited the loss amount to the value of the\r\nmoney, property, or services unlawfully taken. See United States v. Marlatt, 24 F.3d 1005\r\n(7th Cir. 1994) (refusing to count foreseeable losses in loss figure because they did not\r\nrepresent the actual thing taken). A third view is that the commentary’s explicit inclusion\r\nof consequential damages in the loss determination for contract procurement and product\r\nsubstitution cases implies that only non-consequential or direct damages are included in\r\nother cases. See United States v. Thomas, 62 F.3d 1332 (11th Cir. 1995), cert. denied, 516\r\nU.S. 1166 (1996) (only non-consequential or direct damages are included in loss). See also\r\nAmendment 617 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003\r\n\r\nUnited States v. Daddona, 34 F.3d 163 (3d Cir.), cert. denied, 513 U.S. 1002 (1994) (holding\r\nthat merely incidental or consequential damages may not be counted in computing loss); and\r\nUnited States v. Newman, 6 F.3d 623 (9th Cir. 1993) (holding that loss caused by the\r\ndefendant arsonist was only the value of the property destroyed by the fire, not costs of\r\nputting out the fire).\r\nThe amendment defines \"actual loss\" as the \"reasonably foreseeable pecuniary harm\" that\r\nresulted from the offense. The amendment incorporates this causation standard that, at a\r\nminimum, requires factual causation (often called \"but for\" causation) and provides a rule\r\nfor legal causation (i.e., guidance to courts regarding how to draw the line as to what losses\r\nshould be included and excluded from the loss determination). Significantly, the application\r\nof this causation standard in the great variety of factual contexts in which it is expected to\r\noccur appropriately is entrusted to sentencing judges.\r\n\"Pecuniary harm\" is defined in a manner that excludes emotional distress, harm to reputation,\r\nand other non-economic harm, in order to foreclose the laborious effort sometimes necessary\r\nto quantify non-economic harms (as in some tort proceedings, for example).\r\n\"Reasonably foreseeable pecuniary harm\" is defined to include pecuniary harms that the\r\ndefendant knew or, under the circumstances, reasonably should have known, was a potential\r\nresult of the offense. The Commission determined that this standard better ensures the\r\ninclusion in loss of those harms that reflect the seriousness of the offense and the culpability\r\nof the offender.\r\nThe definition deletes the previous rule that, by negative implication, excludes consequential\r\ndamages (except in specified cases), thus resolving a circuit conflict. Compare United States\r\nv. Izydore, 167 F.3d 213 (5th Cir. 1999) (the fact that the Commission prescribed\r\nconsequential losses in only specific fraud cases, and not others, is strong evidence that\r\nconsequential damages were omitted from the general loss definition by design rather than\r\nmistake), with United States v. Gottfried, 58 F.3d 648 (D.C. Cir. 1995) (holding that merely\r\nincidental or consequential damages may not be counted in computing loss). The\r\nCommission decided, however, not to use the term \"consequential damages,\" or any similar\r\ncivil law distinction between direct and indirect harms. Rather, the Commission determined\r\nthat the reasonable foreseeability standard provides sufficient guidance to courts as to what\r\ntype of harms are included in loss.\r\nIn addition, this amendment preserves the special provisions addressing loss in protected\r\ncomputer offenses and the inclusion of consequential damages in product substitution and\r\ncontract procurement offenses; however, these special cases are re-characterized as rules of\r\nconstruction to avoid any negative implications regarding other types of offenses.\r\nThe amendment reflects a decision by the Commission that interest and similar costs shall\r\nbe excluded from loss. However, the amendment provides that a departure may be\r\nwarranted in the rare case in which exclusion of interest will under-punish the offender.\r\nThus, the rule resolves the circuit split regarding whether \"bargained for\" interest may be\r\nincluded in loss. Compare United States v. Henderson, 19 F.3d 917 (5th Cir.), cert. denied,\r\n513 U.S. 877 (1994) (holding that interest should be included if the victim had a reasonable\r\nexpectation of receiving interest from the transaction); United States v. Gilberg, 75 F.3d 15\r\n(1st Cir. 1996) (including in loss interest on fraudulently procured mortgage loan); and\r\nUnited States v. Sharma, 190 F.3d 220 (3d Cir. 1999) (holding that Application Note 8 of\r\nNovember 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II Amendment 617\r\n\r\n§2F1.1 requires the exclusion of \"opportunity cost\" interest, but did not intend to exclude\r\nbargained-for interest), with United States v. Hoyle, 33 F.3d 415 (4th Cir. 1994), cert.\r\ndenied, 513 U.S. 1133 (1995) (excluding interest from the determination of loss for\r\nsentencing purposes); and United States v. Guthrie, 144 F.3d 1006 (6th Cir. 1998) (holding\r\nthat when the defendant concealed assets in a bankruptcy proceeding, the lower court’s\r\ndetermination that loss to creditors included interest was erroneous). This rule is consistent\r\nwith the general purpose of the loss determination to serve as a rough measurement of the\r\nseriousness of the offense and culpability of the offender and avoids unnecessary litigation\r\nregarding the amount of interest to be included.\r\nThe loss definition also excludes from loss certain costs incurred by the government and\r\nvictims in connection with criminal investigation and prosecution of the offense. Such losses\r\nare likely to occur in a broad range of cases, would present a fact-finding burden in those\r\ncases, and would not contribute to the ability of loss to perform its essential function.\r\nThe loss definition also provides for the exclusion from loss of certain economic benefits\r\ntransferred to victims, to be measured at the time of detection. This provision codifies the\r\n\"net loss\" approach that has developed in the case law, with some modifications made for\r\npolicy reasons. This crediting approach is adopted because the seriousness of the offense\r\nand the culpability of a defendant is better determined by using a net approach. This\r\napproach recognizes that the offender who transfers something of value to the victim(s)\r\ngenerally is committing a less serious offense than an offender who does not.\r\nThe amendment adopts \"time of detection\" as the most appropriate and least burdensome\r\ntime for measuring the value of the transferred benefits. The Commission determined that\r\nvaluing such benefits at the time of transfer would be especially problematic in cases in\r\nwhich the offender misrepresented the value of an item that is difficult to value. Although\r\nthe time of detection standard will allow some fluctuation in value which may inure to the\r\ndefendant’s benefit or detriment, the Commission determined that, because the time of\r\ndetection is closer in time to the sentencing and occurs at a point when the authorities are\r\naware of the criminality, its use generally would make it easier to determine a more accurate\r\nvalue of the benefit.\r\nThe definition of \"time of detection\" was adopted because there may be situations in which\r\nit is difficult to prove that the defendant knew the offense was detected even if it was already\r\ndiscovered. In addition, the words \"about to be detected\" are included to cover those\r\nsituations in which the offense is not yet detected, but the defendant knows it is about to be\r\ndetected. In such a case, it would be inappropriate to credit the defendant with benefits\r\ntransferred to the victim after that defendant’s awareness.\r\nThe definition of \"loss\" also provides special rules for certain schemes. One rule includes\r\nin loss (and excludes from crediting) the benefits received by victims of persons fraudulently\r\nproviding professional services. This rule reverses case law that has allowed crediting (or\r\nexclusion from loss) in cases in which services were provided by persons posing as attorneys\r\nand medical personnel. See United States v. Maurello, 76 F.3d 1304 (3d Cir. 1996)\r\n(calculating loss by subtracting the value of satisfactory legal services from amount of fees\r\npaid to a person posing as a lawyer); and United States v. Reddeck, 22 F.3d 1504 (10th Cir.\r\n1994) (reducing loss by the value of education received from a sham university). The\r\nCommission determined that the seriousness of these offenses and the culpability of these\r\noffenders is best reflected by a loss determination that does not credit the value of the\r\nAmendment 617 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003\r\n\r\nunlicensed benefits provided. In addition, this provision eliminates the additional burden\r\nthat would be imposed on courts if required to determine the value of these benefits.\r\nSimilarly, the definition of loss provides a special rule that includes in loss (and excludes\r\nfrom crediting) the value of items that were falsely represented as approved by a regulatory\r\nagency, for which regulatory approval was obtained by fraud, or for which regulatory\r\napproval was required but not obtained. The Commission determined that the seriousness\r\nof these offenses and the culpability of these offenders is best reflected by a loss\r\ndetermination that does not credit the value of these items. This decision reflects the\r\nimportance of the regulatory approval process to public health, safety, and confidence.\r\nRegarding investment schemes, the amendment resolves a circuit conflict regarding whether\r\nand how to credit payments made to victims. Compare United States v. Mucciante, 21 F.3d\r\n1228 (2nd Cir. 1994) (under the Guidelines, loss includes the value of all property taken,\r\neven though all or part of it was returned.); United States v. Deavours, 219 F.3d 400 (5th Cir.\r\n2000) (intended loss is not reduced by any sums returned to investors); and United States v.\r\nLoayza, 107 F.3d 257 (4th Cir.1997) (declining to follow the approach of net loss and\r\nholding defendants responsible for the value of all property taken, even though all or a part\r\nis returned), with United States v. Holiusa, 13 F.3d 1043 (7th Cir.1994) (holding that only\r\nthe net loss should be included in loss, thus allowing a credit for returned interest), and\r\nUnited States v. Orton, 73 F.3d 331 (11th Cir. 1996) (only payments made to losing\r\ninvestors should be credited, not payments to investors who made a profit).\r\nThis amendment adopts the approach of the Eleventh Circuit that excludes the gain to any\r\nindividual investor in the scheme from being used to offset the loss to other individual\r\ninvestors because any gain realized by an individual investor is designed to lure others into\r\nthe fraudulent scheme. See United States v. Orton, supra.\r\nThe definition retains the rule providing for the use of gain when loss cannot reasonably be\r\ndetermined. It clarifies that there must be a loss for gain to be considered. In doing so, the\r\nCommission resolved another circuit conflict. Compare United States v. Robie, 166 F.3d\r\n444 (2d Cir. 1999) (holding that use of defendant’s gain for purposes of subsection (b)(1)\r\nis improper if there is no economic loss to the victim), with United States v. Haas, 171 F.3d\r\n259 (5th Cir. 1999) (stating that \"if the loss is either incalculable or zero, the district court\r\nmust determine the §2F1.1 sentence enhancement by estimating the gain to the defendant as\r\na result of his fraud\"). The Commission decided not to expand the use of gain to situations\r\nin which loss can be determined but the gain is greater than the loss because such instances\r\nshould occur infrequently, the efficiency of the criminal operation as reflected in the amount\r\nof gain ordinarily should not determine the penalty level, and the traditional use of loss is\r\ngenerally adequate.\r\nThe amendment revises the special rule on determining loss in cases involving diversion of\r\ngovernment program benefits to resolve another circuit conflict. The revision is intended to\r\nclarify that loss in such cases only includes amounts that were diverted from intended\r\nrecipients or uses, not benefits received or used by authorized persons. In other words, even\r\nif such benefits flowed through an unauthorized intermediary, as long as they went to\r\nintended recipients for intended uses, the amount of those benefits should not be included\r\nin loss. Compare United States v. Henry, 164 F.3d 1304 (10th Cir. 1999) (holding that loss\r\nincludes the value of gross benefits paid, rather than the value of benefits improperly\r\nreceived or diverted in determining the loss), with United States v. Peters, 59 F.3d 732 (8th\r\nNovember 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II Amendment 617\r\n\r\nCir. 1995) (determining that loss is the value of benefits diverted from intended recipients);\r\nand United States v. Barnes, 117 F.3d 328 (7th Cir. 1997) (holding that the sentence is\r\ncalculated only on the value of the government benefits diverted from intended recipients\r\nor users). This net loss approach is more consistent with general rules for determining loss.\r\nReferring Guidelines for Theft and Fraud\r\nThe amendment includes revisions to the guidelines that, prior to this amendment, referred\r\nto the loss tables in §2B1.1 or §2F1.1. Pursuant to this amendment, these guidelines will\r\nrefer to the loss tables in the consolidated guideline. Prior to this amendment, the referring\r\nguidelines used the tables in §§2B1.1 and 2F1.1, which provided the first loss increment for\r\nlosses in excess of $2,000. Because the consolidated loss table provides the first loss\r\nincrement for losses in excess of $5,000, the referring guidelines are amended to provide a\r\none-level increase in a case in which the loss is more than $2,000, but did not exceed $5,000.\r\nThis increase is provided to avoid a one-level decrease that would otherwise occur for an\r\noffense involving losses of more than $2,000 but not more than $5,000.\r\nTwo referring guidelines (§§2B2.1 (Burglary of a Residence or a Structure Other than a\r\nResidence) and 2B3.1 (Robbery)) that use the definition of loss previously in §2B1.1 will\r\nretain that definition of loss rather than the new loss definition in the consolidated guideline.\r\nThe existing definition has not proven problematic for cases sentenced under these\r\nguidelines.\r\nTechnical and Conforming Amendments\r\nThe amendment includes a number of technical and conforming amendments, most of which\r\nare necessitated by the consolidation and the deletion of the more than minimal planning\r\nenhancement.\r\nComputing Tax Loss\r\nThis amendment addresses several issues related to tax loss. It addresses a circuit conflict\r\nregarding how tax loss under §2T1.1 (Tax Evasion) is computed for cases that involve a\r\ndefendant’s under-reporting of income on both individual and corporate tax returns. Such\r\na case often arises when (1) the defendant fails to report, and pay corporate income taxes on,\r\nincome earned by the corporation; (2) the defendant diverts that unreported corporate income\r\nfor the defendant’s personal use; and (3) the defendant fails to report, and to pay personal\r\nincome taxes on, that diverted income. The amendment provides that the amount of the\r\nfederal tax loss is the sum of the federal income tax due from the corporation and the amount\r\nof federal income tax due from the individual.\r\nThe amendment thereby resolves a circuit conflict as to the methodology used to calculate\r\ntax loss in cases involving a corporate diversion. Two circuits use a sequential method to\r\naggregate the tax loss. Under this method, the court determines the corporate federal income\r\ntax that would have been due, subtracts that amount from the amount diverted to the\r\ndefendant personally, then determines the personal federal income tax that would have been\r\ndue on the reduced diverted amount. See United States v. Harvey, 996 F.2d 919 (7th Cir.\r\n1993); and United States v. Martinez-Rios, 143 F.3d 662 (2d Cir. 1998). The Commission\r\nadopted the alternative method used in United States v. Cseplo, 42 F.3d 360 (6th Cir. 1994),\r\nin which the court determines the corporate federal income tax due on the diverted amount,\r\nAmendment 617 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003\r\n\r\nand adds that amount to the personal federal income tax due on the total amount diverted.\r\nThis clarifies the prior rule in Application Note 7 of §2T1.1 that \"if the offense involves both\r\nindividual and corporate tax returns, the tax loss is the aggregate tax loss from the offenses\r\ntaken together\" and reflects the Commission’s conclusion that, in cases of corporate\r\ndiversions, the method for computing total tax loss adopted by the Sixth Circuit in Cseplo\r\nmore accurately reflects the seriousness of the total harm caused by these offenses than\r\nwould be reflected by the alternative method.\r\nIn evasion-of-payment tax cases, the Commission amended the definition of \"tax loss\" to\r\ninclude interest and penalties because, in contrast to evasion-of-assessment tax cases, such\r\namounts appropriately are included in tax loss for such cases. This amendment limits the\r\ninclusion of interest or penalties to willful evasion of payment cases under 26 U.S.C. § 7201\r\nand willful failure to pay cases under 26 U.S.C. § 7203. The nature of these cases is such\r\nthat the interest and penalties often greatly exceed the assessed tax amount constituting the\r\nbulk of the harm associated with these offenses.\r\nThis amendment also revises the sophisticated concealment enhancement in subsection (b)(2)\r\nof §§2T1.1 (Tax Evasion) and 2T1.4 (Aiding, Assisting, Procuring, Counseling, or Advising\r\nTax Fraud) to conform to the sophisticated means enhancement in the consolidated\r\nguideline, including imposition of a minimum offense level of level 12. This revision is\r\nappropriate inasmuch as certain tax offenses can be committed using sophisticated means\r\nin addition to being concealed in a sophisticated manner. Indeed, tax offenses committed\r\nin a sophisticated manner are more serious offenses, and reflect a greater culpability on the\r\npart of the offender (just as a tax offense concealed in a sophisticated manner reflects greater\r\nculpability). Consequently, this revision will allow the enhancement to apply to a somewhat\r\ngreater range of tax offenses than the previously existing sophisticated concealment\r\nenhancement.\r\nIn addition, the amendment revises \"offshore bank accounts\" by substituting \"financial\" for\r\n\"bank\", to ensure that the enhancement applies to conduct involving similar kinds of\r\naccounts, consistent with language in §2S1.1 (Laundering of Monetary Instruments;\r\nEngaging in Monetary Transactions in Property Derived from Unlawful Activity). A similar\r\nrevision is made in §2B1.1.","EffectiveDate":"Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2001."},{"Id":619,"Title":"Amendment 619","Text":"Section 2B5.1(b)(2) is amended by inserting \"(A)\" after \"defendant\"; and by\r\nstriking \", and the offense level as determined above is less than 15, increase to level 15.\"\r\nand inserting \"; or (B) controlled or possessed (i) counterfeiting paper similar to a distinctive\r\npaper; or (ii) a feature or device essentially identical to a distinctive counterfeit deterrent,\r\nincrease by 2 levels.\".\r\nSection 2B5.1(b) is amended by redesignating subdivisions (3) and (4) as subdivisions (4)\r\nand (5), respectively; and by inserting after subdivision (2) the following:\r\n\"(3) If subsection (b)(2)(A) applies, and the offense level determined under that\r\nsubsection is less than level 15, increase to level 15.\".\r\nThe Commentary to §2B5.1 captioned \"Statutory Provisions\" is amended by inserting \"A\"\r\nafter \"474\".\r\nNovember 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II Amendment 618\r\n\r\nThe Commentary to §2B5.1 captioned \"Application Notes\" is amended by striking Note 1\r\nas follows:\r\n\"1.

This amendment addresses concerns raised by the\r\nDepartment of the Treasury and the United States Secret Service regarding both the\r\noperation of, and the penalties provided by, §2B5.1 (Offenses Involving Counterfeit Bearer\r\nObligations of the United States). The amendment increases penalties for counterfeiting\r\nAmendment 618 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003\r\n\r\nactivity in two ways.\r\nFirst, the amendment adds a two-level enhancement for manufacturing, in addition to the\r\nminimum offense level of level 15 for manufacturing. This change will ensure some degree\r\nof additional punishment for all offenders who engage in manufacturing activity.\r\nSecond, the amendment adds a two-level enhancement (which would apply alternatively to\r\nthe manufacturing enhancement) if the offense involved possessing or controlling (1) paper\r\nthat is similar to a distinctive paper used by the United States for its currency, obligations,\r\nor securities; or (2) a feature or device that is essentially identical to a distinctive counterfeit\r\ndeterrent used by the United States for its currency, obligations, or securities. This\r\nenhancement is justified because of the higher statutory maximum penalties under 18 U.S.C.\r\n§ 474A (i.e., a term of imprisonment of up to 25 years compared to 10, 15, and 20 years for\r\nother counterfeiting offenses). In addition, use of paper similar to \"distinctive paper\" and\r\nuse of features and devices essentially identical to \"distinctive counterfeit deterrents\" (both\r\nof which are defined in §2B5.1 consistently with the statute) make the counterfeit item more\r\npassable and the offense more sophisticated.\r\nIn addition, the amendment deletes the language in the commentary of §2B5.1 that suggests\r\nthat the manufacturing adjustment does not apply if the defendant \"merely photocopies\".\r\nThat commentary was intended to make the manufacturing minimum offense level of level\r\n15 inapplicable to notes that are so obviously counterfeit that they are unlikely to be\r\naccepted. Particularly with the advent of digital technology, it cannot be said that\r\nphotocopying necessarily produces a note so obviously counterfeit as to be impassible.","EffectiveDate":"Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2001."},{"Id":620,"Title":"Amendment 620","Text":"Section 2C1.3 is amended in the title by adding \"; Payment or Receipt of\r\nUnauthorized Compensation\" after \"Interest\".\r\nSection 2C1.3 is amended by adding after subsection (b) the following:\r\n\"(c) Cross Reference\r\n(1) If the offense involved a bribe or gratuity, apply §2C1.1 (Offering,\r\nGiving, Soliciting, or Receiving a Bribe; Extortion Under Color of\r\nOfficial Right) or §2C1.2 (Offering, Giving, Soliciting, or\r\nReceiving a Gratuity), as appropriate, if the resulting offense level\r\nis greater than the offense level determined above.\".\r\nThe Commentary to §2C1.3 captioned \"Statutory Provisions\" is amended by inserting \", 209,\r\n1909\" after \"208\".\r\nThe Commentary to §2C1.3 captioned \"Application Note\" is amended in Note 1 by inserting\r\n\"Abuse of Position of Trust.—\" before \"Do not\".\r\nThe Commentary to §2C1.3 is amended by striking the background as follows:\r\n\"Background: This section applies to financial and non-financial conflicts of\r\ninterest by present and former federal officers and employees.\".\r\nNovember 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II Amendment 619\r\n\r\nChapter Two, Part C is amended by striking §2C1.4 and its accompanying commentary as\r\nfollows:\r\n\"§2C1.4.

L. 106–310 (the \"Act\"), with an\r\neffective date of December 16, 2000. (See Amendment 608.) This amendment\r\nrepromulgates the emergency amendment, with modifications, as a permanent amendment.\r\nThe substantial risk directive instructs the Commission to amend the federal sentencing\r\nguidelines with respect to any offense relating to the manufacture, attempt to manufacture,\r\nor conspiracy to manufacture amphetamine or methamphetamine in (1) the Controlled\r\nSubstances Act, 21 U.S.C. §§ 801-90; (2) the Controlled Substances Import and Export Act,\r\n21 U.S.C. §§ 951-71; or (3) the Maritime Drug Law Enforcement Act, 46 U.S.C. App.\r\nAmendment 620 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003\r\n\r\n§§ 1901-04.\r\nThe Act requires the Commission, in carrying out the substantial risk directive, to provide\r\nthe following enhancements—\r\n(A) if the offense created a substantial risk of harm to human life (other than a life\r\ndescribed in subparagraph (B)) or the environment, increase the base offense level\r\nfor the offense—\r\n(i) by not less than 3 offense levels above the applicable level in effect on\r\nthe date of the enactment of this Act; or\r\n(ii) if the resulting base offense level after an increase under clause (i)\r\nwould be less than level 27, to not less than level 27; or\r\n(B) if the offense created a substantial risk of harm to the life of a minor or\r\nincompetent, increase the base offense level for the offense—\r\n(i) by not less than 6 offense levels above the applicable level in effect on\r\nthe date of the enactment of this Act; or\r\n(ii) if the resulting base offense level after an increase under clause (i)\r\nwould be less than level 30, to not less than level 30.\r\nThe emergency amendment provided enhancements in §§2D1.1 (Unlawful Manufacturing,\r\nImporting, Exporting, or Trafficking (Including Possession with Intent to Commit These\r\nOffenses); Attempt or Conspiracy) and 2D1.10 (Endangering Human Life While Illegally\r\nManufacturing a Controlled Substance) that also apply in the case of an attempt or a\r\nconspiracy to manufacture amphetamine or methamphetamine. The amendment did not\r\namend §2D1.11 (Unlawfully Distributing, Importing, Exporting or Possessing a Listed\r\nChemical; Attempt or Conspiracy) or §2D1.12 (Unlawful Possession, Manufacture,\r\nDistribution, or Importation of Prohibited Flask or Equipment). Although offenses that\r\ninvolve the manufacture of amphetamine or methamphetamine also are referenced in\r\nAppendix A (Statutory Index) to §§2D1.11 and 2D1.12, the cross references in these\r\nguidelines, which apply if the offense involved the manufacture of a controlled substance,\r\nwill result in application of §2D1.1 and accordingly, the enhancements.\r\nThe basic structure of the emergency amendment to §§2D1.1 and 2D1.10 tracked the\r\nstructure of the substantial risk directive. Accordingly, in §2D1.1, the amendment provided\r\na three-level increase and a minimum offense level of level 27 if the offense (1) involved the\r\nmanufacture of amphetamine or methamphetamine; and (2) created a substantial risk of harm\r\neither to human life or the environment. For offenses that created a substantial risk of harm\r\nto the life of a minor or an incompetent, the amendment provided a six-level increase and a\r\nminimum offense level of level 30.\r\nHowever, the structure of the emergency amendment to §2D1.10 differed from the structure\r\nof the emergency amendment to §2D1.1 with respect to the first prong of the enhancement\r\n(regarding substantial risk of harm to human life or to the environment). Specifically, the\r\nemergency amendment provided a three-level increase and a minimum offense level of level\r\n27 if the offense involved the manufacture of amphetamine or methamphetamine without\r\nNovember 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II Amendment 620\r\n\r\nmaking application of the enhancement dependent upon whether the offense also involved\r\na substantial risk of either harm to human life or the environment. Consideration of whether\r\nthe offense involves a substantial risk of harm to human life also is unnecessary because\r\n§2D1.10 applies only to convictions under 21 U.S.C. § 858, and the creation of a substantial\r\nrisk of harm to human life is an element of an offense under 21 U.S.C. § 858. Therefore, the\r\nbase offense level already takes into account the substantial risk of harm to human life.\r\nConsideration of whether the offense involved a substantial risk of harm to the environment\r\nwas unnecessary because the directive predicated application of the enhancement on\r\nsubstantial risk of harm either to human life or to the environment, and the creation of a\r\nsubstantial risk of harm to human life necessarily is taken into account as an element of the\r\noffense.\r\nNeither the substantial risk directive nor any statutory provision defines \"substantial risk of\r\nharm.\" Based on an analysis of relevant case law that interpreted \"substantial risk of harm,\"\r\nthe emergency amendment provided commentary setting forth factors that may be relevant\r\nin determining whether a particular offense created a substantial risk of harm. The definition\r\nof \"incompetent\" was modeled after several state statutes.\r\nThis permanent amendment re-promulgates, with modifications, the emergency amendment\r\nregarding the substantial risk directive. This amendment differs from the emergency\r\namendment in several respects:\r\nFirst, in §2D1.1, this amendment treats the existing specific offense characteristic in\r\n§2D1.1(b)(5), relating to a two-level enhancement for environmental violations occurring\r\nin the course of a drug trafficking offense, as an alternative to the three-level enhancement\r\nfor substantial risk of harm to human life or the environment. This portion of the amendment\r\nis in response to an issue related to the substantial risk directive regarding how to implement\r\nit in a manner consistent with the earlier environmental hazard directive in section 303 of the\r\nComprehensive Methamphetamine Control Act, Pub. L. 104–237. The emergency\r\namendment made the enhancements cumulative. However, this permanent amendment\r\nmakes the new guideline provision alternative with the pre-existing enhancement for\r\nenvironmental hazards in §2D1.1.\r\nSecond, in §2D1.1, this amendment lists four factors that the court \"shall\", as opposed to\r\n\"may\", consider to determine whether subsection (b)(6)(A) or (B) applies. Similarly, in\r\n§2D1.10, this amendment lists four factors the court \"shall\" consider to determine whether\r\nsubsection (b)(1)(B) applies. The list of four factors was identified by the Commission to\r\nassist the courts in defining the meaning of \"substantial risk of harm\" for offenses related to\r\nthe production and trafficking of precursor chemicals and the manufacture of amphetamine\r\nand methamphetamine.\r\nThird, in §2D1.1, this amendment provides that the court (1) shall consider any costs of\r\nenvironmental cleanup and harm to individuals and property in cases involving the\r\nmanufacture of amphetamine or methamphetamine in determining the amount of restitution\r\nunder §5E1.1 (Restitution) and in fashioning appropriate conditions of probation and\r\nsupervision under §§5B1.3 (Conditions of Probation) and 5D1.3 (Conditions of Supervised\r\nRelease), and (2) should consider such costs and harms in cases involving the manufacture\r\nof a controlled substance other than amphetamine or methamphetamine.\r\nThe amendment also makes a minor technical change in the background commentary.\r\nAmendment 620 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003","EffectiveDate":"Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2001."},{"Id":622,"Title":"Amendment 622","Text":"The subdivision captioned \"LSD, PCP, and Other Schedule I and II\r\nHallucinogens (and their immediate precursors)*\" of the Drug Equivalency Tables of Note\r\n10 of the Commentary to §2D1.1 captioned \"Application Notes\", effective May 1, 2001 (see\r\nAmendment 609), is repromulgated without change.","Reason":"Reason for Amendment: This amendment repromulgates (as a permanent amendment)\r\nwithout change the emergency amendment previously promulgated that addressed the\r\ndirective in section 3664 of the Ecstasy Anti-Proliferation Act of 2000, Pub. L. 106–310 (the\r\n\"Act\"). (See Amendment 609). That directive instructs the Commission to provide\r\nincreased penalties for the manufacture, importation, exportation, or trafficking of \"Ecstasy\".\r\nThe directive specifically requires the Commission to increase the base offense level for 3,4-\r\nMethylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), 3,4-Methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA),\r\n3,4-Methylenedioxy-N-ethylamphetamine (MDEA), Paramethoxymethamphetamine (PMA),\r\nand any other controlled substance that is marketed as \"Ecstasy\" and that has either a\r\nchemical structure similar to MDMA or an effect on the central nervous system substantially\r\nsimilar to or greater than MDMA.\r\nThe amendment addresses the directive by amending the Drug Equivalency Tables in\r\n§2D1.1, Application Note 10, to increase substantially the marihuana equivalencies for the\r\nspecified controlled substances, which has the effect of substantially increasing the penalties\r\nfor offenses involving \"Ecstasy\". The new penalties for \"Ecstasy\" trafficking provide\r\npenalties which, gram for gram, are more severe than those for powder cocaine. Under the\r\nDrug Equivalency Tables, one gram of powder cocaine has a marihuana equivalency of 200\r\ngrams. This amendment sets the marihuana equivalency for one gram of \"Ecstasy\" at 500\r\ngrams.\r\nThere is a combination of reasons why the Commission has substantially increased the\r\npenalties in response to the congressional directive. Much evidence received by the\r\nCommission indicated that \"Ecstasy\" (1) has powerful pharmacological effects; (2) has the\r\ncapacity to cause lasting physical harms, including brain damage; and (3) is being abused\r\nby rapidly increasing numbers of teenagers and young adults. Indeed, the market for\r\n\"Ecstasy\" is overwhelmingly comprised of persons under the age of 25 years.\r\nThe Commission considered whether the penalty levels for \"Ecstasy\" should be set at the\r\nsame levels as for heroin (one gram of heroin has a marihuana equivalency of 1000 grams)\r\nand decided that somewhat lesser penalties were appropriate for \"Ecstasy\" for a number of\r\nreasons: (1) the potential for addiction is greater with heroin; (2) heroin distribution often\r\ninvolves violence while, at this time, violence is not reported in \"Ecstasy\" markets; (3)\r\nbecause heroin it is a narcotic and is often injected, the risk of death from overdose is much\r\ngreater than for \"Ecstasy\"; and (4) because heroin is often injected, there are more secondary\r\nhealth consequences, such as infections and the transmission of the human\r\nimmunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis than for \"Ecstasy\".\r\nFinally, based on information regarding \"Ecstasy\" trafficking patterns, the penalty levels\r\nchosen are appropriate and sufficient to target serious and high-level traffickers and to\r\nprovide appropriate punishment, deterrence, and incentives for cooperation. The penalty\r\nlevels chosen for \"Ecstasy\" offenses provide five year sentences for serious traffickers (those\r\nwhose relevant conduct involved approximately 800 pills) and ten year sentences for high-\r\nNovember 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II Amendment 623\r\n\r\nlevel traffickers (those whose relevant conduct involved approximately 8,000 pills).","EffectiveDate":"Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2001."},{"Id":623,"Title":"Amendment 623","Text":"Section 2D1.1(b)(4) is amended by inserting \"amphetamine or\" before\r\n\"methamphetamine\" each place it appears.\r\nThe Commentary to §2D1.1 captioned \"Statutory Provisions\" is amended by inserting \"; 49\r\nU.S.C. § 46317(b)\" after \"960(a), (b)\".\r\nThe Commentary to §2D1.1 captioned \"Application Notes\" is amended in Note 19 by\r\ninserting \"amphetamine or\" before \"methamphetamine\".\r\nAppendix A (Statutory Index), as amended by amendment 617, is further amended by\r\ninserting after the line referenced to 49 U.S.C. § 46317(a) the following new line:\r\n\"49 U.S.C. § 46317(b) 2D1.1\".\r\nThe sixth entry, relating to Amphetamine and Amphetamine (actual), in each of subdivisions\r\n(1) through (14) of section 2D1.1(c), Note (B) of the \"*Notes to Drug Quantity Table\" in\r\n§2D1.1(c), Note 9 of the Commentary to §2D1.1 captioned \"Application Notes\", and the\r\nsubdivision captioned \"Cocaine and Other Schedule I and II Stimulants (and their immediate\r\nprecursors)*\" of the Drug Equivalency Tables in Note 10 of the Commentary to §2D1.1\r\ncaptioned \"Application Notes\", effective May 1, 2001 (see Amendment 610), are\r\nrepromulgated with the following change:\r\nThe Commentary to §2D1.1 captioned \"Application Notes\" is amended in Note 10 in the\r\nDrug Equivalency Tables in the subdivision captioned \"Cocaine and Other Schedule I and\r\nII Stimulants (and their immediate precursors)*\" by striking \"1 gm of Dextroamphetamine\r\n= 200 gm of marihuana\".","Reason":"Reason for Amendment: This amendment repromulgates as a permanent amendment the\r\nemergency amendment previously promulgated to implement the directive in section 3611\r\nof the Methamphetamine Anti-Proliferation Act of 2000, Pub.

L. 106–310 (the\r\n\"Act\"), regarding enhanced punishment for trafficking in List I chemicals. (See Amendment\r\n\r\n611). That section provided the Commission emergency amendment authority to implement\r\nthe directive.\r\nThis amendment provides a new chemical quantity table in §2D1.11 (Unlawfully\r\nDistributing, Importing, Exporting or Possessing a Listed Chemical; Attempt or Conspiracy)\r\nspecifically for ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, and phenylpropanolamine (PPA). The table ties\r\nthe base offense levels for these chemicals to the base offense levels for methamphetamine\r\n(actual) set forth in §2D1.1 (Unlawful Manufacturing, Importing, Exporting, or Trafficking\r\n(Including Possession with Intent to Commit These Offenses); Attempt or Conspiracy),\r\nassuming a 50 percent actual yield of the controlled substance from the chemicals.\r\n(Methamphetamine (actual) is used rather than methamphetamine mixture because ephedrine\r\nand pseudoephedrine produce methamphetamine (actual), and PPA produces amphetamine\r\n(actual)). This yield is based on information provided by the Drug Enforcement\r\nAdministration (DEA) that the typical yield of these substances for clandestine laboratories\r\nis 50 to 75 percent.\r\nThis new chemical quantity table has a maximum base offense level of level 38 (as opposed\r\nto a maximum base offense level of level 30 for all other precursor chemicals). Providing\r\na maximum base offense level of level 38 complies with the directive to establish penalties\r\nfor these precursors that \"correspond to the quantity of controlled substance that reasonably\r\ncould have been manufactured using the quantity of ephedrine, phenylpropanolamine, or\r\npseudoephedrine possessed or distributed.\" Additionally, this eliminates the six-level\r\ndistinction that currently exists between precursor chemical offenses that involve intent to\r\nmanufacture amphetamine or methamphetamine and such offenses that also involve an actual\r\nattempt to manufacture amphetamine or methamphetamine.\r\nThis amendment eliminates the Ephedrine Equivalency Table in §2D1.11 and, in its place,\r\nprovides a general rule for the court to determine the base offense level in cases involving\r\nmultiple precursors (other than ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, or PPA) by using the quantity\r\nof the single chemical resulting in the greatest offense level. An upward departure is\r\nprovided for cases in which the offense level does not adequately address the seriousness of\r\nthe offense.\r\nHowever, this amendment provides an exception to that general rule for offenses that involve\r\na combination of ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, or PPA because these chemicals often are\r\nused in the same manufacturing process. In a case that involves two or more of these\r\nchemicals, the base offense level will be determined using the total quantity of these\r\nchemicals involved. The purpose of this exception is twofold: (1) any of the three primary\r\nprecursors in the same table can be combined without difficulty; and (2) studies conducted\r\nby the DEA indicate that because the manufacturing process for amphetamine is essentially\r\nidentical to the manufacturing process for methamphetamine, there are cases in which the\r\ndifferent precursors are included in the same batch of drugs. If the chemical is PPA,\r\namphetamine results; if the chemical is ephedrine or pseudoephedrine, methamphetamine\r\nresults.\r\nThe amendment also adds to the Drug Equivalency Tables in §2D1.1 a conversion table for\r\nthese precursor chemicals, providing for a 50 percent conversion ratio. This is based on data\r\nfrom the DEA that the actual yield from ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, or PPA typically is in\r\nthe range of 50 to 75 percent. The purpose of this part of the amendment is to achieve the\r\nsame punishment level (as is achieved by the first part of this amendment) for an offense\r\nAmendment 625 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003\r\n\r\ninvolving any of these precursor chemicals when such offense involved the manufacture of\r\namphetamine or methamphetamine and, as a result, is sentenced under §2D1.1 pursuant to\r\nthe cross reference in §2D1.11.\r\nThis amendment also increases the base offense level for Benzaldehyde, Hydriodic Acid,\r\nMethylamine, Nitroethane, and Norpseudoephedrine by re-calibrating these levels to the\r\nappropriate quantity of methamphetamine (actual) that could be produced assuming a 50\r\npercent yield of chemical to drug and retaining a cap at level 30. Previously, these chemicals\r\nhad been linked to methamphetamine (mixture) penalty levels. Based on a study conducted\r\nby the DEA, ephedrine and pseudoepehdrine are the primary precursors used to make\r\nmethamphetamine in the United States. Phenylproponolamine is the primary precursor used\r\nto make amphetamine. Unlike the five additional List I chemicals, the chemical structures\r\nof ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, and PPA are so similar to the resulting drug (i.e.,\r\nmethamphetamine or amphetamine) that the manufacture of methamphetamine or\r\namphetamine from ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, or PPA is a very simple one-step synthesis\r\nwhich anyone can perform using a variety of chemical reagents. The manufacture of\r\nmethamphetamine or amphetamine from the five additional List I chemicals is a more\r\ncomplex process which requires a heightened level of expertise.\r\nThis amendment adds to the emergency amendment in two ways. First, it amends the\r\nChemical Quantity Table in §2D1.11 to include gamma-butyrolactone (GBL), a precursor\r\nfor gamma hydroxybutyric acid (GHB), as a List I chemical. This change is in response to\r\nthe Hillory J. Farias and Samantha Reid Date Rape Prohibition Act of 2000, Pub. L.\r\n106–172, which added GBL to the list of List 1 chemicals in section 401 (b)(1)(C) of the\r\nControlled Substances Act, 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(C). Offense levels for GBL were\r\nestablished in the same manner as other List I chemicals. The offense level for a specific\r\nquantity of GHB that can be produced from a given quantity of GBL, assuming a 50 percent\r\nyield, was determined using the Drug Quantity Table in §2D1.1. From this offense level,\r\nsix levels were subtracted to reflect the fact that an attempt to manufacture is not a required\r\nelement of these offenses and, therefore, they are less serious offenses than offenses covered\r\nby §2D1.1.\r\nSecond, the amendment adds iodine to the Chemical Quantity Table in §2D1.11(e) in\r\nresponse to a recent classification of iodine as a List II chemical. Iodine is used to produce\r\nhydrogen iodide which, in the presence of water, becomes hydriodic acid, a List I chemical\r\nthat is a reagent used in the production of amphetamine and methamphetamine. The\r\npenalties for iodine were established based upon its conversion to hydriodic acid.","EffectiveDate":"Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2001."},{"Id":627,"Title":"Amendment 627","Text":"Section 2D1.12 is amended in the title by inserting \"Transportation,\r\nExportation,\" after \"Distribution,\"; and by striking \"or Equipment\" and inserting \",\r\nEquipment, Chemical, Product, or Material\".\r\nSection 2D1.12(a)(1), (a)(2), and (b)(1) are amended by inserting \"flask,\" after \"prohibited\"\r\neach place it appears; and by inserting \", chemical, product, or material\" after \"equipment\"\r\neach place it appears.\r\nThe Commentary to §2D1.12 captioned \"Statutory Provisions\" is amended by inserting \"§\"\r\nbefore \"843\"; and by inserting \", 864\" after \"(7)\".\r\n\r\nThe Commentary to §2D1.12 captioned \"Application Notes\" is amended by striking the text\r\nof Note 1 as follows:\r\n\"If the offense involved the large-scale manufacture, distribution, or importation of\r\nprohibited flasks or equipment, an upward departure may be warranted.\",\r\nand inserting the following:\r\n\"If the offense involved the large-scale manufacture, distribution, transportation,\r\nexportation, or importation of prohibited flasks, equipment, chemicals, products, or\r\nmaterial, an upward departure may be warranted.\".\r\nAppendix A (Statutory Index) is amended by inserting after the line referenced to 21 U.S.C.\r\n§ 863 the following:\r\n\"21 U.S.C. § 864 2D1.12\".","Reason":"Reason for Amendment: This amendment addresses the new offense, in section 423 of the\r\nControlled Substances Act, 21 U.S.C. § 864, of stealing or transporting across state lines\r\nanhydrous ammonia knowing, intending, or having reasonable cause to believe that such\r\nanhydrous ammonia will be used to manufacture a controlled substance.

In addition, this\r\namendment expands the coverage of Application Note 1 to also apply to cases involving the\r\ntransportation and exportation of prohibited chemicals, products, or material. Finally, the\r\namendment makes minor, non-substantive changes to the guideline in order to fully\r\nincorporate the new and existing offenses.","EffectiveDate":"Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2001."},{"Id":628,"Title":"Amendment 628","Text":"Sections 2G1.1, 2G2.1, 2H4.1, 2H4.2, and 5E1.1, and each line in Appendix\r\nA (Statutory Index) referenced to 18 U.S.C. § 241, § 1589, § 1590, §1591, or §1592, or to\r\n29 U.S.C. § 1851, effective May 1, 2001 (see Amendment 612), are repromulgated with the\r\nfollowing changes:\r\nSection 5E1.1(a)(1) is amended by inserting \", or 21 U.S.C. § 853(q)\" after \"3663A\".\r\nThe Commentary to §5E1.1 captioned \"Background\" is amended in the first paragraph by\r\ninserting \", and 21 U.S.C. § 853(q)\" after \"3663A\".\r\nAmendment 626 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003","Reason":"Reason for Amendment: This amendment repromulgates as a permanent amendment the\r\npreviously promulgated emergency amendment on human trafficking. (See Amendment\r\n612.) The amendment implements the congressional directive in section 112(b) of the\r\nVictims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000, Pub. L. 106–386 (the \"Act\").\r\nThe directive requires the Commission to amend, if appropriate, the guidelines applicable\r\nto human trafficking (i.e., peonage, involuntary servitude, and forced labor) offenses. It also\r\nrequires the Commission to ensure that the guidelines \"are sufficiently stringent to deter and\r\nadequately reflect the heinous nature of these offenses.\" In compliance with the directive,\r\nthe amendment (1) creates a new guideline, §2H4.2 (Willful Violations of the Migrant and\r\nSeasonal Agricultural Worker Protection Act); (2) refers violations of four new statutes,\r\n18 U.S.C. §§ 1589 (Forced Labor), 1590 (Trafficking with Respect to Peonage, Involuntary\r\nServitude or Forced Labor), 1591 (Sex Trafficking of Children by Force, Fraud or Coercion),\r\nand 1592 (Unlawful Conduct with Respect to Documents in Furtherance of Peonage,\r\nInvoluntary Servitude, or Forced Labor) to the appropriate guidelines; and (3) makes\r\nchanges, consistent with the directive, which both enhance sentences and reflect changes to\r\nthree existing statutes: 18 U.S.C. §§ 1581(a) (Peonage), 1583 (Enticement into Slavery) and\r\n1584 (Sale into Involuntary Servitude).\r\nTo address this multi-faceted directive, the amendment makes changes to several existing\r\nguidelines and creates a new guideline for criminal violations of the Migrant and Seasonal\r\nAgricultural Worker Protection Act. Although the directive instructs the Commission to\r\namend the guidelines applicable to the Fair Labor Standards Act (29 U.S.C. § 201 et. seq.),\r\na criminal violation of the Fair Labor Standards Act is only a Class B misdemeanor. See 29\r\nU.S.C. § 216. Thus, the guidelines are not applicable to those offenses.\r\nThe amendment references the new offense at 18 U.S.C. § 1591 to §2G1.1 (Promoting\r\nProstitution or Prohibited Sexual Conduct). Section 1591 provides criminal penalties for a\r\ndefendant who participates in the transporting or harboring of a person, or who benefits from\r\nparticipating in such a venture, with the knowledge that force, fraud, or coercion will be used\r\nto cause that person to engage in a commercial sex act or with knowledge that the person is\r\nnot 18 years old and will be forced to engage in a commercial sex act. Despite the statute’s\r\ninclusion in a chapter of title 18 devoted mainly to peonage offenses, section 1591 offenses\r\nare more analogous to the offenses referenced to the prostitution guideline.\r\nSection 1591 cases alternatively have been referred in Appendix A (Statutory Index) to\r\n§2G2.1 (Sexually Exploiting a Minor by Production of Sexually Explicit Visual or Printed\r\nMaterial; Custodian Permitting Minor to Engage in Sexually Explicit Conduct;\r\nAdvertisement for Minors to Engage in Production). This has been done in anticipation that\r\nsome portion of section 1591 cases will involve forcing or coercing children to engage in\r\ncommercial sex acts for the purpose of producing pornography. Such offenses, as\r\nrecognized by the higher base offense level at §2G2.1, are more serious because they both\r\ninvolve specific harm to an individual victim and further an additional criminal purpose,\r\nnamely, commercial pornography.\r\nThe amendment maintains the view that §2H4.1 (Peonage, Involuntary Servitude, and Slave\r\nTrade) continues to be an appropriate tool for determining sentences for violations of 18\r\nU.S.C. §§ 1581, 1583, and 1584. Section 2H4.1 also is designed to cover offenses under\r\nthree new statutes: 18 U.S.C. §§ 1589, 1590, and 1592. Section 1589 provides criminal\r\npenalties for a defendant who provides or obtains the labor or services of another by the use\r\n\r\nof threats of serious harm or physical restraint against a person, or by a scheme or plan\r\nintended to make the person believe that physical restraint or serious harm would result from\r\nnot performing the labor or services. This statute also applies to defendants who provide or\r\nobtain labor or services of another by abusing or threatening abuse of the law or the legal\r\nprocess. See 18 U.S.C. § 1589.\r\nSection 1590 provides criminal penalties for a defendant who harbors, transports, or is\r\notherwise involved in obtaining, a person for labor or services. Section 1592 provides\r\ncriminal penalties for a defendant who knowingly possesses, destroys, or removes an actual\r\npassport, other immigration document, or government identification document of another\r\nperson in the course of a violation of § 1581 (peonage), § 1583 (enticement into slavery), §\r\n1584 (sale into involuntary servitude), § 1589 (forced labor), § 1590 (trafficking with respect\r\nto these offenses), § 1591 (sex trafficking of children by force, fraud, or coercion), or §\r\n1594(a) (attempts to violate these offenses). Section 1592 also provides criminal penalties\r\nfor a defendant who, with intent to violate § 1581, § 1583, § 1584, § 1589, § 1590, or\r\n§ 1591, knowingly possesses, destroys, or removes an actual passport, other immigration\r\ndocument, or government identification document of another person. These statutes prohibit\r\nthe types of behaviors that traditionally have been sentenced under §2H4.1.\r\nThe amendment provides an alternative, less punitive base offense level of level 18 for those\r\nwho violate 18 U.S.C. § 1592, an offense which limits participation in peonage cases to the\r\ndestruction or wrongful confiscation of a passport or other immigration document. This\r\nalternative, lower base level reflects the lower statutory maximum sentence for section 1592\r\noffenses (i.e., 5 years’ imprisonment).\r\nSection 2H4.1(b)(2) has been expanded to provide a four-level increase if a dangerous\r\nweapon was used and a two-level increase if a dangerous weapon was brandished or its use\r\nwas threatened. Prior to this amendment, only actual use of a dangerous weapon was\r\ncovered. This change reflects the directive to consider an enhancement for the use or\r\nthreatened use of a dangerous weapon. The commentary to §2H4.1 is amended to clarify\r\nthat the threatened use of a dangerous weapon applies regardless of whether a dangerous\r\nweapon was actually present.\r\nThe amendment also creates a new guideline, §2H4.2 (Willful Violations of the Migrant and\r\nSeasonal Agricultural Worker Protection Act), in response to the directive to amend the\r\nguidelines applicable to such offenses. These offenses, which have a statutory maximum\r\nsentence of one year imprisonment for first offenses and three years’ imprisonment for\r\nsubsequent offenses, were not, prior to this amendment, referred to any specific guideline.\r\nThe amendment provides a base offense level of level 6 in recognition of the low statutory\r\nmaximum sentences set for these cases by Congress. Further, these offenses typically\r\ninvolve violations of regulatory provisions. Setting the base offense level at level 6 provides\r\nconsistency with guidelines for other regulatory offenses. See, e.g., §§2N2.1 (Violations of\r\nStatutes and Regulations Dealing With Any Food, Drug, Biological Product, Device,\r\nCosmetic, or Agricultural Product) and 2N3.1 (Odometer Laws and Regulations).\r\nSubsections (b)(1), an enhancement for bodily injury, and (b)(2), an enhancement applicable\r\nto defendants who commit the instant offense after previously sustaining a civil penalty for\r\nsimilar misconduct, have been established to respond to the directive that the Commission\r\nconsider sentencing enhancement for this aggravated conduct. This provision addresses the\r\nDepartment of Justice’s and the Department of Labor’s concern regarding the need for\r\nenhanced penalties in cases involving prior administrative and civil adjudications.\r\nAmendment 627 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003\r\n\r\nThis amendment also addresses that portion of section 112 of the Act that amends chapter\r\n77 of title 18, United States Code, to provide mandatory restitution for peonage and\r\ninvoluntary servitude offenses. The amendment amends §5E1.1 (Restitution) to include a\r\nreference to 18 U.S.C. § 1593 in the guideline provision regarding mandatory restitution.\r\nBy enactment of various sentencing enhancements and encouraged upward departures for\r\nareas of concern identified by Congress, the Commission has provided for more severe\r\nsentences for perpetrators of human trafficking offenses in keeping with the conclusion that\r\nthe offenses covered by this amendment are both heinous in nature and being committed\r\nwith increasing frequency.\r\nIn addition, to repromulgating the emergency amendment, this amendment responds to\r\nsection 3613 of the Methamphetamine Anti-Proliferation Act of 2000, Pub. L. 106–310, that\r\namends 21 U.S.C. § 853(q) to provide mandatory restitution for offenses involving the\r\nmanufacture of methamphetamine. Accordingly, the amendment amends §5E1.1\r\n(Restitution) to include a reference to 21 U.S.C. § 853(q) in the guideline provision\r\nregarding mandatory restitution.","EffectiveDate":"Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2001."},{"Id":629,"Title":"Amendment 629","Text":"Section 2H3.1 is amended in the title by striking \"or\" and inserting a\r\nsemicolon; and by inserting \"; Disclosure of Tax Return Information\" after \"Eavesdropping\".\r\nSection 2H3.1 is amended by striking subsection (a) as follows:\r\n\"(a) Base Offense Level: 9\",\r\nand inserting the following:\r\n\"(a) Base Offense Level (Apply the greater):\r\n(1) 9; or\r\n(2) 6, if the defendant was convicted of 26 U.S.C. § 7213A or 26\r\nU.S.C. § 7216.\".\r\nSection 2H3.1(b)(1) is amended by striking \"conduct\" and inserting \"offense\".\r\nSection 2H3.1(c)(1) is amended by striking \"conduct\" and inserting \"offense\"; and by\r\nstriking \"that offense\" and inserting \"that other offense\".\r\nThe Commentary to §2H3.1 captioned \"Statutory Provisions\" is amended by inserting \"26\r\nU.S.C. §§ 7213(a)(1)-(3), (a)(5), (d), 7213A, 7216;\" after \"2511;\".\r\nThe Commentary to §2H3.1 captioned \"Application Note\" is amended by striking \"Note\"\r\nand inserting \"Notes\"; by redesignating Note 1 as Note 2; and by inserting before Note 2, as\r\nredesignated by this amendment, the following:\r\n\"1.

The Act created\r\nnew tax offenses pertaining to the unlawful disclosure of tax-related information contained\r\non computer software and to unlawful requests for tax audits. In addition, the Taxpayer\r\nBrowsing Protection Act of 1997, Public Law 105–35, created another tax offense pertaining\r\nto the unlawful inspection of tax information.\r\nSpecifically, Public Law 105–35 expanded 26 U.S.C. § 7213 to prohibit federal and state\r\nemployees and certain other persons from disclosing tax-related computer software. Public\r\nLaw 105–35 also created an offense at 26 U.S.C. § 7213A making it unlawful for federal and\r\nstate employees and certain other persons to inspect tax return information in any way other\r\nthan that authorized under the Internal Revenue Code.\r\nThis is a two-part amendment. First, this amendment updates Appendix A (Statutory Index)\r\nby referring most of these offenses to §2H3.1 (Interception of Communications and\r\nEavesdropping). Prior to this amendment, no guideline provision or statutory reference was\r\nexpressly promulgated to address tax offenses that implicated privacy interests. Under\r\nsubsection (a) of §1B1.2 (Applicable Guidelines) and under §2X5.1 (Other Offenses), courts\r\nare required to use the most analogous offense guideline from Chapter Two (Offense\r\nConduct) in each pending case brought under a statute having no reference in the guidelines’\r\nAmendment 628 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003\r\n\r\nstatutory index.\r\nIn general, the guideline most analogous for these offenses is §2H3.1. Section 2H3.1\r\nconcerns offenses against privacy and, in large measure, these tax-related offenses are\r\ndevoted to protecting taxpayer privacy interests. Section 2H3.1 also contains a cross\r\nreference to \"another offense\" if a greater offense level will result.\r\nSecond, this amendment adds a three-level decrease in the base offense level under §2H3.1\r\nfor the least serious types of offense behavior, in which there was no intent to harm or obtain\r\npecuniary gain. The base offense level for §2H3.1 is level 9 with a range of 4 to 10 months\r\n(in criminal history Category I). The Commission determined that a base offense level of\r\nlevel 9 is too severe for the misdemeanor offenses contained in 26 U.S.C. §§ 7213A\r\n(Unauthorized Inspection) and 7216 (Unauthorized Disclosure), and the three-level decrease\r\naddresses this concern.","EffectiveDate":"Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2001."},{"Id":630,"Title":"Amendment 630","Text":"Section 2K1.3(a) is amended by striking the text of subdivision (3) as\r\nfollows:\r\n\"16, if the defendant is a prohibited person; or knowingly distributed explosive\r\nmaterials to a prohibited person; or\",\r\nand inserting the following:\r\n\"16, if the defendant (A) was a prohibited person at the time the defendant\r\ncommitted the instant offense; or (B) knowingly distributed explosive materials to\r\na prohibited person; or\".\r\nThe Commentary to §2K1.3 captioned \"Statutory Provisions\" is amended by inserting \"(l)-\r\n(o), (p)(2),\" after \"(i),\".\r\nThe Commentary to §2K1.3 captioned \"Application Notes\" is amended by striking the text\r\nof Note 3 as follows:\r\n\"‘Prohibited person,’ as used in subsection (a)(3), means anyone who: (i) is under\r\nindictment for, or has been convicted of, a ‘crime punishable by imprisonment for\r\na term exceeding one year,’ as defined at 18 U.S.C. § 841(l); (ii) is a fugitive from\r\njustice; (iii) is an unlawful user of, or is addicted to, any controlled substance; or (iv)\r\nhas been adjudicated as a mental defective or involuntarily committed to a mental\r\ninstitution.\",\r\nand inserting the following:\r\n\"For purposes of subsection (a)(3), ‘prohibited person’ means any person described\r\nin 18 U.S.C. § 842(i).\".\r\nSection 2K2.1(a)(4)(B) is amended by striking \"is\" after \"(i)\" and inserting \"was\"; and by\r\ninserting \"at the time the defendant committed the instant offense\" after \"prohibited person\".\r\n\r\nSection 2K2.1(a)(6) is amended by striking \"is\" after \"(A)\" and inserting \"was\"; and by\r\ninserting \"at the time the defendant committed the instant offense\" after \"prohibited person\".\r\nThe Commentary to §2K2.1 captioned \"Application Notes\" is amended by striking the text\r\nof Note 6 as follows:\r\n‘Prohibited person,’ as used in subsections (a)(4)(B) and (a)(6), means anyone who:\r\n(i) is under indictment for, or has been convicted of, a ‘crime punishable by\r\nimprisonment for more than one year,’ as defined by 18 U.S.C. § 921(a)(20); (ii) is\r\na fugitive from justice; (iii) is an unlawful user of, or is addicted to, any controlled\r\nsubstance; (iv) has been adjudicated as a mental defective or involuntarily\r\ncommitted to a mental institution; (v) being an alien, is illegally or unlawfully in the\r\nUnited States; (vi) is subject to a court order that restrains such person from\r\nharassing, stalking, or threatening an intimate partner of such person or child of such\r\nintimate partner or person, or engaging in other conduct that would place an intimate\r\npartner in reasonable fear of bodily injury to the partner or child as defined in\r\n18 U.S.C. § 922(d)(8); or (vii) has been convicted in any court of a misdemeanor\r\ncrime of domestic violence as defined in 18 U.S.C. § 921(a)(33).\",\r\nand inserting the following:\r\n\"For purposes of subsections (a)(4)(B) and (a)(6), ‘prohibited person’ means any\r\nperson described in 18 U.S.C. § 922(g) or § 922(n).\".","Reason":"Reason for Amendment: This amendment makes two revisions regarding the definition\r\nof \"prohibited person\" in subsection (a)(3) of §2K1.3 (Unlawful Receipt, Possession, or\r\nTransportation of Explosive Materials; Prohibited Transactions Involving Explosive\r\nMaterials) and subsections (a)(4)(B) and (a)(6) of §2K2.1 (Unlawful Receipt, Possession,\r\nor Transportation of Firearms or Ammunition; Prohibited Transactions Involving Firearms\r\nor Ammunition). First, the amendment adopts the definitions of prohibited person found in\r\nspecific statutes for explosive and firearm offenses. (There is no uniform statutory definition\r\nof prohibited person.)

Barton, 100\r\nF.3d 43, 46 (6th Cir. 1996) (defendant’s state drug crime, which was committed after federal\r\noffense of being a felon in possession of firearm, could not have been counted as prior felony\r\nconviction under §2K2.1(a), even though defendant was convicted and sentenced on state\r\noffense prior to sentencing on federal charge; only those convictions that occur prior to the\r\ncommission of the firearm offense may be counted against the defendant in determining the\r\nbase offense level) ) and United States v. Oetken, 241 F.3d 1057 (8th Cir. 2001) (only\r\nconvictions that occur prior to the commission of the offense qualify as \"prior convictions\").\r\nThe amendment adopts the minority view that an offense committed after the commission\r\nof any part of the offense cannot be counted as a prior felony conviction.

For purposes of this guideline—\r\n‘Deported after a conviction,’ means that the deportation was subsequent\r\nto the conviction, whether or not the deportation was in response to such\r\nconviction. An alien has previously been ‘deported’ if he or she has been\r\nremoved or has departed the United States while an order of exclusion,\r\ndeportation, or removal was outstanding.\r\n‘Remained in the United States following a removal order issued after a\r\nconviction,’ means that the removal order was subsequent to the conviction,\r\nwhether or not the removal order was in response to such conviction.\r\n‘Aggravated felony,’ is defined at 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43) without regard to\r\nthe date of conviction of the aggravated felony.\r\n‘Crime of violence’ and ‘controlled substance offense’ are defined in\r\n§4B1.2.

This guideline applies only to felonies. A first offense under 8 U.S.C. §\r\n1325(a) is a Class B misdemeanor for which no guideline has been\r\npromulgated. A prior sentence for such offense, however, is to be\r\nconsidered under the provisions of Chapter Four, Part A (Criminal History).\r\n3. In the case of a defendant with repeated prior instances of deportation, an\r\nupward departure may be warranted. See §4A1.3 (Adequacy of Criminal\r\nHistory Category).\r\n4. An adjustment under subsection (b) for a prior felony conviction applies in\r\naddition to any criminal history points added for such conviction in Chapter\r\nFour, Part A (Criminal History).\r\n5.

The disproportionate penalties result because the breadth of the definition of\r\n\"aggravated felony\" provided in 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43), which is incorporated into the\r\nguideline by reference, means that a defendant who previously was convicted of murder, for\r\nexample, receives the same 16-level enhancement as a defendant previously convicted of\r\nsimple assault. The Commission also observed that the criminal justice system has been\r\naddressing this inequity on an ad hoc basis in such cases by increased use of departures.\r\nThis amendment responds to these concerns by providing a more graduated sentencing\r\nenhancement of between 8 levels and 16 levels, depending on the seriousness of the prior\r\naggravated felony and the dangerousness of the defendant. In doing so, the Commission\r\ndetermined that the 16-level enhancement is warranted if the defendant previously was\r\ndeported, or unlawfully remained in the United States, after a conviction for certain serious\r\noffenses, specifically, a drug trafficking offense for which the sentence imposed exceeded\r\n13 months, a felony that is a crime of violence, a felony that is a firearms offense, a felony\r\nthat is a national security or terrorism offense, a felony that is a human trafficking offense,\r\nAmendment 632 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003\r\n\r\nand a felony that is an alien smuggling offense committed for profit. Other felony drug\r\ntrafficking offenses will receive a 12-level enhancement. All other aggravated felony\r\noffenses will receive an 8-level enhancement.\r\nThis amendment also deletes an application note providing that a downward departure may\r\nbe warranted based on the seriousness of the offense if the 16-level enhancement applied and\r\n(1) the defendant has previously been convicted of only one felony offense; (2) such offense\r\nwas not a crime of violence or firearms offense; and (3) the term of imprisonment for such\r\noffenses did not exceed one year. The Commission determined that the graduation of the 16-\r\nlevel enhancement based on the seriousness of the prior conviction negated the need for this\r\ndeparture provision. As a result, this amendment may have the indirect result of reducing\r\nthe departure rate for cases sentenced under §2L1.2. In addition, this amendment renders\r\nmoot a circuit conflict regarding whether the three criteria set forth in the application note\r\nare the exclusive basis for a downward departure from the 16-level enhancement. Compare\r\nUnited States v. Sanchez-Rodriguez, 161 F.3d 556 (9th Cir. 1998) (holding that Application\r\nNote 5 to §2L1.2 does not limit the circumstances under which a downward departure from\r\nthe 16-level enhancement is warranted); and United States v. Alfaro-Zayas, 196 F.3d 1338\r\n(11th Cir. 1999) (same), with United States v. Tappin, 205 F.3d 536 (2d Cir. 2000) (holding\r\nthat a defendant must satisfy all three criteria set forth in Application Note 5 in §2L1.2 to\r\nreceive a downward departure from the 16-level enhancement).\r\nThis amendment also makes a number of other minor changes to §2L1.2, to provide\r\nguidance regarding the application of the enhancement for the commission of three or more\r\nprior misdemeanors and to provide definitions for terms used in the guideline.","EffectiveDate":"Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2001."},{"Id":634,"Title":"Amendment 634","Text":"The heading to Chapter Two, Part M is amended by adding at the end \"And\r\nWeapons of Mass Destruction\".\r\nSection 2M5.1 is amended by striking subsection (a) as follows:\r\n\"(a) Base Offense Level (Apply the greater):\r\n(1) 22, if national security or nuclear proliferation controls were\r\nevaded; or\r\n(2) 14.\",\r\nand inserting the following:\r\n\"(a) Base Offense Level (Apply the greater):\r\n(1) 26, if national security controls or controls relating to the\r\nproliferation of nuclear, biological, or chemical weapons or\r\nmaterials were evaded; or\r\n(2) 14, otherwise.\".\r\nSection 2M5.2(a)(1) is amended by striking \"22\" and inserting \"26\".\r\nNovember 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II Amendment 633\r\n\r\nThe heading to Chapter Two, Part M, Subpart 6 is amended by striking \"Atomic Energy\" and\r\ninserting \"Nuclear, Biological, And Chemical Weapons And Materials, And Other Weapons\r\nof Mass Destruction\".\r\nChapter Two, Part M is amended by striking §2M6.1 as follows:\r\n\"§2M6.1.

This\r\nincrease serves to make the penalty structure for those offenses proportional to other national\r\nsecurity guidelines in Chapter Two, Part M. In addition, Appendix A (Statutory Index) is\r\namended to refer one of the offenses, 50 U.S.C. § 1701 (which prior to this amendment was\r\nnot referenced in the Statutory Index), to both §§2M5.1 and 2M5.2.\r\nThe amendment also substantially revises §2M6.1 to incorporate offenses at 18 U.S.C. § 175,\r\nrelating to biological weapons, and 18 U.S.C. § 229, relating to chemical weapons.\r\nSpecifically, the amendment modifies §2M6.1 as follows:\r\nFirst, the amendment provides three alternative base offense levels. The first alternative base\r\noffense level of level 42 applies if the offense was committed with the intent to injure the\r\nUnited States or to aid a foreign government or foreign terrorist organization and\r\nincorporates the 12-level enhancement previously at subsection (b)(1). Therefore, this\r\nchange does not affect the overall offense level for these offenses. \"Foreign terrorist\r\norganizations\" are added because such groups are investing in the acquisition of\r\nunconventional weapons such as nuclear, biological, and chemical agents. This first\r\nalternative base offense level is expected to apply to cases previously covered by the\r\nguideline (i.e., the acquisition of nuclear material from nuclear facilities in order to assist\r\nforeign governments, thereby creating a threat to the national security), as well as to cases\r\nthat implicate the national security and involve biological and chemical weapons and other\r\nweapons of mass destruction.\r\nThe amendment provides that, if the base offense level of level 42 applies, none of the\r\nadjustments in subsection (b) shall apply. However, if death results, the cross reference\r\nallows for the possibility of a greater offense level through application of the first degree\r\nmurder guideline.\r\nThe second alternative base offense level of level 28 applies to those cases that do not\r\nthreaten the national security of the United States, and is expected to apply in most cases.\r\nThe third alternative base offense level of level 20 applies to cases which involve a threat to\r\nuse a nuclear, biological, or chemical weapon or material, or other weapon of mass\r\n\r\ndestruction, but do not involve any conduct evidencing an intent or ability to carry out the\r\nthreat and, accordingly, are less serious offenses.\r\nSecond, the amendment provides a two-level enhancement in subsection (b)(1) if the offense\r\nor threat involved particularly dangerous types of nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons\r\nand materials that are defined in the guideline commentary by reference to the applicable\r\nstatutory and regulatory provisions. This enhancement reflects the distinctions already made\r\nin international treaties, provisions of title 18, United States Code, relevant regulatory\r\nschemes, and the fact that certain types of weapons and materials are inherently more lethal\r\nand pose a greater threat to the public safety.\r\nThird, the amendment provides a four-level enhancement in subsection (b)(2) if any victim\r\ndied or sustained permanent or life-threatening bodily injury, and a two-level enhancement\r\nif any victim sustained serious bodily injury. If the degree of injury is between permanent\r\nor life-threatening bodily injury and serious bodily injury, a three-level enhancement is\r\nprovided. This enhancement is modeled after the enhancement found in §2N1.1 (Tampering\r\nor Attempting to Tamper Involving Risk of Death or Bodily Injury).\r\nFourth, the amendment provides a four-level enhancement for cases involving a substantial\r\ndisruption of public, governmental, or business functions or services, or the substantial\r\nexpenditure of funds to clean up, decontaminate, or otherwise respond to the offense.\r\nFifth, the amendment provides two cross references, applicable if the resulting offense level\r\nis greater and either death resulted (in which case the first or second degree murder guideline\r\nwould apply), or if the offense was tantamount to attempted murder (in which case the\r\nattempted murder guideline would apply). These cross references are also modeled after the\r\ncross reference found in §2N1.1.\r\nSixth, the amendment provides a special instruction that if the defendant is convicted of one\r\ncount involving the death of, serious bodily injury to, or attempted murder of, more than one\r\nvictim, the grouping rules will be applied as if the defendant had been convicted of separate\r\ncounts for each such victim.\r\nSeventh, the amendment amends Appendix A to refer violations of 18 U.S.C. §§ 175 and\r\n229 to §2M6.1 and to delete a number of guideline references for violations of 18 U.S.C. §\r\n2332a and instead provide a reference for that offense to §§2K1.4 (Arson; Property Damage\r\nby Use of Explosives) and 2M6.1 (in the case of other weapons of mass destruction).\r\nFinally, the amendment amends the title of §2M6.1 to include attempts and conspiracies, and\r\nadds §2M6.1 under the sections addressing attempts and conspiracies in Application\r\nNote 1 of §2X1.1 (Attempt, Solicitation, or Conspiracy) to indicate that attempts and\r\nconspiracies are covered expressly by the §2M6.1 offense guideline.","EffectiveDate":"Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2001."},{"Id":635,"Title":"Amendment 635","Text":"Chapter Two, Part S is amended by striking §2S1.1 as follows:\r\n\"§2S1.1.

The punishment is higher than that specified in §2S1.2\r\nand §2S1.3 because of the higher statutory maximum, and the added elements as to\r\nsource of funds, knowledge, and intent.\r\nA higher base offense level is specified if the defendant is convicted under\r\n18 U.S.C. § 1956(a)(1)(A), (a)(2)(A), or (a)(3)(A) because those subsections apply\r\nto defendants who encouraged or facilitated the commission of further crimes.\r\nEffective November 18, 1988, 18 U.S.C. § 1956(a)(1)(A) contains two subdivisions.\r\nThe base offense level of 23 applies to § 1956(a)(1)(A)(i) and (ii).\r\nThe amount of money involved is included as a factor because it is an\r\nindicator of the magnitude of the criminal enterprise, and the extent to which the\r\ndefendant aided the enterprise. Narcotics trafficking is included as a factor because\r\nof the clearly expressed Congressional intent to adequately punish persons involved\r\nin that activity.\".\r\nA replacement guideline with accompanying commentary is inserted as §2S1.1 (Laundering\r\nof Monetary Instruments; Engaging in Monetary Transactions in Property Derived from\r\nUnlawful Activity).\r\nChapter Two, Part S is amended by striking §2S1.2 as follows:\r\n\"§2S1.2.

For additional statutory provision(s), see\r\nAppendix A (Statutory Index).\r\nApplication Note:\r\n1. ‘Specified unlawful activity’ is defined in 18 U.S.C. § 1956(c)(7) to include\r\nracketeering offenses (18 U.S.C. § 1961(1)), drug offenses, and most other\r\nserious federal crimes but does not include other money-laundering\r\noffenses.\r\nBackground: The statute covered by this guideline is a part of the Anti-Drug Abuse\r\nAct of 1986, and prohibits monetary transactions that exceed $10,000 and involve\r\nthe proceeds of ‘specified unlawful activity’ (as defined in 18 U.S.C. § 1956), if the\r\ndefendant knows that the funds are criminally derived property. (Knowledge that\r\nthe property is from a specified unlawful activity is not an element of the offense.)\r\nThe maximum term of imprisonment specified is ten years.\r\nThe statute is similar to 18 U.S.C. § 1956, but does not require that the\r\nNovember 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II Amendment 634\r\n\r\nrecipient exchange or ‘launder’ the funds, that he have knowledge that the funds\r\nwere proceeds of a specified unlawful activity, nor that he have any intent to further\r\nor conceal such an activity. In keeping with the intent of the legislation, this\r\nguideline provides for substantial punishment. The offense levels are higher than\r\nin §2S1.3 because of the higher statutory maximum and the added element of\r\nknowing that the funds were criminally derived property.\r\nThe 2-level increase in subsection (b)(1)(B) applies if the defendant knew\r\nthat the funds were not merely criminally derived, but were in fact the proceeds of\r\na specified unlawful activity. Such a distinction is not made in §2S1.1, because the\r\nlevel of intent required in that section effectively precludes an inference that the\r\ndefendant was unaware of the nature of the activity.\".\r\nThe Commentary to §2S1.3 captioned \"Statutory Provisions\" is amended by inserting \"18\r\nU.S.C. § 1960;\" before \"26 U.S.C. § 7203\"; and by inserting \", 5326\" after \"5324\".\r\nAppendix A (Statutory Index) is amended in the line referenced to 18 U.S.C. § 1957 and the\r\nline referenced to 21 U.S.C. § 854 by striking \"2S1.2\" and inserting \"2S1.1\";\r\nby inserting after the line referenced to 18 U.S.C. § 1959 the following new line:\r\n\"18 U.S.C. § 1960 2S1.3\";\r\nand by inserting after the line referenced to 31 U.S.C. § 5324 the following new line:\r\n\"31 U.S.C. § 5326 2S1.3, 2T2.2\".\r\nThe Commentary to §1B1.3 captioned \"Application Notes\" is amended in Note 6 in the first\r\nparagraph by striking the second sentence as follows:\r\n\"For example, in §2S1.1 (Laundering of Monetary Instruments), subsection (a)(1)\r\napplies if the defendant ‘is convicted under 18 U.S.C. § 1956(a)(1)(A), (a)(2)(A),\r\nor (a)(3)(A).’\",\r\nand inserting the following:\r\n\"For example, in §2S1.1 (Laundering of Monetary Instruments; Engaging in\r\nMonetary Transactions in Property Derived from Unlawful Activity), subsection\r\n(b)(2)(B) applies if the defendant ‘is convicted under 18 U.S.C. § 1956’.\".\r\nThe Commentary to §1B1.3 captioned \"Application Notes\" is amended in Note 6 in the\r\nsecond paragraph by striking \"An express\" and inserting \"Unless otherwise specified, an\r\nexpress\"; and by striking the last sentence as follows:\r\n\"For example, §2S1.1(a)(1) (which is applicable only if the defendant is convicted\r\nunder 18 U.S.C. § 1956(a)(1)(A), (a)(2)(A), or (a)(3)(A)) would be applied in\r\ndetermining the offense level under §2X3.1 (Accessory After the Fact) where the\r\ndefendant was convicted of accessory after the fact to a violation of 18 U.S.C. §\r\n1956(a)(1)(A), (a)(2)(A), or (a)(3)(A).\",\r\nAmendment 634 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003\r\n\r\nand inserting the following:\r\n\"For example, §2S1.1(b)(2)(B) (which is applicable only if the defendant is\r\nconvicted under 18 U.S.C. § 1956) would be applied in determining the offense\r\nlevel under §2X3.1 (Accessory After the Fact) in a case in which the defendant was\r\nconvicted of accessory after the fact to a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1956 but would\r\nnot be applied in a case in which the defendant is convicted of a conspiracy under\r\n18 U.S.C. § 1956(h) and the sole object of that conspiracy was to commit an offense\r\nset forth in 18 U.S.C. § 1957.

The\r\namendment responds in several ways to concerns that the penalty structure existing prior to\r\nthis amendment for such offenses did not reflect adequately the culpability of the defendant\r\nor the seriousness of the money laundering conduct because the offense level for money\r\nlaundering was determined without sufficient consideration of the defendant’s involvement\r\nin, or the relative seriousness of, the underlying offense. This amendment is designed to\r\npromote proportionality by providing increased penalties for defendants who launder funds\r\nderived from more serious underlying criminal conduct, such as drug trafficking, crimes of\r\nviolence, and fraud offenses that generate relatively high loss amounts, and decreased\r\npenalties for defendants who launder funds derived from less serious underlying criminal\r\nconduct, such as basic fraud offenses that generate relatively low loss amounts.\r\nFirst, this amendment ties offense levels for money laundering more closely to the\r\nunderlying conduct that was the source of the criminally derived funds by separating money\r\nlaundering offenders into two categories for purposes of determining the base offense level.\r\nFor direct money launderers (offenders who commit or would be accountable under\r\n§1B1.3(a)(1)(A) (Relevant Conduct) for the underlying offense which generated the criminal\r\nproceeds), subsection (a)(1) sets the base offense level at the offense level in Chapter Two\r\n(Offense Conduct) for the underlying offense (i.e., the base offense level, specific offense\r\ncharacteristics, cross references, and special instructions for the underlying offense). For\r\nthird party money launderers (offenders who launder the proceeds generated from underlying\r\noffenses that the defendant did not commit or would not be accountable for under\r\n§1B1.3(a)(1)(A)), subsection (a)(2) sets the base offense level at level 8, plus an increase\r\nbased on the value of the laundered funds from the table in subsection (b)(1) of §2B1.1\r\n(Theft, Fraud, Property Destruction).\r\nNovember 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II Amendment 634\r\n\r\nSecond, in addition to the base offense level calculation, this amendment provides an\r\nenhancement designed to reflect the differing seriousness of the underlying conduct that was\r\nthe source of the criminally derived funds. Subsection (b)(1) provides a six-level\r\nenhancement for third party money launderers who knew or believed that any of the\r\nlaundered funds were the proceeds of, or were intended to promote, certain types of more\r\nserious underlying criminal conduct; specifically, drug trafficking, crimes of violence,\r\noffenses involving firearms, explosives, national security, terrorism, and the sexual\r\nexploitation of a minor. The Commission determined that defendants who knowingly\r\nlaunder the proceeds of these more serious underlying offenses are substantially more\r\nculpable than third party launderers of criminally derived proceeds of less serious underlying\r\noffenses.\r\nThird, this amendment provides three alternative enhancements, with the greatest applicable\r\nenhancement to be applied. These enhancements are designed to (1) ensure that all direct\r\nmoney launderers receive additional punishment for committing both the money laundering\r\noffense and the underlying offense, and (2) reflect the differing seriousness of money\r\nlaundering conduct depending on the nature and sophistication of the offense. Specifically,\r\nsubsection (b)(2)(A) provides a one-level increase if the defendant was convicted under 18\r\nU.S.C. § 1957, and subsection (b)(2)(B) provides a two-level increase if the defendant was\r\nconvicted under 18 U.S.C. § 1956. The one-level difference between these two\r\nenhancements reflects the fact that 18 U.S.C. § 1956 has a statutory maximum penalty (20\r\nyears’ imprisonment) that is twice as long as the statutory maximum penalty for violations\r\nof 18 U.S.C. § 1957 (10 years’ imprisonment). In addition, subsection (b)(3) provides an\r\nadditional two-level increase if subsection (b)(2)(B) applies and the offense involved\r\nsophisticated laundering such as the use of fictitious entities, shell corporations, two or more\r\nlevels of transactions, or offshore financial accounts. The Commission determined that,\r\nsimilar to fraud and tax offenses that involve sophisticated means, see subsection (b)(8) of\r\n§2B1.1 (Theft, Property Destruction, and Fraud), subsection (b)(2) of §2T1.1 (Tax Evasion;\r\nWillful Failure to File Return, Supply Information, or Pay Tax; Fraudulent or False Returns,\r\nStatements, or Other Documents), violations of 18 U.S.C. § 1956 that involve sophisticated\r\nlaundering warrant additional punishment because such offenses are more difficult and time\r\nconsuming for law enforcement to detect than less sophisticated laundering. As a result of\r\nthe enhancements provided by subsections (b)(2)(A), (b)(2)(B), and (b)(3), all direct money\r\nlaunderers will receive an offense level that is one to four levels greater than the Chapter\r\nTwo offense level for the underlying offense, depending on the statute of conviction and\r\nsophistication of the money laundering offense conduct.\r\nWith respect to third party money launderers, subsection (b)(2)(C) provides a four-level\r\nenhancement if the defendant is \"in the business\" of laundering funds. The Commission\r\ndetermined that, similar to a professional \"fence\", see §2B1.1(b)(4)(B), defendants who\r\nroutinely engage in laundering funds on behalf of others, and who gain financially from\r\nengaging in such transactions, warrant substantial additional punishment because they\r\nencourage the commission of additional criminal conduct.\r\nFourth, this amendment contains an application note expressly providing instructions\r\nregarding the grouping of money laundering counts with a count of conviction for the\r\nunderlying offense. In a case in which the defendant is to be sentenced on a count of\r\nconviction for money laundering and a count of conviction for the underlying offense that\r\ngenerated the laundered funds, this application note instructs that such counts shall be\r\ngrouped pursuant to subsection (c) of §3D1.2 (Groups of Closely-Related Counts), thereby\r\nAmendment 634 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003\r\n\r\nresolving a circuit conflict on this issue.

Napoli,\r\n179 F.3d 1 (2d Cir. 1999), cert. denied, 528 U.S. 1162 (2000) (affirming decision not to\r\ngroup wire fraud and money laundering counts under §3D1.2(b) or (d) because the offenses\r\nhave different victims and the offense level for money laundering, unlike fraud, is not based\r\nprimarily on the amount of money involved); United States v. Hildebrand, 152 F.3d 756 (8th\r\nCir.), cert. denied, 525 U.S. 1033 (1998) (finding that money laundering and fraud counts\r\nshould not be grouped because the fraud and money laundering guidelines do not measure\r\nthe same types of harm); United States v. Hanley, 190 F.3d 1017 (9th Cir. 1999) (affirming\r\ndecision not to group money laundering and wire fraud counts under §3D1.2(d) because the\r\nguidelines for such offenses measure harm differently); and United States v. Johnson, 971\r\nF.2d 562 (10th Cir. 1992) (district court erred in grouping money laundering and fraud\r\ncounts under §3D1.2(d) because the measurement of harm for fraud is not the same as that\r\nfor money laundering).\r\nFinally, this amendment provides that convictions under 18 U.S.C. § 1960 are referenced to\r\n§2S1.3 (Structuring Transactions to Evade Reporting Requirements). Operation of money\r\ntransmitting businesses without an appropriate license is proscribed by 18 U.S.C. § 1960, as\r\nare failures to comply with certain reporting requirements issued under 31 U.S.C. § 5330.\r\nThe Commission determined that offenses involving these regulatory requirements serve\r\nmany of the same purposes as Currency Transaction Reports, Currency and Monetary\r\nInstrument Reports, Reports of Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts, and Reports of Cash\r\nPayments over $10,000 Received in a Trade or Business, violations regarding which\r\ncurrently are referenced to §2S1.3, and that, therefore, violations of 18 U.S.C. § 1960 also\r\nshould be referenced to §2S1.3.","EffectiveDate":"Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2001."},{"Id":636,"Title":"Amendment 636","Text":"The Commentary to §3B1.2 is amended by striking Notes 1 through 4 and\r\nthe background as follows:\r\n\"1. Subsection (a) applies to a defendant who plays a minimal role in concerted\r\nactivity. It is intended to cover defendants who are plainly among the least\r\nculpable of those involved in the conduct of a group. Under this provision,\r\nthe defendant’s lack of knowledge or understanding of the scope and\r\nstructure of the enterprise and of the activities of others is indicative of a\r\nrole as minimal participant.\r\n2. It is intended that the downward adjustment for a minimal participant will\r\nbe used infrequently. It would be appropriate, for example, for someone\r\nNovember 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II Amendment 635\r\n\r\nwho played no other role in a very large drug smuggling operation than to\r\noffload part of a single marihuana shipment, or in a case where an\r\nindividual was recruited as a courier for a single smuggling transaction\r\ninvolving a small amount of drugs.\r\n3. For purposes of §3B1.2(b), a minor participant means any participant who\r\nis less culpable than most other participants, but whose role could not be\r\ndescribed as minimal.\r\n4. If a defendant has received a lower offense level by virtue of being\r\nconvicted of an offense significantly less serious than warranted by his\r\nactual criminal conduct, a reduction for a mitigating role under this section\r\nordinarily is not warranted because such defendant is not substantially less\r\nculpable than a defendant whose only conduct involved the less serious\r\noffense. For example, if a defendant whose actual conduct involved a\r\nminimal role in the distribution of 25 grams of cocaine (an offense having\r\na Chapter Two offense level of 14 under §2D1.1) is convicted of simple\r\npossession of cocaine (an offense having a Chapter Two offense level of 6\r\nunder §2D2.1), no reduction for a mitigating role is warranted because the\r\ndefendant is not substantially less culpable than a defendant whose only\r\nconduct involved the simple possession of cocaine.\r\nBackground: This section provides a range of adjustments for a defendant who\r\nplays a part in committing the offense that makes him substantially less culpable\r\nthan the average participant. The determination whether to apply subsection (a) or\r\nsubsection (b), or an intermediate adjustment, involves a determination that is\r\nheavily dependent upon the facts of the particular case.\",\r\nand inserting the following:\r\n\"1. Definition.—For purposes of this guideline, ‘participant’ has the meaning\r\ngiven that term in Application Note 1 of §3B1.1 (Aggravating Role).\r\n2. Requirement of Multiple Participants.—This guideline is not applicable\r\nunless more than one participant was involved in the offense. See the\r\nIntroductory Commentary to this Part (Role in the Offense). Accordingly,\r\nan adjustment under this guideline may not apply to a defendant who is the\r\nonly defendant convicted of an offense unless that offense involved other\r\nparticipants in addition to the defendant and the defendant otherwise\r\nqualifies for such an adjustment.\r\n3. Applicability of Adjustment.—\r\n(A) Substantially Less Culpable than Average Participant.—This\r\nsection provides a range of adjustments for a defendant who plays\r\na part in committing the offense that makes him substantially less\r\nculpable than the average participant.\r\nA defendant who is accountable under §1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct)\r\nonly for the conduct in which the defendant personally was\r\nAmendment 635 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003\r\n\r\ninvolved and who performs a limited function in concerted criminal\r\nactivity is not precluded from consideration for an adjustment\r\nunder this guideline. For example, a defendant who is convicted of\r\na drug trafficking offense, whose role in that offense was limited to\r\ntransporting or storing drugs and who is accountable under §1B1.3\r\nonly for the quantity of drugs the defendant personally transported\r\nor stored is not precluded from consideration for an adjustment\r\nunder this guideline.\r\n(B) Conviction of Significantly Less Serious Offense.—If a defendant\r\nhas received a lower offense level by virtue of being convicted of\r\nan offense significantly less serious than warranted by his actual\r\ncriminal conduct, a reduction for a mitigating role under this\r\nsection ordinarily is not warranted because such defendant is not\r\nsubstantially less culpable than a defendant whose only conduct\r\ninvolved the less serious offense. For example, if a defendant\r\nwhose actual conduct involved a minimal role in the distribution of\r\n25 grams of cocaine (an offense having a Chapter Two offense\r\nlevel of level 14 under §2D1.1 (Unlawful Manufacturing,\r\nImporting, Exporting, or Trafficking (Including Possession with\r\nIntent to Commit These Offenses); Attempt or Conspiracy)) is\r\nconvicted of simple possession of cocaine (an offense having a\r\nChapter Two offense level of level 6 under §2D2.1 (Unlawful\r\nPossession; Attempt or Conspiracy)), no reduction for a mitigating\r\nrole is warranted because the defendant is not substantially less\r\nculpable than a defendant whose only conduct involved the simple\r\npossession of cocaine.\r\n(C) Fact-Based Determination.—The determination whether to apply\r\nsubsection (a) or subsection (b), or an intermediate adjustment,\r\ninvolves a determination that is heavily dependent upon the facts\r\nof the particular case. As with any other factual issue, the court, in\r\nweighing the totality of the circumstances, is not required to find,\r\nbased solely on the defendant’s bare assertion, that such a role\r\nadjustment is warranted.\r\n4. Minimal Participant.—Subsection (a) applies to a defendant described in\r\nApplication Note 3(A) who plays a minimal role in concerted activity. It\r\nis intended to cover defendants who are plainly among the least culpable of\r\nthose involved in the conduct of a group. Under this provision, the\r\ndefendant’s lack of knowledge or understanding of the scope and structure\r\nof the enterprise and of the activities of others is indicative of a role as\r\nminimal participant. It is intended that the downward adjustment for a\r\nminimal participant will be used infrequently.\r\n5. Minor Participant.— Subsection (b) applies to a defendant described in\r\nApplication Note 3(A) who is less culpable than most other participants, but\r\nwhose role could not be described as minimal.\".","Reason":"Reason for Amendment: This amendment resolves a circuit conflict regarding whether a\r\nNovember 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II Amendment 637\r\n\r\ndefendant who is accountable under §1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct) only for conduct in which\r\nthe defendant personally was involved, and who performs a limited function in concerted\r\ncriminal activity, is precluded from consideration for an adjustment under §3B1.2\r\n(Mitigating Role).

Although this circuit conflict arose in the context of a drug\r\noffense, the amendment resolves it in a manner that makes the rule applicable to all types of\r\noffenses.\r\nThe amendment adopts the approach articulated by the Eleventh Circuit in United States v.\r\nRodriguez De Varon, supra, that §3B1.2 does not automatically preclude a defendant from\r\nbeing considered for a mitigating role adjustment in a case in which the defendant is held\r\naccountable under §1B1.3 solely for the amount of drugs the defendant personally handled.\r\nIn considering a §3B1.2 adjustment, a court must measure the defendant’s role against the\r\nrelevant conduct for which the defendant is held accountable at sentencing, whether or not\r\nother defendants are charged.\r\nIn contrast to the holding in United States v. Burnett, supra, this amendment allows the court\r\nto apply traditional analysis on the applicability of a reduction pursuant to §3B1.2, even in\r\na case in which a defendant is held liable under §1B1.3 only for conduct (such as drug\r\nquantities) in which the defendant was involved personally.\r\nThe substantive impact of this amendment in resolving the circuit conflict is to provide, in\r\nthe context of a drug courier, for example, that the court is not precluded from considering\r\na §3B1.2 adjustment simply because the defendant’s role in the offense was limited to\r\ntransporting or storing drugs, and the defendant was accountable under §1B1.3 only for the\r\nquantity of drugs the defendant personally transported or stored. The amendment does not\r\nrequire that such a defendant receive a reduction under §3B1.2, or suggest that such a\r\ndefendant can receive a reduction based only on those facts; rather, the amendment provides\r\nonly that such a defendant is not precluded from consideration for such a reduction if the\r\ndefendant otherwise qualifies for the reduction pursuant to the terms of §3B1.2.\r\nIn addition to resolving the circuit conflict, the amendment makes the following non-\r\nsubstantive revisions to §3B1.2 to clarify guideline application: (1) incorporating\r\ncommentary from the Introduction to Chapter Three, Part B (Role in the Offense) that there\r\nmust be more than one participant before application of a mitigating role adjustment may be\r\nconsidered; (2) incorporating into this guideline the definition of \"participant\" from §3B1.1\r\n(Aggravating Role); (3) moving into an application note significant background commentary\r\nthat has been cited frequently in appellate decisions; (4) adding a section on fact-based\r\ndeterminations to Application Note 3 that emphasizes the significant judicial role in\r\ndecision-making on the applicability of §3B1.2; (5) maintaining commentary language that\r\nthe minimal role adjustment is intended to be used infrequently; and (6) making technical\r\namendments to the Commentary to clarify applicable rules (such as the addition of headings\r\nfor, and the reordering of, application notes in the commentary) that are intended to have no\r\nsubstantive impact.\r\nThe language regarding \"average participant\" is moved from the Background into\r\nAmendment 637 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003\r\n\r\nApplication Note 3(A) to provide guidance as to the applicability of §3B1.2. For a reduction\r\nto apply, the court, at a minimum, must make a factual determination that the defendant’s\r\nrole was significantly less culpable than the average participant.","EffectiveDate":"Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2001."},{"Id":637,"Title":"Amendment 637","Text":"The Commentary to §2J1.6 captioned \"Application Notes\" is amended in\r\nNote 3 in the first sentence of the second paragraph by striking \"In\" and inserting \"However,\r\nin\"; and by inserting \"other than a case of failure to appear for service of sentence,\" after\r\n\"offense and the failure to appear,\".\r\nThe Commentary to §2M3.9 captioned \"Application Notes\" is amended by inserting after\r\nNote 2 the following:\r\n\"3.

L. 107–56 (the \"Act\").\r\nAmong its many provisions are appropriately severe penalties for offenses against mass\r\ntransportation systems and interstate gas or hazardous liquid pipelines. The amendment also\r\nincreases sentences for threats that substantially disrupt governmental or business operations\r\nor result in costly cleanup measures. It expands the guideline coverage of offenses involving\r\nbioterrorism, and it creates a new guideline for providing material support to foreign terrorist\r\norganizations. It punishes attempts and conspiracies to commit terrorism as if the offense\r\nhad been carried out and adds an invited upward departure to the guidelines’ terrorism\r\nenhancement for appropriate cases. Finally, it authorizes a term of supervised release up to\r\nlife for a defendant convicted of a federal crime of terrorism that resulted in substantial risk\r\nof death or serious bodily injury to another person.\r\nFirst, this amendment makes a number of changes to Appendix A (Statutory Index) and\r\nseveral guidelines in Chapter Two (Offense Conduct) in order to incorporate several new\r\npredicate offenses to federal crimes of terrorism. This amendment addresses section 801 of\r\nthe Act, which added 18 U.S.C. § 1993, generally pertaining to offenses against mass\r\ntransportation systems and facilities. The amendment also addresses 49 U.S.C. § 46507\r\npertaining to false information and threats, that heretofore was not listed in the Statutory\r\nIndex, as well as the new offense at 49 U.S.C. § 46503, pertaining to interference with\r\nsecurity screening personnel.\r\nSpecifically, the amendment makes a number of changes to §2A5.2 (Interference with Flight\r\nCrew Member or Flight Attendant) and the guidelines in Chapter Two, Part A, Subpart 2\r\n(Assault). First, this amendment references violations of 18 U.S.C. § 1993(a)(4), (a)(5),\r\n(a)(6), and (b) and 49 U.S.C. § 46503 to §2A5.2 because that guideline presently covers\r\nother similar offenses and because the guideline’s alternative base offense levels cover\r\noffenses that involve reckless or intentional endangerment, conduct which is an element of\r\nsome of these new offenses.\r\nIn order to take into account aggravating conduct which may occur in such offenses, the\r\namendment adds a specific offense characteristic for use of a weapon, borrowing language\r\nfrom §2A2.2 (Aggravated Assault). The specific offense characteristic provides a graduated\r\nenhancement with a minimum offense level of level 24 at §2A5.2(b)(1) for the involvement\r\nof a dangerous weapon in the offense. This enhancement addresses concerns that the current\r\nbase offense level of level 18 (in §2A5.2(a)(2)) for reckless endangerment may be\r\ninadequate in situations involving a dangerous weapon and reckless disregard for the safety\r\nof human life. The minimum offense level of level 24 mirrors the offense level that applies\r\nfor conduct amounting to reckless endangerment under subsection (b)(1) of §2K1.5\r\nAmendment 637 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003\r\n\r\n(Possessing Dangerous Weapons or Materials While Boarding or Aboard an Aircraft). A\r\ncross reference to the appropriate homicide guideline also is provided for offenses in which\r\ndeath results; death as an aggravating circumstance is included in 18 U.S.C. § 1993(b).\r\nThe amendment also amends §2A6.1 (Threatening or Harassing Communications) to\r\nincorporate offenses against mass transportation systems under 18 U.S.C. § 1993(a)(7) and\r\n(a)(8) and 49 U.S.C. § 46507 and provides corresponding references in the Statutory Index.\r\nThese three provisions require the same type of threatening conduct or conveyance of false\r\ninformation as two other offenses referenced to §2A6.1, specifically 18 U.S.C. §§ 32(c) and\r\n35(b), which cover aircraft, railroads, and shipping, rather than mass transportation systems.\r\nAdditionally, a specific offense characteristic is added if the offense resulted in a substantial\r\ndisruption of public, governmental, or business functions or services, or a substantial\r\nexpenditure of funds to clean up, decontaminate, or otherwise respond to the offense. This\r\nenhancement recognizes that a terrorist threat usually will be directed at a large number of\r\nindividuals, governmental buildings or operations, or infrastructure. Unless such a terrorist\r\nthreat is immediately dismissed as not credible, the conduct may result in significant\r\ndisruption and response costs. This specific offense characteristic is the same as that\r\ncontained in subsection (b)(3) of §2M6.1 (Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical Weapons, and\r\nOther Weapons of Mass Destruction). An invited upward departure provision is added for\r\nsituations in which the offense involved multiple victims, a circumstance which might occur\r\nin the context of these new offenses.\r\nThis amendment also amends §2K1.4 (Arson; Property Damage by Use of Explosives) and\r\n§2B1.1 (Theft, Property Destruction, and Fraud) to cover violations of 18 U.S.C.\r\n§ 1993(a)(1) and (b). Offenses under 18 U.S.C. § 1993(a)(1) are similar to another offense\r\nreferenced to these guidelines, 18 U.S.C. § 32(a)(1), with respect to the intent standard\r\nrequired to commit the offense, offense conduct, and resulting harm. The amendment\r\nreferences violations of 18 U.S.C. § 1993(a)(2), (a)(3), and (b) to §§2K1.4 and 2M6.1.\r\nThese offenses encompass a wide range of conduct. For example, a violation of 18 U.S.C.\r\n§ 1993(a)(3) may occur if the defendant sets fire to a garage or places a biological agent or\r\ntoxin for use as a destructive substance near an aircraft and this likely endangered the safety\r\nof that aircraft.\r\nThe amendment expands §2M6.1 to cover 18 U.S.C. §§ 175(b) and 175b, two new offenses\r\ncreated by section 817 of the Act, involving possession of biological agents, toxins, and\r\ndelivery systems. Section 2M6.1 is the most appropriate guideline for these offenses\r\nbecause they involve the knowing possession of certain biological substances. A base\r\noffense level of level 20 is provided for 18 U.S.C. § 175(b) offenses, the same base offense\r\nlevel as is currently provided for threat cases under that guideline. The current two level\r\nincrease for particularly dangerous biological agents would be available for the most serious\r\nsubstances.\r\nA base offense level of level 22 is provided for offenses under 18 U.S.C. § 175b, which\r\nforbids certain restricted persons (defined in the statute) to ship or transport in interstate or\r\nforeign commerce, or possess in or affecting commerce, any biological agent or toxin, or to\r\nreceive any biological agent or toxin that has been shipped or transported in interstate or\r\nforeign commerce, if the biological agent or toxin is listed as a select agent (e.g., ebola,\r\nanthrax). Because this offense already takes into account the serious nature of a select agent,\r\nthe amendment treats these offenses separately from offenses under 18 U.S.C. § 175(b), with\r\na higher base offense level and an instruction that the enhancement for select biological\r\nNovember 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II Amendment 637\r\n\r\nagents does not apply.\r\nThe amendment also amends the Statutory Index to reference 18 U.S.C. § 2339 to §§2X2.1\r\n(Aiding and Abetting) and 2X3.1 (Accessory After the Fact). This offense prohibits\r\nharboring or concealing any person who the defendant knows, or has reasonable grounds to\r\nbelieve, has committed or is about to commit, one of several enumerated offenses.\r\nSecond, this amendment provides Statutory Index references, as well as modifications to\r\nvarious Chapter Two guidelines, for a number of offenses that, prior to enactment of the Act,\r\nwere enumerated in 18 U.S.C. § 2332b(g)(5) as predicate offenses for federal crimes of\r\nterrorism but were not explicitly incorporated in the guidelines.\r\nSpecifically, the amendment references 18 U.S.C. § 2332b(a)(1) offenses to §§2A1.1 (First\r\nDegree Murder), 2A1.2 (Second Degree Murder), 2A1.3 (Voluntary Manslaughter), 2A1.4\r\n(Involuntary Manslaughter), 2A2.1 (Assault with Intent to Commit Murder; Attempted\r\nMurder), 2A2.2 (Aggravated Assault), and 2A4.1 (Kidnapping, Abduction, Unlawful\r\nRestraint), inasmuch as 18 U.S.C. § 2332b offenses are analogous to offenses currently\r\nreferenced to those guidelines.\r\nThe amendment also provides a Statutory Index reference to §2A6.1 (Threatening or\r\nHarassing Communications) for cases under 18 U.S.C. § 2332b(a)(2), which prohibits\r\nthreats, attempts and conspiracies to commit an offense under 18 U.S.C. § 2332b(a)(1).\r\nThis amendment also creates a new guideline, at §2M5.3 (Providing Material Support or\r\nResources to Designated Foreign Terrorist Organizations), for offenses under 18 U.S.C.\r\n§ 2339B, which prohibits the provision of material support or resources to a foreign terrorist\r\norganization. The amendment references offenses under 18 U.S.C. § 2339A to §§2X2.1 and\r\n2X3.1. Section 2339A offenses concern providing material support to terrorists that the\r\ndefendant knows or intends will be used in preparation for, or in carrying out, certain\r\nspecified predicate offenses. Thus, the essence of 18 U.S.C. § 2339A offenses is akin to\r\naiding and abetting or accessory after the fact offenses, which warrants reference to §§2X2.1\r\nand 2X3.1. In contrast, 18 U.S.C. § 2339B offenses are referenced to a new guideline,\r\n§2M5.3, primarily because they are not statutorily linked to the commission of any specified\r\npredicate offenses. To account for the variety of ways in which such offenses may be\r\ncommitted, the new guideline provides two specific offense characteristics that enhance the\r\nsentence for cases in which the material support involved dangerous weapons and in which\r\nthe material support involved nuclear, biological, or chemical weapons.\r\nThe amendment references torture offenses under 18 U.S.C. § 2340A to §§2A1.1, 2A1.2,\r\n2A2.1, 2A2.2, and 2A4.1. The amendment also references 49 U.S.C. § 60123(b), pertaining\r\nto damaging or destroying an interstate gas or hazardous liquid pipeline facility, to §§2B1.1,\r\n2K1.4, 2M2.1 (Destruction of, or Production of Defective, War Material, Premises, or\r\nUtilities), and 2M2.3 (Destruction of, or Production of Defective, National Defense Material,\r\nPremises, or Utilities).\r\nThird, the amendment responds to section 811 of the Act, which amended a number of\r\noffenses to ensure that attempts and conspiracies to commit any of those offenses subject the\r\noffender to the same penalties prescribed for the object offense. This amendment provides\r\na special instruction in §2X1.1 (Attempt, Solicitation, or Conspiracy) that the three level\r\nreduction in §2X1.1(b) does not apply to these offenses when committed for a terrorist\r\nAmendment 637 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003\r\n\r\nobjective.\r\nFourth, the amendment adds an encouraged, structured upward departure in §3A1.4\r\n(Terrorism) for offenses that involve terrorism but do not otherwise qualify as offenses that\r\ninvolved or were intended to promote \"federal crimes of terrorism\" for purposes of the\r\nterrorism adjustment in §3A1.4. The amendment provides an upward departure, rather than\r\na specified guideline adjustment, because of the expected infrequency of these terrorism\r\noffenses and to provide the court with a viable tool to account for the harm involved during\r\nthe commission of these offenses on a case-by-case basis. In addition, the structured upward\r\ndeparture provision makes it possible to impose punishment equal in severity to that which\r\nwould be imposed if the §3A1.4 adjustment actually applied.\r\nThe amendment adds an application note to §3A1.4 regarding harboring and concealing\r\noffenses to clarify that §3A1.4 may apply in the case of offenses that occurred after the\r\ncommission of the federal crime of terrorism (e.g., a case in which the defendant, in violation\r\nof 18 U.S.C. § 2339A, concealed an individual who had committed a federal crime of\r\nterrorism).\r\nFifth, the amendment amends §2S1.3 (Structuring Transactions to Evade Reporting\r\nRequirements; Failure to Report Cash or Monetary Transactions; Failure to File Currency\r\nand Monetary Instrument Report; Knowingly Filing False Reports) to incorporate new\r\nmoney laundering provisions created by the Act.\r\nSpecifically, the amendment provides an alternative base offense level of level 8 in §2S1.3(a)\r\nin order to incorporate offenses under 31 U.S.C. §§ 5318 and 5318A. The base offense level\r\nof level 8 recognizes the heightened due diligence requirements placed on financial\r\ninstitutions with respect to payable-through accounts, correspondent accounts, and shell\r\nbanks.\r\nThe amendment also amends §2S1.3(b)(1), relating to the promotion of unlawful activity,\r\nto provide an alternative prong if the offense involved bulk cash smuggling. This\r\namendment addresses 31 U.S.C. § 5332, added by section 371 of the Act, which prohibits\r\nconcealing, with intent to evade a currency reporting requirement under 31 U.S.C. § 5316,\r\nmore than $10,000 in currency or other monetary instruments and transporting or\r\ntransferring such currency or monetary instruments into or outside of the United States.\r\nFindings set forth in that section of the Act indicate that bulk cash smuggling typically\r\ninvolves the promotion of unlawful activity.\r\nThe amendment also provides an enhancement in §2S1.3(b) to give effect to the enhanced\r\npenalty provisions under 31 U.S.C. § 5322(b) for offenses under subchapter II of chapter 53\r\nof title 31, United Stated Code, if such offenses were committed as part of a pattern of\r\nunlawful activity involving more than $100,000 in a 12-month period.\r\nSixth, the amendment addresses a number of miscellaneous issues related to terrorism.\r\nSpecifically, it provides a definition of terrorism for purposes of the prior conviction\r\nenhancement in §2L1.2 (Unlawfully Entering or Remaining in the United States). For\r\nconsistency, the definition is the same as that found in the current Chapter Three terrorism\r\nadjustment.\r\nIt also amends §3C1.1 (Obstructing or Impeding the Administration of Justice), in response\r\n\r\nto section 319(d) of the Act, which amends the Controlled Substances Act at 21 U.S.C. §\r\n853(e) to require a defendant to repatriate any property that may be seized and forfeited and\r\nto deposit that property in the registry of the court or with the United States Marshals Service\r\nor the Secretary of the Treasury. Section 319(d) of the Act also states that the failure to\r\ncomply with a protective order and an order to repatriate property \"may also result in an\r\nenhancement of the sentence of the defendant under the obstruction of justice provision of\r\nthe Federal Sentencing Guidelines.\" Accordingly, the amendment adds Application Note\r\n4(j) to §3C1.1 to provide that failure to comply with an order issued pursuant to 21 U.S.C.\r\n§ 835(e) is an example of the types of conduct to which the adjustment applies.\r\nIt also amends §5D1.2 (Term of Supervised Release), in response to section 812 of the Act,\r\nwhich authorizes a term of supervised release of any term of years or life for a defendant\r\nconvicted of a federal crime of terrorism the commission of which resulted in, or created a\r\nforeseeable risk of, death or serious bodily injury to another person.\r\nIt also amends §2B1.1 to delete the special instruction pertaining to the imposition of not less\r\nthan six months’ imprisonment for a defendant convicted under 18 U.S.C. § 1030(a)(4) or\r\n(5). This amendment is in response to section 814(f) of the Act, which directed the\r\nCommission to amend the guidelines \"to ensure that any individual convicted of a violation\r\nof section 1030 of title 18, United States Code, can be subjected to appropriate penalties,\r\nwithout regard to any mandatory minimum term of imprisonment.\"\r\nIt also adds a reference in the Statutory Index to §2C1.1 (Offering, Giving, Soliciting, or\r\nReceiving a Bribe; Extortion Under Color of Official Right), for the new offense created by\r\nsection 329 of the Act, which prohibits a federal official or employee, in connection with\r\nadministration of the money laundering provisions of the Act, to corruptly demand, seek,\r\nreceive, accept, or agree to receive or accept anything of value in return for being influenced\r\nin the performance of an official act, being influenced to commit or aid in committing any\r\nfraud on the United States, or being induced to do or omit to do any act in violation of\r\nofficial duties.\r\nIt also amends §2M5.1 (Evasion of Export Controls) to incorporate 18 U.S.C. § 2332d,\r\nwhich prohibits a United States person, knowing or having reasonable cause to know that\r\na country is designated under the Export Administration Act as a country supporting\r\ninternational terrorism, to engage in a financial transaction with the government of that\r\ncountry. The amendment provides a base offense level of level 26 for these offenses.\r\nFinally, it amends §2B2.3 (Trespass) to incorporate the offense under 18 U.S.C. § 1036.\r\nThat offense, added by section 2 of the Enhanced Federal Security Act of 2000, Pub. L.\r\n106–547, prohibits, by fraud or pretense, the entering or attempting to enter any real\r\nproperty, vessel, or aircraft of the United States, or secure area of an airport. The\r\namendment amends the existing two level enhancement in §2B2.3(b)(1) to provide an\r\nadditional ground for application of the enhancement if the trespass involved a vessel,\r\naircraft of the United States, or secure area of an airport. It also adds a cross reference to\r\n§2X1.1 if the offense involved the intent to commit another felony.","EffectiveDate":"Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2002."},{"Id":639,"Title":"Amendment 639","Text":"Section 2B1.1(c) is amended by adding at the end the following:\r\nAmendment 638 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003\r\n\r\n\"(4) If the offense involved a cultural heritage resource, apply §2B1.5 (Theft of,\r\nDamage to, or Destruction of, Cultural Heritage Resources; Unlawful Sale,\r\nPurchase, Exchange, Transportation, or Receipt of Cultural Heritage\r\nResources), if the resulting offense level is greater than that determined\r\nabove.\".\r\nThe Commentary to §2B1.1 captioned \"Application Notes\" is amended in Note 1 by\r\ninserting after \"For purposes of this guideline:\" the following paragraph:\r\n\"‘Cultural heritage resource’ has the meaning given that term in Application Note\r\n1 of the Commentary to §2B1.5 (Theft of, Damage to, or Destruction of, Cultural\r\nHeritage Resources; Unlawful Sale, Purchase, Exchange, Transportation, or Receipt\r\nof Cultural Heritage Resources).\".\r\nThe Commentary to §2B1.1 captioned \"Application Notes\" is amended in subdivision (F)\r\nof Note 2 by adding at the end the following:\r\n\"(vii) Value of Cultural Heritage Resources.—In a case involving a cultural\r\nheritage resource, loss attributable to that cultural heritage resource shall be\r\ndetermined in accordance with the rules for determining the ‘value of the\r\ncultural heritage resource’ set forth in Application Note 2 of the\r\nCommentary to §2B1.5.\".\r\nChapter Two, Part B, Subpart 1 is amended by adding at the end the following new\r\nguideline and accompanying commentary:\r\n\"§2B1.5.

Upward Departure Provision.—There may be cases in which the offense\r\nlevel determined under this guideline substantially understates the\r\nseriousness of the offense. In such cases, an upward departure may be\r\nwarranted. For example, an upward departure may be warranted if (A) in\r\naddition to cultural heritage resources, the offense involved theft of, damage\r\nto, or destruction of, items that are not cultural heritage resources (such as\r\nan offense involving the theft from a national cemetery of lawnmowers and\r\nother administrative property in addition to historic gravemarkers or other\r\ncultural heritage resources); or (B) the offense involved a cultural heritage\r\nresource that has profound significance to cultural identity (e.g., the Statue\r\nof Liberty or the Liberty Bell).\".\r\nSection 2Q2.1 is amended by adding after subsection (b) the following:\r\n\"(c) Cross Reference\r\n(1) If the offense involved a cultural heritage resource, apply §2B1.5\r\n(Theft of, Damage to, or Destruction of, Cultural Heritage\r\nResources; Unlawful Sale, Purchase, Exchange, Transportation, or\r\nReceipt of Cultural Heritage Resources), if the resulting offense\r\nlevel is greater than that determined above.\".\r\nThe Commentary to §2Q2.1 captioned \"Application Notes\" is amended by adding at the end\r\nthe following:\r\nAmendment 638 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003\r\n\r\n\"6.

This amendment reflects the Commission’s conclusion that the\r\nexisting sentencing guidelines for economic and property destruction crimes are inadequate\r\nto punish in an appropriate and proportional way the variety of federal crimes involving the\r\ntheft of, damage to, destruction of, or illicit trafficking in, cultural heritage resources. The\r\nCommission has determined that a separate guideline, which specifically recognizes both the\r\nfederal government’s long-standing obligation and role in preserving such resources, and the\r\nharm caused to both the nation and its inhabitants when its history is degraded through the\r\ndestruction of cultural heritage resources, is needed.\r\nCultural heritage resources include national memorials, landmarks, parks, archaeological and\r\nother historic and cultural resources, specifically designated by Congress and the President\r\nfor the preservation of the cultural heritage of this nation and its ancestors. The federal\r\ngovernment acts either as a trustee for the public generally, or as a fiduciary on behalf of\r\nAmerican Indians, Alaska Natives and Native Hawaiian Organizations, to protect these\r\ncultural heritage resources. Because individuals, communities, and nations identify\r\nthemselves through intellectual, emotional, and spiritual connections to places and objects,\r\nthe effects of cultural heritage resource crimes transcend mere monetary considerations.\r\nAccordingly, this new guideline takes into account the transcendent and irreplaceable value\r\nof cultural heritage resources and punishes in a proportionate way the aggravating conduct\r\nassociated with cultural heritage resource crimes.\r\nThis guideline incorporates into the definition of \"cultural heritage resource\" a broad range\r\nof existing federal statutory definitions for various historical, cultural, and archaeological\r\nitems. If a defendant is convicted of an offense that charges illegal conduct involving a\r\ncultural heritage resource, this guideline will apply, irrespective of whether the conviction\r\nis obtained under general property theft or damage statutes, such as laws concerning the theft\r\nand destruction of government property, 18 U.S.C. § 641, interstate sale or receipt of stolen\r\nproperty, 18 U.S.C. §§ 2314-15, and smuggling, 18 U.S.C. §§ 541 et seq., or under specific\r\ncultural heritage statutes, such as the Archaeological Resources Protection Act of 1979, 16\r\nU.S.C. § 470ee (ARPA), the criminal provisions of the Native American Graves Protection\r\nand Repatriation Act (NAGPRA) at 18 U.S.C. § 1170, and 18 U.S.C. § 668, which concerns\r\ntheft from museums. In addition, if a more general offense is charged that is referenced in\r\nAppendix A to §2B1.1 (Theft, Property Destruction, and Fraud), this guideline will apply\r\nby cross reference if the offense conduct involves a cultural heritage resource and results in\r\na higher offense level.\r\nAmendment 638 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003\r\n\r\nThis new guideline has a base offense level of level 8, which is two levels higher than the\r\nbase offense level for general economic and property destruction crimes. The higher base\r\noffense level represents the Commission’s determination that offenses involving cultural\r\nheritage resources are more serious because they involve essentially irreplaceable resources\r\nand cause intangible harm to society.\r\nThe new guideline also provides that the monetary value of the cultural heritage resource is\r\nan important, although not the sole, factor in determining the appropriate punishment. The\r\nCommission has elected not to use the concept of \"loss,\" which is an integral part of the\r\ntheft, fraud, and property destruction guideline at §2B1.1, because cultural heritage offenses\r\ndo not involve the same fungible and compensatory values embodied in \"loss.\" Instead,\r\nunder this new guideline, value is to be based on commercial value, archaeological value,\r\nand the cost of restoration and repair. These methods of valuation are derived from existing\r\nfederal law. See 16 U.S.C. § 470ee(d); 43 C.F.R. § 7.14.\r\nThe Commission has recognized that archaeological value shall be used in calculating the\r\nvalue of archaeological resources but has provided flexibility for the sentencing court to\r\ndetermine whether either commercial value or the cost of restoration and repair, or both,\r\nshould be added to archaeological value in determining the appropriate value of\r\narchaeological resources. For all other types of cultural heritage resources covered by this\r\nguideline, the Commission has provided flexibility for the sentencing court regarding\r\nwhether and when to use all or some of the methods of valuation, as appropriate, for\r\ncalculating the total value associated with the harm to the particular resource caused by the\r\ndefendant’s offense conduct. The value of the cultural heritage resource is then referenced\r\nto the monetary table provided at §2B1.1(b)(1) in order to determine appropriate and\r\nproportionate offense levels in a manner consistent with the overall guidelines structure.\r\nThe new guideline provides five additional specific offense characteristics to provide\r\nproportionate enhancements for aggravating conduct that may occur in connection with\r\ncultural heritage resource offenses. In providing enhancements for these non-pecuniary\r\naggravating factors, the Commission seeks to ensure that the nonquantifiable harm caused\r\nby the offense to affected cultural groups, and society as a whole, is adequately reflected in\r\nthe penalty structure.\r\nThe first two of these enhancements, at subsections (b)(2) and (b)(3), relate to whether the\r\noffense involves a place or resource that Congress has designated for special protection. A\r\ntwo level enhancement attaches if the offense involves a resource from one of eight locations\r\nspecifically designated by Congress for historic commemoration, resource preservation, or\r\npublic education. These are the national park system, national historic landmarks, national\r\nmonuments, national memorials, national marine sanctuaries, national cemeteries, sites\r\ncontained on the World Heritage List, and museums.\r\nConsistent with the definition in 18 U.S.C. § 668(a)(1), museums are defined broadly to\r\ninclude all organized and permanent institutions, with an essentially educational or aesthetic\r\npurpose, which exhibit tangible objects to the public on a regular schedule. Adoption of this\r\ndefinition reflects the Commission’s recognition that cultural heritage resource crimes\r\naffecting institutions dedicated to the preservation of resources and associated knowledge,\r\nirrespective of the institution’s size, ownership, or funding, deprive the public and future\r\ngenerations of the opportunity to learn and appreciate the richness of the nation’s heritage.\r\nSimilarly, this enhancement reflects the Commission’s assessment that damage to the other\r\nNovember 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II Amendment 638\r\n\r\nlisted places degrades not only the resource itself but also the historical and cultural aspects\r\nwhich the resource commemorates.\r\nAn additional two level enhancement attaches to offense conduct that involves any of a\r\nnumber of specified resources, including human remains and other resources that have been\r\ndesignated by Congress for special treatment and heightened protection under federal law.\r\nFunerary objects, items of cultural patrimony, and sacred objects are included because they\r\nare domestic cultural heritage resources protected under NAGPRA. See 25 U.S.C. § 3001.\r\nCultural property, designated archaeological and ethnological material, and pre-Columbian\r\nmonumental and architectural sculpture and murals are included in the enhancement because\r\nthese are cultural heritage resources of foreign provenance for which Congress has chosen,\r\nin the implementation of international treaties and bilateral agreements, to impose import\r\nrestrictions. See 19 U.S.C. §§ 2092, 2606, and 2607.\r\nThis guideline also provides a two level enhancement at subsection (b)(4) if the offense was\r\ncommitted for pecuniary gain or otherwise involved a commercial purpose. This increase\r\nis based on a determination that offenders who are motivated by financial gain or other\r\ncommercial incentive are more culpable than offenders who are motivated solely by their\r\npersonal interest in possessing cultural heritage resources. Those motivated by financial gain\r\ncontribute to illicit trafficking and support dealers and brokers who earn a livelihood from\r\nillegal activities. Mindful of INTERPOL’s findings, as reported by the Department of\r\nJustice, that the annual dollar value of art and cultural property theft is exceeded only by\r\ntrafficking in illicit narcotics, money laundering, and arms trafficking, the Commission seeks\r\nto ensure that the penalty structure adequately accounts for these increased harms.\r\nThis guideline also provides a two level enhancement at subsection (b)(5) if the offense\r\ninvolves a pattern of misconduct, and provides a definition of \"pattern of misconduct\" that\r\nis designed to interact with other requirements of the guidelines regarding relevant conduct\r\nand criminal history. \"Pattern of misconduct\" is defined as \"two or more separate instances\r\nof offense conduct involving cultural heritage resources that did not occur during the course\r\nof the instant offense (i.e., that did not occur during the offense of conviction and all relevant\r\nconduct under §1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct))\". Accordingly, under this guideline, separate\r\ninstances of offense conduct need not result in a criminal conviction or legal adjudication in\r\norder for this enhancement to apply. Separate instances of offense conduct involving\r\ncultural heritage resources that are included in the defendant’s criminal history may also\r\nform the factual basis for the application of this enhancement. The Commission considers\r\nsuch increased punishment to be appropriate for offenders who repeatedly disregard cultural\r\nheritage resource laws and regulations and the social values underlying them. These repeat\r\noffenders cause serious harm, not only to the resources themselves, but to the nation and the\r\nindividuals who treasure them.\r\nThis guideline also provides at subsection (b)(6) a two level enhancement and a minimum\r\noffense level of level 14 if a dangerous weapon, including a firearm, is brandished or its use\r\nthreatened. This enhancement reflects the increased culpability of offenders who pose a\r\nthreat to law enforcement officers and innocent passersby. Recognizing that there are\r\nlegitimate uses in remote expanses of tribal and federal land for certain tools and firearms\r\nthat may otherwise qualify as \"dangerous weapons\" under the guideline definitions, the\r\nCommission has limited the scope of this enhancement by requiring that the dangerous\r\nweapon or firearm be brandished or its use threatened, in order for increased punishment to\r\nattach under this provision.\r\nAmendment 638 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003\r\n\r\nIn light of the increased potential for the symbols of our nation’s heritage and culture to be\r\ntargets of violent individuals, including terrorists, the Commission also has provided for\r\nincreased punishment through a cross reference to §2K1.4 (Arson; Property Damage by Use\r\nof Explosives), if the offense involved arson or property damage by the use of any explosive,\r\nexplosive material, or destructive devices, when the resulting offense level is greater under\r\n§2K1.4 than the offense level under this guideline.\r\nThis guideline also includes a special rule in the Commentary to address multiple counts of\r\ncultural heritage resource offenses, as well as multiple counts of conviction involving\r\noffenses under this and other guidelines. Consistent with the principles underlying the rules\r\nfor grouping multiple counts of conviction in §3D1.2 (Groups of Closely Related Counts)\r\nand the unique concerns sought to be addressed by this amendment, the new guideline\r\nprovides that multiple counts of cultural heritage resource offenses are to be grouped under\r\n§3D1.2(d). However, because the monetary harm is measured differently, a count of\r\nconviction for an offense sentenced under §2B1.5 may not be grouped under this provision\r\nwith a conviction for an offense sentenced under a different guideline.\r\nThis guideline also invites an upward departure if the determined offense level substantially\r\nunderstates the seriousness of the cultural heritage resource offense. Two illustrations of\r\nsuch situations are given. Finally, this amendment provides a cross reference within §2B1.1.\r\nTheft, fraud, and property destruction offenses which also involve cultural heritage resources\r\nare cross referenced to the new guideline at §2B1.5 if the resulting offense level under it\r\nwould be greater than under §2B1.1. When a case involving a cultural heritage resource is\r\nsentenced under §2B1.1, loss attributable to that cultural heritage resource is to be\r\ndetermined using the definition of \"value of the cultural heritage resource\" from §2B1.5.\r\nThe Commission recognizes that the full implementation of this new guideline for the most\r\nserious offenders often will be limited in its application because of the extremely low\r\nstatutory maxima of some of the potentially applicable statutes, such as the criminal\r\nprovisions of ARPA, NAGPRA, and 18 U.S.C. § 1163 (covering the theft of tribal property).\r\nCurrently ARPA has either a one year or two year statutory maximum term of imprisonment\r\nfor the first offense, depending on whether the value exceeds $500, and NAGPRA has a\r\nstatutory maximum term of imprisonment of one year for the first offense irrespective of\r\nvalue. These statutes all have five year statutory maximum terms of imprisonment for\r\nsecond and subsequent offenses. Consequently, the statutory ceiling may limit the full range\r\nof proportionate guideline sentencing, but the Commission has promulgated this new\r\nguideline to cover the wide variety of potential offense conduct that can occur in connection\r\nwith cultural heritage resources. The Commission has recommended to Congress that the\r\nstatutory maximum terms of imprisonment for these offenses be raised appropriately.","EffectiveDate":"Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2002."},{"Id":640,"Title":"Amendment 640","Text":"The Commentary to §2B4.1 captioned \"Statutory Provisions\" is amended by\r\nstriking \"15 U.S.C. §§ 78dd-1, 78dd-2;\".\r\nThe Commentary to §2B4.1 captioned \"Application Notes\" is amended in Note 1 by\r\ninserting \", foreign governments, or public international organizations\" after \"local\r\ngovernment\"; and by striking \"governmental\" and inserting \"any such\".\r\nThe Commentary to §2B4.1 captioned \"Background\" is amended in the sixth paragraph by\r\nstriking \"to violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 78dd-1 and 78dd-2,\r\nand\".\r\nNovember 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II Amendment 639\r\n\r\nThe Commentary to §2C1.1 captioned \"Statutory Provisions\" is amended by inserting \"15\r\nU.S.C. §§ 78dd-1, 78dd-2, 78dd-3;\" before \"18 U.S.C.\".\r\nThe Commentary to §2C1.1 captioned \"Background\" is amended by inserting after the ninth\r\nparagraph the following:\r\n\" Section 2C1.1 also applies to offenses under 15 U.S.C. §§ 78dd-1, 78dd-\r\n2, and 78dd-3.

Violations of the 15 U.S.C. §§ 78dd-1 through 78dd-3\r\ntypically involve payments to foreign officials for the purposes of influencing their official\r\nacts or decisions, inducing them to do or omit an act in violation of their lawful duty,\r\ninducing them to influence a foreign government, or securing any improper advantage.\r\nThese cases also involve payments to foreign political parties or officials, candidates for\r\nforeign political office, or persons who act as conduits to these individuals. Most cases\r\nprosecuted under 15 U.S.C. §§ 78dd-1 through 78dd-3 involve an intent to influence\r\ngovernmental action.\r\nConversely, commercial bribery cases sentenced under §2B4.1 often involve kickback and\r\ngratuity payments made to bank officials or others who accept payments in return for\r\ninfluence or some type of exchange from the other person.

This part of the amendment responds to concerns that §2D1.8 did not adequately\r\npunish defendants convicted under 21 U.S.C. § 856, pertaining to the establishment of\r\n\r\nmanufacturing operations. That statute originally was enacted to target defendants who\r\nmaintain, manage, or control so-called \"crack houses\" and more recently has been applied\r\nto defendants who facilitate drug use at commercial dance clubs, frequently called \"raves\".\r\nPrior to this amendment, §2D1.8(a)(2) provided a maximum base offense level of level 16\r\nfor defendants convicted under 21 U.S.C. § 856 who had no participation in the underlying\r\ncontrolled substance offense other than allowing use of their premises. The Commission\r\ndetermined that the maximum base offense level of level 16 did not adequately reflect the\r\nculpability of offenders who permit distribution of drugs in quantities that under §2D1.1\r\nresult in offense levels higher than level 16. Such offenders knowingly and intentionally\r\nfacilitate and profit, at least indirectly, from the trafficking of illegal drugs, even though they\r\nmay not participate directly in the underlying controlled substance offense.\r\nSecond, the amendment modifies §2D1.1(a)(3) to provide a maximum base offense level of\r\nlevel 30 if the defendant receives an adjustment under §3B1.2 (Mitigating Role). The\r\nmaximum base offense level somewhat limits the sentencing impact of drug quantity for\r\noffenders who perform relatively low level trafficking functions, have little authority in the\r\ndrug trafficking organization, and have a lower degree of individual culpability (e.g.,\r\n\"mules\" or \"couriers\" whose most serious trafficking function is transporting drugs and who\r\nqualify for a mitigating role adjustment).\r\nThis part of the amendment responds to concerns that base offense levels derived from the\r\nDrug Quantity Table in §2D1.1 overstate the culpability of certain drug offenders who meet\r\nthe criteria for a mitigating role adjustment under §3B1.2. The Commission determined that,\r\nordinarily, a maximum base offense level of level 30 adequately reflects the culpability of\r\na defendant who qualifies for a mitigating role adjustment. Other aggravating adjustments\r\nin the trafficking guideline (e.g., the weapon enhancement at §2D1.1(b)(1)), or other general,\r\naggravating adjustments in Chapter Three (Adjustments), may increase the offense level\r\nabove level 30. The maximum base offense level is expected to apply narrowly, affecting\r\napproximately six percent of all drug trafficking offenders.\r\nThe amendment also adds an application note in §3B1.2 that instructs the court to apply the\r\nappropriate adjustment under that guideline in a case in which the maximum base offense\r\nlevel in §2D1.1(a)(3) operates to reduce the defendant’s base offense level under §2D1.1.\r\nThird, the amendment modifies the Typical Weight Per Unit (Dose, Pill, or Capsule) Table\r\nin the commentary to §2D1.1 to reflect more accurately the type and weight of ecstasy pills\r\ntypically trafficked and consumed. Specifically, the amendment adds a reference for\r\nMDMA (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine) in the Typical Weight Per Unit Table and\r\nlists the typical weight as 250 milligrams per pill. The amendment also revises the typical\r\nweight for MDA to 250 milligrams of the mixture or substance containing the controlled\r\nsubstance. Prior to this amendment, the Table listed the typical weight of MDA as 100\r\nmilligrams of the actual controlled substance.\r\nInformation provided by the Drug Enforcement Administration indicates that ecstasy usually\r\nis trafficked and used as MDMA in pills weighing approximately 250 to 350 milligrams.\r\nThe absence of MDMA from the Typical Weight Per Unit (Dose, Pill, or Capsule) Table and\r\nthe listing for MDA of an estimate of the actual weight of the controlled substance created\r\nAmendment 640 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003\r\n\r\nthe potential for misapplying the MDA estimate in a case in which MDMA is involved,\r\nwhich could result in underpunishment in some ecstasy cases. This part of the amendment\r\nthus promotes uniform application of §2D1.1 for offenses involving ecstasy by adding a\r\nreference for MDMA and revising the estimated weight for MDA.\r\nFourth, the amendment addresses two application concerns regarding the two level reduction\r\nunder §2D1.1(b)(6) for defendants who meet the criteria set forth in §5C1.2 (Limitation on\r\nApplicability of Statutory Minimum Sentences in Certain Cases). The amendment provides\r\nan application note that clarifies that the two level reduction under §2D1.1(b)(6) does not\r\ndepend on whether the defendant is convicted under a statute that carries a mandatory\r\nminimum term of imprisonment. The application note also clarifies that §5C1.2(b), which\r\nprovides a minimum offense level of level 17 for certain offenders, is not applicable to\r\n§2D1.1(b)(6).","EffectiveDate":"Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2002."},{"Id":642,"Title":"Amendment 642","Text":"Chapter Two is amended in the heading of Part G by striking\r\n\"PROSTITUTION\" and inserting \"COMMERCIAL SEX ACTS\".\r\nChapter Two, Part G is amended in the heading of Subpart 1 by striking \"PROSTITUTION\"\r\nand inserting \"A COMMERCIAL SEX ACT\".\r\nSection 2G1.1 is amended in the heading by striking \"Prostitution\" and inserting \"A\r\nCommercial Sex Act\".\r\nSection 2G1.1(b)(1) is amended by striking \"prostitution\" and inserting \"a commercial sex\r\nact\"; by inserting \"fraud,\" after \"force,\"; and by striking \"by threats or drugs or in any\r\nmanner\".\r\nSection 2G1.1(b)(4) is amended by striking \"prostitution\" each place it appears and inserting\r\n\"a commercial sex act\".\r\nSection 2G1.1(b)(5) is amended by striking \"prostitution\" and inserting \"a commercial sex\r\nact\".\r\nSection 2G1.1(c)(3) is amended by striking \"prostitution\" and inserting \"a commercial sex\r\nact\".\r\nSection 2G1.1(d)(1) is amended by striking \"prostitution\" and inserting \"a commercial sex\r\nact\".\r\nThe Commentary to §2G1.1 captioned \"Application Notes\" is amended in Note 1 by\r\ninserting after \"For purposes of this guideline—\" the following paragraph:\r\n\"‘Commercial sex act’ has the meaning given that term in 18 U.S.C. § 1591(c)(1).\";\r\nand by striking the last two paragraphs as follows:\r\n\"‘Promoting prostitution’ means persuading, inducing, enticing, or coercing a person\r\nto engage in prostitution, or to travel to engage in, prostitution.\r\n\r\n‘Victim’ means a person transported, persuaded, induced, enticed, or coerced to\r\nengage in, or travel for the purpose of engaging in, prostitution or prohibited sexual\r\nconduct, whether or not the person consented to the prostitution or prohibited sexual\r\nconduct.

Sections 924(c) and 929(a) of title 18, United States Code,\r\nprovide mandatory minimum terms of imprisonment (e.g., not less than five\r\nyears). Subsection (a) reflects this distinction.

The term of\r\nyears to be imposed consecutively is determined by the statute of conviction, and\r\nis independent of a guideline sentence on any other count. See, e.g., Commentary\r\nto §§2K2.4 (Use of Firearm, Armor-Piercing Ammunition, or Explosive During or\r\nin Relation to Certain Crimes) and 3D1.1 (Procedure for Determining Offense Level\r\non Multiple Counts) regarding determination of the offense levels for related counts\r\nwhen a conviction under 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) is involved. Note, however, that even\r\nin the case of a consecutive term of imprisonment imposed under subsection (a), any\r\nterm of supervised release imposed is to run concurrently with any other term of\r\nsupervised release imposed. See 18 U.S.C. § 3624(e). Subsection (a) also applies\r\nin certain other instances in which an independently determined and consecutive\r\nsentence is required.

See, e.g., 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) (requiring mandatory\r\nminimum terms of imprisonment, based on the conduct involved, and also\r\nrequiring the sentence imposed to run consecutively to any other term of\r\nimprisonment).

Career Offenders Covered under Subsection (e).—\r\n(A) Imposing Sentence.—The sentence imposed for a conviction under\r\n18 U.S.C. § 924(c) or § 929(a) shall, under that statute, consist of\r\na minimum term of imprisonment imposed to run consecutively to\r\nthe sentence on any other count. Subsection (e) requires that the\r\ntotal punishment determined under §4B1.1(c) be apportioned\r\namong all the counts of conviction. In most cases this can be\r\nachieved by imposing the statutory minimum term of imprisonment\r\non the 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) or § 929(a) count, subtracting that\r\nminimum term of imprisonment from the total punishment\r\ndetermined under §4B1.1(c), and then imposing the balance of the\r\ntotal punishment on the other counts of conviction. In some cases\r\ncovered by subsection (e), a consecutive term of imprisonment\r\nlonger than the minimum required by 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) or\r\n§ 929(a) will be necessary in order both to achieve the total\r\npunishment determined by the court and to comply with the\r\napplicable statutory requirements.\r\n(B) Examples.—The following examples illustrate the application of\r\nsubsection (e) in a multiple count situation:\r\n(i) The defendant is convicted of one count of violating 18\r\nU.S.C. § 924(c) for possessing a firearm in furtherance of\r\na drug trafficking offense (5 year mandatory minimum),\r\nand one count of violating 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(C) (20\r\nyear statutory maximum). Applying §4B1.1(c), the court\r\ndetermines that a sentence of 300 months is appropriate\r\n(applicable guideline range of 262-327). The court then\r\nimposes a sentence of 60 months on the 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)\r\ncount, subtracts that 60 months from the total punishment\r\nof 300 months and imposes the remainder of 240 months\r\non the 21 U.S.C. § 841 count. As required by statute, the\r\nsentence on the 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) count is imposed to run\r\nconsecutively.\r\nNovember 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II Amendment 642\r\n\r\n(ii) The defendant is convicted of one count of 18 U.S.C.\r\n§ 924(c) (5 year mandatory minimum), and one count of\r\nviolating 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(C) (20 year statutory\r\nmaximum). Applying §4B1.1(c), the court determines that\r\na sentence of 327 months is appropriate (applicable\r\nguideline range of 262-327). The court then imposes a\r\nsentence of 240 months on the 21 U.S.C. § 841 count and\r\na sentence of 87 months on the 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) count\r\nto run consecutively to the sentence on the 21 U.S.C. § 841\r\ncount.\r\n(iii) The defendant is convicted of two counts of 18 U.S.C.\r\n§ 924(c) (5 year mandatory minimum on first count, 25\r\nyear mandatory minimum on second count) and one count\r\nof violating 18 U.S.C. § 2113(a) (20 year statutory\r\nmaximum). Applying §4B1.1(c), the court determines that\r\na sentence of 400 months is appropriate (applicable\r\nguideline range of 360-life). The court then imposes (I) a\r\nsentence of 60 months on the first 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)\r\ncount; (II) a sentence of 300 months on the second 18\r\nU.S.C. § 924(c) count; and (III) a sentence of 40 months\r\non the 18 U.S.C. § 2113(a) count. The sentence on each\r\ncount is imposed to run consecutively to the other counts.\".","Reason":"Reason for Amendment: This amendment is intended to comply with the statutory\r\ndirective in 28 U.S.C. § 994(h) by providing a guideline sentence at or near the statutory\r\nmaximum of life imprisonment for cases in which certain serious firearm offenses establish\r\nthe defendant as a career offender.\r\nThis amendment provides special rules in §§4B1.1 (Career Offender) and 5G1.2 (Sentencing\r\non Multiple Counts of Conviction) for determining and imposing a guideline sentence in a\r\ncase in which the defendant is convicted of an offense under 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) or § 929(a)\r\nand, as a result of that conviction, is determined to be a career offender under §§4B1.1 and\r\n4B1.2 (Definitions of Terms Used in Section 4B1.1). The amendment supplements\r\nAmendment 600 (effective November 1, 2000) in which the Commission first addressed\r\nimplementation of the statutory changes in penalties for 18 U.S.C. §§ 924(c) and 929(a)\r\noffenses made by the Act to Throttle the Criminal Use of Guns, Pub. L. 105–386. At that\r\ntime, the Commission deferred addressing the more complicated issues of whether\r\nconvictions under 18 U.S.C. §§ 924(c) and 929(a) can qualify as instant offenses for\r\npurposes of §4B1.1, and if they do so qualify, how the sentence would be imposed.\r\nPromulgation of this amendment reflects the Commission’s decision that the amendment,\r\nwhile somewhat complex, is necessary to comply appropriately with 28 U.S.C. § 994(h).\r\nOperationally, this amendment achieves two goals. First, it permits 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) or\r\n§ 929(a) offenses, whether as the instant or prior offense of conviction, to qualify for career\r\noffender purposes. Second, it ensures that, in a case in which such an instant offense\r\nestablishes the defendant as a career offender, the resulting guideline sentence is determined\r\nunder §4B1.1 using a count of conviction that has a statutory maximum of life imprisonment.\r\nThe special rule necessarily is somewhat more complex because of the need to address\r\ncertain anomalies that infrequently would occur in the absence of such a rule, i.e., that a very\r\nAmendment 642 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003\r\n\r\nserious offender could receive a lower sentence by virtue of the application of §4B1.1 than\r\nthat which would otherwise be received by imposing the statutorily required minimum\r\nsentence consecutively to the otherwise applicable guideline range.\r\nThis amendment does not change the current guideline rules precluding application of\r\nguideline weapon enhancements in a case in which the defendant is convicted of a 18 U.S.C.\r\n§ 924(c) or § 929(a) offense. Furthermore, under this amendment, in a case in which the\r\ndefendant is convicted of a 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) or § 929(a) offense but that offense, together\r\nwith any prior convictions, does not establish the defendant as a career offender, the current\r\nguideline rules for sentencing on that 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) or § 929(a) count continue to apply.\r\nAccordingly, under §2K2.4 (Use of Firearm, Armor-Piercing Ammunition, or Explosive\r\nDuring or in Relation to Certain Crimes), the guideline sentence on that count is the statutory\r\nminimum, and that sentence is imposed independently and consecutively to the sentence on\r\nother counts. No adjustments in Chapter Three (Adjustments) or Chapter Four (Criminal\r\nHistory and Criminal Livelihood) apply to adjust the guideline sentence for that 18 U.S.C.\r\n§ 924(c) or § 929(a) count.\r\nHowever, under this amendment, in a case in which the 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) or § 929(a) count\r\nestablishes the defendant as a career offender, which the court will determine under §§4B1.1\r\nand 4B1.2, new special rules and instructions will apply. To determine the guideline\r\nsentence on the 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) or § 929(a) count, the court moves directly from §2K2.4\r\nto §4B1.1 and applies the new special instruction therein. New special instructions for\r\nimposing sentence in these cases also have been added to §5G1.2.","EffectiveDate":"Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2002."},{"Id":644,"Title":"Amendment 644","Text":"Chapter Three, Part A, is amended by striking §3A1.2 as follows:\r\n\"§3A1.2.

For example, a defendant is\r\nin the custody and control of a prison or other correctional facility\r\nif the defendant (i) is on a work detail outside the security\r\nperimeter of the prison or correctional facility; (ii) is physically\r\naway from the prison or correctional facility while on a pass or\r\nfurlough; or (iii) is in custody at a community corrections center,\r\ncommunity treatment center, ‘halfway house’, or similar facility.\r\nThe defendant also shall be deemed to be in the custody and control\r\nof a prison or other correctional facility while the defendant is in\r\nthe status of having escaped from that prison or correctional\r\nfacility.\r\n‘Prison official’ means any individual (including a director, officer,\r\nemployee, independent contractor, or volunteer, but not including\r\nan inmate) authorized to act on behalf of a prison or correctional\r\nfacility.

Walker\r\nheld that an individual employed by the prison to supervise food service functions who was\r\nattacked by an inmate subordinate was not a \"corrections officer\" within the scope of\r\n§3A1.2. The Bureau of Prisons advised the Commission that the Bureau uses a variety of\r\nemployees, contractors, and volunteers to supervise inmates and that maintenance of a safe\r\nand stable institutional environment is fostered by knowledge on the part of inmates that\r\nanyone in prison employment or performing an authorized role within a prison is afforded\r\nthe protection of §3A1.2.

L. 106–578.\r\n(2) It provides guideline references in Appendix A for two new offenses\r\ncreated by the American Homeownership and Economic Opportunity Act\r\nof 2000, Pub. L. 106–569 (\"the Act\").

Under\r\nsection 611 of the National Housing Construction and Safety Standard Act\r\nof 1974 (42 U.S.C.§ 5410(b)), knowing and willful violations of subsection\r\n610(a) are punishable by imprisonment of not more than one year. The\r\namendment references this provision to §2N2.1. Second, section 708 of the\r\nAct created section 543 in Title V of the Housing Act of 1949 (42 U.S.C.\r\n§ 1490(s)(a)), which provides a criminal penalty of not more than five\r\nyears’ imprisonment for equity skimming. The amendment references this\r\nprovision to §2B1.1.\r\n(3) It references offenses under section 307(c) of the National Marine\r\nSanctuaries Act (16 U.S.C. § 1437(c)) to §2A2.4 (Obstructing or Impeding\r\nOfficers). Section 307(c) of the National Marine Sanctuaries Act, as\r\namended by the National Marine Sanctuaries Amendments Act of 2000,\r\nPub.

L.\r\n107–204 (the \"Act\"), by making several modifications to §2B1.1 (Larceny, Embezzlement,\r\nand Other Forms of Theft; Offenses Involving Stolen Property; Property Damage or\r\nDestruction; Fraud and Deceit; Forgery; Offenses Involving Altered or Counterfeit\r\nInstruments Other than Counterfeit Bearer Obligations of the United States) and §2J1.2\r\n(Obstruction of Justice). The directives pertain to serious fraud and related offenses and\r\nobstruction of justice offenses. The directives require the Commission under emergency\r\namendment authority to promulgate amendments addressing, among other things, officers\r\nand directors of publicly traded companies who commit fraud and related offenses, fraud\r\noffenses that endanger the solvency or financial security of a substantial number of victims,\r\nfraud offenses that involve significantly greater than 50 victims, and obstruction of justice\r\nNovember 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II Amendment 647\r\n\r\noffenses that involve the destruction of evidence.\r\nFirst, the amendment addresses the directive contained in section 1104(b)(5) of the Act to\r\n\"ensure that the guideline offense levels and enhancements under United States Sentencing\r\nGuideline §2B1.1 (as in effect on the date of enactment of this Act) are sufficient for a fraud\r\noffense when the number of victims adversely involved is significantly greater than 50.\" The\r\namendment implements this directive by expanding the existing enhancement at\r\n§2B1.1(b)(2) based on the number of victims involved in the offense. Prior to the\r\namendment, subsection (b)(2) provided a two level enhancement if the offense involved\r\nmore than 10, but less than 50, victims (or was committed through mass-marketing), and a\r\nfour level enhancement if the offense involved 50 or more victims. The amendment provides\r\nan additional two level increase, for a total of six levels, if the offense involved 250 or more\r\nvictims. The Commission determined that an enhancement of this magnitude appropriately\r\nresponds to the pertinent directive and reflects the extensive nature of, and the large scale\r\nvictimization caused by, such offenses.\r\nSecond, the amendment addresses directives contained in sections 805 and 1104 of the Act\r\npertaining to securities and accounting fraud offenses and fraud offenses that endanger the\r\nsolvency or financial security of a substantial number of victims. Specifically, section\r\n805(a)(4) directs the Commission to ensure that \"a specific offense characteristic enhancing\r\nsentencing is provided under United States Sentencing Guideline 2B1.1 (as in effect on the\r\ndate of enactment of this Act) for a fraud offense that endangers the solvency or financial\r\nsecurity of a substantial number of victims.\" In addition, section 1104(b)(1) directs the\r\nCommission to \"ensure that the sentencing guidelines and policy statements reflect the\r\nserious nature of securities, pension, and accounting fraud and the need for aggressive and\r\nappropriate law enforcement action to prevent such offenses.\" The amendment implements\r\nthese directives by expanding the scope of the existing enhancement at §2B1.1(b)(12)(B).\r\nPrior to the amendment, §2B1.1(b)(12)(B) provided a four level enhancement and a\r\nminimum offense level of 24 if the offense substantially jeopardized the safety and\r\nsoundness of a financial institution. The amendment expands the scope of this enhancement\r\nby providing two additional prongs. The first prong applies to offenses that substantially\r\nendanger the solvency or financial security of an organization that, at any time during the\r\noffense, was a publicly traded company or had 1,000 or more employees. The addition of\r\nthis prong reflects the Commission’s determination that such an offense undermines the\r\npublic’s confidence in the securities and investment market much in the same manner as an\r\noffense that jeopardizes the safety and soundness of a financial institution undermines the\r\npublic’s confidence in the banking system. This prong also reflects the likelihood that an\r\noffense that endangers the solvency or financial security of an employer of this size will\r\nsimilarly affect a substantial number of individual victims, without requiring the court to\r\ndetermine whether the solvency or financial security of each individual victim was\r\nsubstantially endangered.\r\nA corresponding application note for §2B1.1(b)(12)(B) sets forth a non-exhaustive list of\r\nfactors that the court shall consider in determining whether the offense endangered the\r\nsolvency or financial security of a publicly traded company or an organization with 1,000\r\nor more employees. The list of factors includes references to insolvency, filing for\r\nbankruptcy, substantially reducing the value of the company’s stock, and substantially\r\nreducing the company’s workforce among the list of factors that the court shall consider\r\nwhen applying the new enhancement, and other factors not enumerated in the application\r\nAmendment 647 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003\r\n\r\nnote could be considered by the court as appropriate.\r\nThe amendment also modifies the application note of the previously existing prong of\r\n§2B1.1(b)(12)(B), the financial institutions enhancement, to be consistent structurally with\r\nthe new prongs of the enhancement. Prior to the amendment, the presence of any one of the\r\nfactors enumerated in the application note would trigger the financial institutions\r\nenhancement under §2B1.1(b)(12)(B). Under the amendment, the application note to the\r\nfinancial institutions enhancement sets forth a non-exhaustive list of factors that the court\r\nshall consider in determining whether the offense substantially jeopardized the safety and\r\nsoundness of a financial institution. The list of factors that the court shall consider when\r\napplying this enhancement includes references to insolvency, substantially reducing benefits\r\nto pensioners and insureds, and an inability to refund fully any deposit, payment, or\r\ninvestment on demand.\r\nThe second prong added to §2B1.1(b)(12)(B) by the amendment applies to offenses that\r\nsubstantially endangered the solvency or financial security of 100 or more victims,\r\nregardless of whether a publicly traded company or other organization was affected by the\r\noffense. The Commission concluded that the specificity of the directive in section 805(a)(4)\r\nrequired an enhancement focused specifically on conduct that endangers the financial\r\nsecurity of individual victims. Thus, use of this prong of the enhancement will be\r\nappropriate in cases in which there is sufficient evidence for the court to determine that the\r\namount of loss suffered by individual victims of the offense substantially endangered the\r\nsolvency or financial security of those victims. The Commission also determined that the\r\nenhancement provided in §2B1.1(b)(12)(B) shall apply cumulatively with the enhancement\r\nat §2B1.1(b)(2), which is based solely on the number of victims involved in the offense, to\r\nreflect the particularly acute harm suffered by victims of offenses for which the new prongs\r\nof subsection (b)(12)(B) apply.\r\nThird, the amendment addresses the directive contained at section 1104(a)(2) of the Act to\r\n\"consider the promulgation of new sentencing guidelines or amendments to existing\r\nsentencing guidelines to provide an enhancement for officers or directors of publicly traded\r\ncorporations who commit fraud and related offenses.\" The amendment implements this\r\ndirective by providing a new, four level enhancement at §2B1.1(b)(13) that applies if the\r\noffense involved a violation of securities law and, at the time of the offense, the defendant\r\nwas an officer or director of a publicly traded company. The Commission concluded that\r\na four level enhancement appropriately reflects that an officer or director of a publicly traded\r\ncompany who commits such an offense violates certain heightened fiduciary duties imposed\r\nby securities law upon such individuals. Accordingly, the court is not required to determine\r\nspecifically whether the defendant abused a position of trust in order for the enhancement\r\nto apply, and a corresponding application note provides that, in cases in which the new, four\r\nlevel enhancement applies, the existing two level enhancement for abuse of position of trust\r\nat §3B1.3 (Abuse of Position of Trust or Use of Special Skill) shall not apply.\r\nThe corresponding application note also expressly provides that the enhancement would\r\napply regardless of whether the defendant was convicted under a specific securities fraud\r\nstatute (e.g., 18 U.S.C. § 1348, a new offense created by the Act specifically prohibiting\r\nsecurities fraud) or under a general fraud statute (e.g., 18 U.S.C. § 1341, prohibiting mail\r\nfraud), provided that the offense involved a violation of \"securities law\" as defined in the\r\napplication note.\r\nNovember 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II Amendment 647\r\n\r\nFourth, the amendment expands the loss table at §2B1.1(b)(1) to punish adequately offenses\r\nthat cause catastrophic losses of magnitudes previously unforeseen, such as the serious\r\ncorporate scandals that gave rise to several portions of the Act. Prior to the amendment, the\r\nloss table at §2B1.1(b)(1) provided sentencing enhancements in two level increments up to\r\na maximum of 26 levels for offenses in which the loss exceeded $100,000,000. The\r\namendment adds two additional loss amount categories to the table; an increase of 28 levels\r\nfor offenses in which the loss exceeded $200,000,000, and an increase of 30 levels for\r\noffenses in which the loss exceeded $400,000,000. These additions to the loss table address\r\ncongressional concern regarding particularly extensive and serious fraud offenses, and more\r\nfully effectuate increases in statutory maximum penalties provided by the Act (e.g., the\r\nincrease in the statutory maximum penalties for wire fraud and mail fraud offenses from five\r\nto 20 years set forth in section 903 of the Act). The amendment also modifies the tax table\r\nin §2T4.1 in a similar manner to maintain the longstanding proportional relationship between\r\nthe loss table in §2B1.1 and the tax table.\r\nThe amendment also adds a new factor to the general, enumerated factors that the court may\r\nconsider in determining the amount of loss under §2B1.1(b)(1). Specifically, the amendment\r\nadds the reduction in the value of equity securities or other corporate assets that resulted\r\nfrom the offense to the list of general factors set forth in Application Note 2(C) of §2B1.1.\r\nThis factor was added to provide courts additional guidance in determining loss in certain\r\ncases, particularly in complex white collar cases.\r\nFifth, the amendment modifies §2J1.2 to address the directives pertaining to obstruction of\r\njustice offenses contained in sections 805 and 1104 of the Act. Specifically, section 805(a)\r\nof the Act directs the Commission to ensure that the base offense level and existing\r\nenhancements in §2J1.2 are sufficient to deter and punish obstruction of justice offenses\r\ngenerally, and specifically are adequate in cases involving the destruction, alteration, or\r\nfabrication of a large amount of evidence, a large number of participants, the selection of\r\nevidence that is particularly probative or essential to the investigation, more than minimal\r\nplanning, or abuse of a special skill or a position of trust. Section 1104(b) of the Act further\r\ndirects the Commission to ensure that the \"guideline offense levels and enhancements for an\r\nobstruction of justice offense are adequate in cases where documents or other physical\r\nevidence are actually destroyed or fabricated.\"\r\nThe amendment implements these directives by making two modifications to §2J1.2. First,\r\nthe amendment increases the base offense level in §2J1.2 from level 12 to level 14. Second,\r\nthe amendment adds a new two level enhancement to §2J1.2. This enhancement applies if\r\nthe offense (i) involved the destruction, alteration, or fabrication of a substantial number of\r\nrecords, documents or tangible objects; (ii) involved the selection of any essential or\r\nespecially probative record, document, or tangible object to destroy or alter; or (iii) was\r\notherwise extensive in scope, planning, or preparation. The Commission determined that\r\nexisting adjustments in Chapter Three for aggravating role, §3B1.1, and abuse of position\r\nof trust or use of special skill, §3B1.3, adequately account for those particular factors\r\ndescribed in section 805(a) of the Act.\r\nSixth, the amendment addresses new offenses created by the Act. Section 1520 of title 18,\r\nUnited States Code, relating to destruction of corporate audit records, is referenced to §2E5.3\r\n(False Statements and Concealment of Facts in Relation to Documents Required by the\r\nEmployee Retirement Income Security Act; Failure to Maintain and Falsification of Records\r\nRequired by the Labor Management Reporting and Disclosure Act; Destruction and Failure\r\nAmendment 648 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003\r\n\r\nto Maintain Corporate Audit Records). Section 1520 provides a statutory maximum penalty\r\nof ten years’ imprisonment for knowing and willful violations of document maintenance\r\nrequirements as set forth in that section or in rules or regulations to be promulgated by the\r\nSecurities and Exchange Commission pursuant to that section. The amendment also expands\r\nthe existing cross reference in §2E5.3(a)(2) specifically to cover fraud and obstruction of\r\njustice offenses. Accordingly, if a defendant who is convicted under 18 U.S.C. § 1520\r\ncommitted the offense in order to obstruct justice, the amendment to the cross reference\r\nprovision requires the court to apply §2J1.2 instead of §2E5.3. Other new offenses are listed\r\nin Appendix A (Statutory Index), as well as in the statutory provisions of the relevant\r\nguidelines.","EffectiveDate":"Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is January 25, 2003."},{"Id":649,"Title":"Amendment 649","Text":"Chapter Two, Part C is amended in the heading by adding at the end \"AND\r\nVIOLATIONS OF FEDERAL ELECTION CAMPAIGN LAWS\".\r\nChapter Two, Part C is amended by striking the introductory commentary as follows:\r\n\" Introductory Commentary\r\nThe Commission believes that pre-guidelines sentencing practice did not\r\nadequately reflect the seriousness of public corruption offenses.

Application of Subsection (b)(4).—Subsection (b)(4) shall apply if the defendant\r\nengaged in any combination of 30 or more illegal transactions during the course of\r\nthe offense, whether or not the illegal transactions resulted in a conviction for such\r\nconduct.\r\n4. Departure Provision.—In a case in which the defendant’s conduct was part of a\r\nsystematic or pervasive corruption of a governmental function, process, or office\r\nthat may cause loss of public confidence in government, an upward departure may\r\nbe warranted.\".\r\nSection 3D1.2(d) is amended by inserting \", 2C1.8\" after \"2C1.7\".\r\nThe Commentary to §5E1.2 captioned \"Application Notes\" is amended in the second\r\nsentence of Note 5 by striking \"and\" after \"Control Act;\" and by inserting before the period\r\nat the end the following:\r\n\"; and 2 U.S.C. § 437g(d)(1)(D), which authorizes, for violations of the Federal\r\nElection Campaign Act under 2 U.S.C. § 441f, a fine up to the greater of $50,000\r\nor 1,000 percent of the amount of the violation, and which requires, in the case of\r\nsuch a violation, a minimum fine of not less than 300 percent of the amount of the\r\nviolation.\r\nThere may be cases in which the defendant has entered into a conciliation agreement\r\nwith the Federal Election Commission under section 309 of the Federal Election\r\nCampaign Act of 1971 in order to correct or prevent a violation of such Act by the\r\ndefendant. The existence of a conciliation agreement between the defendant and\r\nFederal Election Commission, and the extent of compliance with that conciliation\r\nagreement, may be appropriate factors in determining at what point within the\r\nNovember 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II Amendment 648\r\n\r\napplicable fine guideline range to sentence the defendant, unless the defendant\r\nbegan negotiations toward a conciliation agreement after becoming aware of a\r\ncriminal investigation\".\r\nAppendix A (Statutory Index) is amended by inserting before the line referenced to 7 U.S.C.\r\n§ 6 the following new lines:\r\n\"2 U.S.C. § 437g(d) 2C1.8\r\n2 U.S.C. § 439a 2C1.8\r\n2 U.S.C. § 441a 2C1.8\r\n2 U.S.C. § 441a-1 2C1.8\r\n2 U.S.C. § 441b 2C1.8\r\n2 U.S.C. § 441c 2C1.8\r\n2 U.S.C. § 441d 2C1.8\r\n2 U.S.C. § 441e 2C1.8\r\n2 U.S.C. § 441f 2C1.8\r\n2 U.S.C. § 441g 2C1.8\r\n2 U.S.C. § 441h(a) 2C1.8\r\n2 U.S.C. § 441i 2C1.8\r\n2 U.S.C. § 441k 2C1.8\".\r\nAppendix A (Statutory Index) is amended by inserting after the line referenced to 18 U.S.C.\r\n§ 597 the following new line:\r\n\"18 U.S.C. § 607 2C1.8\".","Reason":"Reason for Amendment: This amendment implements the directive from Congress\r\ncontained in the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002, Pub. L. 107–155, (the \"BCRA\")\r\nto the effect that the Commission \"promulgate a guideline, or amend an existing guideline\r\n..., for penalties for violations of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 (the \"FECA\")\r\nand related election laws ... .\". The BCRA significantly increased statutory penalties for\r\ncampaign finance crimes, formerly misdemeanors under the FECA. The new statutory\r\nmaximum term of imprisonment for even the least serious of these offenses is now two years\r\nand for more serious offenses, the maximum term of imprisonment is five years.\r\nTo effectively punish these offenses, the Commission chose to create a new guideline at\r\n§2C1.8 (Making, Receiving, or Failing to Report a Contribution, Donation, or Expenditure\r\nin Violation of the Federal Election Campaign Act; Fraudulently Misrepresenting Campaign\r\nAuthority; Soliciting or Receiving a Donation in Connection with an Election While on\r\nCertain Federal Property). The Commission opted against simply amending an existing\r\nguideline because it determined after review that the characteristics of election-violation\r\ncases did not bear sufficient similarity to cases sentenced under any existing guideline. The\r\noffenses which will be sentenced under §2C1.8 include: violations of the statutory\r\nprohibitions against \"soft money\" (2 U.S.C. § 441i); restrictions on \"hard money\"\r\ncontributions (2 U.S.C. § 441a); contributions by foreign nationals (2 U.S.C. § 441e);\r\nrestrictions on \"electioneering communications\" as defined at 2 U.S.C. § 434(f)(3)(C));\r\ncertain fraudulent misrepresentations (2 U.S.C. § 441h); and \"conduit contributions\" (2\r\nU.S.C. § 441f).\r\nThe new guideline has a base offense level of level 8, which reflects the fact that these\r\nAmendment 648 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003\r\n\r\noffenses, while they are somewhat similar to fraud offenses (sentenced under §2B1.1 (Theft,\r\nProperty Destruction, and Fraud) at a base offense level of level 6), generally are more\r\nserious due to the additional harm, or the potential harm, of corrupting the elective process.\r\nThe new guideline provides five specific offense characteristics to ensure appropriate penalty\r\nenhancements for aggravating conduct which may occur during the commission of certain\r\ncampaign finance offenses. First, the new guideline provides a specific offense\r\ncharacteristic, at §2C1.8(b)(1), that uses the fraud loss table in §2B1.1 to incrementally\r\nincrease the offense level in proportion to the monetary amounts involved in the illegal\r\ntransactions. This both assures proportionality with penalties for fraud offenses and\r\nresponds to Congress’ directive to provide an enhancement for \"a large aggregate amount\r\nof illegal contributions.\"\r\nSecond, the new guideline provides alternative enhancements, at §2C1.8(b)(2), if the offense\r\ninvolved a foreign national (two levels) or a foreign government (four levels). These\r\nenhancements respond to another specific directive in the BCRA and reflect the seriousness\r\nof foreign entities attempting to tamper with the United States’ election processes.\r\nThird, the new guideline provides alternative two level enhancements, at §2C1.8(b)(3), when\r\nthe offense involves either \"governmental funds,\" defined broadly to include Federal, State,\r\nor local funds, or an intent to derive \"a specific, identifiable non-monetary Federal benefit\"\r\n(e.g., a presidential pardon). Each of these enhancements responds to specific directives of\r\nthe BCRA.\r\nFourth, the new guideline provides a two level enhancement, at subsection (b)(4), when the\r\noffender engages in \"30 or more illegal transactions.\" After a review of all campaign finance\r\ncases in the Commission’s datafile, the Commission chose 30 transactions as the number best\r\nillustrative of a \"large number\" in that context. This enhancement also responds to a specific\r\ndirective in the BCRA to the effect that the Commission provide enhanced sentencing for\r\ncases involving \"a large number of illegal transactions.\"\r\nFifth, the new guideline provides a 4 level enhancement, at §2C1.8(b)(5), if the offense\r\ninvolves the use of \"intimidation, threat of pecuniary or other harm, or coercion.\" This\r\nenhancement responds to information received from the Federal Election Commission and\r\nthe Public Integrity Section of the Department of Justice which characterizes offenses of this\r\ntype as some of the most aggravated offenses committed under the FECA.\r\nThe new guideline also provides a cross reference, at subsection (c), which directs the\r\nsentencing court to apply either §2C1.1 or §2C1.2, as appropriate, if the offense involved a\r\nbribe or a gratuity and the resulting offense level would be greater than that determined\r\nunder §2C1.8.\r\nSection 3D1.2 (Groups of Closely Related Counts) has been amended, consistent with the\r\nprinciples underlying the rules for grouping multiple counts of conviction, to include §2C1.8\r\noffenses among those in which the offense level is determined largely on the basis of the\r\ntotal amount of harm or loss or some other measure of aggregate harm. (See §3D1.2(d)).\r\nFinally, §5E1.2 (Fines for Individual Defendants) has been amended to specifically reflect\r\nfine provisions unique to the FECA. This part of the amendment also provides that the\r\ndefendant’s participation in a conciliation agreement with the Federal Election Commission\r\nNovember 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II Amendment 648\r\n\r\nmay be an appropriate factor for use in determining the specific fine within the applicable\r\nfine guideline range unless the defendant began negotiations with the Federal Election\r\nCommission after the defendant became aware that he or it was the subject of a criminal\r\ninvestigation.","EffectiveDate":"Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is January 25, 2003."},{"Id":650,"Title":"Amendment 650","Text":"Section 2G2.2(b) is amended by adding at the end the following:\r\n\"(6) If the offense involved—\r\n(A) at least 10 images, but fewer than 150, increase by 2 levels;\r\n(B) at least 150 images, but fewer than 300, increase by 3 levels;\r\n(C) at least 300 images, but fewer than 600, increase by 4 levels; and\r\n(D) 600 or more images, increase by 5 levels.\".\r\nThe Commentary to §2G2.2 is amended by adding at the end the following:\r\n\"Background: Section 401(i)(1)(C) of Public Law 108–21 directly amended\r\nsubsection (b) to add subdivision (6), effective April 30, 2003.\".\r\nSection 2G2.4(b) is amended by adding at the end the following:\r\n\"(4) If the offense involved material that portrays sadistic or masochistic conduct\r\nor other depictions of violence, increase by 4 levels.\r\n(5) If the offense involved—\r\n(A) at least 10 images, but fewer than 150, increase by 2 levels;\r\n(B) at least 150 images, but fewer than 300, increase by 3 levels;\r\n(C) at least 300 images, but fewer than 600, increase by 4 levels; and\r\n(D) 600 or more images, increase by 5 levels.\".\r\nThe Commentary to §2G2.4 is amended by adding at the end the following:\r\n\"Background: Section 401(i)(1)(B) of Public Law 108–21 directly amended\r\nsubsection (b) to add subdivisions (4) and (5), effective April 30, 2003.\".\r\nSection 3E1.1(b) is amended by inserting \"upon motion of the government stating that\"\r\nbefore \"the defendant has assisted authorities\"; and by striking the following:\r\n\"taking one or more of the following steps:\r\n(1) timely providing complete information to the government\r\nAmendment 649 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003\r\n\r\nconcerning his own involvement in the offense; or\r\n(2) timely notifying authorities of his intention to enter a plea of guilty,\r\nthereby permitting the government to avoid preparing for trial and\r\npermitting the court to allocate its resources efficiently,\r\ndecrease the offense level by 1 additional level\",\r\nand inserting \"timely notifying authorities of his intention to enter a plea of guilty, thereby\r\npermitting the government to avoid preparing for trial and permitting the government and\r\nthe court to allocate their resources efficiently, decrease the offense level by 1 additional\r\nlevel\".\r\nThe Commentary to §3E1.1 captioned \"Application Notes\" is amended in Note 6 by striking\r\n\"one or both of\"; by striking \"(1) or (2)\"; by striking \"(b)(2)\" and inserting \"(b)\"; and by\r\nadding at the end the following new paragraph:\r\n\"Because the Government is in the best position to determine whether the defendant\r\nhas assisted authorities in a manner that avoids preparing for trial, an adjustment\r\nunder subsection (b) may only be granted upon a formal motion by the Government\r\nat the time of sentencing.

Authority\r\nThe United States Sentencing Commission (‘Commission’) is an\r\nindependent agency in the judicial branch composed of seven voting and two non-\r\nvoting, ex officio members. Its principal purpose is to establish sentencing policies\r\nand practices for the federal criminal justice system that will assure the ends of\r\njustice by promulgating detailed guidelines prescribing the appropriate sentences for\r\noffenders convicted of federal crimes.\r\nThe guidelines and policy statements promulgated by the Commission are\r\nissued pursuant to Section 994(a) of Title 28, United States Code.\r\nNovember 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II Amendment 651\r\n\r\n2. The Statutory Mission\r\nThe Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 (Title II of the Comprehensive Crime\r\nControl Act of 1984) provides for the development of guidelines that will further\r\nthe basic purposes of criminal punishment: deterrence, incapacitation, just\r\npunishment, and rehabilitation. The Act delegates broad authority to the\r\nCommission to review and rationalize the federal sentencing process.\r\nThe Act contains detailed instructions as to how this determination should\r\nbe made, the most important of which directs the Commission to create categories\r\nof offense behavior and offender characteristics. An offense behavior category\r\nmight consist, for example, of ‘bank robbery/committed with a gun/$2500 taken.’\r\nAn offender characteristic category might be ‘offender with one prior conviction not\r\nresulting in imprisonment.’ The Commission is required to prescribe guideline\r\nranges that specify an appropriate sentence for each class of convicted persons\r\ndetermined by coordinating the offense behavior categories with the offender\r\ncharacteristic categories. Where the guidelines call for imprisonment, the range\r\nmust be narrow: the maximum of the range cannot exceed the minimum by more\r\nthan the greater of 25 percent or six months. 28 U.S.C. § 994(b)(2).\r\nPursuant to the Act, the sentencing court must select a sentence from within\r\nthe guideline range. If, however, a particular case presents atypical features, the Act\r\nallows the court to depart from the guidelines and sentence outside the prescribed\r\nrange. In that case, the court must specify reasons for departure. 18 U.S.C. §\r\n3553(b). If the court sentences within the guideline range, an appellate court may\r\nreview the sentence to determine whether the guidelines were correctly applied. If\r\nthe court departs from the guideline range, an appellate court may review the\r\nreasonableness of the departure. 18 U.S.C. § 3742. The Act also abolishes parole,\r\nand substantially reduces and restructures good behavior adjustments.\r\nThe Commission’s initial guidelines were submitted to Congress on April\r\n13, 1987. After the prescribed period of Congressional review, the guidelines took\r\neffect on November 1, 1987, and apply to all offenses committed on or after that\r\ndate. The Commission has the authority to submit guideline amendments each year\r\nto Congress between the beginning of a regular Congressional session and May 1.\r\nSuch amendments automatically take effect 180 days after submission unless a law\r\nis enacted to the contrary. 28 U.S.C. § 994(p).\r\nThe initial sentencing guidelines and policy statements were developed after\r\nextensive hearings, deliberation, and consideration of substantial public comment.\r\nThe Commission emphasizes, however, that it views the guideline-writing process\r\nas evolutionary. It expects, and the governing statute anticipates, that continuing\r\nresearch, experience, and analysis will result in modifications and revisions to the\r\nguidelines through submission of amendments to Congress. To this end, the\r\nCommission is established as a permanent agency to monitor sentencing practices\r\nin the federal courts.\r\n3. The Basic Approach (Policy Statement)\r\nTo understand the guidelines and their underlying rationale, it is important\r\nAmendment 651 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003\r\n\r\nto focus on the three objectives that Congress sought to achieve in enacting the\r\nSentencing Reform Act of 1984. The Act’s basic objective was to enhance the\r\nability of the criminal justice system to combat crime through an effective, fair\r\nsentencing system. To achieve this end, Congress first sought honesty in\r\nsentencing. It sought to avoid the confusion and implicit deception that arose out\r\nof the pre-guidelines sentencing system which required the court to impose an\r\nindeterminate sentence of imprisonment and empowered the parole commission to\r\ndetermine how much of the sentence an offender actually would serve in prison.\r\nThis practice usually resulted in a substantial reduction in the effective length of the\r\nsentence imposed, with defendants often serving only about one-third of the\r\nsentence imposed by the court.\r\nSecond, Congress sought reasonable uniformity in sentencing by narrowing\r\nthe wide disparity in sentences imposed for similar criminal offenses committed by\r\nsimilar offenders. Third, Congress sought proportionality in sentencing through a\r\nsystem that imposes appropriately different sentences for criminal conduct of\r\ndiffering severity.\r\nHonesty is easy to achieve: the abolition of parole makes the sentence\r\nimposed by the court the sentence the offender will serve, less approximately fifteen\r\npercent for good behavior. There is a tension, however, between the mandate of\r\nuniformity and the mandate of proportionality. Simple uniformity -- sentencing\r\nevery offender to five years -- destroys proportionality. Having only a few simple\r\ncategories of crimes would make the guidelines uniform and easy to administer, but\r\nmight lump together offenses that are different in important respects. For example,\r\na single category for robbery that included armed and unarmed robberies, robberies\r\nwith and without injuries, robberies of a few dollars and robberies of millions,\r\nwould be far too broad.\r\nA sentencing system tailored to fit every conceivable wrinkle of each case\r\nwould quickly become unworkable and seriously compromise the certainty of\r\npunishment and its deterrent effect. For example: a bank robber with (or without)\r\na gun, which the robber kept hidden (or brandished), might have frightened (or\r\nmerely warned), injured seriously (or less seriously), tied up (or simply pushed) a\r\nguard, teller, or customer, at night (or at noon), in an effort to obtain money for\r\nother crimes (or for other purposes), in the company of a few (or many) other\r\nrobbers, for the first (or fourth) time.\r\nThe list of potentially relevant features of criminal behavior is long; the fact\r\nthat they can occur in multiple combinations means that the list of possible\r\npermutations of factors is virtually endless. The appropriate relationships among\r\nthese different factors are exceedingly difficult to establish, for they are often\r\ncontext specific. Sentencing courts do not treat the occurrence of a simple bruise\r\nidentically in all cases, irrespective of whether that bruise occurred in the context of\r\na bank robbery or in the context of a breach of peace. This is so, in part, because the\r\nrisk that such a harm will occur differs depending on the underlying offense with\r\nwhich it is connected; and also because, in part, the relationship between punishment\r\nand multiple harms is not simply additive. The relation varies depending on how\r\nmuch other harm has occurred. Thus, it would not be proper to assign points for\r\neach kind of harm and simply add them up, irrespective of context and total\r\nNovember 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II Amendment 651\r\n\r\namounts.\r\nThe larger the number of subcategories of offense and offender\r\ncharacteristics included in the guidelines, the greater the complexity and the less\r\nworkable the system. Moreover, complex combinations of offense and offender\r\ncharacteristics would apply and interact in unforeseen ways to unforeseen situations,\r\nthus failing to cure the unfairness of a simple, broad category system. Finally, and\r\nperhaps most importantly, probation officers and courts, in applying a complex\r\nsystem having numerous subcategories, would be required to make a host of\r\ndecisions regarding whether the underlying facts were sufficient to bring the case\r\nwithin a particular subcategory. The greater the number of decisions required and\r\nthe greater their complexity, the greater the risk that different courts would apply the\r\nguidelines differently to situations that, in fact, are similar, thereby reintroducing the\r\nvery disparity that the guidelines were designed to reduce.\r\nIn view of the arguments, it would have been tempting to retreat to the\r\nsimple, broad category approach and to grant courts the discretion to select the\r\nproper point along a broad sentencing range. Granting such broad discretion,\r\nhowever, would have risked correspondingly broad disparity in sentencing, for\r\ndifferent courts may exercise their discretionary powers in different ways. Such an\r\napproach would have risked a return to the wide disparity that Congress established\r\nthe Commission to reduce and would have been contrary to the Commission’s\r\nmandate set forth in the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984.\r\nIn the end, there was no completely satisfying solution to this problem. The\r\nCommission had to balance the comparative virtues and vices of broad, simple\r\ncategorization and detailed, complex subcategorization, and within the constraints\r\nestablished by that balance, minimize the discretionary powers of the sentencing\r\ncourt. Any system will, to a degree, enjoy the benefits and suffer from the\r\ndrawbacks of each approach.\r\nA philosophical problem arose when the Commission attempted to reconcile\r\nthe differing perceptions of the purposes of criminal punishment. Most observers\r\nof the criminal law agree that the ultimate aim of the law itself, and of punishment\r\nin particular, is the control of crime. Beyond this point, however, the consensus\r\nseems to break down. Some argue that appropriate punishment should be defined\r\nprimarily on the basis of the principle of ‘just deserts.’ Under this principle,\r\npunishment should be scaled to the offender’s culpability and the resulting harms.\r\nOthers argue that punishment should be imposed primarily on the basis of practical\r\n‘crime control’ considerations. This theory calls for sentences that most effectively\r\nlessen the likelihood of future crime, either by deterring others or incapacitating the\r\ndefendant.\r\nAdherents of each of these points of view urged the Commission to choose\r\nbetween them and accord one primacy over the other. As a practical matter,\r\nhowever, this choice was unnecessary because in most sentencing decisions the\r\napplication of either philosophy will produce the same or similar results.\r\nIn its initial set of guidelines, the Commission sought to solve both the\r\npractical and philosophical problems of developing a coherent sentencing system by\r\nAmendment 651 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003\r\n\r\ntaking an empirical approach that used as a starting point data estimating pre-\r\nguidelines sentencing practice. It analyzed data drawn from 10,000 presentence\r\ninvestigations, the differing elements of various crimes as distinguished in\r\nsubstantive criminal statutes, the United States Parole Commission’s guidelines and\r\nstatistics, and data from other relevant sources in order to determine which\r\ndistinctions were important in pre-guidelines practice. After consideration, the\r\nCommission accepted, modified, or rationalized these distinctions.\r\nThis empirical approach helped the Commission resolve its practical\r\nproblem by defining a list of relevant distinctions that, although of considerable\r\nlength, was short enough to create a manageable set of guidelines. Existing\r\ncategories are relatively broad and omit distinctions that some may believe\r\nimportant, yet they include most of the major distinctions that statutes and data\r\nsuggest made a significant difference in sentencing decisions. Relevant distinctions\r\nnot reflected in the guidelines probably will occur rarely and sentencing courts may\r\ntake such unusual cases into account by departing from the guidelines.\r\nThe Commission’s empirical approach also helped resolve its philosophical\r\ndilemma. Those who adhere to a just deserts philosophy may concede that the lack\r\nof consensus might make it difficult to say exactly what punishment is deserved for\r\na particular crime. Likewise, those who subscribe to a philosophy of crime control\r\nmay acknowledge that the lack of sufficient data might make it difficult to determine\r\nexactly the punishment that will best prevent that crime. Both groups might\r\ntherefore recognize the wisdom of looking to those distinctions that judges and\r\nlegislators have, in fact, made over the course of time. These established\r\ndistinctions are ones that the community believes, or has found over time, to be\r\nimportant from either a just deserts or crime control perspective.\r\nThe Commission did not simply copy estimates of pre-guidelines practice\r\nas revealed by the data, even though establishing offense values on this basis would\r\nhelp eliminate disparity because the data represent averages. Rather, it departed\r\nfrom the data at different points for various important reasons. Congressional\r\nstatutes, for example, suggested or required departure, as in the case of the Anti-\r\nDrug Abuse Act of 1986 that imposed increased and mandatory minimum sentences.\r\nIn addition, the data revealed inconsistencies in treatment, such as punishing\r\neconomic crime less severely than other apparently equivalent behavior.\r\nDespite these policy-oriented departures from pre-guidelines practice, the\r\nguidelines represent an approach that begins with, and builds upon, empirical data.\r\nThe guidelines will not please those who wish the Commission to adopt a single\r\nphilosophical theory and then work deductively to establish a simple and perfect set\r\nof categorizations and distinctions. The guidelines may prove acceptable, however,\r\nto those who seek more modest, incremental improvements in the status quo, who\r\nbelieve the best is often the enemy of the good, and who recognize that these\r\nguidelines are, as the Act contemplates, but the first step in an evolutionary process.\r\nAfter spending considerable time and resources exploring alternative approaches,\r\nthe Commission developed these guidelines as a practical effort toward the\r\nachievement of a more honest, uniform, equitable, proportional, and therefore\r\neffective sentencing system.\r\nNovember 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II Amendment 651\r\n\r\n4. The Guidelines’ Resolution of Major Issues (Policy Statement)\r\nThe guideline-drafting process required the Commission to resolve a host\r\nof important policy questions typically involving rather evenly balanced sets of\r\ncompeting considerations. As an aid to understanding the guidelines, this\r\nintroduction briefly discusses several of those issues; commentary in the guidelines\r\nexplains others.\r\n(a) Real Offense vs. Charge Offense Sentencing.\r\nOne of the most important questions for the Commission to decide was\r\nwhether to base sentences upon the actual conduct in which the defendant engaged\r\nregardless of the charges for which he was indicted or convicted (‘real offense’\r\nsentencing), or upon the conduct that constitutes the elements of the offense for\r\nwhich the defendant was charged and of which he was convicted (‘charge offense’\r\nsentencing). A bank robber, for example, might have used a gun, frightened\r\nbystanders, taken $50,000, injured a teller, refused to stop when ordered, and raced\r\naway damaging property during his escape. A pure real offense system would\r\nsentence on the basis of all identifiable conduct. A pure charge offense system\r\nwould overlook some of the harms that did not constitute statutory elements of the\r\noffenses of which the defendant was convicted.\r\nThe Commission initially sought to develop a pure real offense system.\r\nAfter all, the pre-guidelines sentencing system was, in a sense, this type of system.\r\nThe sentencing court and the parole commission took account of the conduct in\r\nwhich the defendant actually engaged, as determined in a presentence report, at the\r\nsentencing hearing, or before a parole commission hearing officer. The\r\nCommission’s initial efforts in this direction, carried out in the spring and early\r\nsummer of 1986, proved unproductive, mostly for practical reasons. To make such\r\na system work, even to formalize and rationalize the status quo, would have required\r\nthe Commission to decide precisely which harms to take into account, how to add\r\nthem up, and what kinds of procedures the courts should use to determine the\r\npresence or absence of disputed factual elements. The Commission found no\r\npractical way to combine and account for the large number of diverse harms arising\r\nin different circumstances; nor did it find a practical way to reconcile the need for\r\na fair adjudicatory procedure with the need for a speedy sentencing process given\r\nthe potential existence of hosts of adjudicated ‘real harm’ facts in many typical\r\ncases. The effort proposed as a solution to these problems required the use of, for\r\nexample, quadratic roots and other mathematical operations that the Commission\r\nconsidered too complex to be workable. In the Commission’s view, such a system\r\nrisked return to wide disparity in sentencing practice.\r\nIn its initial set of guidelines submitted to Congress in April 1987, the\r\nCommission moved closer to a charge offense system. This system, however, does\r\ncontain a significant number of real offense elements. For one thing, the hundreds\r\nof overlapping and duplicative statutory provisions that make up the federal criminal\r\nlaw forced the Commission to write guidelines that are descriptive of generic\r\nconduct rather than guidelines that track purely statutory language. For another, the\r\nguidelines take account of a number of important, commonly occurring real offense\r\nelements such as role in the offense, the presence of a gun, or the amount of money\r\nAmendment 651 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003\r\n\r\nactually taken, through alternative base offense levels, specific offense\r\ncharacteristics, cross references, and adjustments.\r\nThe Commission recognized that a charge offense system has drawbacks of\r\nits own. One of the most important is the potential it affords prosecutors to\r\ninfluence sentences by increasing or decreasing the number of counts in an\r\nindictment. Of course, the defendant’s actual conduct (that which the prosecutor can\r\nprove in court) imposes a natural limit upon the prosecutor’s ability to increase a\r\ndefendant’s sentence. Moreover, the Commission has written its rules for the\r\ntreatment of multicount convictions with an eye toward eliminating unfair treatment\r\nthat might flow from count manipulation. For example, the guidelines treat a three-\r\ncount indictment, each count of which charges sale of 100 grams of heroin or theft\r\nof $10,000, the same as a single-count indictment charging sale of 300 grams of\r\nheroin or theft of $30,000. Furthermore, a sentencing court may control any\r\ninappropriate manipulation of the indictment through use of its departure power.\r\nFinally, the Commission will closely monitor charging and plea agreement practices\r\nand will make appropriate adjustments should they become necessary.\r\n(b) Departures.\r\nThe sentencing statute permits a court to depart from a guideline-specified\r\nsentence only when it finds ‘an aggravating or mitigating circumstance of a kind, or\r\nto a degree, not adequately taken into consideration by the Sentencing Commission\r\nin formulating the guidelines that should result in a sentence different from that\r\ndescribed.’ 18 U.S.C. § 3553(b). The Commission intends the sentencing courts\r\nto treat each guideline as carving out a ‘heartland,’ a set of typical cases embodying\r\nthe conduct that each guideline describes. When a court finds an atypical case, one\r\nto which a particular guideline linguistically applies but where conduct significantly\r\ndiffers from the norm, the court may consider whether a departure is warranted.\r\nSection 5H1.10 (Race, Sex, National Origin, Creed, Religion, and Socio-Economic\r\nStatus), §5H1.12 (Lack of Guidance as a Youth and Similar Circumstances), the\r\nthird sentence of §5H1.4 (Physical Condition, Including Drug or Alcohol\r\nDependence or Abuse), the last sentence of §5K2.12 (Coercion and Duress), and\r\n§5K2.19 (Post-Sentencing Rehabilitative Efforts) list several factors that the court\r\ncannot take into account as grounds for departure. With those specific exceptions,\r\nhowever, the Commission does not intend to limit the kinds of factors, whether or\r\nnot mentioned anywhere else in the guidelines, that could constitute grounds for\r\ndeparture in an unusual case.\r\nThe Commission has adopted this departure policy for two reasons. First,\r\nit is difficult to prescribe a single set of guidelines that encompasses the vast range\r\nof human conduct potentially relevant to a sentencing decision. The Commission\r\nalso recognizes that the initial set of guidelines need not do so. The Commission is\r\na permanent body, empowered by law to write and rewrite guidelines, with\r\nprogressive changes, over many years. By monitoring when courts depart from the\r\nguidelines and by analyzing their stated reasons for doing so and court decisions\r\nwith references thereto, the Commission, over time, will be able to refine the\r\nguidelines to specify more precisely when departures should and should not be\r\npermitted.\r\nNovember 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II Amendment 651\r\n\r\nSecond, the Commission believes that despite the courts’ legal freedom to\r\ndepart from the guidelines, they will not do so very often. This is because the\r\nguidelines, offense by offense, seek to take account of those factors that the\r\nCommission’s data indicate made a significant difference in pre-guidelines\r\nsentencing practice. Thus, for example, where the presence of physical injury made\r\nan important difference in pre-guidelines sentencing practice (as in the case of\r\nrobbery or assault), the guidelines specifically include this factor to enhance the\r\nsentence. Where the guidelines do not specify an augmentation or diminution, this\r\nis generally because the sentencing data did not permit the Commission to conclude\r\nthat the factor was empirically important in relation to the particular offense. Of\r\ncourse, an important factor (e.g., physical injury) may infrequently occur in\r\nconnection with a particular crime (e.g., fraud). Such rare occurrences are precisely\r\nthe type of events that the courts’ departure powers were designed to cover --\r\nunusual cases outside the range of the more typical offenses for which the guidelines\r\nwere designed.\r\nIt is important to note that the guidelines refer to two different kinds of\r\ndeparture. The first involves instances in which the guidelines provide specific\r\nguidance for departure by analogy or by other numerical or non-numerical\r\nsuggestions. The Commission intends such suggestions as policy guidance for the\r\ncourts. The Commission expects that most departures will reflect the suggestions\r\nand that the courts of appeals may prove more likely to find departures\r\n‘unreasonable’ where they fall outside suggested levels.\r\nA second type of departure will remain unguided. It may rest upon grounds\r\nreferred to in Chapter Five, Part K (Departures) or on grounds not mentioned in the\r\nguidelines. While Chapter Five, Part K lists factors that the Commission believes\r\nmay constitute grounds for departure, the list is not exhaustive. The Commission\r\nrecognizes that there may be other grounds for departure that are not mentioned; it\r\nalso believes there may be cases in which a departure outside suggested levels is\r\nwarranted. In its view, however, such cases will be highly infrequent.\r\n(c) Plea Agreements.\r\nNearly ninety percent of all federal criminal cases involve guilty pleas and\r\nmany of these cases involve some form of plea agreement. Some commentators on\r\nearly Commission guideline drafts urged the Commission not to attempt any major\r\nreforms of the plea agreement process on the grounds that any set of guidelines that\r\nthreatened to change pre-guidelines practice radically also threatened to make the\r\nfederal system unmanageable. Others argued that guidelines that failed to control\r\nand limit plea agreements would leave untouched a ‘loophole’ large enough to undo\r\nthe good that sentencing guidelines would bring.\r\nThe Commission decided not to make major changes in plea agreement\r\npractices in the initial guidelines, but rather to provide guidance by issuing general\r\npolicy statements concerning the acceptance of plea agreements in Chapter Six, Part\r\nB (Plea Agreements). The rules set forth in Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(e) govern the\r\nacceptance or rejection of such agreements. The Commission will collect data on\r\nthe courts’ plea practices and will analyze this information to determine when and\r\nwhy the courts accept or reject plea agreements and whether plea agreement\r\nAmendment 651 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003\r\n\r\npractices are undermining the intent of the Sentencing Reform Act. In light of this\r\ninformation and analysis, the Commission will seek to further regulate the plea\r\nagreement process as appropriate. Importantly, if the policy statements relating to\r\nplea agreements are followed, circumvention of the Sentencing Reform Act and the\r\nguidelines should not occur.\r\nThe Commission expects the guidelines to have a positive, rationalizing\r\nimpact upon plea agreements for two reasons. First, the guidelines create a clear,\r\ndefinite expectation in respect to the sentence that a court will impose if a trial takes\r\nplace. In the event a prosecutor and defense attorney explore the possibility of a\r\nnegotiated plea, they will no longer work in the dark. This fact alone should help\r\nto reduce irrationality in respect to actual sentencing outcomes. Second, the\r\nguidelines create a norm to which courts will likely refer when they decide whether,\r\nunder Rule 11(e), to accept or to reject a plea agreement or recommendation.\r\n(d) Probation and Split Sentences.\r\nThe statute provides that the guidelines are to ‘reflect the general\r\nappropriateness of imposing a sentence other than imprisonment in cases in which\r\nthe defendant is a first offender who has not been convicted of a crime of violence\r\nor an otherwise serious offense . . . .’ 28 U.S.C. § 994(j). Under pre-guidelines\r\nsentencing practice, courts sentenced to probation an inappropriately high\r\npercentage of offenders guilty of certain economic crimes, such as theft, tax evasion,\r\nantitrust offenses, insider trading, fraud, and embezzlement, that in the\r\nCommission’s view are ‘serious.’\r\nThe Commission’s solution to this problem has been to write guidelines that\r\nclassify as serious many offenses for which probation previously was frequently\r\ngiven and provide for at least a short period of imprisonment in such cases. The\r\nCommission concluded that the definite prospect of prison, even though the term\r\nmay be short, will serve as a significant deterrent, particularly when compared with\r\npre-guidelines practice where probation, not prison, was the norm.\r\nMore specifically, the guidelines work as follows in respect to a first\r\noffender. For offense levels one through eight, the sentencing court may elect to\r\nsentence the offender to probation (with or without confinement conditions) or to\r\na prison term. For offense levels nine and ten, the court may substitute probation\r\nfor a prison term, but the probation must include confinement conditions\r\n(community confinement, intermittent confinement, or home detention). For offense\r\nlevels eleven and twelve, the court must impose at least one-half the minimum\r\nconfinement sentence in the form of prison confinement, the remainder to be served\r\non supervised release with a condition of community confinement or home\r\ndetention. The Commission, of course, has not dealt with the single acts of aberrant\r\nbehavior that still may justify probation at higher offense levels through departures.*\r\n*Note: Although the Commission had not addressed ‘single acts of aberrant\r\nbehavior’ at the time the Introduction to the Guidelines Manual originally was\r\nwritten, it subsequently addressed the issue in Amendment 603, effective\r\nNovember 1, 2000. (See Supplement to Appendix C, amendment 603.)\r\nNovember 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II Amendment 651\r\n\r\n(e) Multi-Count Convictions.\r\nThe Commission, like several state sentencing commissions, has found it\r\nparticularly difficult to develop guidelines for sentencing defendants convicted of\r\nmultiple violations of law, each of which makes up a separate count in an\r\nindictment. The difficulty is that when a defendant engages in conduct that causes\r\nseveral harms, each additional harm, even if it increases the extent to which\r\npunishment is warranted, does not necessarily warrant a proportionate increase in\r\npunishment. A defendant who assaults others during a fight, for example, may\r\nwarrant more punishment if he injures ten people than if he injures one, but his\r\nconduct does not necessarily warrant ten times the punishment. If it did, many of\r\nthe simplest offenses, for reasons that are often fortuitous, would lead to sentences\r\nof life imprisonment -- sentences that neither just deserts nor crime control theories\r\nof punishment would justify.\r\nSeveral individual guidelines provide special instructions for increasing\r\npunishment when the conduct that is the subject of that count involves multiple\r\noccurrences or has caused several harms. The guidelines also provide general rules\r\nfor aggravating punishment in light of multiple harms charged separately in separate\r\ncounts. These rules may produce occasional anomalies, but normally they will\r\npermit an appropriate degree of aggravation of punishment for multiple offenses that\r\nare the subjects of separate counts.\r\nThese rules are set out in Chapter Three, Part D (Multiple Counts). They\r\nessentially provide: (1) when the conduct involves fungible items (e.g., separate\r\ndrug transactions or thefts of money), the amounts are added and the guidelines\r\napply to the total amount; (2) when nonfungible harms are involved, the offense\r\nlevel for the most serious count is increased (according to a diminishing scale) to\r\nreflect the existence of other counts of conviction. The guidelines have been written\r\nin order to minimize the possibility that an arbitrary casting of a single transaction\r\ninto several counts will produce a longer sentence. In addition, the sentencing court\r\nwill have adequate power to prevent such a result through departures.\r\n(f) Regulatory Offenses.\r\nRegulatory statutes, though primarily civil in nature, sometimes contain\r\ncriminal provisions in respect to particularly harmful activity. Such criminal\r\nprovisions often describe not only substantive offenses, but also more technical,\r\nadministratively-related offenses such as failure to keep accurate records or to\r\nprovide requested information. These statutes pose two problems: first, which\r\ncriminal regulatory provisions should the Commission initially consider, and\r\nsecond, how should it treat technical or administratively-related criminal violations?\r\nIn respect to the first problem, the Commission found that it could not\r\ncomprehensively treat all regulatory violations in the initial set of guidelines. There\r\nare hundreds of such provisions scattered throughout the United States Code. To\r\nfind all potential violations would involve examination of each individual federal\r\nregulation. Because of this practical difficulty, the Commission sought to\r\ndetermine, with the assistance of the Department of Justice and several regulatory\r\nagencies, which criminal regulatory offenses were particularly important in light of\r\nAmendment 651 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003\r\n\r\nthe need for enforcement of the general regulatory scheme. The Commission\r\naddressed these offenses in the initial guidelines.\r\nIn respect to the second problem, the Commission has developed a system\r\nfor treating technical recordkeeping and reporting offenses that divides them into\r\nfour categories. First, in the simplest of cases, the offender may have failed to fill\r\nout a form intentionally, but without knowledge or intent that substantive harm\r\nwould likely follow. He might fail, for example, to keep an accurate record of toxic\r\nsubstance transport, but that failure may not lead, nor be likely to lead, to the release\r\nor improper handling of any toxic substance. Second, the same failure may be\r\naccompanied by a significant likelihood that substantive harm will occur; it may\r\nmake a release of a toxic substance more likely. Third, the same failure may have\r\nled to substantive harm. Fourth, the failure may represent an effort to conceal a\r\nsubstantive harm that has occurred.\r\nThe structure of a typical guideline for a regulatory offense provides a low\r\nbase offense level (e.g., 6) aimed at the first type of recordkeeping or reporting\r\noffense. Specific offense characteristics designed to reflect substantive harms that\r\ndo occur in respect to some regulatory offenses, or that are likely to occur, increase\r\nthe offense level. A specific offense characteristic also provides that a\r\nrecordkeeping or reporting offense that conceals a substantive offense will have the\r\nsame offense level as the substantive offense.\r\n(g) Sentencing Ranges.\r\nIn determining the appropriate sentencing ranges for each offense, the\r\nCommission estimated the average sentences served within each category under the\r\npre-guidelines sentencing system. It also examined the sentences specified in\r\nfederal statutes, in the parole guidelines, and in other relevant, analogous sources.\r\nThe Commission’s Supplementary Report on the Initial Sentencing Guidelines\r\n(1987) contains a comparison between estimates of pre-guidelines sentencing\r\npractice and sentences under the guidelines.\r\nWhile the Commission has not considered itself bound by pre-guidelines\r\nsentencing practice, it has not attempted to develop an entirely new system of\r\nsentencing on the basis of theory alone. Guideline sentences, in many instances,\r\nwill approximate average pre-guidelines practice and adherence to the guidelines\r\nwill help to eliminate wide disparity. For example, where a high percentage of\r\npersons received probation under pre-guidelines practice, a guideline may include\r\none or more specific offense characteristics in an effort to distinguish those types of\r\ndefendants who received probation from those who received more severe sentences.\r\nIn some instances, short sentences of incarceration for all offenders in a category\r\nhave been substituted for a pre-guidelines sentencing practice of very wide\r\nvariability in which some defendants received probation while others received\r\nseveral years in prison for the same offense. Moreover, inasmuch as those who\r\npleaded guilty under pre-guidelines practice often received lesser sentences, the\r\nguidelines permit the court to impose lesser sentences on those defendants who\r\naccept responsibility for their misconduct. For defendants who provide substantial\r\nassistance to the government in the investigation or prosecution of others, a\r\ndownward departure may be warranted.\r\nNovember 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II Amendment 651\r\n\r\nThe Commission has also examined its sentencing ranges in light of their\r\nlikely impact upon prison population. Specific legislation, such as the Anti-Drug\r\nAbuse Act of 1986 and the career offender provisions of the Sentencing Reform Act\r\nof 1984 (28 U.S.C. § 994(h)), required the Commission to promulgate guidelines\r\nthat will lead to substantial prison population increases. These increases will occur\r\nirrespective of the guidelines. The guidelines themselves, insofar as they reflect\r\npolicy decisions made by the Commission (rather than legislated mandatory\r\nminimum or career offender sentences), are projected to lead to an increase in prison\r\npopulation that computer models, produced by the Commission and the Bureau\r\no f\r\nPrisons\r\nin 1987,\r\nestimat\r\ned a t\r\napproxi\r\nmately\r\n10 perc\r\nent over\r\na period\r\nof ten\r\nyears.\r\n(h) The Sentencing Table.\r\nThe Commission has established a sentencing table that for technical and\r\npractical reasons contains 43 levels. Each level in the table prescribes ranges that\r\noverlap with the ranges in the preceding and succeeding levels. By overlapping the\r\nranges, the table should discourage unnecessary litigation. Both prosecution and\r\ndefense will realize that the difference between one level and another will not\r\nnecessarily make a difference in the sentence that the court imposes. Thus, little\r\npurpose will be served in protracted litigation trying to determine, for example,\r\nwhether $10,000 or $11,000 was obtained as a result of a fraud. At the same time,\r\nthe levels work to increase a sentence proportionately. A change of six levels\r\nroughly doubles the sentence irrespective of the level at which one starts. The\r\nguidelines, in keeping with the statutory requirement that the maximum of any range\r\ncannot exceed the minimum by more than the greater of 25 percent or six months\r\n(28 U.S.C. § 994(b)(2)), permit courts to exercise the greatest permissible range of\r\nsentencing discretion. The table overlaps offense levels meaningfully, works\r\nproportionately, and at the same time preserves the maximum degree of allowable\r\ndiscretion for the court within each level.\r\nSimilarly, many of the individual guidelines refer to tables that correlate\r\namounts of money with offense levels. These tables often have many rather than a\r\nfew levels. Again, the reason is to minimize the likelihood of unnecessary litigation.\r\nIf a money table were to make only a few distinctions, each distinction would\r\nbecome more important and litigation over which category an offender fell within\r\nwould become more likely. Where a table has many small monetary distinctions,\r\nit minimizes the likelihood of litigation because the precise amount of money\r\ninvolved is of considerably less importance.\r\nAmendment 651 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003\r\n\r\n5. A Concluding Note\r\nThe Commission emphasizes that it drafted the initial guidelines with\r\nconsiderable caution. It examined the many hundreds of criminal statutes in the\r\nUnited States Code. It began with those that were the basis for a significant number\r\nof prosecutions and sought to place them in a rational order. It developed additional\r\ndistinctions relevant to the application of these provisions and it applied sentencing\r\nranges to each resulting category. In doing so, it relied upon pre-guidelines\r\nsentencing practice as revealed by its own statistical analyses based on summary\r\nreports of some 40,000 convictions, a sample of 10,000 augmented presentence\r\nreports, the parole guidelines, and policy judgments.\r\nThe Commission recognizes that some will criticize this approach as overly\r\ncautious, as representing too little a departure from pre-guidelines sentencing\r\npractice. Yet, it will cure wide disparity. The Commission is a permanent body that\r\ncan amend the guidelines each year. Although the data available to it, like all data,\r\nare imperfect, experience with the guidelines will lead to additional information and\r\nprovide a firm empirical basis for consideration of revisions.\r\nFinally, the guidelines will apply to more than 90 percent of all felony and\r\nClass A misdemeanor cases in the federal courts. Because of time constraints and\r\nthe nonexistence of statistical information, some offenses that occur infrequently are\r\nnot considered in the guidelines. Their exclusion does not reflect any judgment\r\nregarding their seriousness and they will be addressed as the Commission refines the\r\nguidelines over time.\";\r\nand inserting:\r\n\" PART A - AUTHORITY\r\n§1A1.1.

Historical Review of Original Introduction.—Part A of Chapter One\r\noriginally was an introduction to the Guidelines Manual that explained a\r\nnumber of policy decisions made by the Commission when it promulgated\r\nNovember 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II Amendment 651\r\n\r\nthe initial set of guidelines. This introduction was amended occasionally\r\nbetween 1987 and 2003. In 2003, as part of the Commission’s\r\nimplementation of the Prosecutorial Remedies and Other Tools to end the\r\nExploitation of Children Today Act of 2003 (the ‘PROTECT Act’, Public\r\nLaw 108–21), the original introduction was transferred to the Editorial Note\r\nat the end of this guideline. The Commission encourages the review of this\r\nmaterial for context and historical purposes.\r\nBackground: The Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 changed the course of federal\r\nsentencing. Among other things, the Act created the United States Sentencing\r\nCommission as an independent agency in the Judicial Branch, and directed it to\r\ndevelop guidelines and policy statements for sentencing courts to use when\r\nsentencing offenders convicted of federal crimes. Moreover, it empowered the\r\nCommission with ongoing responsibilities to monitor the guidelines, submit to\r\nCongress appropriate modifications of the guidelines and recommended changes in\r\ncriminal statutes, and establish education and research programs. The mandate\r\nrested on Congressional awareness that sentencing was a dynamic field that requires\r\ncontinuing review by an expert body to revise sentencing policies, in light of\r\napplication experience, as new criminal statutes are enacted, and as more is learned\r\nabout what motivates and controls criminal behavior.\";\r\nand adding an editorial note following the guideline.\r\nThe Commentary to §1B1.1 captioned \"Application Notes\" is amended by striking Note 1\r\nas follows:\r\n\"1. The following are definitions of terms that are used frequently in the\r\nguidelines and are of general applicability (except to the extent expressly\r\nmodified in respect to a particular guideline or policy statement):\r\n(a) ‘Abducted’ means that a victim was forced to accompany an\r\noffender to a different location. For example, a bank robber’s\r\nforcing a bank teller from the bank into a getaway car would\r\nconstitute an abduction.\r\n(b) ‘Bodily injury’ means any significant injury; e.g., an injury that is\r\npainful and obvious, or is of a type for which medical attention\r\nordinarily would be sought.\r\n(c) ‘Brandished’ with reference to a dangerous weapon (including a\r\nfirearm) means that all or part of the weapon was displayed, or the\r\npresence of the weapon was otherwise made known to another\r\nperson, in order to intimidate that person, regardless of whether the\r\nweapon was directly visible to that person. Accordingly, although\r\nthe dangerous weapon does not have to be directly visible, the\r\nweapon must be present.\r\n(d) ‘Dangerous weapon’ means (i) an instrument capable of inflicting\r\ndeath or serious bodily injury; or (ii) an object that is not an\r\ninstrument capable of inflicting death or serious bodily injury but\r\nAmendment 651 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003\r\n\r\n(I) closely resembles such an instrument; or (II) the defendant used\r\nthe object in a manner that created the impression that the object\r\nwas such an instrument (e.g. a defendant wrapped a hand in a towel\r\nduring a bank robbery to create the appearance of a gun).\r\n(e) ‘Firearm’ means (i) any weapon (including a starter gun) which\r\nwill or is designed to or may readily be converted to expel a\r\nprojectile by the action of an explosive; (ii) the frame or receiver of\r\nany such weapon; (iii) any firearm muffler or silencer; or (iv) any\r\ndestructive device. A weapon, commonly known as a ‘BB’ or\r\npellet gun, that uses air or carbon dioxide pressure to expel a\r\nprojectile is a dangerous weapon but not a firearm.\r\n(f) ‘Otherwise used’ with reference to a dangerous weapon (including\r\na firearm) means that the conduct did not amount to the discharge\r\nof a firearm but was more than brandishing, displaying, or\r\npossessing a firearm or other dangerous weapon.\r\n(g) ‘Permanent or life-threatening bodily injury’ means injury\r\ninvolving a substantial risk of death; loss or substantial impairment\r\nof the function of a bodily member, organ, or mental faculty that is\r\nlikely to be permanent; or an obvious disfigurement that is likely\r\nto be permanent. In the case of a kidnapping, for example,\r\nmaltreatment to a life-threatening degree (e.g., by denial of food or\r\nmedical care) would constitute life-threatening bodily injury.\r\n(h) ‘Physically restrained’ means the forcible restraint of the victim\r\nsuch as by being tied, bound, or locked up.\r\n(i) ‘Serious bodily injury’ means injury involving extreme physical\r\npain or the protracted impairment of a function of a bodily member,\r\norgan, or mental faculty; or requiring medical intervention such as\r\nsurgery, hospitalization, or physical rehabilitation. In addition,\r\n‘serious bodily injury’ is deemed to have occurred if the offense\r\ninvolved conduct constituting criminal sexual abuse under 18\r\nU.S.C. § 2241 or § 2242 or any similar offense under state law.\r\n(j) ‘Destructive device’ means any article described in 26 U.S.C. §\r\n5845(f) (including an explosive, incendiary, or poison gas - (i)\r\nbomb, (ii) grenade, (iii) rocket having a propellant charge of more\r\nthan four ounces, (iv) missile having an explosive or incendiary\r\ncharge of more than one-quarter ounce, (v) mine, or (vi) device\r\nsimilar to any of the devices described in the preceding clauses).\r\n(k) ‘Offense’ means the offense of conviction and all relevant conduct\r\nunder §1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct) unless a different meaning is\r\nspecified or is otherwise clear from the context. The term ‘instant’\r\nis used in connection with ‘offense,’ ‘federal offense,’ or ‘offense\r\nof conviction,’ as the case may be, to distinguish the violation for\r\nwhich the defendant is being sentenced from a prior or subsequent\r\nNovember 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II Amendment 651\r\n\r\noffense, or from an offense before another court (e.g., an offense\r\nbefore a state court involving the same underlying conduct).\",\r\nand inserting the following:\r\n\"1.

Adequacy of Criminal History Category (Policy Statement)\r\nIf reliable information indicates that the criminal history category\r\ndoes not adequately reflect the seriousness of the defendant’s past\r\ncriminal conduct or the likelihood that the defendant will commit\r\nother crimes, the court may consider imposing a sentence departing\r\nfrom the otherwise applicable guideline range. Such information\r\nmay include, but is not limited to, information concerning:\r\n(a) prior sentence(s) not used in computing the criminal\r\nhistory category (e.g., sentences for foreign and tribal\r\noffenses);\r\n(b) prior sentence(s) of substantially more than one year\r\nimposed as a result of independent crimes committed on\r\ndifferent occasions;\r\n(c) prior similar misconduct established by a civil adjudication\r\nor by a failure to comply with an administrative order;\r\n(d) whether the defendant was pending trial or sentencing on\r\nanother charge at the time of the instant offense;\r\n(e) prior similar adult criminal conduct not resulting in a\r\ncriminal conviction.\r\nA departure under this provision is warranted when the criminal\r\nhistory category significantly under-represents the seriousness of\r\nthe defendant’s criminal history or the likelihood that the defendant\r\nwill commit further crimes. Examples might include the case of a\r\ndefendant who (1) had several previous foreign sentences for\r\nserious offenses, (2) had received a prior consolidated sentence of\r\nten years for a series of serious assaults, (3) had a similar instance\r\nof large scale fraudulent misconduct established by an adjudication\r\nin a Securities and Exchange Commission enforcement proceeding,\r\n(4) committed the instant offense while on bail or pretrial release\r\nfor another serious offense, or (5) for appropriate reasons, such as\r\ncooperation in the prosecution of other defendants, had previously\r\nreceived an extremely lenient sentence for a serious offense. The\r\ncourt may, after a review of all the relevant information, conclude\r\nthat the defendant’s criminal history was significantly more serious\r\nthan that of most defendants in the same criminal history category,\r\nand therefore consider an upward departure from the guidelines.\r\nHowever, a prior arrest record itself shall not be considered under\r\n§4A1.3.\r\nThere may be cases where the court concludes that a defendant’s\r\ncriminal history category significantly over-represents the\r\nseriousness of a defendant’s criminal history or the likelihood that\r\nthe defendant will commit further crimes. An example might\r\nNovember 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II Amendment 651\r\n\r\ninclude the case of a defendant with two minor misdemeanor\r\nconvictions close to ten years prior to the instant offense and no\r\nother evidence of prior criminal behavior in the intervening period.\r\nThe court may conclude that the defendant’s criminal history was\r\nsignificantly less serious than that of most defendants in the same\r\ncriminal history category (Category II), and therefore consider a\r\ndownward departure from the guidelines.\r\nIn considering a departure under this provision, the Commission\r\nintends that the court use, as a reference, the guideline range for a\r\ndefendant with a higher or lower criminal history category, as\r\napplicable. For example, if the court concludes that the defendant’s\r\ncriminal history category of III significantly under-represents the\r\nseriousness of the defendant’s criminal history, and that the\r\nseriousness of the defendant’s criminal history most closely\r\nresembles that of most defendants with Criminal History Category\r\nIV, the court should look to the guideline range specified for a\r\ndefendant with Criminal History Category IV to guide its\r\ndeparture. The Commission contemplates that there may, on\r\noccasion, be a case of an egregious, serious criminal record in\r\nwhich even the guideline range for Criminal History Category VI\r\nis not adequate to reflect the seriousness of the defendant’s criminal\r\nhistory. In such a case, a departure above the guideline range for\r\na defendant with Criminal History Category VI may be warranted.\r\nIn determining whether an upward departure from Criminal History\r\nCategory VI is warranted, the court should consider that the nature\r\nof the prior offenses rather than simply their number is often more\r\nindicative of the seriousness of the defendant’s criminal record.\r\nFor example, a defendant with five prior sentences for very large-\r\nscale fraud offenses may have 15 criminal history points, within the\r\nrange of points typical for Criminal History Category VI, yet have\r\na substantially more serious criminal history overall because of the\r\nnature of the prior offenses. On the other hand, a defendant with\r\nnine prior 60-day jail sentences for offenses such as petty larceny,\r\nprostitution, or possession of gambling slips has a higher number\r\nof criminal history points (18 points) than the typical Criminal\r\nHistory Category VI defendant, but not necessarily a more serious\r\ncriminal history overall. Where the court determines that the extent\r\nand nature of the defendant’s criminal history, taken together, are\r\nsufficient to warrant an upward departure from Criminal History\r\nCategory VI, the court should structure the departure by moving\r\nincrementally down the sentencing table to the next higher offense\r\nlevel in Criminal History Category VI until it finds a guideline\r\nrange appropriate to the case.\r\nHowever, this provision is not symmetrical. The lower limit of the\r\nrange for Criminal History Category I is set for a first offender with\r\nthe lowest risk of recidivism. Therefore, a departure below the\r\nlower limit of the guideline range for Criminal History Category I\r\non the basis of the adequacy of criminal history cannot be\r\nAmendment 651 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003\r\n\r\nappropriate.\r\nCommentary\r\nBackground: This policy statement recognizes that the criminal history score is\r\nunlikely to take into account all the variations in the seriousness of criminal history\r\nthat may occur. For example, a defendant with an extensive record of serious,\r\nassaultive conduct who had received what might now be considered extremely\r\nlenient treatment in the past might have the same criminal history category as a\r\ndefendant who had a record of less serious conduct. Yet, the first defendant’s\r\ncriminal history clearly may be more serious. This may be particularly true in the\r\ncase of younger defendants (e.g., defendants in their early twenties or younger) who\r\nare more likely to have received repeated lenient treatment, yet who may actually\r\npose a greater risk of serious recidivism than older defendants. This policy\r\nstatement authorizes the consideration of a departure from the guidelines in the\r\nlimited circumstances where reliable information indicates that the criminal history\r\ncategory does not adequately reflect the seriousness of the defendant’s criminal\r\nhistory or likelihood of recidivism, and provides guidance for the consideration of\r\nsuch departures.\",\r\nand inserting:\r\n\"§4A1.3. Departures Based on Inadequacy of Criminal History Category\r\n(Policy Statement)\r\n(a) UPWARD DEPARTURES.—\r\n(1) STANDARD FOR UPWARD DEPARTURE.—If\r\nreliable information indicates that the defendant’s\r\ncriminal history category substantially under-\r\nrepresents the seriousness of the defendant’s\r\ncriminal history or the likelihood that the\r\ndefendant will commit other crimes, an upward\r\ndeparture may be warranted.\r\n(2) TYPES OF INFORMATION FORMING THE\r\nBASIS FOR UPWARD DEPARTURE.—The\r\ninformation described in subsection (a) may\r\ninclude information concerning the following:\r\n(A) Prior sentence(s) not used in computing\r\nthe criminal history category (e.g.,\r\nsentences for foreign and tribal offenses).\r\n(B) Prior sentence(s) of substantially more\r\nthan one year imposed as a result of\r\nindependent crimes committed on\r\ndifferent occasions.\r\n(C) Prior similar misconduct established by a\r\nNovember 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II Amendment 651\r\n\r\ncivil adjudication or by a failure to\r\ncomply with an administrative order.\r\n(D) Whether the defendant was pending trial\r\nor sentencing on another charge at the\r\ntime of the instant offense.\r\n(E) Prior similar adult criminal conduct not\r\nresulting in a criminal conviction.\r\n(3) PROHIBITION.—A prior arrest record itself shall not be\r\nconsidered for purposes of an upward departure under this\r\npolicy statement.\r\n(4) DETERMINATION OF EXTENT OF UPWARD\r\nDEPARTURE.—\r\n(A) IN GENERAL.—Except as provided in\r\nsubdivision (B), the court shall determine the\r\nextent of a departure under this subsection by\r\nusing, as a reference, the criminal history category\r\napplicable to defendants whose criminal history or\r\nlikelihood to recidivate most closely resembles\r\nthat of the defendant’s.\r\n(B) UPWARD DEPARTURES FROM CATEGORY\r\nVI.—In a case in which the court determines that\r\nthe extent and nature of the defendant’s criminal\r\nhistory, taken together, are sufficient to warrant an\r\nupward departure from Criminal History Category\r\nVI, the court should structure the departure by\r\nmoving incrementally down the sentencing table\r\nto the next higher offense level in Criminal\r\nHistory Category VI until it finds a guideline\r\nrange appropriate to the case.\r\n(b) DOWNWARD DEPARTURES.—\r\n(1) STANDARD FOR DOWNWARD DEPARTURE.—If\r\nreliable information indicates that the defendant’s criminal\r\nhistory category substantially over-represents the\r\nseriousness of the defendant’s criminal history or the\r\nlikelihood that the defendant will commit other crimes, a\r\ndownward departure may be warranted.\r\n(2) PROHIBITIONS.—\r\n(A) CRIMINAL HISTORY CATEGORY I.—A\r\ndeparture below the lower limit of the applicable\r\nguideline range for Criminal History Category I is\r\nAmendment 651 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003\r\n\r\nprohibited.\r\n(B) ARMED CAREER CRIMINAL AND REPEAT\r\nAND DANGEROUS SEX OFFENDER.—A\r\ndownward departure under this subsection is\r\nprohibited for (i) an armed career criminal within\r\nthe meaning of §4B1.4 (Armed Career Criminal);\r\nand (ii) a repeat and dangerous sex offender\r\nagainst minors within the meaning of §4B1.5\r\n(Repeat and Dangerous Sex Offender Against\r\nMinors).\r\n(3) LIMITATIONS.—\r\n(A) LIMITATION ON EXTENT OF DOWNWARD\r\nD E P A R T U R E F O R C A R E E R\r\nOFFENDER.—The extent of a downward\r\ndeparture under this subsection for a career\r\noffender within the meaning of §4B1.1 (Career\r\nOffender) may not exceed one criminal history\r\ncategory.\r\n(B) LIMITATION ON APPLICABILITY OF §5C1.2\r\nIN EVENT OF DOWNWARD DEPARTURE TO\r\nCATEGORY I.—A defendant whose criminal\r\nhistory category is Category I after receipt of a\r\ndownward departure under this subsection does\r\nnot meet the criterion of subsection (a)(1) of\r\n§5C1.2 (Limitation on Applicability of Statutory\r\nMaximum Sentences in Certain Cases) if, before\r\nreceipt of the downward departure, the defendant\r\nhad more than one criminal history point under\r\n§4A1.1 (Criminal History Category).\r\n(c) WRITTEN SPECIFICATION OF BASIS FOR DEPARTURE.—In\r\ndeparting from the otherwise applicable criminal history category\r\nunder this policy statement, the court shall specify in writing the\r\nfollowing:\r\n(1) In the case of an upward departure, the specific reasons\r\nwhy the applicable criminal history category substantially\r\nunder-represents the seriousness of the defendant’s\r\ncriminal history or the likelihood that the defendant will\r\ncommit other crimes.\r\n(2) In the case of a downward departure, the specific reasons\r\nwhy the applicable criminal history category substantially\r\nover-represents the seriousness of the defendant’s criminal\r\nhistory or the likelihood that the defendant will commit\r\nother crimes.\r\nNovember 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II Amendment 651\r\n\r\nCommentary\r\nApplication Notes:\r\n1. Definitions.—For purposes of this policy statement, the terms ‘depart’,\r\n‘departure’, ‘downward departure’, and ‘upward departure’ have the\r\nmeaning given those terms in Application Note 1 of the Commentary to\r\n§1B1.1 (Application Instructions).\r\n2. Upward Departures.—\r\n(A) Examples.—An upward departure from the defendant’s criminal\r\nhistory category may be warranted based on any of the following\r\ncircumstances:\r\n(i) A previous foreign sentence for a serious offense.\r\n(ii) Receipt of a prior consolidated sentence of ten years for a\r\nseries of serious assaults.\r\n(iii) A similar instance of large scale fraudulent misconduct\r\nestablished by an adjudication in a Securities and\r\nExchange Commission enforcement proceeding.\r\n(iv) Commission of the instant offense while on bail or pretrial\r\nrelease for another serious offense.\r\n(B) Upward Departures from Criminal History Category VI.—In the\r\ncase of an egregious, serious criminal record in which even the\r\nguideline range for Criminal History Category VI is not adequate\r\nto reflect the seriousness of the defendant’s criminal history, a\r\ndeparture above the guideline range for a defendant with Criminal\r\nHistory Category VI may be warranted. In determining whether an\r\nupward departure from Criminal History Category VI is warranted,\r\nthe court should consider that the nature of the prior offenses rather\r\nthan simply their number is often more indicative of the seriousness\r\nof the defendant’s criminal record. For example, a defendant with\r\nfive prior sentences for very large-scale fraud offenses may have 15\r\ncriminal history points, within the range of points typical for\r\nCriminal History Category VI, yet have a substantially more\r\nserious criminal history overall because of the nature of the prior\r\noffenses.\r\n3. Downward Departures.—A downward departure from the defendant’s\r\ncriminal history category may be warranted if, for example, the defendant\r\nhad two minor misdemeanor convictions close to ten years prior to the\r\ninstant offense and no other evidence of prior criminal behavior in the\r\nintervening period. A departure below the lower limit of the applicable\r\nguideline range for Criminal History Category I is prohibited under\r\nsubsection (b)(2)(B), due to the fact that the lower limit of the guideline\r\nAmendment 651 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003\r\n\r\nrange for Criminal History Category I is set for a first offender with the\r\nlowest risk of recidivism.\r\nBackground: This policy statement recognizes that the criminal history score is\r\nunlikely to take into account all the variations in the seriousness of criminal history\r\nthat may occur. For example, a defendant with an extensive record of serious,\r\nassaultive conduct who had received what might now be considered extremely\r\nlenient treatment in the past might have the same criminal history category as a\r\ndefendant who had a record of less serious conduct. Yet, the first defendant’s\r\ncriminal history clearly may be more serious. This may be particularly true in the\r\ncase of younger defendants (e.g., defendants in their early twenties or younger) who\r\nare more likely to have received repeated lenient treatment, yet who may actually\r\npose a greater risk of serious recidivism than older defendants.

Circumstances to Consider.—\r\n(A) In General.—In determining whether a departure is warranted\r\nunder this policy statement, the court shall consider the following\r\nnon-exhaustive list of circumstances:\r\n(i) The seriousness of the offense.\r\n(ii) The involvement in the offense, if any, of members of the\r\ndefendant’s family.\r\nAmendment 651 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003\r\n\r\n(iii) The danger, if any, to members of the defendant’s family\r\nas a result of the offense.\r\n(B) Departures Based on Loss of Caretaking or Financial Support.—A\r\ndeparture under this policy statement based on the loss of\r\ncaretaking or financial support of the defendant’s family requires,\r\nin addition to the court’s consideration of the non-exhaustive list of\r\ncircumstances in subdivision (A), the presence of the following\r\ncircumstances:\r\n(i) The defendant’s service of a sentence within the applicable\r\nguideline range will cause a substantial, direct, and specific\r\nloss of essential caretaking, or essential financial support,\r\nto the defendant’s family.\r\n(ii) The loss of caretaking or financial support substantially\r\nexceeds the harm ordinarily incident to incarceration for a\r\nsimilarly situated defendant. For example, the fact that the\r\ndefendant’s family might incur some degree of financial\r\nhardship or suffer to some extent from the absence of a\r\nparent through incarceration is not in itself sufficient as a\r\nbasis for departure because such hardship or suffering is of\r\na sort ordinarily incident to incarceration.\r\n(iii) The loss of caretaking or financial support is one for which\r\nno effective remedial or ameliorative programs reasonably\r\nare available, making the defendant’s caretaking or\r\nfinancial support irreplaceable to the defendant’s family.\r\n(iv) The departure effectively will address the loss of\r\ncaretaking or financial support.\",\r\nby striking:\r\n\"§5H1.7.

Grounds for Departure (Policy Statement)\r\n(a) DOWNWARD DEPARTURES IN CRIMINAL CASES\r\nOTHER THAN CHILD CRIMES AND SEXUAL\r\nOFFENSES.—Under 18 U.S.C. § 3553(b), the sentencing\r\ncourt may impose a sentence outside the range established\r\nby the applicable guidelines, if the court finds ‘that there\r\nexists an aggravating or mitigating circumstance of a kind,\r\nor to a degree, not adequately taken into consideration by\r\nthe Sentencing Commission in formulating the guidelines\r\nthat should result in a sentence different from that\r\ndescribed.’ Circumstances that may warrant departure\r\nfrom the guideline range pursuant to this provision cannot,\r\nby their very nature, be comprehensively listed and\r\nanalyzed in advance. The decision as to whether and to\r\nwhat extent departure is warranted rests with the\r\nsentencing court on a case-specific basis. Nonetheless, this\r\nsubpart seeks to aid the court by identifying some of the\r\nfactors that the Commission has not been able to take into\r\naccount fully in formulating the guidelines. Any case may\r\ninvolve factors in addition to those identified that have not\r\nbeen given adequate consideration by the Commission.\r\nPresence of any such factor may warrant departure from\r\nthe guidelines, under some circumstances, in the discretion\r\nof the sentencing court. Similarly, the court may depart\r\nfrom the guidelines, even though the reason for departure\r\nis taken into consideration in determining the guideline\r\nrange (e.g., as a specific offense characteristic or other\r\nadjustment), if the court determines that, in light of unusual\r\nAmendment 651 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003\r\n\r\ncircumstances, the weight attached to that factor under the\r\nguidelines is inadequate or excessive.\r\nWhere, for example, the applicable offense guideline and\r\nadjustments do take into consideration a factor listed in this\r\nsubpart, departure from the applicable guideline range is\r\nwarranted only if the factor is present to a degree\r\nsubstantially in excess of that which ordinarily is involved\r\nin the offense. Thus, disruption of a governmental\r\nfunction, §5K2.7, would have to be quite serious to\r\nwarrant departure from the guidelines when the applicable\r\noffense guideline is bribery or obstruction of justice.\r\nWhen the theft offense guideline is applicable, however,\r\nand the theft caused disruption of a governmental function,\r\ndeparture from the applicable guideline range more readily\r\nwould be appropriate. Similarly, physical injury would not\r\nwarrant departure from the guidelines when the robbery\r\noffense guideline is applicable because the robbery\r\nguideline includes a specific adjustment based on the\r\nextent of any injury. However, because the robbery\r\nguideline does not deal with injury to more than one\r\nvictim, departure would be warranted if several persons\r\nwere injured.\r\nAlso, a factor may be listed as a specific offense\r\ncharacteristic under one guideline but not under all\r\nguidelines. Simply because it was not listed does not mean\r\nthat there may not be circumstances when that factor\r\nwould be relevant to sentencing. For example, the use of\r\na weapon has been listed as a specific offense\r\ncharacteristic under many guidelines, but not under other\r\nguidelines. Therefore, if a weapon is a relevant factor to\r\nsentencing under one of these other guidelines, the court\r\nmay depart for this reason.\r\nFinally, an offender characteristic or other circumstance\r\nthat is, in the Commission’s view, ‘not ordinarily relevant’\r\nin determining whether a sentence should be outside the\r\napplicable guideline range may be relevant to this\r\ndetermination if such characteristic or circumstance is\r\npresent to an unusual degree and distinguishes the case\r\nfrom the ‘heartland’ cases covered by the guidelines.\r\n(b) DOWNWARD DEPARTURES IN CHILD CRIMES\r\nAND SEXUAL OFFENSES.—Under 18 U.S.C. §\r\n3553(b)(2), the sentencing court may impose a sentence\r\nbelow the range established by the applicable guidelines\r\nonly if the court finds that there exists a mitigating\r\ncircumstance of a kind, or to a degree, that—\r\nNovember 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II Amendment 651\r\n\r\n(1) has been affirmatively and specifically identified\r\nas a permissible ground of downward departure in\r\nthe sentencing guidelines or policy statements\r\nissued under section 994(a) of title 28, United\r\nStates Code, taking account of any amendments to\r\nsuch sentencing guidelines or policy statements by\r\nact of Congress;\r\n(2) has not adequately been taken into consideration\r\nby the Sentencing Commission in formulating the\r\nguidelines; and\r\n(3) should result in a sentence different from that\r\ndescribed.\r\nThe grounds enumerated in this Part K of Chapter Five are\r\nthe sole grounds that have been affirmatively and\r\nspecifically identified as a permissible ground of\r\ndownward departure in these sentencing guidelines and\r\npolicy statements. Thus, notwithstanding any other\r\nreference to authority to depart downward elsewhere in\r\nthis Sentencing Manual, a ground of downward departure\r\nhas not been affirmatively and specifically identified as a\r\npermissible ground of downward departure within the\r\nmeaning of section 3553(b)(2) unless it is expressly\r\nenumerated in this Part K as a ground upon which a\r\ndownward departure may be granted.\r\nCommentary*\r\n[*Section 401(m)(2)(C) of Public Law 108–21 directs the Commission to revise\r\n§5K2.0, within 180 days after the date of the enactment of that Public Law, or\r\nOctober 27, 2003, to conform §5K2.0 to changes made by that Public Law,\r\nincluding changes to the appellate standard of review for decisions to depart from\r\nthe guidelines. That directive has not been implemented yet in the following\r\ncommentary.]\r\nThe United States Supreme Court has determined that, in reviewing a\r\ndistrict court’s decision to depart from the guidelines, appellate courts are to apply\r\nan abuse of discretion standard, because the decision to depart embodies the\r\ntraditional exercise of discretion by the sentencing court. Koon v. United States, 518\r\nU.S. 81 (1996). Furthermore,‘[b]efore a departure is permitted, certain aspects of\r\nthe case must be found unusual enough for it to fall outside the heartland of cases\r\nin the Guideline. To resolve this question, the district court must make a refined\r\nassessment of the many facts bearing on the outcome, informed by its vantage point\r\nand day-to-day experience in criminal sentencing. Whether a given factor is present\r\nto a degree not adequately considered by the Commission, or whether a discouraged\r\nfactor nonetheless justifies departure because it is present in some unusual or\r\nexceptional way, are matters determined in large part by comparison with the facts\r\nof other Guidelines cases. District Courts have an institutional advantage over\r\nAmendment 651 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003\r\n\r\nappellate courts in making these sorts of determinations, especially as they see so\r\nmany more Guidelines cases than appellate courts do.’ Id. at 98.\r\nThe last paragraph of subsection (a) sets forth the conditions under which\r\nan offender characteristic or other circumstance that is not ordinarily relevant to a\r\ndeparture from the applicable guideline range may be relevant to this determination.\r\nThe Commission does not foreclose the possibility of an extraordinary case that,\r\nbecause of a combination of such characteristics or circumstances, differs\r\nsignificantly from the \"heartland\" cases covered by the guidelines in a way that is\r\nimportant to the statutory purposes of sentencing, even though none of the\r\ncharacteristics or circumstances individually distinguishes the case. However, the\r\nCommission believes that such cases will be extremely rare.\r\nIn the absence of a characteristic or circumstance that distinguishes a case\r\nas sufficiently atypical to warrant a sentence different from that called for under the\r\nguidelines, a sentence outside the guideline range is not authorized. See 18 U.S.C.\r\n§ 3553(b). For example, dissatisfaction with the available sentencing range or a\r\npreference for a different sentence than that authorized by the guidelines is not an\r\nappropriate basis for a sentence outside the applicable guideline range.\r\nSection 401(b)(1) of Public Law 108–21 directly amended this policy\r\nstatement to add subsection (b), effective April 30, 2003.\",\r\nand inserting:\r\n\"§5K2.0.

If any such circumstance is\r\npresent in the case and has not adequately\r\nbeen taken into consideration in\r\ndetermining the applicable guideline\r\nrange, a departure consistent with 18\r\nU.S.C. § 3553(b) and the provisions of\r\nthis subpart may be warranted.\r\n(B) U N I D E N T I F I E D\r\nCIRCUMSTANCES.—A departure may\r\nbe warranted in the exceptional case in\r\nwhich there is present a circumstance that\r\nthe Commission has not identified in the\r\nguidelines but that nevertheless is relevant\r\nto determining the appropriate sentence.\r\n(3) DEPARTURES BASED ON CIRCUMSTANCES\r\nPRESENT TO A DEGREE NOT ADEQUATELY\r\nTAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION.—A departure\r\nmay be warranted in an exceptional case, even\r\nthough the circumstance that forms the basis for\r\nthe departure is taken into consideration in\r\ndetermining the guideline range, if the court\r\ndetermines that such circumstance is present in the\r\noffense to a degree substantially in excess of, or\r\nsubstantially below, that which ordinarily is\r\ninvolved in that kind of offense.\r\n(4) DEPARTURES BASED ON NOT\r\nORDINARILY RELEVANT OFFENDER\r\nCHARACTERISTICS AND OTHER\r\nCIRCUMSTANCES.—An offender characteristic\r\nor other circumstance identified in Chapter Five,\r\nPart H (Offender Characteristics) or elsewhere in\r\nAmendment 651 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003\r\n\r\nthe guidelines as not ordinarily relevant in\r\ndetermining whether a departure is warranted may\r\nbe relevant to this determination only if such\r\noffender characteristic or other circumstance is\r\npresent to an exceptional degree.\r\n(b) DOWNWARD DEPARTURES IN CHILD CRIMES\r\nAND SEXUAL OFFENSES.—Under 18 U.S.C. §\r\n3553(b)(2)(A)(ii), the sentencing court may impose a\r\nsentence below the range established by the applicable\r\nguidelines only if the court finds that there exists a\r\nmitigating circumstance of a kind, or to a degree, that—\r\n(1) has been affirmatively and specifically identified\r\nas a permissible ground of downward departure in\r\nthe sentencing guidelines or policy statements\r\nissued under section 994(a) of title 28, United\r\nStates Code, taking account of any amendments to\r\nsuch sentencing guidelines or policy statements by\r\nact of Congress;\r\n(2) has not adequately been taken into consideration\r\nby the Sentencing Commission in formulating the\r\nguidelines; and\r\n(3) should result in a sentence different from that\r\ndescribed.\r\nThe grounds enumerated in this Part K of Chapter Five are\r\nthe sole grounds that have been affirmatively and\r\nspecifically identified as a permissible ground of\r\ndownward departure in these sentencing guidelines and\r\npolicy statements.

See 18 U.S.C. § 3553(b).\r\nSubsection (a) of this policy statement applies to upward departures\r\nin all cases covered by the guidelines and to downward departures\r\nin all such cases except for downward departures in child crimes\r\nand sexual offenses.\r\nSubsection (b) of this policy statement applies only to downward\r\ndepartures in child crimes and sexual offenses.\r\n(B) Departures Covered by Other Guidelines.—This policy statement\r\nNovember 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II Amendment 651\r\n\r\ndoes not cover the following departures, which are addressed\r\nelsewhere in the guidelines: (i) departures based on the defendant’s\r\ncriminal history (see Chapter Four (Criminal History and Criminal\r\nLivelihood), particularly §4A1.3 (Departures Based on Inadequacy\r\nof Criminal History Category)); (ii) departures based on the\r\ndefendant’s substantial assistance to the authorities (see §5K1.1\r\n(Substantial Assistance to Authorities)); and (iii) departures based\r\non early disposition programs (see §5K3.1 (Early Disposition\r\nPrograms)).\r\n3. Kinds and Expected Frequency of Departures under Subsection (a).—As set\r\nforth in subsection (a), there generally are two kinds of departures from the\r\nguidelines based on offense characteristics and/or offender characteristics:\r\n(A) departures based on circumstances of a kind not adequately taken into\r\nconsideration in the guidelines; and (B) departures based on circumstances\r\nthat are present to a degree not adequately taken into consideration in the\r\nguidelines.\r\n(A) Departures Based on Circumstances of a Kind Not Adequately\r\nTaken into Account in Guidelines.—Subsection (a)(2) authorizes\r\nthe court to depart if there exists an aggravating or a mitigating\r\ncircumstance in a case under 18 U.S.C. § 3553(b)(1), or an\r\naggravating circumstance in a case under 18 U.S.C. §\r\n3553(b)(2)(A)(i), of a kind not adequately taken into consideration\r\nin the guidelines.\r\n(i) Identified Circumstances.—This subpart (Chapter Five,\r\nPart K, Subpart 2) identifies several circumstances that the\r\nCommission may have not adequately taken into\r\nconsideration in setting the offense level for certain cases.\r\nOffense guidelines in Chapter Two (Offense Conduct) and\r\nadjustments in Chapter Three (Adjustments) sometimes\r\nidentify circumstances the Commission may have not\r\nadequately taken into consideration in setting the offense\r\nlevel for offenses covered by those guidelines. If the\r\noffense guideline in Chapter Two or an adjustment in\r\nChapter Three does not adequately take that circumstance\r\ninto consideration in setting the offense level for the\r\noffense, and only to the extent not adequately taken into\r\nconsideration, a departure based on that circumstance may\r\nbe warranted.\r\n(ii) Unidentified Circumstances.—A case may involve\r\ncircumstances, in addition to those identified by the\r\nguidelines, that have not adequately been taken into\r\nconsideration by the Commission, and the presence of any\r\nsuch circumstance may warrant departure from the\r\nguidelines in that case. However, inasmuch as the\r\nCommission has continued to monitor and refine the\r\nguidelines since their inception to take into consideration\r\nAmendment 651 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003\r\n\r\nrelevant circumstances in sentencing, it is expected that\r\ndepartures based on such unidentified circumstances will\r\noccur rarely and only in exceptional cases.\r\n(B) Departures Based on Circumstances Present to a Degree Not\r\nAdequately Taken into Consideration in Guidelines.—\r\n(i) In General.—Subsection (a)(3) authorizes the court to\r\ndepart if there exists an aggravating or a mitigating\r\ncircumstance in a case under 18 U.S.C. § 3553(b)(1), or an\r\naggravating circumstance in a case under 18 U.S.C. §\r\n3553(b)(2)(A)(i), to a degree not adequately taken into\r\nconsideration in the guidelines. However, inasmuch as the\r\nCommission has continued to monitor and refine the\r\nguidelines since their inception to determine the most\r\nappropriate weight to be accorded the mitigating and\r\naggravating circumstances specified in the guidelines, it is\r\nexpected that departures based on the weight accorded to\r\nany such circumstance will occur rarely and only in\r\nexceptional cases.\r\n(ii) Examples.—As set forth in subsection (a)(3), if the\r\napplicable offense guideline and adjustments take into\r\nconsideration a circumstance identified in this subpart,\r\ndeparture is warranted only if the circumstance is present\r\nto a degree substantially in excess of that which ordinarily\r\nis involved in the offense. Accordingly, a departure\r\npursuant to §5K2.7 for the disruption of a governmental\r\nfunction would have to be substantial to warrant departure\r\nfrom the guidelines when the applicable offense guideline\r\nis bribery or obstruction of justice. When the guideline\r\ncovering the mailing of injurious articles is applicable,\r\nhowever, and the offense caused disruption of a\r\ngovernmental function, departure from the applicable\r\nguideline range more readily would be appropriate.\r\nSimilarly, physical injury would not warrant departure\r\nfrom the guidelines when the robbery offense guideline is\r\napplicable because the robbery guideline includes a\r\nspecific adjustment based on the extent of any injury.\r\nHowever, because the robbery guideline does not deal with\r\ninjury to more than one victim, departure may be\r\nwarranted if several persons were injured.\r\n(C) Departures Based on Circumstances Identified as Not Ordinarily\r\nRelevant.—Because certain circumstances are specified in the\r\nguidelines as not ordinarily relevant to sentencing (see, e.g.,\r\nChapter Five, Part H (Specific Offender Characteristics)), a\r\ndeparture based on any one of such circumstances should occur\r\nonly in exceptional cases, and only if the circumstance is present in\r\nthe case to an exceptional degree. If two or more of such\r\nNovember 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II Amendment 651\r\n\r\ncircumstances each is present in the case to a substantial degree,\r\nhowever, and taken together make the case an exceptional one, the\r\ncourt may consider whether a departure would be warranted\r\npursuant to subsection (c). Departures based on a combination of\r\nnot ordinarily relevant circumstances that are present to a\r\nsubstantial degree should occur extremely rarely and only in\r\nexceptional cases.\r\nIn addition, as required by subsection (e), each circumstance\r\nforming the basis for a departure described in this subdivision shall\r\nbe stated with specificity in the written judgment and commitment\r\norder.\r\n4. Downward Departures in Child Crimes and Sexual Offenses.—\r\n(A) Definition.—For purposes of this policy statement, the term ‘child\r\ncrimes and sexual offenses’ means offenses under any of the\r\nfollowing: 18 U.S.C. § 1201 (involving a minor victim), 18 U.S.C.\r\n§ 1591, or chapter 71, 109A, 110, or 117 of title 18, United States\r\nCode.\r\n(B) Standard for Departure.—\r\n(i) Requirement of Affirmative and Specific Identification of\r\nDeparture Ground.—The standard for a downward\r\ndeparture in child crimes and sexual offenses differs from\r\nthe standard for other departures under this policy\r\nstatement in that it includes a requirement, set forth in 18\r\nU.S.C. § 3553(b)(2)(A)(ii)(I) and subsection (b)(1) of this\r\nguideline, that any mitigating circumstance that forms the\r\nbasis for such a downward departure be affirmatively and\r\nspecifically identified as a ground for downward departure\r\nin this part (i.e., Chapter Five, Part K).\r\n(ii) Application of Subsection (b)(2).—The commentary in\r\nApplication Note 3 of this policy statement, except for the\r\ncommentary in Application Note 3(A)(ii) relating to\r\nunidentified circumstances, shall apply to the court’s\r\ndetermination of whether a case meets the requirement, set\r\nforth in subsection 18 U.S.C. § 3553(b)(2)(A)(ii)(II) and\r\nsubsection (b)(2) of this policy statement, that the\r\nmitigating circumstance forming the basis for a downward\r\ndeparture in child crimes and sexual offenses be of kind, or\r\nto a degree, not adequately taken into consideration by the\r\nCommission.\r\n5. Departures Based on Plea Agreements.—Subsection (d)(4) prohibits a\r\ndownward departure based only on the defendant’s decision, in and of\r\nitself, to plead guilty to the offense or to enter a plea agreement with respect\r\nto the offense. Even though a departure may not be based merely on the\r\nAmendment 651 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003\r\n\r\nfact that the defendant agreed to plead guilty or enter a plea agreement, a\r\ndeparture may be based on justifiable, non-prohibited reasons for departure\r\nas part of a sentence that is recommended, or agreed to, in the plea\r\nagreement and accepted by the court. See §6B1.2 (Standards for\r\nAcceptance of Plea Agreements). In cases in which the court departs based\r\non such reasons as set forth in the plea agreement, the court must state the\r\nreasons for departure with specificity in the written judgment and\r\ncommitment order, as required by subsection (e).\r\nBackground: This policy statement sets forth the standards for departing from the\r\napplicable guideline range based on offense and offender characteristics of a kind,\r\nor to a degree, not adequately considered by the Commission. Circumstances the\r\nCommission has determined are not ordinarily relevant to determining whether a\r\ndeparture is warranted or are prohibited as bases for departure are addressed in\r\nChapter Five, Part H (Offender Characteristics) and in this policy statement. Other\r\ndepartures, such as those based on the defendant’s criminal history, the defendant’s\r\nsubstantial assistance to authorities, and early disposition programs, are addressed\r\nelsewhere in the guidelines.\r\nAs acknowledged by Congress in the Sentencing Reform Act and by the\r\nCommission when the first set of guidelines was promulgated, ‘it is difficult to\r\nprescribe a single set of guidelines that encompasses the vast range of human\r\nconduct potentially relevant to a sentencing decision.’ (See Historical Note to\r\n§1A1.1 (Authority)). Departures, therefore, perform an integral function in the\r\nsentencing guideline system. Departures permit courts to impose an appropriate\r\nsentence in the exceptional case in which mechanical application of the guidelines\r\nwould fail to achieve the statutory purposes and goals of sentencing. Departures\r\nalso help maintain ‘sufficient flexibility to permit individualized sentences when\r\nwarranted by mitigating or aggravating factors not taken into account in the\r\nestablishment of general sentencing practices.’ 28 U.S.C. § 991(b)(1)(B). By\r\nmonitoring when courts depart from the guidelines and by analyzing their stated\r\nreasons for doing so, along with appellate cases reviewing these departures, the\r\nCommission can further refine the guidelines to specify more precisely when\r\ndepartures should and should not be permitted.\r\nAs reaffirmed in the Prosecutorial Remedies and Other Tools to end the\r\nExploitation of Children Today Act of 2003 (the ‘PROTECT Act’, Public Law\r\n108–21), circumstances warranting departure should be rare. Departures were never\r\nintended to permit sentencing courts to substitute their policy judgments for those\r\nof Congress and the Sentencing Commission. Departure in such circumstances\r\nwould produce unwarranted sentencing disparity, which the Sentencing Reform Act\r\nwas designed to avoid.\r\nIn order for appellate courts to fulfill their statutory duties under 18 U.S.C.\r\n§ 3742 and for the Commission to fulfill its ongoing responsibility to refine the\r\nguidelines in light of information it receives on departures, it is essential that\r\nsentencing courts state with specificity the reasons for departure, as required by the\r\nPROTECT Act.\r\nThis policy statement, including its commentary, was substantially revised,\r\nNovember 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II Amendment 651\r\n\r\neffective October 27, 2003, in response to directives contained in the PROTECT\r\nAct, particularly the directive in section 401(m) of that Act to—\r\n‘(1) review the grounds of downward departure that are authorized by the\r\nsentencing guidelines, policy statements, and official commentary of the Sentencing\r\nCommission; and\r\n(2) promulgate, pursuant to section 994 of title 28, United States Code—\r\n(A) appropriate amendments to the sentencing guidelines, policy\r\nstatements, and official commentary to ensure that the incidence of\r\ndownward departures is substantially reduced;\r\n(B) a policy statement authorizing a departure pursuant to an early\r\ndisposition program; and\r\n(C) any other conforming amendments to the sentencing guidelines,\r\npolicy statements, and official commentary of the Sentencing\r\nCommission necessitated by the Act, including a revision of\r\n...section 5K2.0’.\r\nThe substantial revision of this policy statement in response to the\r\nPROTECT Act was intended to refine the standards applicable to departures while\r\ngiving due regard for concepts, such as the ‘heartland’, that have evolved in\r\ndeparture jurisprudence over time.\r\nSection 401(b)(1) of the PROTECT Act directly amended this policy\r\nstatement to add subsection (b), effective April 30, 2003.\";\r\nby striking:\r\n\"§5K2.10. Victim’s Conduct (Policy Statement)\r\nIf the victim’s wrongful conduct contributed significantly to\r\nprovoking the offense behavior, the court may reduce the sentence\r\nbelow the guideline range to reflect the nature and circumstances\r\nof the offense. In deciding the extent of a sentence reduction, the\r\ncourt should consider:\r\n(a) the size and strength of the victim, or other relevant\r\nphysical characteristics, in comparison with those of the\r\ndefendant;\r\n(b) the persistence of the victim’s conduct and any efforts by\r\nthe defendant to prevent confrontation;\r\n(c) the danger reasonably perceived by the defendant,\r\nincluding the victim’s reputation for violence;\r\n(d) the danger actually presented to the defendant by the\r\nvictim; and\r\n(e) any other relevant conduct by the victim that substantially\r\ncontributed to the danger presented.\r\nAmendment 651 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003\r\n\r\nVictim misconduct ordinarily would not be sufficient to warrant\r\napplication of this provision in the context of offenses under\r\nChapter Two, Part A.3 (Criminal Sexual Abuse). In addition, this\r\nprovision usually would not be relevant in the context of non-\r\nviolent offenses. There may, however, be unusual circumstances\r\nin which substantial victim misconduct would warrant a reduced\r\npenalty in the case of a non-violent offense. For example, an\r\nextended course of provocation and harassment might lead a\r\ndefendant to steal or destroy property in retaliation.\",\r\nand inserting:\r\n\"§5K2.10. Victim’s Conduct (Policy Statement)\r\nIf the victim’s wrongful conduct contributed significantly to\r\nprovoking the offense behavior, the court may reduce the sentence\r\nbelow the guideline range to reflect the nature and circumstances\r\nof the offense. In deciding whether a sentence reduction is\r\nwarranted, and the extent of such reduction, the court should\r\nconsider the following:\r\n(1) The size and strength of the victim, or other relevant\r\nphysical characteristics, in comparison with those of the\r\ndefendant.\r\n(2) The persistence of the victim’s conduct and any efforts by\r\nthe defendant to prevent confrontation.\r\n(3) The danger reasonably perceived by the defendant,\r\nincluding the victim’s reputation for violence.\r\n(4) The danger actually presented to the defendant by the\r\nvictim.\r\n(5) Any other relevant conduct by the victim that substantially\r\ncontributed to the danger presented.\r\n(6) The proportionality and reasonableness of the defendant’s\r\nresponse to the victim’s provocation.\r\nVictim misconduct ordinarily would not be sufficient to warrant\r\napplication of this provision in the context of offenses under\r\nChapter Two, Part A, Subpart 3 (Criminal Sexual Abuse). In\r\naddition, this provision usually would not be relevant in the context\r\nof non-violent offenses. There may, however, be unusual\r\ncircumstances in which substantial victim misconduct would\r\nwarrant a reduced penalty in the case of a non-violent offense. For\r\nexample, an extended course of provocation and harassment might\r\nlead a defendant to steal or destroy property in retaliation.\";\r\nNovember 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II Amendment 651\r\n\r\nby striking:\r\n\"§5K2.12. Coercion and Duress (Policy Statement)\r\nIf the defendant committed the offense because of serious coercion,\r\nblackmail or duress, under circumstances not amounting to a\r\ncomplete defense, the court may decrease the sentence below the\r\napplicable guideline range. The extent of the decrease ordinarily\r\nshould depend on the reasonableness of the defendant’s actions and\r\non the extent to which the conduct would have been less harmful\r\nunder the circumstances as the defendant believed them to be.\r\nOrdinarily coercion will be sufficiently serious to warrant departure\r\nonly when it involves a threat of physical injury, substantial\r\ndamage to property or similar injury resulting from the unlawful\r\naction of a third party or from a natural emergency. The\r\nCommission considered the relevance of economic hardship and\r\ndetermined that personal financial difficulties and economic\r\npressures upon a trade or business do not warrant a decrease in\r\nsentence.\",\r\nand inserting:\r\n\"§5K2.12. Coercion and Duress (Policy Statement)\r\nIf the defendant committed the offense because of serious coercion,\r\nblackmail or duress, under circumstances not amounting to a\r\ncomplete defense, the court may decrease the sentence below the\r\napplicable guideline range. The extent of the decrease ordinarily\r\nshould depend on the reasonableness of the defendant’s actions, on\r\nthe proportionality of the defendant’s actions to the seriousness of\r\ncoercion, blackmail, or duress involved, and on the extent to which\r\nthe conduct would have been less harmful under the circumstances\r\nas the defendant believed them to be. Ordinarily coercion will be\r\nsufficiently serious to warrant departure only when it involves a\r\nthreat of physical injury, substantial damage to property or similar\r\ninjury resulting from the unlawful action of a third party or from a\r\nnatural emergency. Notwithstanding this policy statement,\r\npersonal financial difficulties and economic pressures upon a trade\r\nor business do not warrant a downward departure.\";\r\nby striking:\r\n\"§5K2.13. Diminished Capacity (Policy Statement)\r\nA sentence below the applicable guideline range may be warranted\r\nif the defendant committed the offense while suffering from a\r\nsignificantly reduced mental capacity. However, the court may not\r\ndepart below the applicable guideline range if (1) the significantly\r\nreduced mental capacity was caused by the voluntary use of drugs\r\nor other intoxicants; (2) the facts and circumstances of the\r\nAmendment 651 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003\r\n\r\ndefendant’s offense indicate a need to protect the public because\r\nthe offense involved actual violence or a serious threat of violence;\r\n(3) the defendant’s criminal history indicates a need to incarcerate\r\nthe defendant to protect the public; or (4) the defendant has been\r\nconvicted of an offense under chapter 71, 109A, 110, or 117, of\r\ntitle 18, United States Code. If a departure is warranted, the extent\r\nof the departure should reflect the extent to which the reduced\r\nmental capacity contributed to the commission of the offense.\r\nCommentary\r\nApplication Note:\r\n1. For purposes of this policy statement—\r\n\"Significantly reduced mental capacity\" means the defendant, although convicted,\r\nhas a significantly impaired ability to (A) understand the wrongfulness of the\r\nbehavior comprising the offense or to exercise the power of reason; or (B) control\r\nbehavior that the defendant knows is wrongful.\r\nBackground: Section 401(b)(5) of Public Law 108–21 directly amended this policy\r\nstatement to add subdivision (4), effective April 30, 2003.\",\r\nand inserting:\r\n\"§5K2.13. Diminished Capacity (Policy Statement)\r\nA sentence below the applicable guideline range may be warranted\r\nif (1) the defendant committed the offense while suffering from a\r\nsignificantly reduced mental capacity; and (2) the significantly\r\nreduced mental capacity contributed substantially to the\r\ncommission of the offense. Similarly, if a departure is warranted\r\nunder this policy statement, the extent of the departure should\r\nreflect the extent to which the reduced mental capacity contributed\r\nto the commission of the offense.\r\nHowever, the court may not depart below the applicable guideline\r\nrange if (1) the significantly reduced mental capacity was caused\r\nby the voluntary use of drugs or other intoxicants; (2) the facts and\r\ncircumstances of the defendant’s offense indicate a need to protect\r\nthe public because the offense involved actual violence or a serious\r\nthreat of violence; (3) the defendant’s criminal history indicates a\r\nneed to incarcerate the defendant to protect the public; or (4) the\r\ndefendant has been convicted of an offense under chapter 71,\r\n109A, 110, or 117, of title 18, United States Code.\r\nCommentary\r\nApplication Note:\r\nNovember 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II Amendment 651\r\n\r\n1. For purposes of this policy statement—\r\n‘Significantly reduced mental capacity’ means the defendant, although\r\nconvicted, has a significantly impaired ability to (A) understand the\r\nwrongfulness of the behavior comprising the offense or to exercise the\r\npower of reason; or (B) control behavior that the defendant knows is\r\nwrongful.\r\nBackground: Section 401(b)(5) of Public Law 108–21 directly amended this policy\r\nstatement to add subdivision (4), effective April 30, 2003.\";\r\nand by striking:\r\n\"§5K2.20.

However, the court may not\r\ndepart below the guideline range on this basis if (1) the offense\r\ninvolved serious bodily injury or death; (2) the defendant\r\ndischarged a firearm or otherwise used a firearm or a dangerous\r\nweapon; (3) the instant offense of conviction is a serious drug\r\ntrafficking offense; (4) the defendant has more than one criminal\r\nhistory point, as determined under Chapter Four (Criminal History\r\nand Criminal Livelihood); or (5) the defendant has a prior federal,\r\nor state, felony conviction, regardless of whether the conviction is\r\ncountable under Chapter Four.\r\nCommentary\r\nApplication Notes:\r\n1. For purposes of this policy statement—\r\n‘Aberrant behavior’ means a single criminal occurrence or single criminal\r\ntransaction that (A) was committed without significant planning; (B) was\r\nof limited duration; and (C) represents a marked deviation by the defendant\r\nfrom an otherwise law-abiding life.\r\n‘Dangerous weapon,’ ‘firearm,’ ‘otherwise used,’ and ‘serious bodily\r\ninjury’ have the meaning given those terms in the Commentary to §1B1.1\r\n(Application Instructions).\r\n‘Serious drug trafficking offense’ means any controlled substance offense\r\nunder title 21, United States Code, other than simple possession under 21\r\nU.S.C. § 844, that, because the defendant does not meet the criteria under\r\n§5C1.2 (Limitation on Applicability of Statutory Mandatory Minimum\r\nAmendment 651 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003\r\n\r\nSentences in Certain Cases), results in the imposition of a mandatory\r\nminimum term of imprisonment upon the defendant.\r\n2. In determining whether the court should depart on the basis of aberrant\r\nbehavior, the court may consider the defendant’s (A) mental and emotional\r\nconditions; (B) employment record; (C) record of prior good works; (D)\r\nmotivation for committing the offense; and (E) efforts to mitigate the effects\r\nof the offense.\r\nBackground: Section 401(b)(3) of Public Law 108–21 directly amended this policy\r\nstatement, effective April 30, 2003.\",\r\nand inserting:\r\n\"§5K2.20. Aberrant Behavior (Policy Statement)\r\n(a) IN GENERAL.—Except where a defendant is convicted of\r\nan offense involving a minor victim under section 1201, an\r\noffense under section 1591, or an offense under chapter 71,\r\n109A, 110, or 117, of title 18, United States Code, a\r\ndownward departure may be warranted in an exceptional\r\ncase if (1) the defendant’s criminal conduct meets the\r\nrequirements of subsection (b); and (2) the departure is not\r\nprohibited under subsection (c).\r\n(b) REQUIREMENTS.—The court may depart downward\r\nunder this policy statement only if the defendant\r\ncommitted a single criminal occurrence or single criminal\r\ntransaction that (1) was committed without significant\r\nplanning; (2) was of limited duration; and (3) represents a\r\nmarked deviation by the defendant from an otherwise law-\r\nabiding life.\r\n(c) PROHIBITIONS BASED ON THE PRESENCE OF\r\nCERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES.—The court may not\r\ndepart downward pursuant to this policy statement if any\r\nof the following circumstances are present:\r\n(1) The offense involved serious bodily injury or\r\ndeath.\r\n(2) The defendant discharged a firearm or otherwise\r\nused a firearm or a dangerous weapon.\r\n(3) The instant offense of conviction is a serious drug\r\ntrafficking offense.\r\n(4) The defendant has either of the following: (A)\r\nmore than one criminal history point, as\r\ndetermined under Chapter Four (Criminal History\r\nNovember 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II Amendment 651\r\n\r\nand Criminal Livelihood) before application of\r\nsubsection (b) of §4A1.3 (Departures Based on\r\nInadequacy of Criminal History Category); or (B)\r\na prior federal or state felony conviction, or any\r\nother significant prior criminal behavior,\r\nregardless of whether the conviction or significant\r\nprior criminal behavior is countable under Chapter\r\nFour.\r\nCommentary\r\nApplication Notes:\r\n1. Definitions.—For purposes of this policy statement:\r\n‘Dangerous weapon,’ ‘firearm,’ ‘otherwise used,’ and ‘serious bodily\r\ninjury’ have the meaning given those terms in the Commentary to §1B1.1\r\n(Application Instructions).\r\n‘Serious drug trafficking offense’ means any controlled substance offense\r\nunder title 21, United States Code, other than simple possession under 21\r\nU.S.C. § 844, that provides for a mandatory minimum term of\r\nimprisonment of five years or greater, regardless of whether the defendant\r\nmeets the criteria of §5C1.2 (Limitation on Applicability of Statutory\r\nMandatory Minimum Sentences in Certain Cases).\r\n2. Repetitious or Significant, Planned Behavior.—Repetitious or significant,\r\nplanned behavior does not meet the requirements of subsection (b). For\r\nexample, a fraud scheme generally would not meet such requirements\r\nbecause such a scheme usually involves repetitive acts, rather than a single\r\noccurrence or single criminal transaction, and significant planning.\r\n3. Other Circumstances to Consider.—In determining whether the court\r\nshould depart under this policy statement, the court may consider the\r\ndefendant’s (A) mental and emotional conditions; (B) employment record;\r\n(C) record of prior good works; (D) motivation for committing the offense;\r\nand (E) efforts to mitigate the effects of the offense.\r\nBackground: Section 401(b)(3) of Public Law 108–21 directly amended subsection\r\n(a) of this policy statement, effective April 30, 2003.\".\r\nChapter 5, Part K, is amended by adding at the end the following:\r\n\"3.

L. 108–21. The PROTECT Act was enacted on April 30, 2003, and\r\ndirects the Commission, not later than 180 days after the enactment of the Act, to\r\npromulgate: (1) appropriate amendments to the sentencing guidelines, policy statements, and\r\nNovember 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II Amendment 651\r\n\r\nofficial commentary to ensure that the incidence of downward departures is substantially\r\nreduced; (2) a policy statement authorizing a downward departure of not more than 4 levels\r\nif the Government files a motion for such departure pursuant to an early disposition program\r\nauthorized by the Attorney General and the United States Attorney for the district in which\r\nthe court resides; (3) any other necessary conforming amendments, including a revision of\r\nparagraph 4(b) of Part A of Chapter One and a revision of §5K2.0 (Grounds for Departure).\r\nThe analysis underlying this amendment will be set forth more fully in a forthcoming report\r\nto Congress.\r\nThe Commission anticipates that this amendment will substantially reduce the incidence of\r\ndownward departures by prohibiting several factors as grounds for departure, restricting the\r\navailability of certain departures, clarifying when certain departures are appropriate, and\r\nlimiting the extent of departure permissible for certain offenders. The amendment also\r\nreduces the incidence of downward departures generally by restructuring departure\r\nprovisions throughout the Guidelines Manual to track more closely both the statutory criteria\r\nfor imposing a sentence outside the guideline sentencing range and the newly enacted\r\nstatutory requirement that reasons for departure be stated with specificity in the written order\r\nof judgment and commitment. See 18 U.S.C. §§ 3553 (Imposition of a sentence), 3742(e)\r\n(Review of a sentence). The Commission determined that requiring sentencing courts to\r\ndocument reasons for departure with greater specificity complements the findings required\r\nof sentencing courts by the PROTECT Act, increases the accountability of sentencing courts\r\nfor departures by facilitating appellate review, and improves the Commission’s ability to\r\nmonitor departure decisions and refine the guidelines as necessary.\r\nThe eight-part amendment makes modifications to §§5K2.0 (Grounds for Departure), 5H1.4\r\n(Physical Condition, Including Drug or Alcohol Dependence or Abuse; Gambling\r\nAddiction), 5H1.6 (Family Ties and Responsibilities), 5H1.7 (Role in the Offense), 5H1.8\r\n(Criminal History), 5K2.10 (Victim’s Conduct), 5K2.12 (Coercion and Duress), 5K2.13\r\n(Diminished Capacity), 5K2.20 (Aberrant Behavior), 4A1.3 (Departures Based on\r\nInadequacy of Criminal History Category), and 6B1.2 (Standards for Acceptance of Plea\r\nAgreements). The amendment also creates one new policy statement, §5K3.1 (Early\r\nDisposition Programs), and one new guideline, §1A1.1 (Authority), among other changes.\r\nFirst, this amendment makes several significant modifications to §5K2.0 (Grounds for\r\nDeparture) to limit, and in certain circumstances, to prohibit downward departures. The\r\namendment generally restructures §5K2.0 to set forth more clearly the standards governing\r\ndepartures in order to facilitate and emphasize the analysis required of the court. The\r\namendment does so by: (1) integrating throughout the policy statement the statutory\r\nlanguage of 18 U.S.C. §§ 3553(b) and 3742(e), as amended by the PROTECT Act, which\r\nprovide the statutory criteria for sentencing outside the guideline range; (2) adopting, when\r\nprovided in the policy statement, a uniform qualitative description of the type of case in\r\nwhich a departure may be warranted, the “exceptional case”; (3) restating in the application\r\nnotes and background commentary to §5K2.0 longstanding commentary in the Guidelines\r\nManual, which was reaffirmed by the PROTECT Act, that the frequency of departures under\r\n§5K2.0 generally should be rare, and that certain types of departures under §5K2.0 should\r\nbe extremely rare; and (4) deleting certain language in the commentary taken from Koon v.\r\nUnited States, 518 U.S. 81 (1996) that effectively was overruled by the PROTECT Act.\r\nAccordingly, §5K2.0(a) sets forth the general governing principle that, in cases other than\r\nchild crimes and sexual offenses, the sentencing court may depart if the court finds pursuant\r\nAmendment 651 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003\r\n\r\nto 18 U.S.C. § 3553(b)(1) that there exists an aggravating or mitigating circumstance of a\r\nkind, or to a degree, not adequately taken into consideration by the Sentencing Commission\r\nthat, in order to advance the objectives set forth in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(2), should result in\r\na sentence different from a sentence within the applicable guideline range.\r\nThe amendment also prohibits several grounds for departure, in addition to the departure\r\nprohibitions in §5K2.0 for child crimes and sexual offenses enacted by the PROTECT Act,\r\nand other prohibitions elsewhere in the Guidelines Manual. The amendment creates a new\r\nsubsection, §5K2.0(d), that clearly lists the forbidden departure grounds. These include\r\nseveral longstanding prohibitions, as well as a number of new prohibitions added by the\r\namendment, specifically: (1) the defendant’s acceptance of responsibility; (2) the\r\ndefendant’s aggravating or mitigating role in the offense; (3) the defendant’s decision, in\r\nitself, to plead guilty to the offense or to enter into a plea agreement with respect to the\r\noffense; and (4) the defendant’s fulfillment of restitution only to the extent required by law,\r\nincluding the guidelines. The Commission determined that these circumstances are never\r\nappropriate grounds for departure.\r\nThe amendment also revises §5K2.0 to restrict the availability of departures based on\r\nmultiple circumstances, often referred to as a “combination of factors.” The Commission\r\ndetermined that heightened criteria are appropriate for cases in which no single offender\r\ncharacteristic or other circumstance independently is sufficient to provide a basis for\r\ndeparture. Under §5K2.0(c) a departure based on multiple circumstances can be based only\r\non offender characteristics or other circumstances that are identified in the guidelines as\r\npermissible grounds for departure. Circumstances unmentioned in the guidelines, therefore,\r\ncan no longer be used for a departure based on multiple circumstances pursuant to\r\n§5K2.0(c). In addition, in order to support a departure based on a combination of\r\ncircumstances, each offender characteristic or other circumstance must be present\r\nindividually to a substantial degree and must make the case exceptional when considered\r\ntogether. Emphasizing the Commission’s expectation as to the infrequency of such\r\ndepartures, the accompanying application note retains previously existing guidance and\r\nstates that departures under §5K2.0(c) based on a combination of not ordinarily relevant\r\ncircumstances should occur extremely rarely.\r\nIn addition, the amendment clarifies when a departure may be based on a circumstance\r\npresent to a degree not adequately taken into consideration. Section 5K2.0(a)(3) provides\r\nthat a departure may be warranted in an exceptional case, even though the circumstance that\r\nforms the basis for the departure is taken into consideration, only if the court determines that\r\nsuch circumstance is present to a degree substantially different from that ordinarily involved\r\nin that kind of offense.\r\nThe amendment also modifies §5K2.0 in two additional ways to underscore the need for\r\ncourts to state with specificity their reasons for departure. First, §5K2.0(e) provides that if\r\nthe court departs, it shall state, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3553(c), as amended by the\r\nPROTECT Act, its specific reasons for departure in open court at the time of sentencing and,\r\nwith limited exception in the case of statements received in camera, shall state those factors\r\nwith specificity in the written judgment and commitment order. Second, Application Note\r\n5 provides that in cases in which the court departs based on reasons set forth in a plea\r\nagreement, the court must state the reasons for departure with specificity in the written\r\njudgment and commitment order.\r\nNovember 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II Amendment 651\r\n\r\nSecond, the amendment limits several departure provisions in Chapter Five, Part H (Specific\r\nOffender Characteristics). First, the amendment adds a prohibition to §5H1.4 (Physical\r\nCondition, Including Drug or Alcohol Dependence or Abuse; Gambling Addiction) against\r\ndepartures based on addiction to gambling and renames the policy statement accordingly.\r\nThe Commission determined that addiction to gambling is never a relevant ground for\r\ndeparture.\r\nThe amendment limits the availability of departures pursuant to §5H1.6 (Family Ties and\r\nResponsibilities) by requiring the court to conduct certain more rigorous analyses. In\r\ndetermining whether a departure is warranted under this policy statement, a new application\r\nnote instructs the court to consider the seriousness of the offense; the involvement in the\r\noffense, if any, of members of the defendant’s family; and the danger, if any to members of\r\nthe defendant’s immediate family as a result of the offense.\r\nIn addition to considering those factors, the amendment further restricts family ties\r\ndepartures by adding an application note that establishes heightened criteria for departures\r\nbased on loss of caretaking or financial support. In such cases, the court must find all of the\r\nfollowing four circumstances: (1) that a sentence within the applicable guideline range will\r\ncause a substantial, direct, and specific loss of essential caretaking or essential financial\r\nsupport to the defendant’s family; (2) that such loss exceeds the harm ordinarily incident to\r\nincarceration; (3) that there are no effective remedial or ameliorative programs reasonably\r\navailable, making the defendant’s caretaking or financial support irreplaceable to the\r\ndefendant’s family; and (4) that the departure effectively will address the loss of caretaking\r\nor financial support. The Commission determined that these heightened criteria are\r\nappropriate and necessary in order to distinguish hardship or suffering that is ordinarily\r\nincident to incarceration from that which is exceptional.\r\nThe amendment also eliminates community ties as a separate ground for departure and\r\nrenames §5H1.6 accordingly.\r\nThe amendment makes conforming modifications to §5H1.7 (Role in the Offense),\r\nreiterating that a defendant’s role in the offense is not a basis for departure, and to §5H1.8\r\n(Criminal History), providing that the only grounds for departure based on the defendant’s\r\ncriminal history are set forth in §4A1.3 (Departures Based on Inadequacy of Criminal\r\nHistory Category).\r\nThird, the amendment limits several departure provisions in Chapter Five, Part K\r\n(Departures). The amendment adds a factor to §5K2.10 (Victim’s Conduct) that the court\r\nshould consider when determining whether a departure is warranted based on victim’s\r\nconduct. The amendment provides that, in addition to five previously existing factors, the\r\ncourt should consider the proportionality and reasonableness of the defendant’s response to\r\nthe victim’s provocation.\r\nThe amendment adds a similar factor to §5K2.12 (Coercion and Duress). The amendment\r\nprovides that the extent of a departure based on coercion and duress ordinarily should\r\ndepend on several considerations, including the proportionality of the defendant’s actions\r\nto the seriousness of the coercion, blackmail, or duress involved.\r\nThe amendment limits the availability of departures pursuant to §5K2.13 (Diminished\r\nCapacity) by adding a causation element. The amendment provides that in order to receive\r\nAmendment 651 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003\r\n\r\na departure for diminished capacity, the significantly reduced mental capacity must have\r\ncontributed substantially to the commission of the offense. The amendment similarly limits\r\nthe extent of departure by stating that the extent of the departure should reflect the extent to\r\nwhich the reduced mental capacity contributed to the commission of the offense.\r\nThe amendment significantly restructures §5K2.20 (Aberrant Behavior) and further restricts\r\nthe availability of departures based on aberrant behavior. The Commission promulgated\r\n§5K2.20 effective November 1, 2000, in order to resolve a longstanding circuit conflict and\r\nmore properly define when a departure based on aberrant behavior may be warranted. See\r\nAppendix C, amendment 603. A departure based on aberrant behavior may be warranted\r\nonly if the defendant committed a single criminal occurrence or single criminal transaction\r\nthat (1) was without significant planning; (2) was of limited duration; and (3) represents a\r\nmarked deviation by the defendant from an otherwise law-abiding life.\r\nThe amendment provides greater emphasis to these strict requirements by moving them from\r\nan application note to the body of the policy statement. The amendment also gives the court\r\ngreater guidance in applying these requirements with a new application note that clarifies\r\nthat repetitious or significant, planned behavior does not meet the requirements for receiving\r\na departure under §5K2.20. A fraud scheme, for example, generally would be prohibited\r\nfrom receiving a departure pursuant to §5K2.20 because such a scheme usually involves\r\nrepetitive acts, rather than a single occurrence or single criminal transaction, as well as\r\nsignificant planning.\r\nThe amendment also further restricts the availability of departures based on aberrant\r\nbehavior by adding several strict prohibitions to the list that has existed in §5K2.20 since its\r\ninitial promulgation. Prior to this amendment, §5K2.20 prohibited the court from departing\r\nbased on aberrant behavior if (1) the offense involved serious bodily injury or death; (2) the\r\ndefendant discharged a firearm or otherwise used a firearm or a dangerous weapon; (3) the\r\ninstant offense of conviction is a serious drug trafficking offense; (4) the defendant has more\r\nthan one criminal history point, as determined under Chapter Four (Criminal History and\r\nCriminal Livelihood); or (5) the defendant has a prior federal, or state, felony conviction,\r\nregardless of whether the conviction is countable under Chapter Four.\r\nThe amendment gives greater prominence to those previously existing prohibitions and\r\nexpands them in significant ways. The amendment eliminates defendants who have any\r\nsignificant prior criminal behavior from consideration for a departure pursuant to §5K2.20,\r\nregardless of whether such behavior is countable under Chapter Four, and even if such\r\nbehavior is not a state or federal felony. In addition, the amendment expands the class of\r\ndrug trafficking defendants prohibited from consideration for a departure pursuant to\r\n§5K2.20 by expanding the definition of \"serious drug trafficking offense.\" Specifically, the\r\namendment expands the definition of \"serious drug trafficking offense\" in the accompanying\r\napplication note to include any controlled substance offense under title 21, United States\r\nCode, other than simple possession under 21 U.S.C. § 844, that provides a mandatory\r\nminimum term of imprisonment of five years or greater, regardless of whether the defendant\r\nmeets the criteria of §5C1.2 (Limitation on Applicability of Statutory Mandatory Minimum\r\nSentences in Certain Cases). Prior to this amendment, only drug trafficking defendants who\r\nwere subject to such mandatory minimum penalties and who did not meet the criteria set\r\nforth in §5C1.2 were precluded categorically from consideration for a departure under\r\n§5K2.20.\r\nNovember 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II Amendment 651\r\n\r\nFourth, the amendment substantially restructures §4A1.3 (Departures Based on Inadequacy\r\nof Criminal History Category) to set forth more clearly the standards governing departures\r\nbased on criminal history, to prohibit and limit the extent of departures based on criminal\r\nhistory for certain offenders with significant criminal history, and to require written\r\nspecification of the basis for a criminal history departure.\r\nSection 4A1.3(a) provides that an upward departure may be warranted if reliable information\r\nindicates that the defendant’s criminal history category substantially under-represents the\r\nseriousness of the defendant’s criminal history or the likelihood that the defendant will\r\ncommit other crimes. Section 4A1.3(a) also more clearly sets forth previously existing\r\nguidance regarding determination of the extent of an upward departure based on criminal\r\nhistory. Similarly, §4A1.3(b) provides that a downward departure may be warranted if\r\nreliable information indicates that the defendant’s criminal history category substantially\r\nover-represents the seriousness of the defendant’s criminal history or the likelihood that the\r\ndefendant will commit other crimes.\r\nThe amendment, however, adds several prohibitions and limitations to the availability of\r\ndownward departures based on criminal history. It prohibits a downward departure based\r\non §4A1.3(b) if the defendant is an armed career criminal within the meaning of §4B1.3\r\n(Armed Career Criminal) or a repeat and dangerous sex offender against minors within the\r\nmeaning of §4B1.5 (Repeat and Dangerous Sex Offender Against Minors). The Commission\r\ndetermined that such offenders should never receive a criminal history-based downward\r\ndeparture.\r\nSection 4A1.3(b) reiterates the longstanding prohibition against a departure below the lower\r\nlimit of the applicable guideline range for Criminal History Category I.\r\nSection 4A1.3(b) also contains certain limitations on the extent of departure available under\r\nthis provision. Specifically, a downward departure pursuant to this section for a career\r\noffender within the meaning of §4B1.1 (Career Offender) may not exceed one criminal\r\nhistory category.\r\nIn addition, the amendment provides that a defendant whose criminal history category is\r\nCategory I after receipt of a downward departure under §4A1.3(b) does not meet the\r\ncriterion of subsection (a)(1) of §5C1.2 if, before receipt of the departure, the defendant had\r\nmore than one criminal history point under §4A1.1 (Criminal History Category). Thus, a\r\ndeparture to Category I cannot qualify an otherwise ineligible defendant for relief from an\r\napplicable mandatory minimum sentence under §5C1.2, which is consistent with case law.\r\nThe amendment adds a new subsection, §4A1.3(c), that requires the court, in departing based\r\non criminal history, to set forth in writing the specific reasons why the applicable criminal\r\nhistory category under-represents or over-represents the seriousness of the defendant’s\r\ncriminal history or the likelihood that the defendant will commit other crimes. This\r\nspecificity requirement is consistent with the PROTECT Act and is intended to facilitate\r\nboth the necessary statutory and guideline departure analysis, as well as to improve the\r\nCommission’s ability to refine the criminal history guidelines in light of criminal history\r\ndeparture decisions.\r\nThe amendment also makes conforming modifications to §4A1.1 and §5C1.2.\r\nAmendment 651 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003\r\n\r\nThe amendment implements the directive at section 401(m)(2)(B) of the PROTECT Act by\r\nadding a new policy statement at §5K3.1 entitled Early Disposition Programs. The provision\r\nrestates the language contained in the directive and provides that, upon motion of the\r\nGovernment, the court may depart downward not more than 4 levels pursuant to an early\r\ndisposition program authorized by the Attorney General of the United States and the United\r\nStates Attorney for the district in which the court resides. The Commission determined that\r\nimplementing the directive in this manner is appropriate at this time, pending further study\r\nand monitoring of the implementation of early disposition programs.\r\nThe amendment revises subsections (b) and (c) of §6B1.2 (Standards for Acceptance of Plea\r\nAgreements) to require greater specificity in the sentencing documentation in a case\r\ninvolving a departure either recommended or agreed to in a Rule 11(c)(1)(B) or Rule\r\n11(c)(1)(C) plea agreement. Specifically, if the court accepts such a plea agreement, and the\r\nrecommended or agreed to sentence departs from the applicable guideline range for\r\njustifiable reasons, the amendment requires the court to set forth specifically those reasons\r\nin writing in the statement of reasons or judgment and commitment order. This specificity\r\nrequirement is consistent with the PROTECT Act and is intended to facilitate the necessary\r\nstatutory and guideline departure analysis, as well as to improve the Commission’s ability\r\nto understand the underlying reasons for departures in cases involving plea agreements.\r\nThe amendment creates a new guideline, §1A1.1 (Authority), that clearly sets forth the\r\nCommission’s authority to promulgate guidelines, policy statements, and commentary and\r\nimplements the Protect Act directive requiring conforming amendments to paragraph 4(b)\r\nof Part A of Chapter One. In addition, the amendment moves in toto Part A of Chapter One,\r\nas in effect on November 1, 1987, to the commentary as a historical note. Part A of Chapter\r\nOne was an introduction to the Guidelines Manual that explained a number of policy\r\ndecisions made by the Commission when it promulgated the initial set of guidelines. This\r\nintroduction was amended occasionally between 1987 and 2003. The Commission\r\ndetermined that in order to preserve its historical significance and context, the introduction\r\nshould be returned to its original form and placed in a historical note. The Commission\r\nencourages review of this material. The amendment also incorporates relevant portions of\r\nparagraph 4(b) of Part A of the former introduction regarding departures in the background\r\ncommentary to §5K2.0.\r\nThe amendment amends §1B1.1 (Application Instructions) to provide uniform definitions\r\nof departure, upward departure, and downward departure.\r\nThe amendment also makes technical amendments to §2A4.1 (Kidnapping, Abduction,\r\nUnlawful Restraint).\r\nThis amendment complements other significant policy initiatives affecting sentencing,\r\nincluding the statutory changes in sentencing law and guideline changes directly made by\r\nthe PROTECT Act, and recent policies implemented by the Department of Justice. The\r\nCommission believes that these general policy changes, working together, will substantially\r\nreduce the incidence of downward departures. In addition to the significant modifications\r\nmade by this amendment, the Commission has identified several aspects of the guidelines\r\naffecting departures that it intends to continue studying during the current amendment cycle\r\nand beyond, including aberrant behavior, criminal history, immigration, early disposition,\r\nor \"fast track,\" programs, and collateral consequences, among others.\r\nNovember 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II Amendment 653","EffectiveDate":"Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is October 27, 2003."},{"Id":653,"Title":"Amendment 653","Text":"Section 2A1.4(a)(1) is amended by striking \"10\" and inserting \"12\".\r\nSection 2A1.4(a)(2) is amended by striking \"14\" and inserting \"18\".","Reason":"Reason for Amendment: This amendment responds to a concern that the federal sentencing\r\nguidelines do not adequately reflect the seriousness of involuntary manslaughter offenses.\r\nSpecifically, the Department of Justice, some members of Congress, and an ad hoc advisory\r\ngroup formed by the Commission to address Native American sentencing guideline issues\r\nexpressed concern that most federal involuntary manslaughter cases involve vehicular\r\nhomicides, which analysis of Commission data confirmed. These commentators also\r\nindicated that these offenses appear to be underpunished, particularly when compared to\r\ncomparable cases arising under state law. This disparity with state punishments has been\r\nconfirmed by studies undertaken by the Commission. In addition, Congress increased the\r\nmaximum statutory penalty for involuntary manslaughter from three to six years’\r\nimprisonment in 1994.\r\nIn response to these concerns and the Commission’s analysis, this amendment increases the\r\nbase offense level in §2A1.4(a)(2) for reckless involuntary manslaughter offenses from level\r\n14 to level 18. This four level increase corresponds to an approximate 50 percent increase\r\nin sentence length for these offenses.

This 2003\r\namendment also implements directives in sections 805, 905, and 1104 of the Sarbanes-Oxley\r\nAct of 2002, Pub. L. 107–204 (the \"Act\"), by making several modifications to §§2B1.1\r\n(Larceny, Embezzlement, and Other Forms of Theft; Offenses Involving Stolen Property;\r\nProperty Damage or Destruction; Fraud and Deceit; Forgery; Offenses Involving Altered or\r\nCounterfeit Instruments Other than Counterfeit Bearer Obligations of the United States),\r\n2J1.2 (Obstruction of Justice), and 2E5.3 (False Statements and Concealment of Facts in\r\nRelation to Documents Required by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act; Failure\r\nto Maintain and Falsification of Records Required by the Labor Management Reporting and\r\nDisclosure Act; Destruction and Failure to Maintain Corporate Audit Records), as well as\r\nconforming changes to §§2J1.1 (Contempt), 2J1.3 (Perjury or Subornation of Perjury;\r\nBribery of Witness), and 2T4.1 (Tax Table). The amendment also responds to increased\r\nstatutory penalties for existing crimes and several severely punished new crimes created by\r\nthe Act.\r\nThe directives in the Act generally pertain to serious fraud and related offenses and\r\nobstruction of justice offenses. Congress gave the Commission emergency amendment\r\nauthority to promulgate amendments addressing, among other things, officers and directors\r\nof publicly traded companies who commit fraud and related offenses, fraud offenses that\r\nendanger the solvency or financial security of a substantial number of victims, fraud offenses\r\nthat involve significantly greater than 50 victims, and obstruction of justice offenses that\r\ninvolve the destruction of evidence. This amendment expands upon the temporary\r\nemergency amendment effective January 25, 2003, and repromulgates it as a permanent\r\namendment.\r\nFirst, the amendment modifies the base offense level in §2B1.1 to implement more fully the\r\ndirective contained in section 905(b)(2) of the Act to consider whether the guidelines \"for\r\nviolations of the sections amended by this Act are sufficient to deter and punish such\r\noffenses, and specifically, are adequate in view of the statutory increases in penalties\r\ncontained in this Act.\" Section 903 of the Act, for example, quadrupled the statutory\r\nmaximum penalties for wire fraud and mail fraud from five to 20 years’ imprisonment, while\r\nsection 902 made attempts and conspiracies subject to these same heightened penalties.\r\nSpecifically, the amendment provides a new higher alternative base offense level of level 7\r\nif the defendant was convicted of an offense referenced to §2B1.1 and the offense carries a\r\nstatutory maximum term of imprisonment of 20 years or more. The alternative base offense\r\nlevels are intended to calibrate better the base guideline penalty to the seriousness of the\r\nwide variety of offenses referenced to that guideline, as reflected by statutory maximum\r\npenalties established by Congress.\r\nFor those offenses to which the higher alternative base offense will apply (including wire\r\nfraud and mail fraud), the effect of the amendment is to limit the availability of a probation\r\nonly sentence in Zone A of the sentencing table to offenses involving loss amounts of\r\n$10,000 or less, assuming a two level reduction for acceptance of responsibility. Prior to the\r\namendment, a Zone A sentence was available for all offenses sentenced under §2B1.1\r\ninvolving loss amounts of $30,000 or less. Similarly, for those offenses for which the higher\r\nNovember 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II Amendment 653\r\n\r\nalternative base offense level will apply, the effect of the amendment is to require an\r\nimprisonment sentence in Zone D for offenses involving loss amounts of more than $70,000.\r\nPrior to the amendment, a Zone D sentence was required for all offenses sentenced under\r\n§2B1.1 involving loss amounts of more than $120,000.\r\nSecond, the amendment expands the loss table at §2B1.1(b)(1) to punish adequately offenses\r\nthat cause catastrophic losses of magnitudes previously unforeseen, such as the serious\r\ncorporate scandals that gave rise to several portions of the Act. Prior to the emergency\r\namendment, the loss table at §2B1.1(b)(1) provided sentencing enhancements in two level\r\nincrements up to a maximum of 26 levels for offenses in which the loss exceeded\r\n$100,000,000. The amendment adds two additional loss amount categories to the table; an\r\nincrease of 28 levels for offenses in which the loss exceeded $200,000,000, and an increase\r\nof 30 levels for offenses in which the loss exceeded $400,000,000. These additions to the\r\nloss table address congressional concern regarding particularly extensive and serious fraud\r\noffenses and also more fully effectuate increases in statutory maximum penalties provided\r\nby the Act. The amendment also modifies the tax table in §2T4.1 in a similar manner to\r\nmaintain the longstanding proportional relationship between the loss table in §2B1.1 and the\r\ntax table.\r\nThe amendment also adds a new factor to the general, enumerated factors that the court may\r\nconsider in determining the amount of loss under §2B1.1(b)(1). Specifically, the amendment\r\nadds the reduction in the value of equity securities or other corporate assets that resulted\r\nfrom the offense to the list of general factors set forth in Application Note 3(C) of §2B1.1.\r\nThis factor was added to provide courts additional guidance in determining loss in certain\r\ncases, particularly in complex white collar cases.\r\nThird, the amendment addresses the directive contained in section 1104(b)(5) of the Act to\r\n\"ensure that the guideline offense levels and enhancements under United States Sentencing\r\nGuideline 2B1.1 (as in effect on the date of enactment of this Act) are sufficient for a fraud\r\noffense when the number of victims adversely involved is significantly greater than 50.\" The\r\namendment implements this directive by expanding the existing enhancement at\r\n§2B1.1(b)(2) based on the number of victims involved in the offense. Prior to the\r\nemergency amendment, subsection (b)(2) provided a two level enhancement if the offense\r\ninvolved more than 10, but less than 50, victims (or was committed through mass-\r\nmarketing), and a four level enhancement if the offense involved 50 or more victims. The\r\namendment provides an additional two level increase, for a total of six levels, if the offense\r\ninvolved 250 or more victims. The Commission determined that an enhancement of this\r\nmagnitude appropriately responds to the pertinent directive and accounts for the extensive\r\nnature of, and the large scale victimization caused by, such offenses.\r\nFourth, the amendment addresses directives contained in sections 805 and 1104 of the Act\r\npertaining to securities and accounting fraud offenses and fraud offenses that endanger the\r\nsolvency or financial security of a substantial number of victims. Specifically, section\r\n805(a)(4) directs the Commission to ensure that \"a specific offense characteristic enhancing\r\nsentencing is provided under United States Sentencing Guideline 2B1.1 (as in effect on the\r\ndate of enactment of this Act) for a fraud offense that endangers the solvency or financial\r\nsecurity of a substantial number of victims.\" In addition, section 1104(b)(1) directs the\r\nCommission to \"ensure that the sentencing guidelines and policy statements reflect the\r\nserious nature of securities, pension, and accounting fraud and the need for aggressive and\r\nappropriate law enforcement action to prevent such offenses.\" The amendment implements\r\nAmendment 653 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003\r\n\r\nthese directives by expanding the scope of the existing enhancement at §2B1.1(b)(12)(B).\r\nPrior to the emergency amendment, §2B1.1(b)(12)(B) provided a four level enhancement\r\nand a minimum offense level of level 24 if the offense substantially jeopardized the safety\r\nand soundness of a financial institution. The amendment expands the scope of this\r\nenhancement by providing two additional parts. The first part applies to offenses that\r\nsubstantially endanger the solvency or financial security of an organization that, at any time\r\nduring the offense, was a publicly traded company or had 1,000 or more employees. The\r\naddition of this part reflects the Commission’s determination that such an offense\r\nundermines the public’s confidence in the securities and investment market much in the same\r\nmanner as an offense that jeopardizes the safety and soundness of a financial institution\r\nundermines the public’s confidence in the banking system. This part also reflects the\r\nlikelihood that an offense that endangers the solvency or financial security of an employer\r\nof this size will similarly affect a substantial number of individual victims, without requiring\r\nthe court to determine whether the solvency or financial security of each individual victim\r\nwas substantially endangered.\r\nA corresponding application note for §2B1.1(b)(12)(B) sets forth a non-exhaustive list of\r\nfactors that the court shall consider in determining whether the offense endangered the\r\nsolvency or financial security of a publicly traded company or an organization with 1,000\r\nor more employees. The list of factors that the court shall consider when applying the new\r\nenhancement includes references to insolvency, filing for bankruptcy, substantially reducing\r\nthe value of the company’s stock, and substantially reducing the company’s workforce. As\r\nappropriate, the court may consider other factors not enumerated in the application note.\r\nThe amendment also modifies the application note to previously existing §2B1.1(b)(12)(B),\r\nthe financial institutions enhancement, to be consistent structurally with the new part of the\r\nenhancement. Prior to the emergency amendment, the presence of any one of the factors\r\nenumerated in the application note would trigger the financial institutions enhancement\r\nunder §2B1.1(b)(12)(B). Under the amendment, the application note to the financial\r\ninstitutions enhancement sets forth a non-exhaustive list of factors that the court shall\r\nconsider in determining whether the offense substantially jeopardized the safety and\r\nsoundness of a financial institution. The list of factors that the court shall consider when\r\napplying this enhancement includes references to insolvency, substantially reducing benefits\r\nto pensioners and insureds, and an inability to refund fully any deposit, payment, or\r\ninvestment on demand.\r\nThe second part added to §2B1.1(b)(12)(B) by the amendment applies to offenses that\r\nsubstantially endangered the solvency or financial security of 100 or more victims,\r\nregardless of whether a publicly traded company or other organization was affected by the\r\noffense. The Commission concluded that the specificity of the directive in section 805(a)(4)\r\nrequired an enhancement focused specifically on conduct that endangers the financial\r\nsecurity of individual victims. Thus, use of this part of the enhancement will be appropriate\r\nin cases in which there is sufficient evidence for the court to determine that the amount of\r\nloss suffered by individual victims of the offense substantially endangered the solvency or\r\nfinancial security of those victims. The Commission also determined that the enhancement\r\nprovided in §2B1.1(b)(12)(B) shall apply cumulatively with the enhancement at\r\n§2B1.1(b)(2), which is based solely on the number of victims involved in the offense, to\r\nreflect the particularly acute harm suffered by victims of offenses to which the new parts of\r\nsubsection (b)(12)(B) apply. To account for the overlapping nature of such conduct in some\r\n\r\ncases, however, the Commission added a provision at subsection (b)(12)(C) that limits the\r\ncumulative impact of subsections (b)(2) and (b)(12)(B) to eight levels, except for application\r\nof the minimum offense level of level 24.\r\nFifth, the amendment addresses the directive contained at section 1104(a)(2) of the Act to\r\n\"consider the promulgation of new sentencing guidelines or amendments to existing\r\nsentencing guidelines to provide an enhancement for officers or directors of publicly traded\r\ncorporations who commit fraud and related offenses.\" The emergency amendment\r\nimplemented this directive by providing a new, four level enhancement that applies if the\r\noffense involved a violation of securities law and, at the time of the offense, the defendant\r\nwas an officer or director of a publicly traded company.\r\nThe amendment expands the scope of this enhancement to cover registered brokers and\r\ndealers, associated persons of a broker or dealer, investment advisers, and associated persons\r\nof an investment adviser. The amendment also expands the scope of this enhancement to\r\napply if the offense involves a violation of commodities law and, at the time of the offense,\r\nthe defendant was an officer or director of a futures commission merchant or introducing\r\nbroker, a commodities trading advisor, or a commodity pool operator. The Commission\r\nconcluded that a four level enhancement appropriately reflects the culpability of offenders\r\nwho occupy such positions and who are subject to heightened fiduciary duties imposed by\r\nsecurities law or commodities law similar to duties imposed on officers and directors of\r\npublicly traded corporations. Accordingly, the court is not required to determine specifically\r\nwhether the defendant abused a position of trust in order for the enhancement to apply, and\r\na corresponding application note provides that, in cases in which the new, four level\r\nenhancement applies, the existing two level enhancement for abuse of position of trust at\r\n§3B1.3 (Abuse of Position of Trust or Use of Special Skill) shall not apply.\r\nThe corresponding application note also expressly provides that the enhancement would\r\napply regardless of whether the defendant was convicted under a specific securities fraud or\r\ncommodities fraud statute (e.g., 18 U.S.C. § 1348, a new offense created by the Act\r\nspecifically prohibiting securities fraud) or under a general fraud statute (e.g., 18 U.S.C.\r\n§ 1341, prohibiting mail fraud), provided that the offense involved a violation of \"securities\r\nlaw\" or \"commodities law\" as defined in the application note.\r\nSixth, the amendment modifies §2J1.2 to address the directives pertaining to obstruction of\r\njustice offenses contained in sections 805 and 1104 of the Act. Specifically, section 805(a)\r\nof the Act directs the Commission to ensure that the base offense level and existing\r\nenhancements in §2J1.2 are sufficient to deter and punish obstruction of justice offenses\r\ngenerally, and specifically are adequate in cases involving the destruction, alteration, or\r\nfabrication of a large amount of evidence, a large number of participants, the selection of\r\nevidence that is particularly probative or essential to the investigation, more than minimal\r\nplanning, or abuse of a special skill or a position of trust. Section 1104(b) of the Act further\r\ndirects the Commission to ensure that the \"guideline offense levels and enhancements for an\r\nobstruction of justice offense are adequate in cases where documents or other physical\r\nevidence are actually destroyed or fabricated.\"\r\nThe amendment implements these directives by making two modifications to §2J1.2. First,\r\nthe amendment increases the base offense level in §2J1.2 from level 12 to level 14. Second,\r\nthe amendment adds a new two level enhancement to §2J1.2. This enhancement applies if\r\nthe offense (1) involved the destruction, alteration, or fabrication of a substantial number of\r\nAmendment 653 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003\r\n\r\nrecords, documents or tangible objects; (2) involved the selection of any essential or\r\nespecially probative record, document, or tangible object to destroy or alter; or (3) was\r\notherwise extensive in scope, planning, or preparation. The amendment also adds an upward\r\ndeparture provision for offenses sentenced under §2J1.2 that involve extreme acts of\r\nviolence, for example, retaliating against a government witness by throwing acid in the\r\nwitness’s face. The Commission determined that existing adjustments in Chapter Three for\r\naggravating role, §3B1.1, and abuse of position of trust or use of special skill, §3B1.3,\r\nadequately account for those particular factors described in section 805(a) of the Act.\r\nSeventh, the amendment also increases the base offense level in the perjury guideline,\r\n§2J1.3, from level 12 to level 14 in order to maintain the longstanding proportional\r\nrelationship between the offense levels provided in the guidelines for perjury and obstruction\r\nof justice.\r\nEighth, the amendment addresses new offenses created by the Act. Section 1520 of title 18,\r\nUnited States Code, relating to destruction of corporate audit records, is referenced to\r\n§2E5.3. Section 1520 provides a statutory maximum penalty of ten years’ imprisonment for\r\nknowing and willful violations of document maintenance requirements as set forth in that\r\nsection or in rules or regulations to be promulgated by the Securities and Exchange\r\nCommission pursuant to that section. The amendment also expands the existing cross\r\nreference in §2E5.3(a)(2) specifically to cover fraud and obstruction of justice offenses.\r\nAccordingly, if a defendant violated 18 U.S.C. § 1520 in order to obstruct justice, the cross\r\nreference provision in §2E5.3 requires the court to apply §2J1.2 instead of §2E5.3.

It\r\nimplements the directive in section 225(b) of the Homeland Security Act of 2002, Pub. L.\r\n107–296, which required the Commission to review, and if appropriate amend, the\r\nguidelines and policy statements applicable to persons convicted of offenses under 18 U.S.C.\r\n§ 1030 (fraud and related activity in connection with computers) to ensure that the guidelines\r\nand policy statements reflect the serious nature and growing incidence of such offenses and\r\nthe need for an effective deterrent and appropriate punishment. The directive further\r\nrequires the Commission to consider the extent to which eight specific factors were or were\r\nnot accounted for by the guidelines. The amendment responds to the directive by making\r\nseveral changes to §§2B1.1 (Larceny, Embezzlement, and Other Forms of Theft; Offenses\r\nInvolving Stolen Property; Property Damage or Destruction; Fraud and Deceit; Forgery;\r\nOffenses Involving Altered or Counterfeit Instruments Other than Counterfeit Bearer\r\nObligations of the United States), 2B2.3 (Trespass), and 2B3.2 (Extortion by Force or Threat\r\nof Injury or Serious Damage). These changes are designed to supplement existing guidelines\r\nand policy statements and thereby ensure that offenses under 18 U.S.C. § 1030 are\r\nadequately addressed and punished.\r\nFirst, the amendment adds a new specific offense characteristic at §2B1.1(b)(13) with three\r\nalternative enhancements of two, four, and six levels. The first enhancement provides a two\r\nlevel increase for convictions under 18 U.S.C. § 1030 that involve either (1) a computer\r\nsystem used to maintain or operate a critical infrastructure or used in furtherance of the\r\nadministration of justice, national defense, or national security; or (2) an intent to obtain\r\nprivate personal information. The second enhancement provides a four level increase for a\r\nconviction under 18 U.S.C. § 1030(a)(5)(A)(i), which requires a heightened showing of\r\nintent to cause damage. The third enhancement provides a six level increase, with a\r\nminimum offense level of level 24, for a conviction under 18 U.S.C. § 1030 that resulted in\r\na substantial disruption of a critical infrastructure. The graduated levels ensure incremental\r\nNovember 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II Amendment 654\r\n\r\npunishment for increasingly serious conduct, and were chosen in recognition of the fact that\r\nconduct supporting application of a more serious enhancement frequently will encompass\r\nbehavior relevant to a lesser enhancement as well. Accordingly, the most serious applicable\r\nenhancement will apply in any particular case.\r\nThe minimum offense level of level 24 applicable to the third such enhancement was chosen\r\nto maintain parity with the minimum offense level that applies to an offense that\r\nsubstantially jeopardized the safety and soundness of a financial institution, substantially\r\nendangered the solvency or financial security of a publicly traded company or an\r\norganization of at least 1,000 employees, or substantially endangered the solvency or\r\nfinancial security of 100 or more victims. See §2B1.1(b)(12)(B). Because of the potential\r\noverlap in certain cases, the commentary provides that the enhancement at §2B1.1(b)(12)(B)\r\nwill not apply in a case in which the conduct supporting the six level critical infrastructure\r\nenhancement is the only conduct that forms the basis for the §2B1.1(b)(12)(B) enhancement.\r\nThe minimum offense level of level 24 applicable to the third enhancement also reflects the\r\nfact that some offenders to whom the enhancement may apply will be subject to a statutory\r\nmaximum penalty of five years’ imprisonment, i.e., those convicted of an offense under 18\r\nU.S.C. § 1030(a)(5)(A)(ii). To ensure that the most egregious cases involving critical\r\ninfrastructure are adequately addressed, the amendment also provides an encouraged upward\r\ndeparture for cases in which the disruption of the critical infrastructure has a debilitating\r\nimpact on national security, national economic security, national public health or safety, or\r\nany combination of these matters.\r\nA definition of critical infrastructure is provided in the commentary. This definition is\r\nderived in part from the definition of critical infrastructure in the USA PATRIOT Act (see\r\nPub. L. 107–56, section 1016; 42 U.S.C. § 5195c(e)) but was modified to ensure that the\r\nenhancement will apply to substantial disruptions of critical infrastructure that are regional,\r\nrather than national, in scope. Examples of critical infrastructures are provided.\r\nSecond, the amendment modifies the rule of construction relating to the calculation of loss\r\nin protected computer cases. This change was made to incorporate more fully the statutory\r\ndefinition of loss at 18 U.S.C. § 1030(e)(11), added as part of the USA PATRIOT Act, and\r\nto clarify its application to all 18 U.S.C. § 1030 offenses sentenced under §2B1.1.\r\nThird, the amendment expands the upward departure note in §2B1.1. That note provides that\r\nan upward departure may be warranted if an offense caused or risked substantial non-\r\nmonetary harm, including physical harm. The amendment adds a provision that expressly\r\nstates that an upward departure would be warranted for an offense under 18 U.S.C. § 1030\r\ninvolving damage to a protected computer that results in death.\r\nFourth, the amendment modifies §2B2.3, to which 18 U.S.C. § 1030(a)(3) (misdemeanor\r\ntrespass on a government computer) offenses are referenced, and §2B3.2, to which 18 U.S.C.\r\n§ 1030(a)(7) (extortionate demand to damage protected computer) offenses are referenced,\r\nto provide enhancements relating to computer systems used to maintain or operate a critical\r\ninfrastructure, or by or for a government entity in furtherance of the administration of justice,\r\nnational defense, or national security. The amendment expands the scope of existing\r\nenhancements to ensure that trespasses and extortions involving these types of important\r\ncomputer systems are addressed.\r\nAmendment 654 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003\r\n\r\nFinally, the amendment references offenses under 18 U.S.C. § 2701 (unlawful access to\r\nstored communications) to §2B1.1. Prior to the Act, a first offense under section 2701 was\r\nclassified as a misdemeanor offense, and the guidelines did not reference the statute in\r\nAppendix A (Statutory Index). Given that the Act increased the penalties available for 18\r\nU.S.C. § 2701 offenses, the amendment references the statute in Appendix A. Section 2701\r\noffenses are referenced to §2B1.1 because such offenses involve the obtaining, altering, or\r\ndenial of authorized access to stored wire or electronic communications, conduct that is\r\nrelated to fraud, theft, and property damage, which are covered by §2B1.1.","EffectiveDate":"Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2003."},{"Id":656,"Title":"Amendment 656","Text":"The Commentary to §2B1.1 captioned \"Application Notes\", as amended by\r\nAmendment 654, is further amended in subdivision (A)(ii) of Note 18, as redesignated by\r\nAmendment 653, by adding at the end the following:\r\n\"An upward departure also would be warranted, for example, in a case involving\r\nanimal enterprise terrorism under 18 U.S.C. § 43, if, in the course of the offense,\r\nserious bodily injury or death resulted, or substantial scientific research or\r\ninformation were destroyed.\".\r\nSection 2K1.3(a) is amended by redesignating subdivisions (3) and (4) as subdivisions (4)\r\nand (5), respectively;

L.\r\n107–56; (2) responds to the Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and\r\nResponse Act of 2002, Pub. L. 107–188; and (3) responds to the Terrorist Bombings\r\nPreparedness and Response Act of 2002, Pub. L. 107–197.\r\nFirst, this amendment makes changes to the money laundering and transactions structuring\r\nguidelines to complete work begun in 2002 to address the provisions of the USA PATRIOT\r\nAct. The amendment eliminates the six level enhancement for terrorism in §2S1.1\r\n(Laundering of Monetary Instruments; Engaging in Monetary Transactions in Property\r\nDerived from Unlawful Activity) because such conduct is adequately accounted for by the\r\nterrorism adjustment at §3A1.4 (Terrorism). The terrorism adjustment at §3A1.4 applies if\r\nthe offense is a felony that involved, or was intended to promote, a federal crime of\r\nterrorism as defined in 18 U.S.C. § 2332b(g)(5). Therefore, if the defendant knew or\r\nbelieved that any of the laundered funds were the proceeds of, or were intended to promote,\r\nan offense involving terrorism, as defined in §3A1.4, that adjustment will apply. This\r\namendment also provides for the treatment of certain offenses under 18 U.S.C. § 1960. The\r\nAmendment 655 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003\r\n\r\namendment changes Appendix A (Statutory Index) to refer violations of 18 U.S.C. § 1960\r\nto both §§2S1.1 and 2S1.3 (Structuring Transactions to Evade Reporting Requirements;\r\nFailure to Report Case or Monetary Transactions; Failure to File Currency and Monetary\r\nInstrument Report; Knowingly Filing False Reports; Bulk Cash Smuggling; Establishing or\r\nMaintaining Prohibited Accounts). Referring violations of 18 U.S.C. § 1960(b)(1)(C) to\r\n§2S1.1 is appropriate because the essence of this offense is money laundering, rather than\r\nstructuring transactions to evade reporting requirements.\r\nThe amendment also raises the maximum offense level in §2X3.1 (Accessory After the Fact)\r\nfrom level 20 to level 30 for offenses in which the conduct involves harboring or concealing\r\na fugitive involved in a terrorism offense. The Commission determined that the heightened\r\nmaximum offense level of level 30 is appropriate for offenses involving the harboring of\r\nterrorists because of the relative seriousness of those offenses. Specifically, the heightened\r\nmaximum offense level applies in any case in which the defendant is convicted under 18\r\nU.S.C. § 2339 or § 2339A or in which the conduct involved harboring a person who\r\ncommitted any offense listed under those statutes, or who committed any offense involving\r\nor intending to promote a federal crime of terrorism as defined in 18 U.S.C. § 2332b(g)(5).\r\nSecond, the amendment responds to the Public Health Security and Bioterrorism\r\nPreparedness and Response Act of 2002. The amendment refers certain new offenses\r\ninvolving biological agents and toxins to the guideline covering nuclear, biological, and\r\nchemical weapons and materials, §2M6.1 (Unlawful Production, Development, Acquisition,\r\nStockpiling, Alteration, Use, Transfer, or Possession of Nuclear Material, Weapons, or\r\nFacilities, Biological Agents, Toxins, or Delivery Systems, Chemical Weapons, or Other\r\nWeapons of Mass Destruction; Attempt or Conspiracy).\r\nThe amendment also responds to amendments made to the Safe Drinking Water Act (42\r\nU.S.C. § 300i-1(a)) made by section 403 of the Public Health Security and Bioterrorism\r\nPreparedness and Response Act of 2002. Section 1432(a) of the Safe Drinking Water Act\r\nprohibits any person from tampering with a public water system. The statutory maximum\r\npenalty was increased from five years’ imprisonment to 20 years’ imprisonment. Section\r\n1432(b) of the Act prohibits anyone from attempting or threatening to tamper with a public\r\nwater system. The statutory maximum penalty was increased from three years’\r\nimprisonment to ten years’ imprisonment.\r\nThe amendment consolidates §§2Q1.5 (Threatened Tampering with Public Water System)\r\nand 2Q1.4 (Tampering or Attempted Tampering with Public Water System). This\r\nconsolidation reflects the similar manner in which threats to carry out a nuclear, biological,\r\nor chemical weapons offense are treated under §2M6.1. Three alternative base offense levels\r\nare provided for the substantive offense and for a threat to carry out the substantive offense,\r\neither accompanied or unaccompanied by other conduct evidencing an intent to carry out the\r\nthreat.\r\nThe amendment also increases the base offense level for offenses involving tampering and\r\nthreatened tampering with a public water system. The amendment increases the base offense\r\nlevel for tampering with a public water system from level 18 to level 26. The six level\r\nenhancement for the risk of death or serious bodily injury (in the predecessor guideline) is\r\nincorporated into the base offense level, as are two levels for bodily injury (similar to the\r\ntreatment of this aggravated conduct in the consumer product tampering guideline). A\r\ngraduated enhancement for serious or life-threatening bodily injury, modeled after the\r\nNovember 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II Amendment 655\r\n\r\nnuclear, biological, and chemical guideline and the consumer product tampering guideline,\r\nis added. Likewise, the base offense level for threatening to tamper with a public water\r\nsystem, without conduct evidencing an intent to carry out the threat, is increased from level\r\n10 to level 16. A base offense level of level 22 is provided if there is conduct evidencing an\r\nintent to carry out the threat. For point of comparison, the existing base offense levels for\r\nthreatening communications under §2A6.1 (Threatening or Harassing Communications) is\r\nlevel 12, and for threatened use of nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons under §2M6.1\r\nis level 20. These substantial increases in the base offense levels for threatened tampering\r\nof a public water system are provided to ensure proportionality with similar offenses and to\r\nrespond to the increased statutory maximum penalties made by section 403 of the Public\r\nHealth Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002. Additionally, the\r\nenhancement in subsection (b)(2) regarding the disruption of the public water system has\r\nbeen expanded slightly to make it consistent with similar enhancements in other related\r\nguidelines, such as the nuclear, biological, and chemical guideline, §2M6.1.\r\nThis amendment adds an invited upward departure provision in §2B1.1 (Larceny,\r\nEmbezzlement, and Other Forms of Theft; Offenses Involving Stolen Property; Property\r\nDamage or Destruction; Fraud and Deceit; Forgery; Offenses Involving Altered or\r\nCounterfeit Instruments Other than Counterfeit Bearer Obligations of the United States), to\r\naccount for aggravating conduct that may occur in connection with an animal enterprise\r\noffense under 18 U.S.C. § 43. While reference only to that guideline generally continues to\r\nbe appropriate for violations under 18 U.S.C. § 43, that guideline fails to account for\r\naggravated situations in which serious bodily injury or death results. Although the property\r\ndamage guideline contains an enhancement for the risk of serious bodily injury or death,\r\nthere is no enhancement or cross reference in that guideline that would provide a higher\r\noffense level if actual serious bodily injury or death resulted. Given the highly unusual\r\noccurrence of death or serious bodily injury in property damage cases generally and the\r\ninfrequency of these specific offenses, the amendment adds an invited upward departure\r\nprovision in the commentary of §2B1.1 if death or serious bodily injury occurs in an offense\r\nunder 18 U.S.C. § 43, or if substantial or significant scientific information or research is lost\r\nas part of such an offense.\r\nThird, the amendment amends Appendix A (and the Statutory Provisions of the pertinent\r\nChapter Two guidelines) to add three new offenses created by the Terrorist Bombings\r\nConvention Implementation Act of 2002, and provides conforming amendments within a\r\nnumber of Chapter Two guidelines to incorporate more fully the new offenses into the\r\noffense guidelines. Section 102 of the Act created a new offense at 18 U.S.C. § 2332f,\r\nwhich provides in subsection (a) that \"whoever unlawfully delivers, places, discharges, or\r\ndetonates an explosive or other lethal device in, into, or against a place of public use, a state\r\nor government facility, a public transportation system, or an infrastructure facility (1) with\r\nthe intent to cause death or serious bodily injury, or (2) with the intent to cause extensive\r\ndestruction of such a place, facility, or system, where such destruction results in or is likely\r\nto result in major economic loss\" and in subsection (b) that \"whoever attempts or conspires\r\nto commit [such] an offense\" shall be punished as provided under 18 U.S.C. § 2332a(a).\r\nSection 2332a offenses currently are referenced to §§2K1.4 (Arson; Property Damage by\r\nUse of Explosives) and 2M6.1. The amendment refers this new offense to those guidelines\r\nas well. In addition, the amendment amends the alternative base offense levels in\r\n§2K1.4(a)(1) so that the base offense level of level 24 applies to targets of 18 U.S.C. § 2332f\r\noffenses, namely, state or government facilities, infrastructure facilities, public transportation\r\nsystems and \"places of public use\".\r\nAmendment 655 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003\r\n\r\nSection 202 of the Act created a new offense at 18 U.S.C. § 2339C. The amendment refers\r\nthe new offense at 18 U.S.C. § 2339C(1)(A) to §2X2.1 (Aiding and Abetting). The new\r\noffense involves providing or collecting funds knowing or intending that the funds would\r\nbe used to carry out any of a number of specified offenses. Accordingly, the amendment\r\ntreats these offenses in the same manner as 18 U.S.C. § 2339A offenses, which aid and abet\r\na predicate offense listed in the statute. An amendment is also made in §2X2.1 to provide\r\na definition for the \"underlying offense\" that is aided and abetted.\r\nThe amendment also refers the new offense at 18 U.S.C. § 2339C(a)(1)(B) to §2M5.3\r\n(Providing Material Support or Resources to Designated Foreign Terrorist Organizations).\r\nReference to §2M5.3 is appropriate because this offense involves generally providing or\r\ncollecting funds knowing or intending that the funds would be used to carry out an act which\r\nby its nature is a terrorist act (because it is meant to intimidate a civilian population or to\r\ncompel a government or international organization to do something or to refrain from doing\r\nsomething). Therefore, the essence of the offense is the provision of material support to\r\nterrorists, which appropriately is referenced to §2M5.3. The amendment expands §2M5.3\r\nto include not only designated foreign terrorist organizations but other terrorists as well.\r\nAdditionally, 18 U.S.C. § 2339C(c)(2) makes it unlawful in the United States, or outside the\r\nUnited States by a national of the United States or an entity organized under the laws of the\r\nUnited States, to knowingly conceal or disguise the nature, location, source, ownership, or\r\ncontrol of any material support, resources, or funds knowing or intending that they were (1)\r\nprovided in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2339B, or (2) provided or collected in violation of 18\r\nU.S.C. § 2339C(a)(1) or (2). The maximum term of imprisonment for a violation of\r\nsubsection 18 U.S.C. § 2339C(c) is 10 years. The amendment references offenses under 18\r\nU.S.C. § 2339C(c)(2)(A) to §2X3.1 (Accessory After the Fact), because the essence of such\r\nan offense is the concealment of resources that were known or intended to have been\r\nprovided in violation of another substantive offense, namely, 18 U.S.C. § 2339B. An\r\namendment is made in §2X3.1 to provide a definition of the \"underlying offense\" to which\r\nthe defendant is an accessory.\r\nThe amendment references offenses under 18 U.S.C. § 2339C(c)(2)(B) to §§2M5.3 and\r\n2X3.1. To the extent the offense involved knowingly concealing or disguising the nature,\r\nlocation, source, ownership, or control of any funds knowing or intending that they were\r\nprovided or collected in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2339C(a)(1)(A), the offense should be\r\nsentenced under §2X3.1. This is because the concealment occurs with respect to funds the\r\ndefendant knows are to be used, in full or in part, in order to carry out an act which\r\nconstitutes any number of specified offenses. To the extent the offense involved knowingly\r\nconcealing or disguising the nature, location, source, ownership, or control of any funds\r\nknowing or intending that they were provided or collected in violation of 18 U.S.C. §\r\n2339C(a)(1)(B), the offense should be sentenced under §2M5.3. This is because the\r\nconcealment occurs with respect to material support the defendant knows is to be used, in\r\nfull or in part, in order to carry out an act which by its nature is a terrorist act (because it is\r\nmeant to intimidate a civilian population or to compel a government or international\r\norganization to do something or to refrain from doing something). A conforming\r\namendment is added to the Statutory Provisions of §§2M5.3 and 2X3.1.\r\nFinally, an amendment is made to §2K1.3 (Unlawful Receipt, Possession, or Transportation\r\nof Explosive Materials; Prohibited Transaction Involving Explosive Materials) to add an\r\nadditional base offense level of level 18 for certain offenses committed under 18 U.S.C. §\r\nNovember 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II Amendment 655\r\n\r\n842(p)(2) involving explosives, destructive devices, or weapons of mass destruction. The\r\nstatute is referenced in Appendix A to §§2K1.3 and 2M6.1. The applicable offense levels\r\nat §2M6.1 are levels 42 and 28. The applicable base offense level at §2K1.3 is level 12. The\r\nbase offense level of level 12 appears to be disproportionately low compared with other 20\r\nyear offenses and compared with the treatment of 18 U.S.C. § 842(p)(2) offenses under\r\n§2M6.1. This is especially true in light of the definition of destructive device, defined at 18\r\nU.S.C. § 921(a)(4) to include any explosive, incendiary, or poison gas (1) bomb; (2) grenade;\r\n(3) rocket having a propellant charge of more than four ounces; (4) missile having an\r\nexplosive or incendiary charge of more than one-quarter ounce; (5) mine; or (6) device\r\nsimilar to any of the devices described in the preceding clauses.\r\nThe amendment makes the enhancement at §2K1.3(b)(3) and the cross reference at\r\n§2K1.3(c)(1) applicable to 18 U.S.C. § 842(p)(2) offenses. In cases in which the defendant\r\nused or possessed any explosive material in connection with another felony offense or\r\npossessed or transferred any explosive material with knowledge, intent, or reason to believe\r\nthat it would be used or possessed in connection with another felony offense, subsection\r\n(b)(3) provides a four level enhancement and a minimum offense level of level 18.\r\nAlternatively, the cross reference at subsection (c)(1) references such cases either to §2X1.1\r\n(Attempt, Solicitation, or Conspiracy (Not Covered by a Specific Guideline)), or to the most\r\nanalogous homicide guideline if death resulted, if the resulting offense level is greater.\r\nApplication of both subsection (b)(3) and subsection (c)(1) to 18 U.S.C. § 842(p)(2) offenses\r\nis appropriate because of the defendant’s knowledge and/or intent that the defendant’s\r\nteaching would be used to carry out another felony.","EffectiveDate":"Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2003."},{"Id":657,"Title":"Amendment 657","Text":"The heading of Part C of Chapter Two, amendments to the Introductory\r\nCommentary of Part C of Chapter Two, §§2C1.8, 3D1.2 and 5E1.2, effective January 25,\r\n2003 (see USSC Guidelines Manual Appendix C (Volume II), Amendment 648), are\r\nrepromulgated without change.

This amendment repromulgates without change the emergency\r\namendment as a permanent amendment.\r\nThis amendment implements the directive from Congress contained in the BCRA to the\r\neffect that the Commission \"promulgate a guideline, or amend an existing guideline ... , for\r\npenalties for violations of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 [the \"FECA\"] and\r\nrelated election laws ... .\" The BCRA significantly increased statutory penalties for\r\ncampaign finance crimes, formerly misdemeanors under the FECA. The new statutory\r\nmaximum term of imprisonment for even the least serious of these offenses is now two years,\r\nand for more serious offenses, the maximum term of imprisonment is five years.\r\nTo punish these offenses effectively, the Commission chose to create a new guideline at\r\n§2C1.8 (Making, Receiving, or Failing to Report a Contribution, Donation, or Expenditure\r\nin Violation of the Federal Election Campaign Act; Fraudulently Misrepresenting Campaign\r\nAmendment 655 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003\r\n\r\nAuthority; Soliciting or Receiving a Donation in Connection with an Election While on\r\nCertain Federal Property). The Commission opted against simply amending an existing\r\nguideline because it determined after review that the characteristics of election violation\r\ncases did not bear sufficient similarity to cases sentenced under any existing guideline. The\r\noffenses that will be sentenced under §2C1.8 include: violations of the statutory prohibitions\r\nagainst \"soft money\" (2 U.S.C. § 441i); restrictions on \"hard money\" contributions (2 U.S.C.\r\n§ 441a); contributions by foreign nationals (2 U.S.C. § 441e); restrictions on \"electioneering\r\ncommunications\" (as defined in 2 U.S.C. § 434(f)(3)(C)); certain fraudulent\r\nmisrepresentations (2 U.S.C. § 441h); and \"conduit contributions\" (2 U.S.C. § 441f).\r\nThe new guideline has a base offense level of level 8, which reflects the fact that these\r\noffenses, while they are somewhat similar to fraud offenses (sentenced under §2B1.1\r\n(Larceny, Embezzlement, and Other Forms of Theft; Offenses Involving Stolen Property;\r\nProperty Damage or Destruction; Fraud and Deceit; Forgery; Offenses Involving Altered or\r\nCounterfeit Instruments Other than Counterfeit Bearer Obligations of the United States) at\r\na base offense level of level 6), nevertheless are more serious due to the additional harm, or\r\nthe potential harm, of corrupting the elective process.\r\nThe new guideline provides five specific offense characteristics to ensure appropriate penalty\r\nenhancements for aggravating conduct that may occur during the commission of certain\r\ncampaign finance offenses. First, the new guideline provides a specific offense\r\ncharacteristic, at §2C1.8(b)(1), that uses the fraud loss table in §2B1.1 incrementally to\r\nincrease the offense level in proportion to the monetary amounts involved in the illegal\r\ntransactions. This both assures proportionality with penalties for fraud offenses and\r\nresponds to Congress’ directive to provide an enhancement for \"a large aggregate amount\r\nof illegal contributions.\"\r\nSecond, the new guideline provides alternative enhancements, at §2C1.8(b)(2), if the offense\r\ninvolved a foreign national (two levels) or a foreign government (four levels). These\r\nenhancements respond to another specific directive in the BCRA and reflect the seriousness\r\nof attempts by foreign entities to tamper with the United States’ election processes.\r\nThird, the new guideline provides alternative enhancements of two levels each, at\r\n§2C1.8(b)(3), when the offense involves either \"governmental funds,\" defined broadly to\r\ninclude federal, state, or local funds, or an intent to derive \"a specific, identifiable non-\r\nmonetary Federal benefit\" (e.g., a presidential pardon). Each of these enhancements\r\nresponds to specific directives of the BCRA.\r\nFourth, the new guideline provides a two level enhancement, at subsection (b)(4), when the\r\noffender engages in \"30 or more illegal transactions.\" After a review of all campaign finance\r\ncases in the Commission’s datafile, the Commission chose 30 transactions as the number best\r\nillustrative of a \"large number\" in that context. This enhancement also responds to a specific\r\ndirective in the BCRA to the effect that the Commission provide enhanced sentencing for\r\ncases involving \"a large number of illegal transactions.\"\r\nFifth, the new guideline provides a four level enhancement, at §2C1.8(b)(5), if the offense\r\ninvolves the use of \"intimidation, threat of pecuniary or other harm, or coercion.\" This\r\nenhancement responds to information, received from the Federal Election Commission and\r\nthe Public Integrity Section of the Department of Justice, which characterizes offenses of this\r\ntype as some of the most aggravated offenses committed under the FECA.\r\nNovember 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II Amendment 658\r\n\r\nThe new guideline also provides a cross reference, at subsection (c), which directs the\r\nsentencing court to apply either §2C1.1 (Offering, Giving, Soliciting, or Receiving a Bribe;\r\nExtortion Under Color of Official Right) or §2C1.2 (Offering, Giving, Soliciting, or\r\nReceiving a Gratuity), as appropriate, if the offense involved a bribe or a gratuity and the\r\nresulting offense level would be greater than that determined under §2C1.8.\r\nSection 3D1.2 (Groups of Closely Related Counts) has been amended, consistent with the\r\nprinciples underlying the rules for grouping multiple counts of conviction, to include §2C1.8\r\noffenses among those in which the offense level is determined largely on the basis of the\r\ntotal amount of harm or loss or some other measure of aggregate harm. (See §3D1.2(d)).\r\nFinally, §5E1.2 (Fines for Individual Defendants) has been amended specifically to reflect\r\nfine provisions unique to the FECA. This part of the amendment also provides that the\r\ndefendant’s participation in a conciliation agreement with the Federal Election Commission\r\nmay be an appropriate factor for use in determining the specific fine within the applicable\r\nfine guideline range unless the defendant began negotiations with the Federal Election\r\nCommission only after the defendant became aware that the defendant was the subject of a\r\ncriminal investigation.","EffectiveDate":"Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2003."},{"Id":658,"Title":"Amendment 658","Text":"Section 2D1.1(c) is amended in Note (B) of the \"*Notes to Drug Quantity\r\nTable\" by adding at the end the following new paragraph:\r\n\"The term ‘Oxycodone (actual)’ refers to the weight of the controlled substance, itself,\r\ncontained in the pill, capsule, or mixture.\".\r\nThe Commentary to §2D1.1 captioned \"Application Notes\" is amended in Note 9 by striking\r\n\"or \" after \"amphetamine,\"; and by inserting \", or oxycodone\" after \"methamphetamine\".\r\nThe Commentary to §2D1.1 captioned \"Application Notes\" is amended in Note 10, in the\r\nDrug Equivalency Tables, in the subdivision captioned \"Schedule I or II Opiates*\" by\r\nstriking \"1 gm of Oxycodone = 500 gm of marihuana\" and inserting \"1 gm of Oxycodone\r\n(actual) = 6700 gm of marihuana\".","Reason":"Reason for Amendment: This amendment responds to proportionality issues in the\r\nsentencing of oxycodone trafficking offenses. Oxycodone is an opium alkaloid found in\r\ncertain prescription pain relievers such as Percocet and OxyContin. This prescription drug\r\ngenerally is sold in pill form and, prior to this amendment, the sentencing guidelines\r\nestablished penalties for oxycodone trafficking based on the entire weight of the pill. The\r\nproportionality issues arise (1) because of the formulations of the different medicines; and\r\n(2) because different amounts of oxycodone are found in pills of identical weight.\r\nAs an example of the first issue, the drug Percocet contains, in addition to oxycodone, the\r\nnon-prescription pain reliever acetaminophen. The weight of the oxycodone component\r\naccounts for a very small proportion of the total weight of the pill. In contrast, the weight\r\nof the oxycodone accounts for a substantially greater proportion of the weight of an\r\nOxyContin pill. To illustrate this difference, a Percocet pill containing five milligrams (mg)\r\nof oxycodone weighs approximately 550 mg with oxycodone accounting for 0.9 percent of\r\nthe total weight of the pill. By comparison, the weight of an OxyContin pill containing 10\r\nAmendment 656 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003\r\n\r\nmg of oxycodone is approximately 135 mg with oxycodone accounting for 7.4 percent of\r\nthe total weight. Consequently, prior to this amendment, trafficking 364 Percocet pills or\r\n1,481 OxyContin pills resulted in the same five year sentence of imprisonment.\r\nAdditionally, the total amount of the narcotic oxycodone involved in this example is vastly\r\ndifferent depending on the drug. The 364 Percocets produce 1.8 grams of actual oxycodone\r\nwhile the 1,481 OxyContin pills produce 14.8 grams of oxycodone.\r\nThe second issue results from differences in the formulation of OxyContin. Three different\r\namounts of oxycodone (10, 20, and 40 mg) are contained in pills of identical weight (135\r\nmg). As a result, prior to this amendment, an individual trafficking in a particular number\r\nof OxyContin pills would receive the same sentence regardless of the amount of oxycodone\r\ncontained in the pills.\r\nTo remedy these proportionality issues, the amendment changes the Drug Equivalency\r\nTables in §2D1.1 (Unlawful Manufacturing, Importing, Exporting, or Trafficking (Including\r\nPossession with Intent to Commit These Offenses); Attempt or Conspiracy) to provide\r\nsentences for oxycodone offenses using the weight of the actual oxycodone instead of\r\ncalculating the weight of the entire pill. The amendment equates 1 gram of actual oxycodone\r\nto 6,700 grams of marihuana. This equivalency keeps penalties for offenses involving 10\r\nmg OxyContin pills identical to levels that existed prior to the amendment, substantially\r\nincreases penalties for all other doses of OxyContin, and decreases somewhat the penalties\r\nfor offenses involving Percocet.","EffectiveDate":"Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2003."},{"Id":659,"Title":"Amendment 659","Text":"Section 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(vii) is amended by striking \"committed for profit\".\r\nThe Commentary to §2L1.2 captioned \"Application Notes\" is amended in Note 1 by striking\r\nsubdivision (A)(iv) as follows:\r\n\"(iv) If all or any part of a sentence of imprisonment was probated, suspended,\r\ndeferred, or stayed, \"sentence imposed\" refers only to the portion that was\r\nnot probated, suspended, deferred, or stayed.\",\r\nand inserting the following:\r\n\"(iv) Subsection (b)(1) does not apply to a conviction for an offense committed\r\nbefore the defendant was eighteen years of age unless such conviction is\r\nclassified as an adult conviction under the laws of the jurisdiction in which\r\nthe defendant was convicted.\".\r\nThe Commentary to §2L1.2 captioned \"Application Notes\" is amended in Note 1 by striking\r\nsubdivision (B) as follows:\r\n\"(B) Definitions.—For purposes of subsection (b)(1):\r\n(i) ‘Committed for profit’ means committed for payment or\r\nexpectation of payment.\r\n(ii) ‘Crime of violence’—\r\nNovember 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II Amendment 658\r\n\r\n(I) means an offense under federal, state, or local law that has\r\nas an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of\r\nphysical force against the person of another;

In response to application issues raised by a number of judges, probation\r\nofficers, defense attorneys, and prosecutors, particularly along the southwest border between\r\nthe United States and Mexico, this amendment builds upon the 2001 amendment by\r\nclarifying the meaning of some of the terms used in §2L1.2(b)(1).\r\nFirst, the amendment adds commentary to define the following offenses: \"alien smuggling\",\r\n\"child pornography\", and \"human trafficking.\" Prior to the amendment, these offenses\r\nreceived a 16 level increase but were not defined. The lack of definitions led to litigation\r\nregarding the meaning and scope of some of these terms. The Commission has determined\r\nthat these offenses warrant application of the 16 level enhancement even though some of\r\nthese offenses, as defined by the amendment, may not meet the statutory definition of an\r\naggravated felony in 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43).\r\nThe amendment provides a definition of \"alien smuggling offense\" in a manner consistent\r\nwith the \"aggravated felony\" definition in 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43)(N). This statutory\r\ndefinition excludes \"a first offense for which the alien has affirmatively shown that the alien\r\ncommitted the offense for the purpose of assisting, abetting, or aiding only the alien’s\r\nspouse, child, or parent (and no other person)\". This definition generally is consistent with\r\nthe guideline’s previous terminology of \"alien smuggling offense committed for profit,\" and\r\nresults in a 16 level increase only for the most serious of such offenses. The new definition\r\nalso responds to concerns about whether an alien smuggling offense includes the offenses\r\nof harboring or transporting aliens. By explicitly incorporating the statutory definition of\r\nalien smuggling within the guideline definition, the amendment, in effect, adopts the Fifth\r\nCircuit’s interpretation of \"alien smuggling\". See United States v. Solis-Campozano, 312\r\nF.3d 164 (5th Cir. 2002) (holding that \"alien smuggling offense\" was not limited to the\r\n\"offense of alien smuggling\" but includes transporting aliens brought into the country as\r\nwell).\r\nSecond, the amendment adds commentary that clarifies the meaning of the term \"crime of\r\nviolence\" by providing that the term \"means any of the following: murder, manslaughter,\r\nkidnapping, aggravated assault, forcible sex offenses, statutory rape, sexual abuse of a minor,\r\n\r\nrobbery, arson, extortion, extortionate extension of credit, burglary of a dwelling, or any\r\noffense under federal, state, or local law that has as an element the use, attempted use, or\r\nthreatened use of physical force against the person of another.\" The previous definition often\r\nled to confusion over whether the specified offenses listed in that definition, particularly\r\nsexual abuse of a minor and residential burglary, also had to include as an element of the\r\noffense \"the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of\r\nanother.\" The amended definition makes clear that the enumerated offenses are always\r\nclassified as \"crimes of violence,\" regardless of whether the prior offense expressly has as\r\nan element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of\r\nanother.\r\nThird, the amendment adds commentary at Application Note 1(B)(vii) explaining that the\r\nterm \"sentence imposed\" has the meaning given the term \"sentence of imprisonment\" in\r\nApplication Note 2 and subsection (b) of §4A1.2 (Definitions and Instructions for\r\nComputing Criminal History), without regard to the date of the conviction. The length of\r\nthe sentence of imprisonment includes any term of imprisonment given upon revocation of\r\nprobation, parole, or supervised release. The Commission’s approach in clarifying this\r\ndefinition is consistent with the case law interpreting the term and the use of the term in\r\nChapter Four of the guidelines. See, e.g., United States v. Moreno-Cisneros, 319 F.3d 456\r\n(9th Cir. 2003) (holding that the length of the sentence of imprisonment includes any term\r\nof imprisonment given upon revocation of probation, parole, or supervised release);\r\nUnited States v. Compian-Torres, 320 F.3d 514 (5th Cir. 2003) (same). Compare United\r\nStates v. Hidalgo-Macias, 300 F.3d 281 (2d Cir. 2002) (holding that the imposition of a\r\nsentence of imprisonment following revocation of probation is a modification of the original\r\nsentence and must be considered part of the sentence imposed for the original offense), with\r\nUnited States v. Rodriguez-Arreola, 313 F.3d 1064 (8th Cir. 2002) (holding that the term\r\n\"sentence imposed\" when applied to an indeterminate sentence is the maximum term that a\r\ndefendant may serve).\r\nFourth, the amendment adds commentary providing that the enhancements in subsection\r\n(b)(1) do not apply to a conviction for an offense committed before the defendant was\r\neighteen years of age, unless such conviction is classified as an adult conviction under the\r\nlaws of the jurisdiction in which the defendant was convicted. This provision is consistent\r\nwith the approach in Chapter Four of the guidelines.\r\nThe amendment also makes other minor technical and clarifying changes.","EffectiveDate":"Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2003."},{"Id":660,"Title":"Amendment 660","Text":"Chapter Three, Part B, is amended by adding at the end the following new\r\nguideline:\r\n\"§3B1.5.

The new\r\nadjustment provides for the greater of a two level adjustment if the defendant was convicted\r\nof a crime of violence or a drug trafficking crime and the offense involved the use of body\r\narmor, or a four level adjustment if the defendant used body armor in preparation for, during\r\nthe commission of, or in an attempt to avoid apprehension for, the offense.\r\nAn application note defines \"drug trafficking crime\" (as defined in 18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(2)).\r\nThis definition includes any felony punishable under the Controlled Substances Act. The\r\napplication note also defines \"crime of violence\" (as defined in 18 U.S.C. § 16). This\r\ndefinition includes offenses that involve the use or attempted use of physical force against\r\nproperty as well as persons. Both of these definitions are somewhat broader than the\r\ndefinitions of \"crime of violence\" and \"drug trafficking offense\" used in a number of other\r\nguidelines. The definition of \"body armor\" is the same as the statutory definition provided\r\nin 18 U.S.C. § 921(a)(35).\r\nAn application note makes clear that in order for §3B1.5 to apply, the body armor must be\r\nused, i.e., actively employed either in a manner to protect the person from gunfire or as a\r\nmeans of bartering. Mere possession is insufficient to trigger the adjustment.\r\nAnother application note explains that in order for the heightened, four level adjustment to\r\napply, the defendant must have used the body armor or aided, abetted, counseled,\r\ncommanded, induced, procured, or willfully caused someone else to use the body armor.","EffectiveDate":"Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2003."},{"Id":661,"Title":"Amendment 661","Text":"Section 5G1.3 is amended by striking subsection (b) as follows:\r\n\"(b) If subsection (a) does not apply, and the undischarged term of imprisonment\r\nresulted from offense(s) that have been fully taken into account in the\r\ndetermination of the offense level for the instant offense, the sentence for\r\nthe instant offense shall be imposed to run concurrently to the undischarged\r\nterm of imprisonment.\",\r\nand inserting the following:\r\n\"(b) If subsection (a) does not apply, and a term of imprisonment resulted from\r\nanother offense that is relevant conduct to the instant offense of conviction\r\nunder the provisions of subsections (a)(1), (a)(2), or (a)(3) of §1B1.3\r\n(Relevant Conduct) and that was the basis for an increase in the offense\r\nlevel for the instant offense under Chapter Two (Offense Conduct) or\r\nChapter Three (Adjustments), the sentence for the instant offense shall be\r\nimposed as follows:\r\nAmendment 659 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003\r\n\r\n(1) the court shall adjust the sentence for any period of imprisonment\r\nalready served on the undischarged term of imprisonment if the\r\ncourt determines that such period of imprisonment will not be\r\ncredited to the federal sentence by the Bureau of Prisons; and\r\n(2) the sentence for the instant offense shall be imposed to run\r\nconcurrently to the remainder of the undischarged term of\r\nimprisonment.\".\r\nSection 5G1.3(c) is amended by inserting \"involving an undischarged term of imprisonment\"\r\nafter \"case\".\r\nThe Commentary to §5G1.3 captioned \"Application Notes\" is amended by striking Notes 2\r\nthrough 7 as follows:\r\n\"2. Adjusted concurrent sentence - subsection (b) cases. When a sentence is\r\nimposed pursuant to subsection (b), the court should adjust the sentence for\r\nany period of imprisonment already served as a result of the conduct taken\r\ninto account in determining the guideline range for the instant offense if the\r\ncourt determines that period of imprisonment will not be credited to the\r\nfederal sentence by the Bureau of Prisons. Example: The defendant is\r\nconvicted of a federal offense charging the sale of 30 grams of cocaine.\r\nUnder §1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct), the defendant is held accountable for the\r\nsale of an additional 15 grams of cocaine, an offense for which the\r\ndefendant has been convicted and sentenced in state court. The defendant\r\nreceived a nine-month sentence of imprisonment for the state offense and\r\nhas served six months on that sentence at the time of sentencing on the\r\ninstant federal offense. The guideline range applicable to the defendant is\r\n10-16 months (Chapter Two offense level of 14 for sale of 45 grams of\r\ncocaine; 2-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility; final offense\r\nlevel of 12; Criminal History Category I). The court determines that a\r\nsentence of 13 months provides the appropriate total punishment. Because\r\nthe defendant has already served six months on the related state charge as\r\nof the date of sentencing on the instant federal offense, a sentence of seven\r\nmonths, imposed to run concurrently with the three months remaining on\r\nthe defendant’s state sentence, achieves this result. For clarity, the court\r\nshould note on the Judgment in a Criminal Case Order that the sentence\r\nimposed is not a departure from the guideline range because the defendant\r\nhas been credited for guideline purposes under §5G1.3(b) with six months\r\nserved in state custody that will not be credited to the federal sentence under\r\n18 U.S.C. § 3585(b).\r\n3. Concurrent or consecutive sentence - subsection (c) cases. In circumstances\r\nnot covered under subsection (a) or (b), subsection (c) applies. Under this\r\nsubsection, the court may impose a sentence concurrently, partially\r\nconcurrently, or consecutively. To achieve a reasonable punishment and\r\navoid unwarranted disparity, the court should consider the factors set forth\r\nin 18 U.S.C. § 3584 (referencing 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)) and be cognizant of:\r\n(a) the type (e.g., determinate, indeterminate/parolable) and length of\r\nNovember 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II Amendment 660\r\n\r\nthe prior undischarged sentence;\r\n(b) the time served on the undischarged sentence and the time likely to\r\nbe served before release;\r\n(c) the fact that the prior undischarged sentence may have been\r\nimposed in state court\r\nrather than federal court, or at a different time before the same or\r\ndifferent federal court; and\r\n(d) any other circumstance relevant to the determination of an\r\nappropriate sentence for the instant offense.\r\n4. Partially concurrent sentence. In some cases under subsection (c), a\r\npartially concurrent sentence may achieve most appropriately the desired\r\nresult. To impose a partially concurrent sentence, the court may provide in\r\nthe Judgment in a Criminal Case Order that the sentence for the instant\r\noffense shall commence (A) when the defendant is released from the prior\r\nundischarged sentence, or (B) on a specified date, whichever is earlier. This\r\norder provides for a fully consecutive sentence if the defendant is released\r\non the undischarged term of imprisonment on or before the date specified\r\nin the order, and a partially concurrent sentence if the defendant is not\r\nreleased on the undischarged term of imprisonment by that date.\r\n5. Complex situations. Occasionally, the court may be faced with a complex\r\ncase in which a defendant may be subject to multiple undischarged terms\r\nof imprisonment that seemingly call for the application of different rules.\r\nIn such a case, the court may exercise its discretion in accordance with\r\nsubsection (c) to fashion a sentence of appropriate length and structure it to\r\nrun in any appropriate manner to achieve a reasonable punishment for the\r\ninstant offense.\r\n6. Revocations. If the defendant was on federal or state probation, parole, or\r\nsupervised release at the time of the instant offense, and has had such\r\nprobation, parole, or supervised release revoked, the sentence for the instant\r\noffense should be imposed to run consecutively to the term imposed for the\r\nviolation of probation, parole, or supervised release in order to provide an\r\nincremental penalty for the violation of probation, parole, or supervised\r\nrelease. See §7B1.3 (Revocation of Probation or Supervised Release)\r\n(setting forth a policy that any imprisonment penalty imposed for violating\r\nprobation or supervised release should be consecutive to any sentence of\r\nimprisonment being served or subsequently imposed).\r\n7. Downward Departure Provision.—In the case of a discharged term of\r\nimprisonment, a downward departure is not prohibited if subsection (b)\r\nwould have applied to that term of imprisonment had the term been\r\nundischarged. Any such departure should be fashioned to achieve a\r\nreasonable punishment for the instant offense.\",\r\nand inserting the following:\r\nAmendment 660 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003\r\n\r\n\"2. Application of Subsection (b).—\r\n(A) In General.—Subsection (b) applies in cases in which all of the\r\nprior offense (i) is relevant conduct to the instant offense under the\r\nprovisions of subsection (a)(1), (a)(2), or (a)(3) of §1B1.3\r\n(Relevant Conduct); and (ii) has resulted in an increase in the\r\nChapter Two or Three offense level for the instant offense. Cases\r\nin which only part of the prior offense is relevant conduct to the\r\ninstant offense are covered under subsection (c).\r\n(B) Inapplicability of Subsection (b).—Subsection (b) does not apply\r\nin cases in which the prior offense increased the Chapter Two or\r\nThree offense level for the instant offense but was not relevant\r\nconduct to the instant offense under §1B1.3(a)(1), (a)(2), or (a)(3)\r\n(e.g., the prior offense is an aggravated felony for which the\r\ndefendant received an increase under §2L1.2 (Unlawfully Entering\r\nor Remaining in the United States), or the prior offense was a crime\r\nof violence for which the defendant received an increased base\r\noffense level under §2K2.1 (Unlawful Receipt, Possession, or\r\nTransportation of Firearms or Ammunition; Prohibited\r\nTransactions Involving Firearms or Ammunition)).\r\n(C) Imposition of Sentence.—If subsection (b) applies, and the court\r\nadjusts the sentence for a period of time already served, the court\r\nshould note on the Judgement in a Criminal Case Order (i) the\r\napplicable subsection (e.g., §5G1.3(b)); (ii) the amount of time by\r\nwhich the sentence is being adjusted; (iii) the undischarged term of\r\nimprisonment for which the adjustment is being given; and (iv) that\r\nthe sentence imposed is a sentence reduction pursuant to §5G1.3(b)\r\nfor a period of imprisonment that will not be credited by the Bureau\r\nof Prisons.\r\n(D) Example.—The following is an example in which subsection (b)\r\napplies and an adjustment to the sentence is appropriate:\r\nThe defendant is convicted of a federal offense charging the sale of\r\n40 grams of cocaine. Under §1B1.3, the defendant is held\r\naccountable for the sale of an additional 15 grams of cocaine, an\r\noffense for which the defendant has been convicted and sentenced\r\nin state court. The defendant received a nine-month sentence of\r\nimprisonment for the state offense and has served six months on\r\nthat sentence at the time of sentencing on the instant federal\r\noffense. The guideline range applicable to the defendant is 12-18\r\nmonths (Chapter Two offense level of level 16 for sale of 55 grams\r\nof cocaine; 3 level reduction for acceptance of responsibility; final\r\noffense level of level 13; Criminal History Category I). The court\r\ndetermines that a sentence of 13 months provides the appropriate\r\ntotal punishment. Because the defendant has already served six\r\nmonths on the related state charge as of the date of sentencing on\r\nthe instant federal offense, a sentence of seven months, imposed to\r\nNovember 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II Amendment 660\r\n\r\nrun concurrently with the three months remaining on the\r\ndefendant’s state sentence, achieves this result.\r\n3. Application of Subsection (c).—\r\n(A) In General.—Under subsection (c), the court may impose a\r\nsentence concurrently, partially concurrently, or consecutively to\r\nthe undischarged term of imprisonment. In order to achieve a\r\nreasonable incremental punishment for the instant offense and\r\navoid unwarranted disparity, the court should consider the\r\nfollowing:\r\n(i) the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. § 3584 (referencing\r\n18 U.S.C. § 3553(a));\r\n(ii) the type (e.g., determinate, indeterminate/parolable) and\r\nlength of the prior undischarged sentence;\r\n(iii) the time served on the undischarged sentence and the time\r\nlikely to be served before release;\r\n(iv) the fact that the prior undischarged sentence may have\r\nbeen imposed in state court rather than federal court, or at\r\na different time before the same or different federal court;\r\nand\r\n(v) any other circumstance relevant to the determination of an\r\nappropriate sentence for the instant offense.\r\n(B) Partially Concurrent Sentence.—In some cases under subsection\r\n(c), a partially concurrent sentence may achieve most appropriately\r\nthe desired result. To impose a partially concurrent sentence, the\r\ncourt may provide in the Judgment in a Criminal Case Order that\r\nthe sentence for the instant offense shall commence on the earlier\r\nof (i) when the defendant is released from the prior undischarged\r\nsentence; or (ii) on a specified date. This order provides for a fully\r\nconsecutive sentence if the defendant is released on the\r\nundischarged term of imprisonment on or before the date specified\r\nin the order, and a partially concurrent sentence if the defendant is\r\nnot released on the undischarged term of imprisonment by that\r\ndate.\r\n(C) Undischarged Terms of Imprisonment Resulting from Revocations\r\nof Probation, Parole or Supervised Release.—Subsection (c)\r\napplies in cases in which the defendant was on federal or state\r\nprobation, parole, or supervised release at the time of the instant\r\noffense and has had such probation, parole, or supervised release\r\nrevoked. Consistent with the policy set forth in Application Note\r\n4 and subsection (f) of §7B1.3 (Revocation of Probation or\r\nSupervised Release), the Commission recommends that the\r\nAmendment 660 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003\r\n\r\nsentence for the instant offense be imposed consecutively to the\r\nsentence imposed for the revocation.\r\n(D) Complex Situations.—Occasionally, the court may be faced with\r\na complex case in which a defendant may be subject to multiple\r\nundischarged terms of imprisonment that seemingly call for the\r\napplication of different rules. In such a case, the court may\r\nexercise its discretion in accordance with subsection (c) to fashion\r\na sentence of appropriate length and structure it to run in any\r\nappropriate manner to achieve a reasonable punishment for the\r\ninstant offense.\r\n(E) Downward Departure.—Unlike subsection (b), subsection (c) does\r\nnot authorize an adjustment of the sentence for the instant offense\r\nfor a period of imprisonment already served on the undischarged\r\nterm of imprisonment. However, in an extraordinary case\r\ninvolving an undischarged term of imprisonment under subsection\r\n(c), it may be appropriate for the court to downwardly depart. This\r\nmay occur, for example, in a case in which the defendant has\r\nserved a very substantial period of imprisonment on an\r\nundischarged term of imprisonment that resulted from conduct only\r\npartially within the relevant conduct for the instant offense. In such\r\na case, a downward departure may be warranted to ensure that the\r\ncombined punishment is not increased unduly by the fortuity and\r\ntiming of separate prosecutions and sentencings. Nevertheless, it\r\nis intended that a departure pursuant to this application note result\r\nin a sentence that ensures a reasonable incremental punishment for\r\nthe instant offense of conviction.\r\nTo avoid confusion with the Bureau of Prisons’ exclusive authority\r\nprovided under 18 U.S.C. § 3585(b) to grant credit for time served\r\nunder certain circumstances, the Commission recommends that any\r\ndownward departure under this application note be clearly stated on\r\nthe Judgment in a Criminal Case Order as a downward departure\r\npursuant to §5G1.3(c), rather than as a credit for time served.\r\n4. Downward Departure Provision.—In the case of a discharged term of\r\nimprisonment, a downward departure is not prohibited if the defendant (A)\r\nhas completed serving a term of imprisonment; and (B) subsection (b)\r\nwould have provided an adjustment had that completed term of\r\nimprisonment been undischarged at the time of sentencing for the instant\r\noffense. See §5K2.23 (Discharged Terms of Imprisonment).\".\r\nChapter Five, Part K, is amended by adding at the end the following new policy statement:\r\n\"§5K2.23. Discharged Terms of Imprisonment (Policy Statement)\r\nA sentence below the applicable guideline range may be\r\nappropriate if the defendant (1) has completed serving a term of\r\nimprisonment; and (2) subsection (b) of §5G1.3 (Imposition of a\r\n\r\nSentence on a Defendant Subject to Undischarged Term of\r\nImprisonment) would have provided an adjustment had that\r\ncompleted term of imprisonment been undischarged at the time of\r\nsentencing for the instant offense. Any such departure should be\r\nfashioned to achieve a reasonable punishment for the instant\r\noffense.\".","Reason":"Reason for Amendment: This amendment addresses a number of issues in §5G1.3\r\n(Imposition of a Sentence on a Defendant Subject to an Undischarged Term of\r\nImprisonment).\r\nFirst, this amendment clarifies the rule for application of subsection (b) (mandating a\r\nconcurrent term of imprisonment) with respect to a prior term of imprisonment by stating\r\nthat subsection (b) shall apply only to prior offenses that are relevant conduct to the instant\r\noffense of conviction and that resulted in an increase in the offense level for the instant\r\noffense. By clarifying the application of subsection (b), this amendment addresses\r\nconflicting litigation regarding the meaning of \"fully taken into account.\" Compare, e.g.,\r\nUnited States v. Garcia-Hernandez, 237 F.3d 105, 109 (2d Cir. 2000) (determining that a\r\nprior offense is \"fully taken into account\" if and only if the guidelines provide for sentencing\r\nas if both the offense of conviction and the separate offense had been prosecuted in a single\r\nproceeding), with United States v. Fuentes, 107 F.3d 1515, 1524 (11th Cir. 1997) (finding\r\nthat a prior offense has been \"fully taken into account\" when the prior offense is part of the\r\nsame course of conduct, common scheme, or plan).\r\nSecond, this amendment addresses how this guideline applies in cases in which an instant\r\noffense is committed while the defendant is on federal or state probation, parole, or\r\nsupervised release, and has had such probation, parole, or supervised release revoked. Under\r\nthis amendment, the sentence for the instant offense may be imposed concurrently, partially\r\nconcurrently, or consecutively to the undischarged term of imprisonment; however, the\r\nCommission recommends a consecutive sentence in this situation. This amendment also\r\nresolves a circuit conflict concerning whether the imposition of such sentence is required to\r\nbe consecutive. The amendment follows holdings of the Second, Third, and Tenth Circuits\r\nstating that imposition of sentence for the instant offense is not required to be consecutive\r\nto the sentence imposed upon revocation of probation, parole, or supervised release. See\r\nUnited States v. Maria, 186 F.3d 65, 70-73 (2d Cir. 1999); United States v. Swan, 275 F.3d\r\n272, 279-83 (3d Cir. 2002); United States v. Tisdale, 248 F.3d 964, 977-79 (10th Cir. 2001).\r\nThird, this amendment provides a new downward departure provision in §5K2.23\r\n(Discharged Terms of Imprisonment) regarding the effect of discharged terms of\r\nimprisonment. This provision replaces the departure provision previously set forth in\r\nApplication Note 7 of §5G1.3. By placing the departure provision in Chapter Five, Part K,\r\nthis amendment brings structural clarity to §5G1.3 because the guideline applies to\r\nundischarged, rather than discharged, terms of imprisonment. For ease of application, the\r\nnew commentary in §5G1.3 provides a reference to §5K2.23.\r\nFinally, this amendment addresses a circuit conflict regarding whether the sentencing court\r\nmay grant \"credit\" or adjust the instant sentence for time served on a prior undischarged term\r\ncovered under subsection (c). Compare Ruggiano v. Reish, 307 F.3d 121 (3d Cir. 2002)\r\n(federal sentencing court may grant such credit), with United States v. Fermin, 252 F.3d 102\r\nAmendment 660 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003\r\n\r\n(2d Cir. 2001) (court may not grant such credit). The amendment makes clear that the court\r\nmay not adjust or give \"credit\" for time served on an undischarged term of imprisonment\r\ncovered under subsection (c). However, the amendment adds commentary to §5G1.3 to\r\nprovide that courts may consider a downward departure in an extraordinary case, in order\r\nto achieve a reasonable punishment for the instant offense.","EffectiveDate":"Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2003."},{"Id":662,"Title":"Amendment 662","Text":"Section 1B1.1 is amended by inserting before subsection (a) the following\r\nnew paragraph:\r\n\"Except as specifically directed, the provisions of this manual are to be applied in\r\nthe following order:\".\r\nThe Commentary to §1B1.1 captioned \"Application Notes\" is amended by striking Note 4\r\nas follows:\r\n\"4.
