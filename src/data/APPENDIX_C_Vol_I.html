See &#167;1B1.3<br />(Relevant Conduct).",<br />and inserting in lieu thereof:<br />"See &#167;&#167;1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct) and 1B1.4 (Information to be Used in Imposing<br />Sentence).".</td><td>Reason for Amendment: The purposes of this amendment are to correct a clerical error and<br /><br />to clarify the operation of the guidelines.</td><td>Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is January 15, 1988.</td></tr><tr><td class="n">3</td><td>Amendment 3</td><td>Chapter One, Part B is amended by deleting &#167;1B1.3 in its entirety as follows:<br />"&#167;1B1.3. Relevant Conduct<br />To determine the seriousness of the offense conduct, all conduct,<br />circumstances, and injuries relevant to the offense of conviction shall be<br />taken into account.<br />(a) Unless otherwise specified under the guidelines, conduct and<br />circumstances relevant to the offense of conviction means:<br />acts or omissions committed or aided and abetted by the<br />defendant, or by a person for whose conduct the defendant is<br />legally accountable, that (1) are part of the same course of<br />conduct, or a common scheme or plan, as the offense of<br />conviction, or (2) are relevant to the defendant’s state of mind or<br />motive in committing the offense of conviction, or (3) indicate<br />the defendant’s degree of dependence upon criminal activity for<br />a livelihood.<br />(b) Injury relevant to the offense of conviction means harm which is<br />caused intentionally, recklessly or by criminal negligence in the<br />course of conduct relevant to the offense of conviction.<br />Commentary<br />Application Note:<br />1. In sentencing, the court should consider all relevant offense and offender<br />characteristics. For purposes of assessing offense conduct, the relevant conduct<br />and circumstances of the offense of conviction are as follows:<br />a. conduct directed toward preparation for or commission of the offense of<br />conviction, and efforts to avoid detection and responsibility for the<br />offense of conviction;<br />b. conduct indicating that the offense of conviction was to some degree part<br />of a broader purpose, scheme, or plan;<br />c. conduct that is relevant to the state of mind or motive of the defendant in<br />committing the crime;<br />d. conduct that is relevant to the defendant’s involvement in crime as a<br />livelihood.<br />The first three criteria are derived from two sources, Rule 8(a) of the<br />Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, governing joinder of similar or related<br /><br />offenses, and Rule 404(b) of the Federal Rules of Evidence, permitting admission<br />of evidence of other crimes to establish motive, intent, plan, and common<br />scheme. These rules provide standards that govern consideration at trial of<br />crimes "of the same or similar character," and utilize concepts and terminology<br />familiar to judges, prosecutors, and defenders. The governing standard should<br />be liberally construed in favor of considering information generally appropriate<br />to sentencing. When other crimes are inadmissible under the Rule 404(b)<br />standard, such crimes may not be "relevant to the offense of conviction" under<br />the criteria that determine this question for purposes of Chapter Two; such crimes<br />would, however, be considered in determining the relevant offender<br />characteristics to the extent authorized by Chapter Three (Adjustments), and<br />Chapter Four (Criminal History and Criminal Livelihood) and Chapter Five,<br />Part H (Specific Offender Characteristics). This construction is consistent with<br />the existing rule that "[n]o limitation shall be placed on the information<br />concerning the background, character, and conduct of a person convicted of an<br />offense . . . for the purpose of imposing an appropriate sentence," 18 U.S.C.<br />&#167; 3577, so long as the information "has sufficient indicia of reliability to support<br />its probable accuracy." United States v. Marshall, 519 F. Supp. 751 (D. Wis.<br />1981), aff’d, 719 F.2d 887 (7th Cir. 1983).<br />The last of these criteria is intended to ensure that a judge may consider<br />at sentencing, information that, although not specifically within other criteria of<br />relevance, indicates that the defendant engages in crime for a living. Inclusion<br />of this information in sentencing considerations is consistent with 28 U.S.C. &#167;<br />994(d)(11).".<br />A replacement guideline with accompanying commentary is inserted as &#167;1B1.3 (Relevant<br />Conduct (Factors that Determine the Guideline Range)).</td><td>Reason for Amendment: The purpose of this amendment is to clarify the guideline. The<br />amended language restates the intent of &#167;1B1.3 as originally promulgated.</td><td>Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is January 15, 1988.</td></tr><tr><td class="n">4</td><td>Amendment 4</td><td>Chapter One, Part B is amended by deleting &#167;1B1.4 in its entirety as follows:<br />"&#167;1B1.4. Determining the Offense Level<br />In determining the offense level:<br />(a) determine the base offense level from Chapter Two;<br />(b) make any applicable adjustments for specific offense<br />characteristics from Chapter Two in the order listed;<br />(c) make any applicable adjustments from Chapter Three;<br />(d) make any applicable adjustments from Chapter Four, Part B<br />(Career Offenders and Criminal Livelihood).<br />Commentary<br /><br />Application Notes:<br />1. A particular guideline (in the base offense level or in a specific offense<br />characteristic) may expressly direct that a particular factor be applied only if the<br />defendant was convicted of a particular statute. E.g., in &#167;2K2.3, a base offense<br />level of 12 is used "if convicted under 26 U.S.C. &#167; 5861." Unless such an express<br />direction is included, conviction under the statute is not required. Thus, use of<br />a statutory reference to describe a particular set of circumstances does not require<br />a conviction under the referenced statute. Examples of this usage are found in<br />&#167;2K1.3(b)(4) ("if the defendant was a person prohibited from receiving<br />explosives under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 842(i), or if the defendant knowingly distributed<br />explosives to a person prohibited from receiving explosives under 18 U.S.C. &#167;<br />842(i), increase by 10 levels"); and &#167;2A3.4(b)(2) ("if the abusive contact was<br />accomplished as defined in 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2242, increase by 4 levels"). In such<br />cases, the particular circumstances described are to be evaluated under the<br />"relevant conduct" standard of &#167;1B1.3.<br />2. Once the appropriate base offense level is determined, all specific offense<br />characteristics are to be applied in the order listed.<br />3. The offense level adjustments from more than one specific offense characteristic<br />within an offense guideline are cumulative (added together) unless the guideline<br />specifies that only the greater (or greatest) is to be used. Within each specific<br />offense characteristic subsection, however, the offense level adjustments are<br />alternative; only the one that best describes the conduct is to be used. E.g., in<br />&#167;2A2.2(b)(3), pertaining to degree of bodily injury, the subsection that best<br />describes the level of bodily injury is used; the adjustments from different<br />degrees of bodily injury (subsections (A), (B) and (C)) are not added together).<br />4. The adjustments in Chapter Three that may apply include Part A (Victim-Related<br />Adjustments), Part B (Role in the Offense), Part C (Obstruction), Part D<br />(Multiple Counts), and Part E (Acceptance of Responsibility).".<br />A replacement guideline with accompanying commentary is inserted as &#167;1B1.4 (Information<br />to be Used in Imposing Sentence (Selecting a Point Within the Guideline Range or Departing<br />from the Guidelines)).</td><td>Reason for Amendment: The purposes of this amendment are to remove material made<br />redundant by the reorganization of this Part and to replace it with material that clarifies the<br />operation of the guidelines. The material formerly in this section is now covered by &#167;1B1.1.</td><td>Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is January 15, 1988.</td></tr><tr><td class="n">5</td><td>Amendment 5</td><td>Chapter One, Part B, is amended by inserting an additional guideline with<br />accompanying commentary as &#167;1B1.8 (Use of Certain Information).</td><td>Reason for Amendment: The purpose of this amendment is to facilitate cooperation<br />agreements by ensuring that certain information revealed by a defendant, as part of an<br />agreement to cooperate with the government by providing information concerning unlawful<br />activities of others, will not be used to increase the guideline sentence.</td><td>Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is June 15, 1988.</td></tr><tr><td class="n">6</td><td>Amendment 6</td><td>Chapter One, Part B, is amended by inserting an additional guideline with<br />accompanying commentary as &#167;1B1.9 (Petty Offenses).</td><td>Reason for Amendment: The purpose of this guideline is to delete coverage of petty offenses.</td><td>Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is June 15, 1988.</td></tr><tr><td class="n">7</td><td>Amendment 7</td><td>Section 2B1.1(b)(1) is amended by deleting "value of the property taken" and<br />inserting in lieu thereof "loss".<br />The Commentary to &#167;2B1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 2 by deleting:<br />"Loss is to be based upon replacement cost to the victim or market value of the property,<br />whichever is greater.",<br />and inserting in lieu thereof:<br />"‘Loss’ means the value of the property taken, damaged, or destroyed. Ordinarily, when<br />property is taken or destroyed the loss is the fair market value of the particular property<br />at issue. Where the market value is difficult to ascertain or inadequate to measure harm<br />to the victim, the court may measure loss in some other way, such as reasonable<br />replacement cost to the victim. When property is damaged the loss is the cost of repairs,<br />not to exceed the loss had the property been destroyed. In cases of partially completed<br />conduct, the loss is to be determined in accordance with the provisions of &#167;2X1.1<br />(Attempt, Solicitation, or Conspiracy Not Covered by a Specific Guideline). E.g., in the<br />case of the theft of a government check or money order, loss refers to the loss that would<br />have occurred if the check or money order had been cashed. Similarly, if a defendant is<br />apprehended in the process of taking a vehicle, the loss refers to the value of the vehicle<br />even if the vehicle is recovered immediately.".</td><td>Reason for Amendment: The purpose of this amendment is to clarify the guideline in respect<br />to the determination of loss.</td><td>Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is June 15, 1988.</td></tr><tr><td class="n">8</td><td>Amendment 8</td><td>Section 2B1.2 is amended by transposing the texts of subsections (b)(2) and (3).<br />The Commentary to &#167;2B1.2 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by deleting:<br />"3. For consistency with &#167;2B1.1, it is the Commission’s intent that specific offense<br />characteristic (b)(3) be applied before (b)(2).",<br />and by renumbering Note 4 as Note 3.</td><td>Reason for Amendment: The purpose of this amendment is to correct a clerical error in the<br />guideline.

For a felony<br /><br />or a class A misdemeanor (see 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 3559(a) and 3581(b)), the court is directed<br />to apply the most analogous guideline.

An inquiry as to whether there is a sufficiently analogous guideline that might<br />be applied is not required. The Commission makes this distinction in treatment because<br />for many lesser offenses (e.g., traffic infractions), generally handled under assimilative<br />offense provisions by magistrates, there will be no sufficiently analogous guideline, and<br />a case-by-case determination in respect to this issue for the high volume of cases<br />processed each year would be unduly burdensome and would not significantly reduce<br />disparity.".<br />A replacement guideline with accompanying commentary is inserted as &#167;2X5.1 (Other<br />Offenses).</td><td>Reason for Amendment: The purposes of this amendment are to make the section a binding<br />guideline (as the Commission originally intended with respect to felonies and Class A<br />misdemeanors) rather than a policy statement, to delete language relating to petty offenses, and<br />to conform and clarify the commentary.</td><td>Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is June 15, 1988.</td></tr><tr><td class="n">44</td><td>Amendment 44</td><td>The Commentary to &#167;3A1.2 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note<br />1 by deleting:<br />" ‘Victim’ refers to an individual directly victimized by the offense.

A specific offense characteristic, for<br />example, might require an increase of four levels for serious bodily injury but two levels<br />for bodily injury. Rather than requiring a court to force middle instances into either the<br />‘serious’ or the ‘simple’ category, the guideline commentary suggests that the court may<br />interpolate and select a midpoint increase of three levels. The Commission has decided<br />to call such an interpolation a ‘departure’ in light of the legal views that a guideline<br />providing for a range of increases in offense levels may violate the statute’s 25 percent<br />rule (though other have presented contrary legal arguments). Since interpolations are<br />technically departures, the courts will have to provide reasons for their selection, and it<br />will be subject to review for ‘reasonableness’ on appeal. The Commission believes,<br />however, that a simple reference by the court to the ‘mid-category’ nature of the facts<br />will typically provide sufficient reason. It does not foresee serious practical problems<br />arising out of the application of the appeal provisions to this form of departure.";<br />in the first sentence of the fifth paragraph by deleting "second" and inserting in lieu thereof<br />"first"; and, in the first sentence of the sixth paragraph by deleting "third" and inserting in lieu<br />thereof "second".</td><td>Reason for Amendment: The purpose of this amendment is to eliminate references to<br />interpolation as a special type of departure. The Commission has reviewed the discussion of<br />interpolation in Chapter One, which has been read as describing "interpolation" as a departure<br />from an offense level rather than from the guideline range established after the determination<br />of an offense level. The Commission concluded that it is simpler to add intermediate offense<br />level adjustments to the guidelines in the cases where interpolation is most likely to be<br />considered (i.e., degree of bodily injury). This amendment is not intended to preclude<br />interpolation in other cases; where appropriate, the court will be able to achieve the same result<br />by use of the regular departure provisions.</td><td>Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1989.</td></tr><tr><td class="n">69</td><td>Amendment 69</td><td>Section 1B1.1(a) is amended by deleting "guideline section in Chapter Two<br />most applicable to the statute of conviction" and inserting in lieu thereof "applicable offense<br />guideline section from Chapter Two", and by deleting the last sentence as follows: "If more<br />than one guideline is referenced for the particular statute, select the guideline most appropriate<br />for the conduct of which the defendant was convicted.".</td><td>Reason for Amendment: The purposes of this amendment are to clarify the guideline and<br />conform the language to &#167;1B1.2.</td><td>Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1989.</td></tr><tr><td class="n">70</td><td>Amendment 70</td><td>Section 1B1.1(e) is amended by deleting the last sentence as follows: "The<br />resulting offense level is the total offense level.".<br />Section 1B1.1(g) is amended by deleting "total", and by inserting "determined above"<br />immediately following "category".</td><td>Reason for Amendment: The purpose of this amendment is to clarify the guideline.</td><td>Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1989.</td></tr><tr><td class="n">71</td><td>Amendment 71</td><td>The Commentary to &#167;1B1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note<br />1(c) by deleting "firearm or other dangerous weapon" and inserting in lieu thereof "dangerous<br />weapon (including a firearm)".<br />The Commentary to &#167;1B1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 1(d) by<br />inserting the following additional sentence at the end: "Where an object that appeared to be a<br />dangerous weapon was brandished, displayed, or possessed, treat the object as a dangerous<br />weapon.".<br />The Commentary to &#167;1B1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 1(g) by deleting<br />"firearm or other dangerous weapon" the first time it appears and inserting in lieu thereof<br />"dangerous weapon (including a firearm)".<br />The Commentary to &#167;1B1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by inserting the<br />following additional note:<br />"5.

Subsections (c) and (d) address circumstances in which the provisions of Chapter<br />Three, Part D (Multiple Counts) are to be applied although there may be only one<br />count of conviction. Subsection (c) provides that in the case of a stipulation to<br />the commission of additional offense(s), the guidelines are to be applied as if the<br />defendant had been convicted of an additional count for each of the offenses<br />stipulated. For example, if the defendant is convicted of one count of robbery<br />but, as part of a plea agreement, admits to having committed two additional<br />robberies, the guidelines are to be applied as if the defendant had been convicted<br />of three counts of robbery. Subsection (d) provides that a conviction on a<br />conspiracy count charging conspiracy to commit more than one offense is treated<br />as if the defendant had been convicted of a separate conspiracy count for each<br />offense that he conspired to commit. For example, where a conviction on a single<br />count of conspiracy establishes that the defendant conspired to commit three<br />robberies, the guidelines are to be applied as if the defendant had been convicted<br />on one count of conspiracy to commit the first robbery, one count of conspiracy<br />to commit the second robbery, and one count of conspiracy to commit the third<br />robbery.<br />5. Particular care must be taken in applying subsection (d) because there are cases<br />in which the jury’s verdict does not establish which offense(s) was the object of<br />the conspiracy. In such cases, subsection (d) should only be applied with respect<br />to an object offense alleged in the conspiracy count if the court, were it sitting as<br />a trier of fact, would convict the defendant of conspiring to commit that object<br />offense. Note, however, if the object offenses specified in the conspiracy count<br />would be grouped together under &#167;3D1.2(d) (e.g., a conspiracy to steal three<br />government checks) it is not necessary to engage in the foregoing analysis,<br />because &#167;1B1.3(a)(2) governs consideration of the defendant’s conduct.".</td><td>Reason for Amendment: The purpose of this amendment is to add a guideline subsection<br />(subsection (d)) expressly providing that a conviction of conspiracy to commit more than one<br />offense is treated for guideline purposes as if the defendant had been convicted of a separate<br />conspiracy count for each offense that the defendant conspired to commit. The current<br />instruction in Application Note 9 of &#167;3D1.2 is inadequate. For consistency, material now<br />contained at &#167;1B1.2(a) concerning stipulations to having committed additional offenses is<br />moved to a new subsection (subsection (c)).<br />Additional commentary (Application Note 5) is provided to address cases in which the jury’s<br /><br />verdict does not specify how many or which offenses were the object of the conspiracy of<br />which the defendant was convicted. Compare United States v. Johnson, 713 F.2d 633, 645-46<br />(11th Cir. 1983) (conviction stands if there is sufficient proof with respect to any one of the<br />objectives) cert. denied sub nom. Wilkins v. United States, 465 U.S. 1081 (1984) with United<br />States v. Tarnopol, 561 F.2d 466 (3d Cir. 1977) (failure of proof with respect to any one of the<br />objectives renders the conspiracy conviction invalid). In order to maintain consistency with<br />other &#167;1B1.2(a) determinations, this decision should be governed by a reasonable doubt<br />standard. A higher standard of proof should govern the creation of what is, in effect, a new<br />count of conviction for the purposes of Chapter Three, Part D (Multiple Counts). Because the<br />guidelines do not explicitly establish standards of proof, the proposed new application note calls<br />upon the court to determine which offense(s) was the object of the conspiracy as if it were<br />"sitting as a trier of fact." The foregoing determination is not required, however, in the case of<br />offenses that are grouped together under &#167;3D1.2(d) (e.g., fraud and theft) because &#167;1B1.3(a)(2)<br />governs consideration of the defendant’s conduct.</td><td>Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1989.</td></tr><tr><td class="n">76</td><td>Amendment 76</td><td>Section 1B1.3 is amended in subsection (a)(3) by deleting "or risk of harm"<br />immediately following "all harm", and by deleting "if the harm or risk was caused intentionally,<br />recklessly or by criminal negligence, and all harm or risk" and inserting in lieu thereof "and all<br />harm".<br />Section 1B1.3(a) is amended by deleting:<br />"(4) the defendant’s state of mind, intent, motive and purpose in committing the<br />offense; and",<br />by renumbering subsection (a)(5) as (a)(4), and by inserting "and" at the end of subsection<br />(a)(3) immediately following the semicolon.<br />The Commentary to &#167;1B1.3 captioned "Background" is amended by deleting:<br />" Subsection (a)(4) requires consideration of the defendant’s ‘state of mind, intent,<br />motive or purpose in committing the offense.’ The defendant’s state of mind is an<br />element of the offense that may constitute a specific offense characteristic.

Defendant A, one of ten off-loaders hired by Defendant B, was convicted of<br />importation of marihuana, as a result of his assistance in off-loading a boat containing<br />a one-ton shipment of marihuana. Regardless of the number of bales of marihuana that<br />he actually unloaded, and notwithstanding any claim on his part that he was neither<br />aware of, nor could reasonably foresee, that the boat contained this quantity of<br />marihuana, Defendant A is held accountable for the entire one-ton quantity of marihuana<br />on the boat because he aided and abetted the unloading, and hence the importation, of the<br />entire shipment.<br />b. Defendant C, the getaway driver in an armed bank robbery in which $15,000 is<br />taken and a teller is injured, is convicted of the substantive count of bank robbery.<br />Defendant C is accountable for the money taken because he aided and abetted the taking<br />of the money. He is accountable for the injury inflicted because he participated in<br />concerted criminal conduct that he could reasonably foresee might result in the infliction<br />of injury.<br />c. Defendant D pays Defendant E a small amount to forge an endorsement on an<br />$800 stolen government check. Unknown to Defendant E, Defendant D then uses that<br />check as a down payment in a scheme to fraudulently obtain $15,000 worth of<br />merchandise. Defendant E is convicted of forging the $800 check. Defendant E is not<br />accountable for the $15,000 because the fraudulent scheme to obtain $15,000 was<br />beyond the scope of, and not reasonably foreseeable in connection with, the criminal<br />activity he jointly undertook with Defendant D.<br />d. Defendants F and G, working together, design and execute a scheme to sell<br />fraudulent stocks by telephone. Defendant F fraudulently obtains $20,000. Defendant<br /><br />G fraudulently obtains $35,000. Each is convicted of mail fraud. Each defendant is<br />accountable for the entire amount ($55,000) because each aided and abetted the other in<br />the fraudulent conduct. Alternatively, because Defendants F and G engaged in concerted<br />criminal activity, each is accountable for the entire $55,000 loss because the conduct of<br />each was in furtherance of the jointly undertaken criminal activity and was reasonably<br />foreseeable.<br />e. Defendants H and I engaged in an ongoing marihuana importation conspiracy in<br />which Defendant J was hired only to help off-load a single shipment. Defendants H, I,<br />and J are included in a single count charging conspiracy to import marihuana. For the<br />purposes of determining the offense level under this guideline, Defendant J is<br />accountable for the entire single shipment of marihuana he conspired to help import and<br />any acts or omissions in furtherance of the importation that were reasonably foreseeable.<br />He is not accountable for prior or subsequent shipments of marihuana imported by<br />Defendants H or I if those acts were beyond the scope of, and not reasonably<br />foreseeable in connection with, the criminal activity he agreed to jointly undertake with<br />Defendants H and I (i.e., the importation of the single shipment of marihuana).".</td><td>Reason for Amendment: The purpose of this amendment is to clarify the definition of<br />conduct for which the defendant is "otherwise accountable."</td><td>Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1989.</td></tr><tr><td class="n">79</td><td>Amendment 79</td><td>Section 1B1.5 is amended by deleting "adjustments for" immediately following<br />"all applicable", and by inserting "and cross references" immediately before the period at the<br />end of the sentence.<br />The Commentary to &#167;1B1.5 captioned "Application Note" is amended in Note 1 by inserting<br />"and cross references" immediately before "as well as the base offense level".</td><td>Reason for Amendment: The purpose of this amendment is to clarify the guideline and<br />commentary.</td><td>Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1989.</td></tr><tr><td class="n">80</td><td>Amendment 80</td><td>The Commentary to &#167;1B1.5 captioned "Application Note" is amended in Note<br />1 by deleting the last sentence as follows: "If the victim was vulnerable, the adjustment from<br />&#167;3A1.1 (Vulnerable Victim) also would apply.".</td><td>Reason for Amendment: The purpose of this amendment is to delete an unnecessary sentence.<br />No substantive change is made.</td><td>Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1989.</td></tr><tr><td class="n">81</td><td>Amendment 81</td><td>Section 1B1.9 is amended in the title by deleting "Petty Offenses" and inserting<br />in lieu thereof "Class B or C Misdemeanors and Infractions".<br /><br />Section 1B1.9 is amended by deleting "(petty offense)" immediately following "infraction".<br />The Commentary to &#167;1B1.9 captioned "Application Notes is amended in the first sentence of<br />Note 1 by deleting "petty offense" and inserting in lieu thereof "Class B or C misdemeanor or<br />an infraction", in the second sentence of Note 1 by deleting "A petty offense is any offense for<br />which the maximum sentence that may be imposed does not exceed six months’ imprisonment."<br />and inserting in lieu thereof "A Class B misdemeanor is any offense for which the maximum<br />authorized term of imprisonment is more than thirty days but not more than six months; a Class<br />C misdemeanor is any offense for which the maximum authorized term of imprisonment is<br />more than five days but not more than thirty days; an infraction is any offense for which the<br />maximum authorized term of imprisonment is not more than five days.", in the first sentence<br />of Note 2 by deleting "petty offenses" and inserting in lieu thereof "Class B or C misdemeanors<br />or infractions", in the second sentence of Note 2 by deleting "petty" and inserting in lieu thereof<br />"such", in the third sentence of Note 2 by deleting "petty offense" and inserting in lieu thereof<br />"Class B or C misdemeanor or infraction" and, in Note 3 by deleting:<br />"3.

Section 7089 of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 revises the<br />definition of a petty offense so that it no longer exactly corresponds with a Class B or C<br />misdemeanor or infraction. Under the revised definition, a Class B or C misdemeanor or<br />infraction that has an authorized fine of more than $5,000 for an individual (or more than<br />$10,000 for an organization) will not be a petty offense. This legislative revision does not<br />affect the maximum terms of imprisonment authorized. The maximum authorized term of<br />imprisonment remains controlled by the grade of the offense (i.e., the maximum term of<br />imprisonment remains five days for an infraction, thirty days for a Class C misdemeanor, and<br />six months for a Class B misdemeanor). Because the statutory grade of the offense (i.e., a Class<br />B or C misdemeanor or an infraction) is the more relevant definition for guideline purposes, this<br />amendment deletes the references in &#167;1B1.9 to "petty offenses" and in lieu thereof inserts<br />references to "Class B and C misdemeanors and infractions."</td><td>Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1989.</td></tr><tr><td class="n">82</td><td>Amendment 82</td><td>The Commentary to &#167;2A1.1 captioned "Statutory Provision" is amended by<br />deleting "Provision" and inserting in lieu thereof "Provisions", and by inserting "; 21 U.S.C.<br />&#167; 848(e)" at the end immediately before the period.<br />The Commentary to &#167;2A1.1 captioned "Application Note" is amended in the caption by<br />deleting "Note" and inserting in lieu thereof "Notes", and by inserting the following additional<br />note:<br />"2.

In contrast, the fraud and theft guidelines generally provide a 2-level<br />increase in cases of repeated instances under the second prong of the "more than minimal<br />planning" definition.<br />Unlike the theft and fraud guidelines, it is arguable that the value of any bribe that was part of<br />the same course of conduct or a common scheme or plan as the offense of conviction, but not<br />included in the count of conviction, is excluded from consideration. This is because<br />&#167;1B1.3(a)(2), which authorizes consideration of conduct not expressly included in the offense<br />of conviction but part of the same course of conduct or common scheme or plan, applies only<br />to offenses grouped under &#167;3D1.2(d). Thus, if the defendant pleads to one count of a bribery<br />offense involving one $10,000 bribe in satisfaction of a 15 count indictment involving an<br />additional $80,000 in separate bribes that were part of the same course of conduct, the current<br />bribery guideline, unlike the theft and fraud guidelines, would not take into account the<br />additional $80,000, and there would be no increase for repeated instances.<br />The current guideline may also create various anomalies because the multiple count rule (which<br />applies only where the offenses are not grouped under &#167;3D1.2(b)) increases the offense level<br />differently than the monetary table. For example, an elected public official who takes three<br />unrelated $200 bribes has an offense level of 21; the same defendant who took two unrelated<br />$500,000 bribes would have an offense level of 20.</td><td>Reason for Amendment: The purpose of this amendment is to address the above noted issues.<br />A specific offense characteristic is added to provide a 2-level increase where the offense<br />involved more than one bribe or gratuity. In addition, such offenses will be grouped under<br />&#167;3D1.2(d) which allows for aggregation of the amount of the bribes from the same course of<br />conduct or common scheme or plan under &#167;1B1.3(a)(2) (as in theft and fraud offenses).</td><td>Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1989.</td></tr><tr><td class="n">122</td><td>Amendment 122</td><td>The Commentary to &#167;2C1.1 captioned "Background" is amended in the eighth<br />paragraph by deleting "extortions, conspiracies, and attempts" and inserting in lieu thereof<br />"extortion, or attempted extortion,".</td><td>Reason for Amendment: The purpose of this amendment is to correct a technical error.

For example, if there are three drug offenses of conviction<br />and only one involves juveniles in trafficking, add the amount from the first and<br />second offense, double the amount for the offense involving juveniles, and total.<br />Use that total to determine the base offense level.<br />2. The reference to the level from &#167;2D1.1 includes the base offense level plus the<br />specific offense characteristic dealing with a weapon. Under &#167;2D1.1(b)(1) there<br />is a 2-level increase for possession of a firearm or other dangerous weapon<br />during commission of the offense.<br /><br />Background: The statute addressed by this section punishes any person eighteen years<br />of age or older who knowingly employs or uses any person younger than eighteen to<br />violate or to conceal any violation of any provision of Title 21. Section 845b provides<br />a minimum mandatory period of imprisonment of one year. An increased penalty for the<br />employment or use of persons fourteen years of age or younger reflects the enhanced<br />sentence authorized by 21 U.S.C. &#167; 845b(d).<br />&#167;2D1.3. Distributing Controlled Substances to Individuals Younger than Twenty-<br />One Years, To Pregnant Women, or Within 1000 Feet of a School or<br />College<br />(a) Base Offense Level:<br />(1) Level from &#167;2D1.1, corresponding to double the drug<br />amount involved, but in no event less than level 13, for<br />distributing a controlled substance to a pregnant woman;<br />(2) (A) Level from &#167;2D1.1, corresponding to double the<br />drug amount involved, but in no event less than<br />level 13, for distributing a controlled substance<br />other than five grams or less of marihuana to an<br />individual under the age of twenty-one years; or<br />(B) Level from &#167;2D1.1, corresponding to double the<br />drug amount involved, but in no event less than<br />level 13, for distributing or manufacturing a<br />controlled substance other than five grams or<br />less of marihuana within 1000 feet of a<br />schoolyard.<br />Commentary<br />Statutory Provisions: 21 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 845, 845a.<br />Application Notes:<br />1. The provisions addressed by this section contain a mandatory minimum period<br />of imprisonment of one year. The base offense level is determined as in &#167;2D1.2.<br />If both subsections (a)(1) and (a)(2) apply to a single distribution (e.g., the<br />distribution of 10 grams of a controlled substance to a pregnant woman under<br />twenty-one years of age), the enhancements are applied cumulatively, i.e., by<br />using four times rather than two times the amount distributed. However, only<br />one of the enhancements in &#167;2D1.3(a)(2) shall apply in a given case.<br />2. If multiple drugs or offenses occur, determine the offense level as described in<br />the Commentary to &#167;2D1.2.<br />3. The reference to the level from &#167;2D1.1 includes the base offense level plus the<br />specific offense characteristic dealing with a weapon. Under &#167;2D1.1(b)(1) there<br />is a 2-level increase for possession of a firearm, or other dangerous weapon<br /><br />during the commission of the offense.<br />Background: The guideline sentences for distribution of controlled substances to<br />individuals under twenty-one years of age or within 1000 feet of a school or college treat<br />the distribution of less than five grams of marihuana less harshly than other controlled<br />substances. This distinction is based on the statutory provisions that specifically exempt<br />convictions for the distribution of less than five grams of marihuana from the mandatory<br />minimum one-year imprisonment requirement.".<br />A replacement guideline with accompanying commentary is inserted as &#167;2D1.2 (Drug Offenses<br />Occurring Near Protected Locations or Involving Underage or Pregnant Individuals).</td><td>Reason for Amendment: The purposes of this amendment are to implement the directive in<br />Section 6454 of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988, and to expand the coverage of the guideline<br />to include the provision of Sections 6458 and 6459 of that Act. The amendment also covers<br />the provisions of 21 U.S.C. &#167; 845, 845a, and 845b not included in the statutory direction to the<br />Commission.</td><td>Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1989.</td></tr><tr><td class="n">136</td><td>Amendment 136</td><td>The Commentary to &#167;2D1.4 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note<br />1 by deleting:<br />"Where the defendant was not reasonably capable of producing the negotiated amount,<br />the court may depart and impose a sentence lower than the sentence that would otherwise<br />result.",<br />and inserting in lieu thereof:<br />"However, where the court finds that the defendant did not intend to produce and was<br />not reasonably capable of producing the negotiated amount, the court shall exclude from<br />the guideline calculation the amount that it finds the defendant did not intend to produce<br />and was not reasonably capable of producing.".</td><td>Reason for Amendment: Application Note 1 currently provides that the "weight under<br />negotiation in an uncompleted distribution shall be used to calculate the applicable amount."<br />The instruction then provides "Where the defendant was not reasonably capable of producing<br />the negotiated amount the court may depart and impose a sentence lower than the sentence that<br />would otherwise result." This provision may result in inflated offense levels in uncompleted<br />offenses where a defendant is merely "puffing," even though the court is then authorized to<br />address the situation by a downward departure.

Under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 921(a)(3),<br />the term ‘firearm’ means (A) any weapon (including a starter gun) which will or<br />is designed to or may readily be converted to expel a projectile by the action of<br /><br />an explosive; (B) the frame or receiver of any such weapon; (C) any firearm<br />muffler or firearm silencer; or (D) any destructive device.

Because there exist a large number of<br />overlapping statutory provisions, the three basic guidelines, &#167;2K2.1 (Possession by a prohibited<br />person), &#167;2K2.2 (Possession of certain types of weapons), and &#167;2K2.3 (Unlawful trafficking)<br />are not closely tied to the actual conduct. The amendment addresses this issue by consolidating<br />the current three guidelines into two guidelines: (1) unlawful possession, receipt, or<br />transportation, and (2) unlawful trafficking; and by more carefully drawing the distinctions<br />between the base offense levels provided. The third guideline in this amendment is a new<br />guideline to address transfer of a weapon with intent or knowledge that it will be used to<br />commit another offense (formerly covered in a cross reference) and a new offense added by the<br />Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 (Section 6211)(Interstate travel to acquire a firearm for a criminal<br />purpose).<br />The base offense level for conduct covered by the current &#167;2K2.1 is increased in the<br /><br />amendment from 9 to 12. The statutorily authorized maximum sentence for the conduct<br />covered under &#167;2K2.1 was increased from five to ten years by the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of<br />1988 (Section 6462). Note, however, that the most aggravated conduct under &#167;2K2.1<br />(possession of a weapon during commission of another offense) is handled by the cross-<br />reference at subsection (c) and is based upon the offense level for an attempt to commit the<br />underlying offense. See Background Commentary to current &#167;2K2.1. The offense level for<br />unlawful possession of a machine gun, sawed off shotgun, or destructive device is increased<br />from 12 to 16. In addition, the amendment raises the enhancement for stolen weapons or<br />obliterated serial numbers from 1 to 2 levels to better reflect the seriousness of this conduct.<br />The numbers currently used in the table for the distribution of multiple weapons in &#167;2K2.2 are<br />amended to increase the offense level more rapidly for sale of multiple weapons.</td><td>Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1989.</td></tr><tr><td class="n">190</td><td>Amendment 190</td><td>Section 2K2.4 is amended by deleting "penalties are those" and inserting in lieu<br />thereof "term of imprisonment is that".<br />The Commentary to &#167;2K2.4 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by inserting the<br />following additional note:<br />"3.

This guideline<br />shall be used as a consolidated fine guideline for both the underlying<br />offense and the conviction underlying this section.".<br />The Commentary to &#167;2K2.4 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by inserting the<br />following additional note:<br />"4. Subsection (b) sets forth special provisions concerning the imposition of fines.<br />Where there is also a conviction for the underlying offense, a consolidated fine<br />guideline is determined by the offense level that would have applied to the<br />underlying offense absent a conviction under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c) or 929(a). This<br />is because the offense level for the underlying offense may be reduced when<br />there is also a conviction under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c) or 929(a) in that any specific<br />offense characteristic for possession, use, or discharge of a firearm is not applied<br />(see Application Note 2).

The court has<br />discretion to impose a sentence of up to 6 months imprisonment for a Class B misdemeanor<br />(Class B or C misdemeanors and infractions are not covered by the guidelines; see &#167;1B1.9).<br />It appears anomalous that the Commission guidelines allow less discretion for certain felonies<br /><br />and Class A misdemeanors. In fact, in certain cases, a plea to a reduced charge of a Class B<br />misdemeanor could result in a higher potential sentence because the sentence for the felony or<br />Class A misdemeanor might be restricted to less than 6 months by the guidelines. This can<br />happen when the Sentencing Table provides a guideline range of 0-1 month, 0-2 months, 0-3,<br />0-4, or 0-5 months. These very narrow ranges are not required by statute, which allows a 6<br />month guideline range in such cases.

The Statutory Mission<br />The Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984 foresees guidelines that will<br />further the basic purposes of criminal punishment, i.e., deterring crime, incapacitating<br />the offender, providing just punishment, and rehabilitating the offender. It delegates to<br />the Commission broad authority to review and rationalize the federal sentencing process.<br />The statute contains many detailed instructions as to how this determination<br />should be made, but the most important of them instructs the Commission to create<br />Amendment 305 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003<br /><br />categories of offense behavior and offender characteristics. An offense behavior<br />category might consist, for example, of ‘bank robbery/committed with a gun/$2500<br />taken.’ An offender characteristic category might be ‘offender with one prior conviction<br />who was not sentenced to imprisonment.’ The Commission is required to prescribe<br />guideline ranges that specify an appropriate sentence for each class of convicted persons,<br />to be determined by coordinating the offense behavior categories with the offender<br />characteristic categories. The statute contemplates the guidelines will establish a range<br />of sentences for every coordination of categories. Where the guidelines call for<br />imprisonment, the range must be narrow: the maximum imprisonment cannot exceed the<br />minimum by more than the greater of 25 percent or six months. 28 U.S.C. &#167; 994(b)(2).<br />The sentencing judge must select a sentence from within the guideline range. If,<br />however, a particular case presents atypical features, the Act allows the judge to depart<br />from the guidelines and sentence outside the range. In that case, the judge must specify<br />reasons for departure. 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(b). If the court sentences within the guideline<br />range, an appellate court may review the sentence to see if the guideline was correctly<br /><br />applied. If the judge departs from the guideline range, an appellate court may review the<br />reasonableness of the departure. 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3742. The Act requires the offender to<br />serve virtually all of any prison sentence imposed, for it abolishes parole and<br />substantially restructures good behavior adjustments.<br />The law requires the Commission to send its initial guidelines to Congress by<br />April 13, 1987, and under the present statute they take effect automatically on<br />November 1, 1987. Pub. L. No. 98-473, &#167; 235, reprinted at 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3551. The<br />Commission may submit guideline amendments each year to Congress between the<br />beginning of a regular session and May 1. The amendments will take effect<br />automatically 180 days after submission unless a law is enacted to the contrary.<br />28 U.S.C. &#167; 994(p).<br />The Commission, with the aid of its legal and research staff, considerable public<br />testimony, and written commentary, has developed an initial set of guidelines which it<br />now transmits to Congress. The Commission emphasizes, however, that it views the<br />guideline-writing process as evolutionary. It expects, and the governing statute<br />anticipates, that continuing research, experience, and analysis will result in modifications<br />and revisions to the guidelines by submission of amendments to Congress. To this end,<br />the Commission is established as a permanent agency to monitor sentencing practices in<br />the federal courts throughout the nation.<br />3. The Basic Approach (Policy Statement)<br />To understand these guidelines and the rationale that underlies them, one must<br />begin with the three objectives that Congress, in enacting the new sentencing law, sought<br />to achieve. Its basic objective was to enhance the ability of the criminal justice system<br />to reduce crime through an effective, fair sentencing system. To achieve this objective,<br />Congress first sought honesty in sentencing. It sought to avoid the confusion and<br />implicit deception that arises out of the present sentencing system which requires a judge<br />to impose an indeterminate sentence that is automatically reduced in most cases by ‘good<br />time’ credits. In addition, the parole commission is permitted to determine how much<br />of the remainder of any prison sentence an offender actually will serve. This usually<br />results in a substantial reduction in the effective length of the sentence imposed, with<br />defendants often serving only about one-third of the sentence handed down by the court.<br />Second, Congress sought uniformity in sentencing by narrowing the wide<br />disparity in sentences imposed by different federal courts for similar criminal conduct<br />by similar offenders. Third, Congress sought proportionality in sentencing through a<br />system that imposes appropriately different sentences for criminal conduct of different<br />severity.<br />Honesty is easy to achieve: The abolition of parole makes the sentence imposed<br />by the court the sentence the offender will serve. There is a tension, however, between<br />the mandate of uniformity (treat similar cases alike) and the mandate of proportionality<br />(treat different cases differently) which, like the historical tension between law and<br />equity, makes it difficult to achieve both goals simultaneously. Perfect uniformity --<br />sentencing every offender to five years -- destroys proportionality. Having only a few<br />simple categories of crimes would make the guidelines uniform and easy to administer,<br />but might lump together offenses that are different in important respects. For example,<br /><br />a single category for robbery that lumps together armed and unarmed robberies, robberies<br />with and without injuries, robberies of a few dollars and robberies of millions, is far too<br />broad.<br />At the same time, a sentencing system tailored to fit every conceivable wrinkle<br />of each case can become unworkable and seriously compromise the certainty of<br />punishment and its deterrent effect. A bank robber with (or without) a gun, which the<br />robber kept hidden (or brandished), might have frightened (or merely warned), injured<br />seriously (or less seriously), tied up (or simply pushed) a guard, a teller or a customer,<br />at night (or at noon), for a bad (or arguably less bad) motive, in an effort to obtain money<br />for other crimes (or for other purposes), in the company of a few (or many) other robbers,<br />for the first (or fourth) time that day, while sober (or under the influence of drugs or<br />alcohol), and so forth.<br />The list of potentially relevant features of criminal behavior is long; the fact that<br />they can occur in multiple combinations means that the list of possible permutations of<br />factors is virtually endless. The appropriate relationships among these different factors<br />are exceedingly difficult to establish, for they are often context specific. Sentencing<br />courts do not treat the occurrence of a simple bruise identically in all cases, irrespective<br />of whether that bruise occurred in the context of a bank robbery or in the context of a<br />breach of peace. This is so, in part, because the risk that such a harm will occur differs<br />depending on the underlying offense with which it is connected (and therefore may<br />already be counted, to a different degree, in the punishment for the underlying offense);<br />and also because, in part, the relationship between punishment and multiple harms is not<br />simply additive. The relation varies, depending on how much other harm has occurred.<br />(Thus, one cannot easily assign points for each kind of harm and simply add them up,<br />irrespective of context and total amounts.)<br />The larger the number of subcategories, the greater the complexity that is created<br />and the less workable the system. Moreover, the subcategories themselves, sometimes<br />too broad and sometimes too narrow, will apply and interact in unforeseen ways to<br />unforeseen situations, thus failing to cure the unfairness of a simple, broad category<br />system. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, probation officers and courts, in applying<br />a complex system of subcategories, would have to make a host of decisions about<br />whether the underlying facts are sufficient to bring the case within a particular<br />subcategory. The greater the number of decisions required and the greater their<br />complexity, the greater the risk that different judges will apply the guidelines differently<br />to situations that, in fact, are similar, thereby reintroducing the very disparity that the<br />guidelines were designed to eliminate.<br />In view of the arguments, it is tempting to retreat to the simple, broad-category<br />approach and to grant judges the discretion to select the proper point along a broad<br />sentencing range. Obviously, however, granting such broad discretion risks<br />correspondingly broad disparity in sentencing, for different courts may exercise their<br />discretionary powers in different ways. That is to say, such an approach risks a return<br />to the wide disparity that Congress established the Commission to limit.<br />In the end, there is no completely satisfying solution to this practical stalemate.<br />The Commission has had to simply balance the comparative virtues and vices of broad,<br />simple categorization and detailed, complex subcategorization, and within the constraints<br /><br />established by that balance, minimize the discretionary powers of the sentencing court.<br />Any ultimate system will, to a degree, enjoy the benefits and suffer from the drawbacks<br />of each approach.<br />A philosophical problem arose when the Commission attempted to reconcile the<br />differing perceptions of the purposes of criminal punishment. Most observers of the<br />criminal law agree that the ultimate aim of the law itself, and of punishment in particular,<br />is the control of crime. Beyond this point, however, the consensus seems to break down.<br />Some argue that appropriate punishment should be defined primarily on the basis of the<br />moral principle of ‘just deserts.’ Under this principle, punishment should be scaled to<br />the offender’s culpability and the resulting harms. Thus, if a defendant is less culpable,<br />the defendant deserves less punishment. Others argue that punishment should be<br />imposed primarily on the basis of practical ‘crime control’ considerations. Defendants<br />sentenced under this scheme should receive the punishment that most effectively lessens<br />the likelihood of future crime, either by deterring others or incapacitating the defendant.<br />Adherents of these points of view have urged the Commission to choose between<br />them, to accord one primacy over the other. Such a choice would be profoundly difficult.<br />The relevant literature is vast, the arguments deep, and each point of view has much to<br />be said in its favor. A clear-cut Commission decision in favor of one of these approaches<br />would diminish the chance that the guidelines would find the widespread acceptance they<br />need for effective implementation. As a practical matter, in most sentencing decisions<br />both philosophies may prove consistent with the same result.<br />For now, the Commission has sought to solve both the practical and philosophical<br />problems of developing a coherent sentencing system by taking an empirical approach<br />that uses data estimating the existing sentencing system as a starting point. It has<br />analyzed data drawn from 10,000 presentence investigations, crimes as distinguished in<br />substantive criminal statutes, the United States Parole Commission’s guidelines and<br />resulting statistics, and data from other relevant sources, in order to determine which<br />distinctions are important in present practice. After examination, the Commission has<br />accepted, modified, or rationalized the more important of these distinctions.<br />This empirical approach has helped the Commission resolve its practical problem<br />by defining a list of relevant distinctions that, although of considerable length, is short<br />enough to create a manageable set of guidelines. Existing categories are relatively broad<br />and omit many distinctions that some may believe important, yet they include most of<br />the major distinctions that statutes and presentence data suggest make a significant<br />difference in sentencing decisions. Important distinctions that are ignored in existing<br />practice probably occur rarely. A sentencing judge may take this unusual case into<br />account by departing from the guidelines.<br />The Commission’s empirical approach has also helped resolve its philosophical<br />dilemma. Those who adhere to a just deserts philosophy may concede that the lack of<br />moral consensus might make it difficult to say exactly what punishment is deserved for<br />a particular crime, specified in minute detail. Likewise, those who subscribe to a<br />philosophy of crime control may acknowledge that the lack of sufficient, readily<br />available data might make it difficult to say exactly what punishment will best prevent<br />that crime. Both groups might therefore recognize the wisdom of looking to those<br />distinctions that judges and legislators have, in fact, made over the course of time. These<br /><br />established distinctions are ones that the community believes, or has found over time, to<br />be important from either a moral or crime-control perspective.<br />The Commission has not simply copied estimates of existing practice as revealed<br />by the data (even though establishing offense values on this basis would help eliminate<br />disparity, for the data represent averages). Rather, it has departed from the data at<br />different points for various important reasons. Congressional statutes, for example, may<br />suggest or require departure, as in the case of the new drug law that imposes increased<br />and mandatory minimum sentences. In addition, the data may reveal inconsistencies in<br />treatment, such as punishing economic crime less severely than other apparently<br />equivalent behavior.<br />Despite these policy-oriented departures from present practice, the guidelines<br />represent an approach that begins with, and builds upon, empirical data. The guidelines<br />will not please those who wish the Commission to adopt a single philosophical theory<br />and then work deductively to establish a simple and perfect set of categorizations and<br />distinctions. The guidelines may prove acceptable, however, to those who seek more<br />modest, incremental improvements in the status quo, who believe the best is often the<br />enemy of the good, and who recognize that these initial guidelines are but the first step<br />in an evolutionary process. After spending considerable time and resources exploring<br />alternative approaches, the Commission has developed these guidelines as a practical<br />effort toward the achievement of a more honest, uniform, equitable, and therefore<br />effective, sentencing system.<br />4. The Guidelines’ Resolution of Major Issues (Policy Statement)<br />The guideline-writing process has required the Commission to resolve a host of<br />important policy questions, typically involving rather evenly balanced sets of competing<br />considerations. As an aid to understanding the guidelines, this introduction will briefly<br />discuss several of those issues. Commentary in the guidelines explains others.<br />(a) Real Offense vs. Charge Offense Sentencing.<br />One of the most important questions for the Commission to decide was whether<br />to base sentences upon the actual conduct in which the defendant engaged regardless of<br />the charges for which he was indicted or convicted (‘real offense’ sentencing), or upon<br />the conduct that constitutes the elements of the offense with which the defendant was<br />charged and of which he was convicted (‘charge offense’ sentencing). A bank robber,<br />for example, might have used a gun, frightened bystanders, taken $50,000, injured a<br />teller, refused to stop when ordered, and raced away damaging property during escape.<br />A pure real offense system would sentence on the basis of all identifiable conduct. A<br />pure charge offense system would overlook some of the harms that did not constitute<br />statutory elements of the offenses of which the defendant was convicted.<br />The Commission initially sought to develop a real offense system. After all, the<br />present sentencing system is, in a sense, a real offense system. The sentencing court (and<br />the parole commission) take account of the conduct in which the defendant actually<br />engaged, as determined in a presentence report, at the sentencing hearing, or before a<br />parole commission hearing officer. The Commission’s initial efforts in this direction,<br />carried out in the spring and early summer of 1986, proved unproductive mostly for<br /><br />practical reasons. To make such a system work, even to formalize and rationalize the<br />status quo, would have required the Commission to decide precisely which harms to take<br />into account, how to add them up, and what kinds of procedures the courts should use to<br />determine the presence or absence of disputed factual elements. The Commission found<br />no practical way to combine and account for the large number of diverse harms arising<br />in different circumstances; nor did it find a practical way to reconcile the need for a fair<br />adjudicatory procedure with the need for a speedy sentencing process, given the potential<br />existence of hosts of adjudicated ‘real harm’ facts in many typical cases. The effort<br />proposed as a solution to these problems required the use of, for example, quadratic roots<br />and other mathematical operations that the Commission considered too complex to be<br />workable, and, in the Commission’s view, risked return to wide disparity in practice.<br />The Commission therefore abandoned the effort to devise a ‘pure’ real offense<br />system and instead experimented with a ‘modified real offense system,’ which it<br />published for public comment in a September 1986 preliminary draft.<br />This version also foundered in several major respects on the rock of practicality.<br />It was highly complex and its mechanical rules for adding harms (e.g., bodily injury<br />added the same punishment irrespective of context) threatened to work considerable<br />unfairness. Ultimately, the Commission decided that it could not find a practical or fair<br />and efficient way to implement either a pure or modified real offense system of the sort<br />it originally wanted, and it abandoned that approach.<br />The Commission, in its January 1987 Revised Draft and the present guidelines,<br />has moved closer to a ‘charge offense’ system. The system is not, however, pure; it has<br />a number of real elements. For one thing, the hundreds of overlapping and duplicative<br />statutory provisions that make up the federal criminal law have forced the Commission<br />to write guidelines that are descriptive of generic conduct rather than tracking purely<br />statutory language. For another, the guidelines, both through specific offense<br />characteristics and adjustments, take account of a number of important, commonly<br />occurring real offense elements such as role in the offense, the presence of a gun, or the<br />amount of money actually taken.<br />Finally, it is important not to overstate the difference in practice between a real<br />and a charge offense system. The federal criminal system, in practice, deals mostly with<br />drug offenses, bank robberies and white collar crimes (such as fraud, embezzlement, and<br />bribery). For the most part, the conduct that an indictment charges approximates the real<br />and relevant conduct in which the offender actually engaged.<br />The Commission recognizes its system will not completely cure the problems of<br />a real offense system. It may still be necessary, for example, for a court to determine<br />some particular real facts that will make a difference to the sentence. Yet, the<br />Commission believes that the instances of controversial facts will be far fewer; indeed,<br />there will be few enough so that the court system will be able to devise fair procedures<br />for their determination. See United States v. Fatico, 579 F.2d 707 (2d Cir. 1978)<br />(permitting introduction of hearsay evidence at sentencing hearing under certain<br />conditions), on remand, 458 F. Supp. 388 (E.D.N.Y. 1978), aff’d, 603 F.2d 1053 (2d Cir.<br />1979) (holding that the government need not prove facts at sentencing hearing beyond<br />a reasonable doubt), cert. denied, 444 U.S. 1073 (1980).<br /><br />The Commission also recognizes that a charge offense system has drawbacks of<br />its own. One of the most important is its potential to turn over to the prosecutor the<br />power to determine the sentence by increasing or decreasing the number (or content) of<br />the counts in an indictment. Of course, the defendant’s actual conduct (that which the<br />prosecutor can prove in court) imposes a natural limit upon the prosecutor’s ability to<br />increase a defendant’s sentence. Moreover, the Commission has written its rules for the<br />treatment of multicount convictions with an eye toward eliminating unfair treatment that<br />might flow from count manipulation. For example, the guidelines treat a three-count<br />indictment, each count of which charges sale of 100 grams of heroin, or theft of $10,000,<br />the same as a single-count indictment charging sale of 300 grams of heroin or theft of<br />$30,000. Further, a sentencing court may control any inappropriate manipulation of the<br />indictment through use of its power to depart from the specific guideline sentence.<br />Finally, the Commission will closely monitor problems arising out of count manipulation<br />and will make appropriate adjustments should they become necessary.<br />(b) Departures.<br />The new sentencing statute permits a court to depart from a guideline-specified<br />sentence only when it finds ‘an aggravating or mitigating circumstance of a kind, or to<br />a degree, not adequately taken into consideration by the Sentencing Commission . . .’.<br />18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(b). Thus, in principle, the Commission, by specifying that it had<br />adequately considered a particular factor, could prevent a court from using it as grounds<br />for departure. In this initial set of guidelines, however, the Commission does not so limit<br />the courts’ departure powers. The Commission intends the sentencing courts to treat<br />each guideline as carving out a ‘heartland,’ a set of typical cases embodying the conduct<br />that each guideline describes. When a court finds an atypical case, one to which a<br />particular guideline linguistically applies but where conduct significantly differs from the<br />norm, the court may consider whether a departure is warranted. Section 5H1.10 (Race,<br />Sex, National Origin, Creed, Religion, Socio-Economic Status), the third sentence of<br />&#167;5H1.4, and the last sentence of &#167;5K2.12, list a few factors that the court cannot take into<br />account as grounds for departure. With those specific exceptions, however, the<br />Commission does not intend to limit the kinds of factors (whether or not mentioned<br />anywhere else in the guidelines) that could constitute grounds for departure in an unusual<br />case.<br />The Commission has adopted this departure policy for two basic reasons. First<br />is the difficulty of foreseeing and capturing a single set of guidelines that encompasses<br />the vast range of human conduct potentially relevant to a sentencing decision. The<br />Commission also recognizes that in the initial set of guidelines it need not do so. The<br />Commission is a permanent body, empowered by law to write and rewrite guidelines,<br />with progressive changes, over many years. By monitoring when courts depart from the<br />guidelines and by analyzing their stated reasons for doing so, the Commission, over time,<br />will be able to create more accurate guidelines that specify precisely where departures<br />should and should not be permitted.<br />Second, the Commission believes that despite the courts’ legal freedom to depart<br />from the guidelines, they will not do so very often. This is because the guidelines,<br />offense by offense, seek to take account of those factors that the Commission’s<br />sentencing data indicate make a significant difference in sentencing at the present time.<br />Thus, for example, where the presence of actual physical injury currently makes an<br /><br />important difference in final sentences, as in the case of robbery, assault, or arson, the<br />guidelines specifically instruct the judge to use this factor to augment the sentence.<br />Where the guidelines do not specify an augmentation or diminution, this is generally<br />because the sentencing data do not permit the Commission, at this time, to conclude that<br />the factor is empirically important in relation to the particular offense. Of course, a<br />factor (say physical injury) may nonetheless sometimes occur in connection with a crime<br />(such as fraud) where it does not often occur. If, however, as the data indicate, such<br />occurrences are rare, they are precisely the type of events that the court’s departure<br />powers were designed to cover -- unusual cases outside the range of the more typical<br />offenses for which the guidelines were designed. Of course, the Commission recognizes<br />that even its collection and analysis of 10,000 presentence reports are an imperfect source<br />of data sentencing estimates. Rather than rely heavily at this time upon impressionistic<br />accounts, however, the Commission believes it wiser to wait and collect additional data<br />from our continuing monitoring process that may demonstrate how the guidelines work<br />in practice before further modification.<br />It is important to note that the guidelines refer to two different kinds of departure.<br />The first kind involves instances in which the guidelines provide specific<br />guidance for departure, by analogy or by other numerical or non-numerical suggestions.<br />For example, the commentary to &#167;2G1.1 (Transportation for Prostitution), recommends<br />a downward adjustment of eight levels where commercial purpose was not involved. The<br />Commission intends such suggestions as policy guidance for the courts. The<br />Commission expects that most departures will reflect the suggestions, and that the courts<br />of appeals may prove more likely to find departures ‘unreasonable’ where they fall<br />outside suggested levels.<br />A second kind of departure will remain unguided. It may rest upon grounds<br />referred to in Chapter 5, Part K (Departures), or on grounds not mentioned in the<br />guidelines. While Chapter 5, Part K lists factors that the Commission believes may<br />constitute grounds for departure, those suggested grounds are not exhaustive. The<br />Commission recognizes that there may be other grounds for departure that are not<br />mentioned; it also believes there may be cases in which a departure outside suggested<br />levels is warranted. In its view, however, such cases will be highly unusual.<br />(c) Plea Agreements.<br />Nearly ninety percent of all federal criminal cases involve guilty pleas, and many<br />of these cases involve some form of plea agreement. Some commentators on early<br />Commission guideline drafts have urged the Commission not to attempt any major<br />reforms of the agreement process, on the grounds that any set of guidelines that threatens<br />to radically change present practice also threatens to make the federal system<br />unmanageable. Others, starting with the same facts, have argued that guidelines which<br />fail to control and limit plea agreements would leave untouched a ‘loophole’ large<br />enough to undo the good that sentencing guidelines may bring. Still other commentators<br />make both sets of arguments.<br />The Commission has decided that these initial guidelines will not, in general,<br />make significant changes in current plea agreement practices. The court will accept or<br />reject any such agreements primarily in accordance with the rules set forth in<br /><br />Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(e). The Commission will collect data on the courts’ plea practices and<br />will analyze this information to determine when and why the courts accept or reject plea<br />agreements. In light of this information and analysis, the Commission will seek to<br />further regulate the plea agreement process as appropriate.<br />The Commission nonetheless expects the initial set of guidelines to have a<br />positive, rationalizing impact upon plea agreements for two reasons. First, the guidelines<br />create a clear, definite expectation in respect to the sentence that a court will impose if<br />a trial takes place. Insofar as a prosecutor and defense attorney seek to agree about a<br />likely sentence or range of sentences, they will no longer work in the dark. This fact<br />alone should help to reduce irrationality in respect to actual sentencing outcomes.<br />Second, the guidelines create a norm to which judges will likely refer when they decide<br />whether, under Rule 11(e), to accept or to reject a plea agreement or recommendation.<br />Since they will have before them the norm, the relevant factors (as disclosed in the plea<br />agreement), and the reason for the agreement, they will find it easier than at present to<br />determine whether there is sufficient reason to accept a plea agreement that departs from<br />the norm.<br />(d) Probation and Split Sentences.<br />The statute provides that the guidelines are to ‘reflect the general appropriateness<br />of imposing a sentence other than imprisonment in cases in which the defendant is a first<br />offender who has not been convicted of a crime of violence or an otherwise serious<br />offense . . .’ 28 U.S.C. &#167; 994(j). Under present sentencing practice, courts sentence to<br />probation an inappropriately high percentage of offenders guilty of certain economic<br />crimes, such as theft, tax evasion, antitrust offenses, insider trading, fraud, and<br />embezzlement, that in the Commission’s view are ‘serious.’ If the guidelines were to<br />permit courts to impose probation instead of prison in many or all such cases, the present<br />sentences would continue to be ineffective.<br />The Commission’s solution to this problem has been to write guidelines that<br />classify as ‘serious’ (and therefore subject to mandatory prison sentences) many offenses<br />for which probation is now frequently given. At the same time, the guidelines will<br />permit the sentencing court to impose short prison terms in many such cases. The<br />Commission’s view is that the definite prospect of prison, though the term is short, will<br />act as a significant deterrent to many of these crimes, particularly when compared with<br />the status quo where probation, not prison, is the norm.<br />More specifically, the guidelines work as follows in respect to a first offender.<br />For offense levels one through six, the sentencing court may elect to sentence the<br />offender to probation (with or without confinement conditions) or to a prison term. For<br />offense levels seven through ten, the court may substitute probation for a prison term, but<br />the probation must include confinement conditions (community confinement, intermittent<br />confinement, or home detention). For offense levels eleven and twelve, the court must<br />impose at least one half the minimum confinement sentence in the form of prison<br />confinement, the remainder to be served on supervised release with a condition of<br />community confinement or home detention. The Commission, of course, has not dealt<br />with the single acts of aberrant behavior that still may justify probation at higher offense<br />levels through departures.<br /><br />(e) Multi-Count Convictions.<br />The Commission, like other sentencing commissions, has found it particularly<br />difficult to develop rules for sentencing defendants convicted of multiple violations of<br />law, each of which makes up a separate count in an indictment. The reason it is difficult<br />is that when a defendant engages in conduct that causes several harms, each additional<br />harm, even if it increases the extent to which punishment is warranted, does not<br />necessarily warrant a proportionate increase in punishment. A defendant who assaults<br />others during a fight, for example, may warrant more punishment if he injures ten people<br />than if he injures one, but his conduct does not necessarily warrant ten times the<br />punishment. If it did, many of the simplest offenses, for reasons that are often fortuitous,<br />would lead to life sentences of imprisonment--sentences that neither ‘just deserts’ nor<br />‘crime control’ theories of punishment would find justified.<br />Several individual guidelines provide special instructions for increasing<br />punishment when the conduct that is the subject of that count involves multiple<br />occurrences or has caused several harms. The guidelines also provide general rules for<br />aggravating punishment in light of multiple harms charged separately in separate counts.<br />These rules may produce occasional anomalies, but normally they will permit an<br />appropriate degree of aggravation of punishment when multiple offenses that are the<br />subjects of separate counts take place.<br />These rules are set out in Chapter Three, Part D. They essentially provide: (1)<br />When the conduct involves fungible items, e.g., separate drug transactions or thefts of<br />money, the amounts are added and the guidelines apply to the total amount. (2) When<br />nonfungible harms are involved, the offense level for the most serious count is increased<br />(according to a somewhat diminishing scale) to reflect the existence of other counts of<br />conviction.<br />The rules have been written in order to minimize the possibility that an arbitrary<br />casting of a single transaction into several counts will produce a longer sentence. In<br />addition, the sentencing court will have adequate power to prevent such a result through<br />departures where necessary to produce a mitigated sentence.<br />(f) Regulatory Offenses.<br />Regulatory statutes, though primarily civil in nature, sometimes contain criminal<br />provisions in respect to particularly harmful activity. Such criminal provisions often<br />describe not only substantive offenses, but also more technical, administratively-related<br />offenses such as failure to keep accurate records or to provide requested information.<br />These criminal statutes pose two problems. First, which criminal regulatory provisions<br />should the Commission initially consider, and second, how should it treat technical or<br />administratively-related criminal violations?<br />In respect to the first problem, the Commission found that it cannot<br />comprehensively treat all regulatory violations in the initial set of guidelines. There are<br />hundreds of such provisions scattered throughout the United States Code. To find all<br />potential violations would involve examination of each individual federal regulation.<br />Because of this practical difficulty, the Commission has sought to determine, with the<br />assistance of the Department of Justice and several regulatory agencies, which criminal<br /><br />regulatory offenses are particularly important in light of the need for enforcement of the<br />general regulatory scheme. The Commission has sought to treat these offenses in these<br />initial guidelines. It will address the less common regulatory offenses in the future.<br />In respect to the second problem, the Commission has developed a system for<br />treating technical recordkeeping and reporting offenses, dividing them into four<br />categories.<br />First, in the simplest of cases, the offender may have failed to fill out a form<br />intentionally, but without knowledge or intent that substantive harm would likely follow.<br />He might fail, for example, to keep an accurate record of toxic substance transport, but<br />that failure may not lead, nor be likely to lead, to the release or improper treatment of any<br />toxic substance. Second, the same failure may be accompanied by a significant<br />likelihood that substantive harm will occur; it may make a release of a toxic substance<br />more likely. Third, the same failure may have led to substantive harm. Fourth, the<br />failure may represent an effort to conceal a substantive harm that has occurred.<br />The structure of a typical guideline for a regulatory offense is as follows:<br />(1) The guideline provides a low base offense level (6) aimed at the first type of<br />recordkeeping or reporting offense. It gives the court the legal authority to<br />impose a punishment ranging from probation up to six months of imprisonment.<br />(2) Specific offense characteristics designed to reflect substantive offenses that do<br />occur (in respect to some regulatory offenses), or that are likely to occur, increase<br />the offense level.<br />(3) A specific offense characteristic also provides that a recordkeeping or reporting<br />offense that conceals a substantive offense will be treated like the substantive<br />offense.<br />The Commission views this structure as an initial effort. It may revise its<br />approach in light of further experience and analysis of regulatory crimes.<br />(g) Sentencing Ranges.<br />In determining the appropriate sentencing ranges for each offense, the<br />Commission began by estimating the average sentences now being served within each<br />category. It also examined the sentence specified in congressional statutes, in the parole<br />guidelines, and in other relevant, analogous sources. The Commission’s forthcoming<br />detailed report will contain a comparison between estimates of existing sentencing<br />practices and sentences under the guidelines.<br />While the Commission has not considered itself bound by existing sentencing<br />practice, it has not tried to develop an entirely new system of sentencing on the basis of<br />theory alone. Guideline sentences in many instances will approximate existing practice,<br />but adherence to the guidelines will help to eliminate wide disparity. For example, where<br />a high percentage of persons now receive probation, a guideline may include one or more<br />specific offense characteristics in an effort to distinguish those types of defendants who<br />now receive probation from those who receive more severe sentences. In some instances,<br /><br />short sentences of incarceration for all offenders in a category have been substituted for<br />a current sentencing practice of very wide variability in which some defendants receive<br />probation while others receive several years in prison for the same offense. Moreover,<br />inasmuch as those who currently plead guilty often receive lesser sentences, the<br />guidelines also permit the court to impose lesser sentences on those defendants who<br />accept responsibility and those who cooperate with the government.<br />The Commission has also examined its sentencing ranges in light of their likely<br />impact upon prison population. Specific legislation, such as the new drug law and the<br />career offender provisions of the sentencing law, require the Commission to promulgate<br />rules that will lead to substantial prison population increases. These increases will occur<br />irrespective of any guidelines. The guidelines themselves, insofar as they reflect policy<br />decisions made by the Commission (rather than legislated mandatory minimum, or career<br />offender, sentences), will lead to an increase in prison population that computer models,<br />produced by the Commission and the Bureau of Prisons, estimate at approximately<br />10 percent, over a period of ten years.<br />(h) The Sentencing Table.<br />The Commission has established a sentencing table. For technical and practical<br />reasons it has 43 levels. Each row in the table contains levels that overlap with the levels<br />in the preceding and succeeding rows. By overlapping the levels, the table should<br />discourage unnecessary litigation. Both prosecutor and defendant will realize that the<br />difference between one level and another will not necessarily make a difference in the<br />sentence that the judge imposes. Thus, little purpose will be served in protracted<br />litigation trying to determine, for example, whether $10,000 or $11,000 was obtained as<br />a result of a fraud. At the same time, the rows work to increase a sentence<br />proportionately. A change of 6 levels roughly doubles the sentence irrespective of the<br />level at which one starts. The Commission, aware of the legal requirement that the<br />maximum of any range cannot exceed the minimum by more than the greater of<br />25 percent or six months, also wishes to permit courts the greatest possible range for<br />exercising discretion. The table overlaps offense levels meaningfully, works<br />proportionately, and at the same time preserves the maximum degree of allowable<br />discretion for the judge within each level.<br />Similarly, many of the individual guidelines refer to tables that correlate amounts<br />of money with offense levels. These tables often have many, rather than a few levels.<br />Again, the reason is to minimize the likelihood of unnecessary litigation. If a money<br />table were to make only a few distinctions, each distinction would become more<br />important and litigation as to which category an offender fell within would become more<br />likely. Where a table has many smaller monetary distinctions, it minimizes the<br />likelihood of litigation, for the importance of the precise amount of money involved is<br />considerably less.<br />5. A Concluding Note<br />The Commission emphasizes that its approach in this initial set of guidelines is<br />one of caution. It has examined the many hundreds of criminal statutes in the United<br />States Code. It has begun with those that are the basis for a significant number of<br />prosecutions. It has sought to place them in a rational order. It has developed additional<br /><br />distinctions relevant to the application of these provisions, and it has applied sentencing<br />ranges to each resulting category. In doing so, it has relied upon estimates of existing<br />sentencing practices as revealed by its own statistical analyses, based on summary reports<br />of some 40,000 convictions, a sample of 10,000 augmented presentence reports, the<br />parole guidelines and policy judgments.<br />The Commission recognizes that some will criticize this approach as overly<br />cautious, as representing too little a departure from existing practice. Yet, it will cure<br />wide disparity. The Commission is a permanent body that can amend the guidelines each<br />year. Although the data available to it, like all data, are imperfect, experience with these<br />guidelines will lead to additional information and provide a firm empirical basis for<br />revision.<br />Finally, the guidelines will apply to approximately 90 percent of all cases in the<br />federal courts. Because of time constraints and the nonexistence of statistical<br />information, some offenses that occur infrequently are not considered in this initial set<br />of guidelines.

For example, where the defendant engaged in three drug<br />sales of 10, 15, and 20 grams of cocaine, as part of the same course of conduct or<br />common scheme or plan, subsection (a)(2) provides that the total quantity of cocaine<br />involved (45 grams) is to be used to determine the offense level even if the defendant is<br />convicted of a single count charging only one of the sales. If the defendant is convicted<br />of multiple counts for the above noted sales, the grouping rules of Chapter Three, Part<br />D (Multiple Counts) provide that the counts are grouped together. Although Chapter<br />Three, Part D (Multiple Counts) applies to multiple counts of conviction, it does not limit<br />the scope of subsection (a)(2).

In addition, a finding is made that there are two other sales, also part of the<br />common scheme or plan, each involving 10 grams of cocaine. The total amount of all<br />four sales (40 grams of cocaine) will be used to determine the offense level for each<br />count under &#167;1B1.3(a)(2).

However, because of the ordering of the specific offense<br />characteristics, there is a 1 or 2-level difference between &#167;&#167;2B1.1, 2B1.2 and 2B1.3 on the one<br />hand, and &#167;2B5.2 on the other, in cases of stolen or destroyed mail involving more than<br />minimal planning and a loss of $1,000 or less.

The statute to which this guideline applies (21 U.S.C. &#167; 843(b)) prohibits the use<br />of a communications facility to commit, cause, or facilitate a felony controlled substance<br />offense. Frequently, a conviction under this statute is the result of a plea bargain because the<br />statute has a low maximum (four years with no prior felony drug conviction; eight years with<br />a prior felony drug conviction) and no mandatory minimum. The current guideline has a base<br />offense level of 12 and no specific offense characteristics. Therefore, the scale of the<br />underlying drug offense is not reflected in the guideline. This results in a departure from the<br />guideline range frequently being warranted. Without guidance as to whether or how far to<br />depart, the potential for unwarranted disparity is substantial.

In particular, the amendment clarifies<br />the Commission’s intent regarding the counting of uncounseled misdemeanor convictions for<br />which counsel constitutionally is not required because the defendant was not imprisoned. Lack<br />of clarity regarding whether these prior sentences are to be counted may result not only in<br />considerable disparity in guideline application, but also in the criminal history score not<br />adequately reflecting the defendant’s failure to learn from the application of previous sanctions<br />and his potential for recidivism. This amendment expressly states the Commission’s position<br />that such convictions are to be counted for the purposes of criminal history under Chapter Four,<br />Part A.</td><td>Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1990.</td></tr><tr><td class="n">352</td><td>Amendment 352</td><td>The Commentary to &#167;4B1.3 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note<br />2 by deleting "(currently 2,000x the hourly minimum wage under federal law is $6,700)"<br />immediately following "then existing hourly minimum wage under federal law".</td><td>Reason for Amendment: This amendment deletes a reference to the federal minimum wage<br />that is now outdated.</td><td>Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1990.</td></tr><tr><td class="n">353</td><td>Amendment 353</td><td>Chapter Four, Part B, is amended by inserting an additional guideline with<br />accompanying commentary as &#167;4B1.4 (Armed Career Criminal).</td><td>Reason for Amendment: This amendment adds a new section to address cases subject to a<br />sentence enhancement under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(e).</td><td>Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1990.</td></tr><tr><td class="n">354</td><td>Amendment 354</td><td>Section 5E1.2 is amended by deleting:<br />"(a) Except as provided in subsection (f) below, the court shall impose a fine in all<br />cases.",<br />and inserting in lieu thereof:<br />"(a) The court shall impose a fine in all cases, except where the defendant establishes<br />that he is unable to pay and is not likely to become able to pay any fine.".<br />Section 5E1.2(d)(2) is amended by deleting "the ability of the defendant" and inserting in lieu<br />thereof "any evidence presented as to the defendant’s ability".<br />The Commentary to &#167;5E1.2 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 3 by deleting<br />the fourth sentence as follows:<br />"In many cases, circumstances will make it unnecessary to consider these standards other<br />than in the most general terms.";<br /><br />and by inserting the following additional paragraphs at the end:<br />"Where it is readily ascertainable that the defendant cannot, and is not likely to become<br />able to, pay a fine greater than the maximum fine set forth in Column B of the Fine Table<br />in subsection (c)(3), calculation of the alternative maximum fines under subsections<br />(c)(2)(B) (twice the gross pecuniary loss caused by the offense) and (c)(2)(C) (three<br />times the gross pecuniary gain to all participants in the offense) is unnecessary. In such<br />cases, a statement that ‘the alternative maximums of the fine table were not calculated<br />because it is readily ascertainable that the defendant cannot, and is not likely to become<br />able to, pay a fine greater than the maximum set forth in the fine table’ is recommended<br />in lieu of such calculations.<br />The determination of the fine guideline range may be dispensed with entirely upon a<br />court determination of present and future inability to pay any fine. The inability of a<br />defendant to post bail bond (having otherwise been determined eligible for release) and<br />the fact that a defendant is represented by (or was determined eligible for) assigned<br />counsel are significant indicators of present inability to pay any fine. In conjunction with<br />other factors, they may also indicate that the defendant is not likely to become able to pay<br />any fine.".</td><td>Reason for Amendment: This amendment clarifies the operation of this guideline.</td><td>Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1990.</td></tr><tr><td class="n">355</td><td>Amendment 355</td><td>The Introductory Commentary to Chapter Five, Part H is amended by inserting<br />the following additional paragraph at the end:<br />" In addition, 28 U.S.C. &#167;

It is the Commission’s intent that significant violations be promptly<br />reported to the court. At the same time, the Commission realizes that it would neither be<br />practical nor desirable to require such reporting for every minor violation.<br />&#167;7A1.2.

Under 28 U.S.C.<br />&#167; 994(a)(3), the Sentencing Commission is required to issue guidelines or policy statements<br />applicable to the revocation of probation and supervised release. At this time, the Commission<br />Amendment 362 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003<br /><br />has chosen to promulgate policy statements only. These policy statements will provide<br />guidance while allowing for the identification of any substantive or procedural issues that<br />require further review. The Commission views these policy statements as evolutionary and will<br />review relevant data and materials concerning revocation determinations under these policy<br />statements.

For additional<br />statutory provision(s), see Appendix A (Statutory Index).<br />Application Notes:<br />1. The definition of ‘firearm’ used in this section is that set forth in 18 U.S.C.<br />&#167; 921(a)(3) (if the defendant is convicted under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922) and 26 U.S.C.<br />&#167; 5845(a) (if the defendant is convicted under 26 U.S.C. &#167; 5861). These<br />definitions are somewhat broader than that used in Application Note 1(e) of the<br />Commentary to &#167;1B1.1 (Application Instructions). Under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 921(a)(3),<br />the term ‘firearm’ means (A) any weapon (including a starter gun) which will or<br />is designed to or may readily be converted to expel a projectile by the action of<br />an explosive; (B) the frame or receiver of any such weapon; (C) any firearm<br />muffler or firearm silencer; or (D) any destructive device. Under 26 U.S.C. &#167;<br />5845(a), the term ‘firearm’ includes a shotgun, or a weapon made from a shotgun,<br />with a barrel or barrels of less than 18 inches in length; a weapon made from a<br />shotgun or rifle with an overall length of less than 26 inches; a rifle, or weapon<br />made from a rifle, with a barrel or barrels less than 16 inches in length; a machine<br />gun; a muffler or silencer for a firearm; a destructive device; and certain other<br />large bore weapons.<br />2. Under &#167;2K2.1(b)(1), intended lawful use, as determined by the surrounding<br />circumstances, provides a decrease in the offense level. Relevant circumstances<br />include, among others, the number and type of firearms (sawed-off shotguns, for<br />example, have few legitimate uses) and ammunition, the location and<br />circumstances of possession, the nature of the defendant’s criminal history (e.g.,<br />whether involving firearms), and the extent to which possession was restricted by<br />local law.<br />Background: Under pre-guidelines practice, there was substantial sentencing variation<br />for these crimes. From the Commission’s investigations, it appeared that the variation<br />Amendment 374 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003<br /><br />was attributable primarily to the wide variety of circumstances under which these<br />offenses occur. Apart from the nature of the defendant’s criminal history, his actual or<br />intended use of the firearm was probably the most important factor in determining the<br />sentence.<br />Statistics showed that pre-guidelines sentences averaged two to three months<br />lower if the firearm involved was a rifle or an unaltered shotgun. This may reflect the<br />fact that these weapons tend to be more suitable than others for recreational activities.<br />However, some rifles or shotguns may be possessed for criminal purposes, while some<br />handguns may be suitable primarily for recreation. Therefore, the guideline is not based<br />upon the type of firearm. Intended lawful use, as determined by the surrounding<br />circumstances, is a mitigating factor.<br />Available pre-guidelines data were not sufficient to determine the effect a stolen<br />firearm had on the average sentence. However, reviews of pre-guidelines cases<br />suggested that this factor tended to result in more severe sentences. Independent studies<br />show that stolen firearms are used disproportionately in the commission of crimes.<br />The firearm statutes often are used as a device to enable the federal court to<br />exercise jurisdiction over offenses that otherwise could be prosecuted only under state<br />law. For example, a convicted felon may be prosecuted for possessing a firearm if he<br />used the firearm to rob a gasoline station. In pre-guidelines practice, such prosecutions<br />resulted in high sentences because of the true nature of the underlying conduct. The<br />cross reference at &#167;2K2.1(c)(2) deals with such cases.<br />&#167;2K2.2.

The provisions of &#167;3B1.1 (Aggravating Role) and &#167;3B1.2 (Mitigating Role)<br />should be applied to an individual defendant as appropriate to reflect the<br />individual’s role in committing the offense. For example, if a sales manager<br />organizes or leads the price-fixing activity of five or more participants, a 4-level<br />increase is called for under &#167;3B1.1.

Under pre-guidelines practice, approximately 39 percent of all<br />individuals convicted of antitrust violations were imprisoned. Considering all defendants<br />sentenced, the average time served under pre-guidelines practice was only forty-<br />five days. The guideline prison terms are, however, consistent with the parole guidelines.<br />The fines specified in the guideline represent substantial increases over pre-guidelines<br />practice. Under pre-guidelines practice, the average fine for individuals was only<br />approximately $27,000; for corporations, it was approximately $160,000.".</td><td>Reason for Amendment: This amendment increases the offense levels for antitrust violations<br />to make them more comparable to the offense levels for fraud with similar amounts of loss. The<br />base offense level for antitrust violations starts higher than the base offense level for fraud<br />violations to reflect the serious nature of and the difficulty of detecting such violations, but the<br />offense levels for antitrust offenses based on volume of commerce increase less rapidly than<br />the offense levels for fraud, in part, because, on the average, the level of mark-up from an<br />antitrust violation may tend to decline with the volume of commerce involved. This<br />amendment also reduces the minimum guideline fine level based on the volume of commerce<br />to reflect a marginal shift from fines to imprisonment as the more effective means to deter<br />antitrust offenses. The provision addressing fines for organizational defendants in the current<br />guideline is deleted. Such fines are addressed by the provisions pertaining to the sentencing<br />of organizational defendants that are added by a separate amendment (amendment 422).</td><td>Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1991.</td></tr><tr><td class="n">376</td><td>Amendment 376</td><td>Section 2S1.1(a)(1) is amended by deleting "or (a)(2)(A)" and inserting in lieu<br />thereof<br />", (a)(2)(A), or (a)(3)(A)".<br />Section 2S1.1(b)(1) is amended by inserting "or believed" immediately following "knew".<br />The Commentary to &#167;2S1.1 captioned "Background" is amended in the third paragraph by<br />deleting "or (a)(2)(A)" and inserting in lieu thereof ", (a)(2)(A), or (a)(3)(A)"; and by deleting<br />"did not merely conceal a serious crime that had already taken place, but" immediately before<br />"encouraged".</td><td>Reason for Amendment: This amendment revises this guideline to reflect the enactment of<br />subsection (a)(3) of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1956 that authorizes undercover "sting" operations in money<br />laundering cases.

In such<br />cases, a statement that ‘the alternative maximums of the fine table were not calculated<br />because it is readily ascertainable that the defendant cannot, and is not likely to become<br />able to, pay a fine greater than the maximum set forth in the fine table’ is recommended<br />in lieu of such calculations.".<br />The Commentary to &#167;5E1.2 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by deleting:<br />"4. ‘Restitution made or ordered’ refers to restitution for the instant offense made<br />before or at the time of sentencing, as well as any restitution ordered at the time<br />of sentencing for the instant offense.",<br />and inserting in lieu thereof:<br />Amendment 384 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003<br /><br />"4. The Commission envisions that for most defendants, the maximum of the<br />guideline fine range from subsection (c) will be at least twice the amount of gain<br />or loss resulting from the offense. Where, however, two times either the amount<br />of gain to the defendant or the amount of loss caused by the offense exceeds the<br />maximum of the fine guideline, an upward departure from the fine guideline may<br />be warranted.<br />Moreover, where a sentence within the applicable fine guideline range would not<br />be sufficient to ensure both the disgorgement of any gain from the offense that<br />otherwise would not be disgorged (e.g., by restitution or forfeiture) and an<br />adequate punitive fine, an upward departure from the fine guideline range may<br />be warranted.".<br />The Commentary to &#167;5E1.2 captioned "Background" is deleted in its entirety as follows:<br />"Background: These guidelines permit a relatively wide range of fines. The<br />Commission may promulgate more detailed guidelines for the imposition of fines after<br />analyzing practice under these initial guidelines.<br />Recent legislation provides for substantial increases in fines.<br />18 U.S.C. &#167; 3571(b). With few restrictions, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 10601(b), and (c) authorize fine<br />payments up to $100 million to be deposited in the Crime Victims Fund in the United<br />States Treasury. With vigorous enforcement, higher fines should be effective punitive<br />and deterrent sanctions.<br />A larger multiple of the gain than of the loss is used in subsection (c)(2) because<br />most offenses result in losses to society that exceed the gain to the participants. In<br />addition, in many such cases restitution will not be feasible. These larger fines<br />authorized under subsection (c)(2) are, of course, subject to the absolute limits on fines<br />that are imposed by statute.<br />The Commission has not attempted to define gain or loss precisely. It is expected<br />that the terms will be used flexibly and consistently with their use in the criminal code,<br />including former 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3623(c)(1).".</td><td>Reason for Amendment: This amendment is designed to simplify the operation of this<br />guideline and conserve probation and court resources by eliminating the need for the<br />determination of loss and gain under this section in most cases. Experience has shown that for<br />the vast majority of defendants, the amount from the fine table in subsection (c)(3) or the<br />amount from subsection (c)(4), as applicable, is more than twice the gain or loss from the<br />offense. This amendment provides that the guideline fine range is to be determined from<br />subsection (c)(3) or (c)(4), as applicable. In the unusual case in which twice the defendant’s<br />gain from the offense or twice the loss caused by the offense exceeds the maximum of the<br />guideline range, an upward departure may be considered.</td><td>Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1991.</td></tr><tr><td class="n">383</td><td>Amendment 383</td><td>Chapter Five, Part G is amended by deleting &#167;5G1.3 in its entirety as follows:<br />"&#167;5G1.3.

In the case of a partially completed offense (e.g., an offense involving an<br />attempted theft of $800,000 and a completed theft of $30,000), the offense level<br />is to be determined in accordance with &#167;2X1.1 (Attempt, Solicitation, or<br />Conspiracy) whether the conviction is for the substantive offense, the inchoate<br />offense (attempt, solicitation, or conspiracy), or both.

Immediately upon release from prison, he again sold cocaine to<br />the same person, using the same accomplices and modus operandi. The instant<br />federal offense (the offense of conviction) charges this latter sale. In this<br />example, the offense conduct relevant to the state prison sentence is considered<br />as prior criminal history, not as part of the same course of conduct or common<br />scheme or plan as the offense of conviction. The prior state prison sentence is<br />counted under Chapter Four (Criminal History and Criminal Livelihood). (2) The<br />defendant engaged in two cocaine sales constituting part of the same course of<br />conduct or common scheme or plan. Subsequently, he is arrested by state<br />authorities for the first sale and by federal authorities for the second sale. He is<br />convicted in state court for the first sale and sentenced to imprisonment; he is<br />then convicted in federal court for the second sale. In this case, the cocaine sales<br />are not separated by an intervening sentence. Therefore, under subsection (a)(2),<br />the cocaine sale associated with the state conviction is considered as relevant<br />conduct to the instant federal offense. The state prison sentence for that sale is<br />not counted as a prior sentence; see &#167;4A1.2(a)(1).<br />Note, however, in certain cases, offense conduct associated with a previously<br />imposed sentence may be expressly charged in the offense of conviction.

For example, if the fraud consisted of attempting to sell<br />$40,000 in worthless securities, or representing that a forged check for $40,000<br />was genuine, the ‘loss’ would be treated as $40,000 for purposes of this<br />guideline.<br />8. The amount of loss need not be precise. The court is not expected to identify<br />each victim and the loss he suffered to arrive at an exact figure. The court need<br />only make a reasonable estimate of the range of loss, given the available<br />information. The estimate may be based on the approximate number of victims<br />and an estimate of the average loss to each victim, or on more general factors,<br />such as the nature and duration of the fraud and the revenues generated by similar<br />operations. Estimates based upon aggregate ‘market loss’ (e.g., the aggregate<br />decline in market value of a stock resulting from disclosure of information that<br />was wrongfully withheld or misrepresented) are especially appropriate for<br />securities cases.

Examples would include<br />understating debts to a limited degree in order to obtain a substantial loan which<br />the defendant genuinely expected to repay; attempting to negotiate an instrument<br />that was so obviously fraudulent that no one would seriously consider honoring<br />it; and making a misrepresentation in a securities offering that enabled the<br />securities to be sold at inflated prices, but where the value of the securities<br />subsequently declined in substantial part for other reasons. In such instances, a<br />downward departure may be warranted.";<br />by renumbering Note 9 as Note 10; by inserting the following as Notes 7, 8 and 9:<br />"7. Valuation of loss is discussed in the Commentary to &#167;2B1.1 (Larceny,<br />Embezzlement, and Other Forms of Theft). Consistent with the provisions of<br />&#167;2X1.1 (Attempt, Solicitation or Conspiracy), if an intended loss that the<br />defendant was attempting to inflict can be determined, this figure will be used if<br />it is greater than the actual loss. Frequently, loss in a fraud case will be the same<br />as in a theft case. For example, if the fraud consisted of selling or attempting to<br />sell $40,000 in worthless securities, or representing that a forged check for<br />$40,000 was genuine, the loss would be $40,000.<br />There are, however, instances where additional factors are to be considered in<br />determining the loss or intended loss:<br />(a) Fraud Involving Misrepresentation of the Value of an Item or Product<br />Substitution<br />A fraud may involve the misrepresentation of the value of an item that<br />does have some value (in contrast to an item that is worthless). Where,<br />for example, a defendant fraudulently represents that stock is worth<br /><br />$40,000 and the stock is worth only $10,000, the loss is the amount by<br />which the stock was overvalued (i.e., $30,000). In a case involving a<br />misrepresentation concerning the quality of a consumer product, the loss<br />is the difference between the amount paid by the victim for the product<br />and the amount for which the victim could resell the product received.<br />(b) Fraudulent Loan Application and Contract Procurement Cases<br />In fraudulent loan application cases and contract procurement cases where<br />the defendant’s capabilities are fraudulently represented, the loss is the<br />actual loss to the victim (or if the loss has not yet come about, the<br />expected loss). For example, if a defendant fraudulently obtains a loan<br />by misrepresenting the value of his assets, the loss is the amount of the<br />loan not repaid at the time the offense is discovered, reduced by the<br />amount the lending institution has recovered, or can expect to recover,<br />from any assets pledged to secure the loan.<br />In some cases, the loss determined above may significantly understate or<br />overstate the seriousness of the defendant’s conduct. For example, where<br />the defendant substantially understated his debts to obtain a loan, which<br />he nevertheless repaid, the loss determined above (zero loss) will tend not<br />to reflect adequately the risk of loss created by the defendant’s conduct.<br />Conversely, a defendant may understate his debts to a limited degree to<br />obtain a loan (e.g., to expand a grain export business), which he genuinely<br />expected to repay and for which he would have qualified at a higher<br />interest rate had he made truthful disclosure, but he is unable to repay the<br />loan because of some unforeseen event (e.g., an embargo imposed on<br />grain exports) which would have caused a default in any event. In such<br />a case, the loss determined above may overstate the seriousness of the<br />defendant’s conduct.<br />(c) Consequential Damages in Procurement Fraud and Product Substitution<br />Cases<br />In contrast to other types of cases, loss in a procurement fraud or product<br />substitution case includes not only direct damages, but also consequential<br />damages that were reasonably foreseeable. For example, in a case<br />involving a defense product substitution offense, the loss includes the<br />government’s reasonably foreseeable costs of making substitute<br />transactions and handling or disposing of the product delivered or<br />retrofitting the product so that it can be used for its intended purpose, plus<br />the government’s reasonably foreseeable cost of rectifying the actual or<br />potential disruption to government operations caused by the product<br />substitution. Similarly, in the case of fraud affecting a defense contract<br />award, loss includes the reasonably foreseeable administrative cost to the<br />government and other participants of repeating or correcting the<br />procurement action affected, plus any increased cost to procure the<br />product or service involved that was reasonably foreseeable. Inclusion of<br />reasonably foreseeable consequential damages directly in the calculation<br />Amendment 393 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003<br /><br />of loss in procurement fraud and product substitution cases reflects that<br />such damages frequently are substantial in such cases.<br />(d) Diversion of Government Program Benefits<br />In a case involving diversion of government program benefits, loss is the<br />value of the benefits diverted from intended recipients or uses.<br />(e) Davis-Bacon Act Cases<br />In a case involving a Davis-Bacon Act violation (a violation of 40 U.S.C.<br />&#167; 276a, criminally prosecuted under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1001), the loss is the<br />difference between the legally required and actual wages paid.<br />8. For the purposes of subsection (b)(1), the loss need not be determined with<br />precision. The court need only make a reasonable estimate of the loss, given the<br />available information. This estimate, for example, may be based on the<br />approximate number of victims and an estimate of the average loss to each<br />victim, or on more general factors, such as the nature and duration of the fraud<br />and the revenues generated by similar operations. The offender’s gain from<br />committing the fraud is an alternative estimate that ordinarily will underestimate<br />the loss.<br />9. In the case of a partially completed offense (e.g., an offense involving a<br />completed fraud that is part of a larger, attempted fraud), the offense level is to<br />be determined in accordance with the provisions of &#167;2X1.1 (Attempt,<br />Solicitation, or Conspiracy) whether the conviction is for the substantive offense,<br />the inchoate offense (attempt, solicitation, or conspiracy), or both; see<br />Application Note 4 in the Commentary to &#167;2X1.1.";<br />and in the renumbered Note 10 (formerly Note 9) by deleting:<br />"Dollar loss often does not fully capture the harmfulness and seriousness of the conduct.<br />In such instances, an upward departure may be warranted.",<br />and inserting in lieu thereof:<br />"In cases in which the loss determined under subsection (b)(1) does not fully capture the<br />harmfulness and seriousness of the conduct, an upward departure may be warranted.";<br />by deleting subdivision (f) as follows:<br />"(f) completion of the offense was prevented, or the offense was interrupted before<br />it caused serious harm.";<br />by deleting the semicolon at the end of subdivision (e) and inserting in lieu thereof a period; and<br />by inserting the following additional paragraph at the end:<br /><br />"In a few instances, the loss determined under subsection (b)(1) may overstate the<br />seriousness of the offense.

paragraph as the fourth paragraph:<br />" In cases involving fifty or more marihuana plants, an equivalency of one plant to<br />one kilogram of marihuana is derived from the statutory penalty provisions of 21 U.S.C.<br />&#167; 841(b)(1)(A), (B), and (D). In cases involving fewer than fifty plants, the statute is<br />silent as to the equivalency. For cases involving fewer than fifty plants, the Commission<br />has adopted an equivalency of 100 grams per plant, or the actual weight of the usable<br />marihuana, whichever is greater. The decision to treat each plant as equal to 100 grams<br />is premised on the fact that the average yield from a mature marihuana plant equals 100<br />grams of marihuana. In controlled substance offenses, an attempt is assigned the same<br />offense level as the object of the attempt (see &#167;2D1.4). Consequently, the Commission<br />adopted the policy that, in the case of fewer than fifty marihuana plants, each plant is to<br />be treated as the equivalent of an attempt to produce 100 grams of marihuana, except<br />where the actual weight of the usable marihuana is greater.".</td><td>Reason for Amendment: This amendment substitutes a single conversion for Schedule III<br />substances (1 gm of a Schedule III substance = 2 gms of marihuana) that will simplify<br />application of the guidelines as well as address currently unlisted Schedule III substances.<br />Because the equivalencies for Schedule III substances are not statutorily based, nor are the<br />pharmacological equivalencies as clear as with Schedule I or II Substances, a generic listing<br />was deemed appropriate. For the same reasons, the amendment provides a single conversion<br />Amendment 396 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003<br /><br />for Schedule IV substances (1 gm of a Schedule IV substance = 0.125 gm of marihuana) and<br />Schedule V substances (1 gm of a Schedule V substance = 0.0125 gm of marihuana). The<br />amendment also adds a conversion for anabolic steroids consistent with their treatment in the<br />Drug Quantity Table. In addition, the amendment adds footnotes to the Drug Equivalency<br />Tables for Schedule I or II depressants and Schedule III, IV, and V substances to remove an<br />ambiguity in guideline application by expressly limiting the combined equivalent weight of<br />such substances to the marihuana amount consistent with the highest offense level for such<br />substances provided in the Drug Quantity Table. See United States v. Gurgliolo, 894 F.2d 56<br />(3d Cir. 1990). The amendment inserts an additional listing under "Secobarbital and Other<br />Schedule I and II Depressants" to reflect that glutethimide has been changed from a Schedule<br />III to a Schedule II controlled substance under 21 C.F.R. &#167;1308.12. In addition, the amendment<br />simplifies the application of the Drug Equivalency Table by referencing the conversions to one<br />substance (marihuana) rather than to four substances; the use of one referent rather than four<br />makes no substantive change but will make the required computations easier and reduce the<br />likelihood of computational error. Finally, the amendment sets forth the rationale for the<br />Commission’s treatment of fewer than fifty marihuana plants.</td><td>Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1991.</td></tr><tr><td class="n">395</td><td>Amendment 395</td><td>Section 2D1.7 is amended in the title by deleting "Interstate Sale and<br />Transporting" and inserting in lieu thereof "Sale or Transportation".<br />Section 2D1.7 is amended by inserting the following additional subsection:<br />"(b) Cross Reference<br />(1) If the offense involved a controlled substance, apply &#167;2D1.1 (Unlawful<br />Manufacturing, Importing, Exporting, or Trafficking) or &#167;2D2.1<br />(Unlawful Possession), as appropriate, if the resulting offense level is<br />greater than that determined above.".<br />The Commentary to &#167;2D1.7 captioned "Statutory Provision" is amended by deleting "21 U.S.C.<br />&#167; 857" and inserting in lieu thereof "21 U.S.C. &#167; 863 (formerly 21 U.S.C. &#167; 857)".<br />The Commentary to &#167;2D1.7 is amended by inserting the following at the end:<br />"Application Note:<br />1.

The guideline range for the failure to appear count is to be<br />determined independently and the grouping rules of &#167;&#167; 3D1.2-3D1.5 do not<br />apply.<br />Otherwise, in the case of a conviction on both the underlying offense and the<br />failure to appear, the failure to appear is treated under &#167;3C1.1 (Obstructing or<br />Impeding the Administration of Justice) as an obstruction of the underlying<br />offense; and the failure to appear count and the count(s) for the underlying<br />offense are grouped together under &#167;3D1.2(c). Note that although 18 U.S.C. &#167;<br />3146(b)(2) does not require a sentence of imprisonment on a failure to appear<br />count, it does require that any sentence of imprisonment on a failure to appear<br />count be imposed consecutively to any other sentence of imprisonment.<br />Therefore, in such cases, the combined sentence must be constructed to provide<br />a ‘total punishment’ that satisfies the requirements both of &#167;5G1.2 (Sentencing<br />on Multiple Counts of Conviction) and 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3146(b)(2).

Instead, the guideline range applicable to the<br />underlying offense absent such adjustment is to be used after subtracting the term of<br />imprisonment imposed under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c) or &#167; 929(a) from both the minimum and<br />maximum of such range.<br />Example: A defendant, is to be sentenced under the robbery guideline; his unadjusted<br />offense level from &#167;2B3.1 is 30, including a 7-level enhancement for discharging a<br />firearm; no Chapter Three adjustments are applicable; and his criminal history category<br />is Category IV. His unadjusted guideline range from Chapter Five, Part A (Sentencing<br />Table) is 135-168 months. This defendant has also been convicted under 18 U.S.C. &#167;<br />924(c) arising from the possession of a weapon during the robbery, and therefore must<br />be sentenced to an additional consecutive five-year term of imprisonment. The<br /><br />defendant’s adjusted guideline range, which takes into account the conviction under 18<br />U.S.C. &#167; 924(c) by eliminating the 7-level weapon enhancement, is 70-87 months.<br />Because the maximum of the defendant’s adjusted guideline range plus the five year<br />consecutive sentence (87 months + 60 months = 147 months) is less than the maximum<br />of the defendant’s unadjusted guideline range (168 months), the defendant is to be<br />sentenced using the unadjusted guideline range after subtracting the 60 month sentence<br />to be imposed under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c) from both the minimum and maximum of the<br />unadjusted range (e.g., 135 months - 60 months = 75 months; 168 months - 60 months<br />= 108 months). A sentence imposed for the underlying offense using the guideline range<br />determined in this manner (75-108 months) when combined with the consecutive<br />sentence imposed under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c) or &#167; 929(a), will produce the appropriate<br />total term of imprisonment.".</td><td>Reason for Amendment: This amendment provides an additional instruction for the<br />determination of the offense level in cases in which the defendant is convicted under<br />18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c) or &#167;929(a) in addition to a count for the offense in respect to which the<br />firearm was used or possessed. The amendment is designed to prevent the anomalous result of<br />the total punishment being less when there are convictions on both such counts than if the<br />defendant was convicted only of the offense in respect to which the weapon was used or<br />possessed.</td><td>Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1991.</td></tr><tr><td class="n">404</td><td>Amendment 404</td><td>The Commentary to &#167;2P1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by<br />inserting the following additional note:<br />"6.

The fine for an organization is determined by applying Chapter Eight (Sentencing<br />of Organizations).

It is estimated that the average<br />gain from price-fixing is 10 percent of the selling price. The loss from price-<br />fixing exceeds the gain because, among other things, injury is inflicted upon<br />consumers who are unable or for other reasons do not buy the product at the<br />higher prices. Because the loss from price-fixing exceeds the gain, subsection<br />(d)(1) provides that 20 percent of the volume of affected commerce is to be used<br />in lieu of the pecuniary loss under &#167;8C2.4(a)(3). The purpose for specifying a<br />percent of the volume of commerce is to avoid the time and expense that would<br />be required for the court to determine the actual gain or loss. In cases in which<br />the actual monopoly overcharge appears to be either substantially more or<br />substantially less than 10 percent, this factor should be considered in setting the<br />fine within the guideline fine range.".<br />The Commentary to &#167;2R1.1 captioned "Background" is amended by deleting the last paragraph<br />as follows:<br />" Substantial fines are an essential part of the sanction.

The<br />Commission has specified that a fine from two to five times that amount be imposed on<br />organizational defendants as a deterrent because of the difficulty in identifying violators.<br />Additional monetary penalties can be provided through private treble damage actions.<br />A lower fine is specified for individuals. The Commission believes that most antitrust<br />defendants have the resources and earning capacity to pay these fines, at least over time.<br />The statutory maximum fine is $250,000 for individuals and $1,000,000 for<br />organizations, but is increased when there are convictions on multiple counts.",<br />and inserting in lieu thereof:<br />" Substantial fines are an essential part of the sentence. For an individual, the<br />guideline fine range is from one to five percent of the volume of commerce, but not less<br />than $20,000. For an organization, the guideline fine range is determined under Chapter<br />Eight (Sentencing of Organizations), but pursuant to subsection (d)(2), the minimum<br />multiplier is at least 0.75. This multiplier, which requires a minimum fine of 15 percent<br />of the volume of commerce for the least serious case, was selected to provide an effective<br />deterrent to antitrust offenses. At the same time, this minimum multiplier maintains<br />incentives for desired organizational behavior. Because the Department of Justice has<br />a well-established amnesty program for organizations that self-report antitrust offenses,<br />no lower minimum multiplier is needed as an incentive for self-reporting. A minimum<br />multiplier of at least 0.75 ensures that fines imposed in antitrust cases will exceed the<br />average monopoly overcharge.<br />The Commission believes that most antitrust defendants have the resources and earning<br />capacity to pay the fines called for by this guideline, at least over time on an installment<br />basis. The statutory maximum fine is $350,000 for individuals and $10,000,000 for<br />organizations, but is increased when there are convictions on multiple counts.".<br />Section 2S1.1 is amended by inserting the following additional subsection:<br />"(c) Special Instruction for Fines - Organizations<br /><br />(1) In lieu of the applicable amount from the table in subsection (d) of<br />&#167;8C2.4 (Base Fine), use:<br />(A) the greater of $250,000 or 100 percent of the value of the funds<br />if subsections (a)(1) and (b)(1) are used to determine the offense<br />level; or<br />(B) the greater of $200,000 or 70 percent of the value of the funds if<br />subsections (a)(2) and (b)(1) are used to determine the offense<br />level; or<br />(C) the greater of $200,000 or 70 percent of the value of the funds if<br />subsection (a)(1) but not (b)(1) is used to determine the offense<br />level; or<br />(D) the greater of $150,000 or 50 percent of the value of the funds if<br />subsection (a)(2) but not (b)(1) is used to determine the offense<br />level.".<br />Section 2S1.2 is amended by inserting the following additional subsection:<br />"(c) Special Instruction for Fines - Organizations<br />(1) In lieu of the applicable amount from the table in subsection (d) of<br />&#167;8C2.4 (Base Fine), use:<br />(A) the greater of $175,000 or 60 percent of the value of the funds if<br />subsection (b)(1)(A) is used to determine the offense level; or<br />(B) the greater of $150,000 or 50 percent of the value of the funds if<br />subsection (b)(1)(B) is used to determine the offense level.".<br />Section 2S1.3 is amended by inserting the following additional subsection:<br />"(c) Special Instruction for Fines - Organizations<br />(1) In lieu of the applicable amount from the table in subsection (d) of<br />&#167;8C2.4 (Base Fine), use:<br />(A) the greater of $125,000 or 30 percent of the value of the funds if<br />subsections (a)(1) and (b)(1) are used to determine the offense<br />level; or<br />(B) the greater of $50,000 or 20 percent of the value of the funds if<br />subsection (a)(1) but not (b)(1) are used to determine the offense<br />level.".<br />Amendment 422 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003<br /><br />Section 2S1.4 is amended by inserting the following additional subsection:<br />"(c) Special Instruction for Fines - Organizations<br />(1) In lieu of the applicable amount from the table in subsection (d) of<br />&#167;8C2.4 (Base Fine), use:<br />(A) the greater of $50,000 or 20 percent of the value of the funds if<br />subsection (b)(1) or (b)(2) is used to determine the offense level;<br />or<br />(B) the greater of $15,000 or 10 percent of the value of the funds,<br />otherwise.".</td><td>Reason for Amendment: This amendment adds guidelines and policy statements to address<br />the sentencing of organizational defendants.</td><td>Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1991.</td></tr><tr><td class="n">421</td><td>Amendment 421</td><td>Section 1B1.10(c) is amended by deleting:<br />"(c) Provided, however, that a reduction in a defendant’s term of imprisonment --<br />(1) is not authorized unless the maximum of the guideline range applicable<br />to the defendant (from Chapter Five, Part A) has been lowered by at least<br />six months; and<br />(2) may, in no event, exceed the number of months by which the maximum<br />of the guideline range applicable to the defendant (from Chapter Five,<br />Part A) has been lowered.",<br />and inserting in lieu thereof:<br />"(c) Provided, that a reduction in a defendant’s term of imprisonment may, in no<br />event, exceed the number of months by which the maximum of the guideline<br />range applicable to the defendant (from Chapter Five, Part A) has been lowered.".<br />Section 1B1.10(d) is amended by deleting "and 341" and inserting in lieu thereof "341, 379, and<br />380".<br />The Commentary to &#167;1B1.10 captioned "Background" is amended in the fourth paragraph by<br />deleting:<br />"The requirement in subsection (c)(1) that the maximum of the guideline range be<br />lowered by at least six months for a reduction to be considered",<br />and inserting in lieu thereof:<br /><br />"The Commission has not included in this policy statement amendments that generally<br />reduce the maximum of the guideline range by less than six months.

A reference to another guideline may direct that such reference is to be used only<br />if it results in a greater offense level. In such cases, the greater offense level<br />means the greater final offense level (i.e., the greater offense level taking into<br />account both the Chapter Two offense level and any applicable Chapter Three<br />adjustments). Although the offense guideline that results in the greater offense<br />level under Chapter Two will most frequently result in the greater final offense<br />level, this will not always be the case. If, for example, a role or abuse of trust<br />adjustment applies to the cross-referenced offense guideline, but not to the<br />guideline initially applied, the greater Chapter Two offense level may not<br />necessarily result in a greater final offense level.<br />4. A reference may direct that, if the conduct involved another offense, the offense<br />guideline for such other offense is to be applied. Where there is more than one<br />such other offense, the most serious such offense (or group of closely-related<br />offenses in the case of offenses that would be grouped together under &#167;3D1.2(d))<br />is to be used. For example, if a defendant convicted of possession of a firearm<br />by a felon, to which &#167;2K2.1 (Unlawful Receipt, Possession, or Transportation of<br />Firearms or Ammunition; Prohibited Transactions Involving Firearms or<br />Ammunition) applies, is found to have possessed that firearm during commission<br />of a series of offenses, the cross reference at &#167;2K2.1(c) is applied to the offense<br />resulting in the greatest offense level.";<br />Amendment 429 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003<br /><br />and in the caption by deleting "Note" and inserting in lieu thereof "Notes".</td><td>Reason for Amendment: This amendment clarifies the operation of this guideline.</td><td>Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1991.</td></tr><tr><td class="n">428</td><td>Amendment 428</td><td>The Commentary to &#167;2H1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by<br />inserting the following additional paragraph as the first paragraph of Note 1:<br />"‘Underlying offense,’ as used in this guideline, includes any offense under federal, state,<br />or local law other than an offense that is itself covered under Chapter Two, Part H,<br />Subpart 1, 2, or 4. For example, in the case of a conspiracy to interfere with a person’s<br />civil rights (a violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 241) that involved an aggravated assault (the use<br />of force) to deny certain rights or benefits in furtherance of discrimination (a violation<br />of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 245), the underlying offense in respect to both the violation of 18 U.S.C.<br />&#167; 241 (to which &#167;2H1.1 applies) and the violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 245 (to which &#167;2H1.3<br />applies) would be the aggravated assault.".<br />The Commentary to &#167;2H1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 1 by inserting<br />the following additional paragraph at the end:<br />"In certain cases, the count of which the defendant is convicted may set forth conduct<br />that constitutes more than one underlying offense (e.g., two instances of assault, or one<br />instance of assault and one instance of arson). In such cases, determine the offense level<br />for the underlying offense by treating each underlying offense as if contained in a<br />separate count of conviction. To determine which of the alternative base offense levels<br />(e.g., &#167;2H1.1(a)(1) or (a)(2)) results in the greater offense level, apply Chapter Three,<br />Parts A, B, C, and D to each alternative base offense level. Use whichever results in the<br />greater offense level. Example: The defendant is convicted of one count of conspiracy<br />to violate civil rights that included two level 12 underlying offenses (of a type not<br />grouped together under Chapter Three, Part D). No adjustment from Chapter Three,<br />Parts A, B, or C applies. The base offense level from &#167;2H1.1(a)(1) is 15. The offense<br />level for each underlying offense from &#167;2H1.1(a)(2) is 14 (2 + 12). Under Chapter<br />Three, Part D (Multiple Counts), the two level 14 underlying offenses result in a<br />combined offense level of 16. This offense level is greater than the alternative base<br />offense level of 15 under &#167;2H1.1(a)(1). Therefore, the case is treated as if there were two<br />counts, one for each underlying offense, with a base offense level under &#167;2H1.1(a)(2) of<br />14 for each underlying offense.".<br />The Commentary to &#167;2H1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in the first sentence of<br />the second paragraph of Note 1 (formerly the first paragraph) by deleting "contained in the<br />particular guideline in Chapter Two) for any underlying criminal conduct" and inserting in lieu<br />thereof "and cross references) from the offense guideline in Chapter Two that most closely<br />corresponds to the underlying offense"; in the last sentence of the second paragraph of Note 1<br />(formerly the first paragraph) by deleting "an offense" and "that offense" and inserting in lieu<br />thereof "arson" in each instance.</td><td>Reason for Amendment: This amendment clarifies the operation of this guideline.</td><td>Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1991.</td></tr><tr><td class="n">429</td><td>Amendment 429</td><td>The Commentary to &#167;2J1.7 captioned "Background" is amended by deleting the<br />first paragraph as follows:<br />"An enhancement under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3147 may be imposed only upon application of the<br />government; it cannot be imposed on the court’s own motion.

Defendant C, the getaway driver in an armed bank robbery in which<br />$15,000 is taken and a teller is injured, is convicted of the substantive count of<br />bank robbery.

He is not<br />accountable for prior or subsequent shipments of marihuana imported by<br />Defendants H or I if those acts were beyond the scope of, and not reasonably<br />foreseeable in connection with, the criminal activity he agreed to jointly<br />undertake with Defendants H and I (i.e., the importation of the single shipment<br />of marihuana).",<br />and inserting in lieu thereof:<br />"1. The principles and limits of sentencing accountability under this guideline are not<br />always the same as the principles and limits of criminal liability. Under<br />subsections (a)(1) and (a)(2), the focus is on the specific acts and omissions for<br />which the defendant is to be held accountable in determining the applicable<br />guideline range, rather than on whether the defendant is criminally liable for an<br />offense as a principal, accomplice, or conspirator.<br />2. A ‘jointly undertaken criminal activity’ is a criminal plan, scheme, endeavor, or<br />enterprise undertaken by the defendant in concert with others, whether or not<br />charged as a conspiracy.<br />In the case of a jointly undertaken criminal activity, subsection (a)(1)(B) provides<br />that a defendant is accountable for the conduct (acts and omissions) of others that<br />was both:<br />(i) in furtherance of the jointly undertaken criminal activity; and<br />(ii) reasonably foreseeable in connection with that criminal activity.<br />Because a count may be worded broadly and include the conduct of many<br />participants over a period of time, the scope of the criminal activity jointly<br />Amendment 439 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003<br /><br />undertaken by the defendant (the ‘jointly undertaken criminal activity’) is not<br />necessarily the same as the scope of the entire conspiracy, and hence relevant<br />conduct is not necessarily the same for every participant. In order to determine<br />the defendant’s accountability for the conduct of others under subsection<br />(a)(1)(B), the court must first determine the scope of the criminal activity the<br />particular defendant agreed to jointly undertake (i.e., the scope of the specific<br />conduct and objectives embraced by the defendant’s agreement). The conduct<br />of others that was both in furtherance of, and reasonably foreseeable in<br />connection with, the criminal activity jointly undertaken by the defendant is<br />relevant conduct under this provision. The conduct of others that was not in<br />furtherance of the criminal activity jointly undertaken by the defendant, or was<br />not reasonably foreseeable in connection with that criminal activity, is not<br />relevant conduct under this provision.<br />In determining the scope of the criminal activity that the particular defendant<br />agreed to jointly undertake (i.e., the scope of the specific conduct and objectives<br />embraced by the defendant’s agreement), the court may consider any explicit<br />agreement or implicit agreement fairly inferred from the conduct of the defendant<br />and others.<br />Note that the criminal activity that the defendant agreed to jointly undertake, and<br />the reasonably foreseeable conduct of others in furtherance of that criminal<br />activity, are not necessarily identical. For example, two defendants agree to<br />commit a robbery and, during the course of that robbery, the first defendant<br />assaults and injures a victim. The second defendant is accountable for the assault<br />and injury to the victim (even if the second defendant had not agreed to the<br />assault and had cautioned the first defendant to be careful not to hurt anyone)<br />because the assaultive conduct was in furtherance of the jointly undertaken<br />criminal activity (the robbery) and was reasonably foreseeable in connection with<br />that criminal activity (given the nature of the offense).<br />With respect to offenses involving contraband (including controlled substances),<br />the defendant is accountable for all quantities of contraband with which he was<br />directly involved and, in the case of a jointly undertaken criminal activity, all<br />reasonably foreseeable quantities of contraband that were within the scope of the<br />criminal activity that he jointly undertook.<br />The requirement of reasonable foreseeability applies only in respect to the<br />conduct (i.e., acts and omissions) of others under subsection (a)(1)(B). It does<br />not apply to conduct that the defendant personally undertakes, aids, abets,<br />counsels, commands, induces, procures, or willfully causes; such conduct is<br />addressed under subsection (a)(1)(A).<br />Illustrations of Conduct for Which the Defendant is Accountable<br />(a) Acts and omissions aided or abetted by the defendant<br />(1) Defendant A is one of ten persons hired by Defendant B to off-<br />load a ship containing marihuana. The off-loading of the ship is<br />interrupted by law enforcement officers and one ton of<br />marihuana is seized (the amount on the ship as well as the<br />amount off-loaded). Defendant A and the other off-loaders are<br />arrested and convicted of importation of marihuana. Regardless<br />of the number of bales he personally unloaded, Defendant A is<br /><br />accountable for the entire one-ton quantity of marihuana.<br />Defendant A aided and abetted the off-loading of the entire<br />shipment of marihuana by directly participating in the off-<br />loading of that shipment (i.e., the specific objective of the<br />criminal activity he joined was the off-loading of the entire<br />shipment). Therefore, he is accountable for the entire shipment<br />under subsection (a)(1)(A) without regard to the issue of<br />reasonable foreseeability. This is conceptually similar to the case<br />of a defendant who transports a suitcase knowing that it contains<br />a controlled substance and, therefore, is accountable for the<br />controlled substance in the suitcase regardless of his knowledge<br />or lack of knowledge of the actual type or amount of that<br />controlled substance.<br />In certain cases, a defendant may be accountable for particular<br />conduct under more than one subsection of this guideline. As<br />noted in the preceding paragraph, Defendant A is accountable for<br />the entire one-ton shipment of marihuana under subsection<br />(a)(1)(A). Defendant A also is accountable for the entire one-ton<br />shipment of marihuana on the basis of subsection<br />(a)(1)(B)(applying to a jointly undertaken criminal activity).<br />Defendant A engaged in a jointly undertaken criminal activity<br />(the scope of which was the importation of the shipment of<br />marihuana). A finding that the one-ton quantity of marihuana<br />was reasonably foreseeable is warranted from the nature of the<br />undertaking itself (the importation of marihuana by ship typically<br />involves very large quantities of marihuana). The specific<br />circumstances of the case (the defendant was one of ten persons<br />off-loading the marihuana in bales) also support this finding. In<br />an actual case, of course, if a defendant’s accountability for<br />particular conduct is established under one provision of this<br />guideline, it is not necessary to review alternative provisions<br />under which such accountability might be established.<br />(b) Acts and omissions aided or abetted by the defendant; requirement that<br />the conduct of others be in furtherance of the jointly undertaken criminal<br />activity and reasonably foreseeable<br />(1) Defendant C is the getaway driver in an armed bank robbery in<br />which $15,000 is taken and a teller is assaulted and injured.<br />Defendant C is accountable for the money taken under<br />subsection (a)(1)(A) because he aided and abetted the act of<br />taking the money (the taking of money was the specific objective<br />of the offense he joined). Defendant C is accountable for the<br />injury to the teller under subsection (a)(1)(B) because the assault<br />on the teller was in furtherance of the jointly undertaken criminal<br />activity (the robbery) and was reasonably foreseeable in<br />connection with that criminal activity (given the nature of the<br />offense).<br />As noted earlier, a defendant may be accountable for particular<br />conduct under more than one subsection. In this example,<br />Defendant C also is accountable for the money taken on the basis<br />of subsection (a)(1)(B) because the taking of money was in<br />Amendment 439 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003<br /><br />furtherance of the jointly undertaken criminal activity (the<br />robbery) and was reasonably foreseeable (as noted, the taking of<br />money was the specific objective of the jointly undertaken<br />criminal activity).<br />(c) Requirement that the conduct of others be in furtherance of the jointly<br />undertaken criminal activity and reasonably foreseeable; scope of the<br />criminal activity<br />(1) Defendant D pays Defendant E a small amount to forge an<br />endorsement on an $800 stolen government check. Unknown to<br />Defendant E, Defendant D then uses that check as a down<br />payment in a scheme to fraudulently obtain $15,000 worth of<br />merchandise. Defendant E is convicted of forging the $800<br />check and is accountable for the forgery of this check under<br />subsection (a)(1)(A). Defendant E is not accountable for the<br />$15,000 because the fraudulent scheme to obtain $15,000 was<br />not in furtherance of the criminal activity he jointly undertook<br />with Defendant D (i.e., the forgery of the $800 check).<br />(2) Defendants F and G, working together, design and execute a<br />scheme to sell fraudulent stocks by telephone. Defendant F<br />fraudulently obtains $20,000. Defendant G fraudulently obtains<br />$35,000. Each is convicted of mail fraud. Defendants F and G<br />each are accountable for the entire amount ($55,000). Each<br />defendant is accountable for the amount he personally obtained<br />under subsection (a)(1)(A). Each defendant is accountable for<br />the amount obtained by his accomplice under subsection<br />(a)(1)(B) because the conduct of each was in furtherance of the<br />jointly undertaken criminal activity and was reasonably<br />foreseeable in connection with that criminal activity.<br />(3) Defendants H and I engaged in an ongoing marihuana<br />importation conspiracy in which Defendant J was hired only to<br />help off-load a single shipment. Defendants H, I, and J are<br />included in a single count charging conspiracy to import<br />marihuana. Defendant J is accountable for the entire single<br />shipment of marihuana he helped import under subsection<br />(a)(1)(A) and any acts and omissions in furtherance of the<br />importation of that shipment that were reasonably foreseeable<br />(see the discussion in example (a)(1) above). He is not<br />accountable for prior or subsequent shipments of marihuana<br />imported by Defendants H or I because those acts were not in<br />furtherance of his jointly undertaken criminal activity (the<br />importation of the single shipment of marihuana).<br />(4) Defendant K is a wholesale distributor of child pornography.<br />Defendant L is a retail-level dealer who purchases child<br />pornography from Defendant K and resells it, but otherwise<br />operates independently of Defendant K. Similarly, Defendant M<br />is a retail-level dealer who purchases child pornography from<br />Defendant K and resells it, but otherwise operates independently<br />of Defendant K. Defendants L and M are aware of each other’s<br />criminal activity but operate independently. Defendant N is<br /><br />Defendant K’s assistant who recruits customers for Defendant K<br />and frequently supervises the deliveries to Defendant K’s<br />customers. Each defendant is convicted of a count charging<br />conspiracy to distribute child pornography. Defendant K is<br />accountable under subsection (a)(1)(A) for the entire quantity of<br />child pornography sold to Defendants L and M. Defendant N<br />also is accountable for the entire quantity sold to those<br />defendants under subsection (a)(1)(B) because the entire quantity<br />was within the scope of his jointly undertaken criminal activity<br />and reasonably foreseeable. Defendant L is accountable under<br />subsection (a)(1)(A) only for the quantity of child pornography<br />that he purchased from Defendant K because the scope of his<br />jointly undertaken criminal activity is limited to that amount.<br />For the same reason, Defendant M is accountable under<br />subsection (a)(1)(A) only for the quantity of child pornography<br />that he purchased from Defendant K.<br />(5) Defendant O knows about her boyfriend’s ongoing drug-<br />trafficking activity, but agrees to participate on only one occasion<br />by making a delivery for him at his request when he was ill.<br />Defendant O is accountable under subsection (a)(1)(A) for the<br />drug quantity involved on that one occasion. Defendant O is not<br />accountable for the other drug sales made by her boyfriend<br />because those sales were not in furtherance of her jointly<br />undertaken criminal activity (i.e., the one delivery).<br />(6) Defendant P is a street-level drug dealer who knows of other<br />street-level drug dealers in the same geographic area who sell the<br />same type of drug as he sells. Defendant P and the other dealers<br />share a common source of supply, but otherwise operate<br />independently. Defendant P is not accountable for the quantities<br />of drugs sold by the other street-level drug dealers because he is<br />not engaged in a jointly undertaken criminal activity with them.<br />In contrast, Defendant Q, another street-level drug dealer, pools<br />his resources and profits with four other street-level drug dealers.<br />Defendant Q is engaged in a jointly undertaken criminal activity<br />and, therefore, he is accountable under subsection (a)(1)(B) for<br />the quantities of drugs sold by the four other dealers during the<br />course of his joint undertaking with them because those sales<br />were in furtherance of the jointly undertaken criminal activity<br />and reasonably foreseeable in connection with that criminal<br />activity.<br />(7) Defendant R recruits Defendant S to distribute 500 grams of<br />cocaine. Defendant S knows that Defendant R is the prime<br />figure in a conspiracy involved in importing much larger<br />quantities of cocaine. As long as Defendant S’s agreement and<br />conduct is limited to the distribution of the 500 grams, Defendant<br />S is accountable only for that 500 gram amount (under<br />subsection (a)(1)(A)), rather than the much larger quantity<br />imported by Defendant R.<br />(8) Defendants T, U, V, and W are hired by a supplier to backpack<br />Amendment 439 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003<br /><br />a quantity of marihuana across the border from Mexico into the<br />United States. Defendants T, U, V, and W receive their<br />individual shipments from the supplier at the same time and<br />coordinate their importation efforts by walking across the border<br />together for mutual assistance and protection. Each defendant is<br />accountable for the aggregate quantity of marihuana transported<br />by the four defendants. The four defendants engaged in a jointly<br />undertaken criminal activity, the object of which was the<br />importation of the four backpacks containing marihuana<br />(subsection (a)(1)(B)), and aided and abetted each other’s actions<br />(subsection (a)(1)(A)) in carrying out the jointly undertaken<br />criminal activity. In contrast, if Defendants T, U, V, and W were<br />hired individually, transported their individual shipments at<br />different times, and otherwise operated independently, each<br />defendant would be accountable only for the quantity of<br />marihuana he personally transported (subsection (a)(1)(A)). As<br />this example illustrates, in cases involving contraband (including<br />controlled substances), the scope of the jointly undertaken<br />criminal activity (and thus the accountability of the defendant for<br />the contraband that was the object of that jointly undertaken<br />activity) may depend upon whether, in the particular<br />circumstances, the nature of the offense is more appropriately<br />viewed as one jointly undertaken criminal activity or as a number<br />of separate criminal activities.".<br />The Commentary to &#167;1B1.3 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 3 (formerly<br />Note 2) by deleting the first sentence as follows:<br />"‘Such acts and omissions that were part of the same course of conduct or common<br />scheme or plan as the offense of conviction,’ as used in subsection (a)(2), refers to acts<br />and omissions committed or aided and abetted by the defendant, or for which the<br />defendant would be otherwise accountable, that were part of the same course of conduct<br />or common scheme or plan as the offense of conviction.".<br />The Commentary to &#167;1B1.3 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 6 (formerly<br />Note 5) in the first paragraph by deleting:<br />"For example, in &#167;2K1.5, subsection (b)(1) applies ‘If the defendant is convicted under<br />49 U.S.C. &#167; 1472(l)(2).’",<br />and inserting in lieu thereof:<br />"For example, in &#167;2S1.1, subsection (a)(1) applies if the defendant ‘is convicted under<br />18 U.S.C. &#167; 1956(a)(1)(A), (a)(2)(A), or (a)(3)(A).’";<br />and in the second paragraph by deleting:<br />"For example, &#167;2K1.5(b)(1) (which is applicable only if the defendant is convicted under<br />49 U.S.C. &#167; 1472(l)(2)) would be applied in determining the offense level under &#167;2X3.1<br />(Accessory After the Fact) where the defendant was convicted of accessory after the fact<br />to a violation of 49 U.S.C. &#167; 1472(l)(2).",<br />and inserting in lieu thereof:<br /><br />"For example, &#167;2S1.1(a)(1) (which is applicable only if the defendant is convicted under<br />18 U.S.C. &#167; 1956(a)(1)(A), (a)(2)(A), or (a)(3)(A)) would be applied in determining the<br />offense level under &#167;2X3.1 (Accessory After the Fact) where the defendant was<br />convicted of accessory after the fact to a violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1956(a)(1)(A),<br />(a)(2)(A), or (a)(3)(A).".<br />The Commentary to &#167;1B1.3 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by inserting the<br />following additional notes:<br />"9. ‘Common scheme or plan’ and ‘same course of conduct’ are two closely-related<br />concepts.<br />(A) Common scheme or plan. For two or more offenses to constitute part of a<br />common scheme or plan, they must be substantially connected to each other by<br />at least one common factor, such as common victims, common accomplices,<br />common purpose, or similar modus operandi. For example, the conduct of five<br />defendants who together defrauded a group of investors by computer<br />manipulations that unlawfully transferred funds over an eighteen-month period<br />would qualify as a common scheme or plan on the basis of any of the above listed<br />factors; i.e., the commonality of victims (the same investors were defrauded on<br />an ongoing basis), commonality of offenders (the conduct constituted an ongoing<br />conspiracy), commonality of purpose (to defraud the group of investors), or<br />similarity of modus operandi (the same or similar computer manipulations were<br />used to execute the scheme).<br />(B) Same course of conduct. Offenses that do not qualify as part of a common<br />scheme or plan may nonetheless qualify as part of the same course of conduct if<br />they are sufficiently connected or related to each other as to warrant the<br />conclusion that they are part of a single episode, spree, or ongoing series of<br />offenses. Factors that are appropriate to the determination of whether offenses<br />are sufficiently connected or related to each other to be considered as part of the<br />same course of conduct include the degree of similarity of the offenses and the<br />time interval between the offenses. The nature of the offenses may also be a<br />relevant consideration (e.g., a defendant’s failure to file tax returns in three<br />consecutive years appropriately would be considered as part of the same course<br />of conduct because such returns are only required at yearly intervals).<br />10. In the case of solicitation, misprision, or accessory after the fact, the conduct for<br />which the defendant is accountable includes all conduct relevant to determining<br />the offense level for the underlying offense that was known, or reasonably should<br />have been known, by the defendant.".</td><td>Reason for Amendment: This amendment clarifies and more fully illustrates the operation<br />of this guideline.

In addition, this amendment provides<br />definitions of the terms "same course of conduct" and "common scheme or plan."

The inclusion of specific offense characteristic (b)(2) in &#167;2L1.1 in the guidelines as<br />initially promulgated in April 1987 was intended to conform the guidelines to the offense level<br />indicated by past practices data for "ongoing criminal conduct." However, further study has<br />convinced the Commission that the specific offense characteristic "prior conviction for the same<br />or similar offense" is not a good proxy for such conduct. Moreover, the inclusion of a prior<br />criminal record variable in the offense guideline is inconsistent with the general treatment of<br />prior record as a separate dimension in the guidelines.<br />Amendment 450 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003<br /><br />This amendment addresses these issues by providing an enhancement in the guideline for the<br />number of aliens smuggled, transported, or harbored as a more direct measure of the scope of<br />the offense. Consistent with the Commission’s general approach throughout the guidelines, the<br />offense level increases gradually with the number of aliens. It should be noted that &#167;3B1.1<br />(Aggravating Role) generally provides an additional increase of 2, 3, or 4 levels for organizers,<br />managers, and supervisors in large-scale cases. The enhancement in this amendment pertaining<br />to the number of aliens is designed to work in conjunction with the operation of the role<br />enhancements from &#167;3B1.1.

In addition, the amendment expands the<br />specific offense characteristic in subsection (b)(2) to cover other comparable types of risk of<br />harm.

The<br />lower limit of the range for a Category I criminal history is set for a first offender with<br /><br />the lowest risk of recidivism. Therefore, a departure below the lower limit of the<br />guideline range for a Category I criminal history on the basis of the adequacy of criminal<br />history cannot be appropriate.",<br />and inserting in lieu thereof:<br />"The Commission contemplates that there may, on occasion, be a case of an egregious,<br />serious criminal record in which even the guideline range for Criminal History Category<br />VI is not adequate to reflect the seriousness of the defendant’s criminal history. In such<br />a case, a departure above the guideline range for a defendant with Criminal History<br />Category VI may be warranted. In determining whether an upward departure from<br />Criminal History Category VI is warranted, the court should consider that the nature of<br />the prior offenses rather than simply their number is often more indicative of the<br />seriousness of the defendant’s criminal record. For example, a defendant with five prior<br />sentences for very large-scale fraud offenses may have 15 criminal history points, within<br />the range of points typical for Criminal History Category VI, yet have a substantially<br />more serious criminal history overall because of the nature of the prior offenses. On the<br />other hand, a defendant with nine prior 60-day jail sentences for offenses such as petty<br />larceny, prostitution, or possession of gambling slips has a higher number of criminal<br />history points (18 points) than the typical Criminal History Category VI defendant, but<br />not necessarily a more serious criminal history overall. Where the court determines that<br />the extent and nature of the defendant’s criminal history, taken together, are sufficient<br />to warrant an upward departure from Criminal History Category VI, the court should<br />structure the departure by moving incrementally down the sentencing table to the next<br />higher offense level in Criminal History Category VI until it finds a guideline range<br />appropriate to the case.<br />However, this provision is not symmetrical. The lower limit of the range for Criminal<br />History Category I is set for a first offender with the lowest risk of recidivism.<br />Therefore, a departure below the lower limit of the guideline range for Criminal History<br />Category I on the basis of the adequacy of criminal history cannot be appropriate.".</td><td>Reason for Amendment: This amendment provides additional guidance concerning upward<br />departure from Criminal History Category VI on the basis of adequacy of criminal history<br />category, and makes minor editorial changes.</td><td>Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1992.</td></tr><tr><td class="n">459</td><td>Amendment 459</td><td>Section 4B1.2(3) is amended by deleting the last sentence as follows:<br />"The date that a defendant sustained a conviction shall be the date the judgment of<br />conviction was entered.",<br />and inserting in lieu thereof:<br />"The date that a defendant sustained a conviction shall be the date that the guilt of the<br />defendant has been established, whether by guilty plea, trial, or plea of nolo contendere.".<br />The Commentary to &#167;4B1.2 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by deleting the text of<br />Note 2 as follows:<br />"‘Crime of violence’ includes murder, manslaughter, kidnapping, aggravated assault,<br />forcible sex offenses, robbery, arson, extortion, extortionate extension of credit, and<br />burglary of a dwelling.

Subsection (b) (which applies only if subsection (a) does not apply), applies in<br />two situations. First, it applies if the sentence resulting in the undischarged term<br />of imprisonment was a federal sentence imposed pursuant to the Sentencing<br />Reform Act. In such cases, the court shall fashion a sentence equal to the total<br />punishment that would have been imposed had both sentences been imposed at<br />the same time. Second, it applies if the conduct resulting in the undischarged<br />term of imprisonment was part of the same course of conduct as the instant<br />offense and has been fully taken into account in determining the offense level for<br />the instant offense (e.g., where a defendant is prosecuted in both federal and state<br /><br />court for the same criminal conduct; or where a defendant is prosecuted in federal<br />and state court for different criminal transactions that are part of the same course<br />of conduct, such as two drug sales, but the conduct underlying both transactions<br />is fully taken into account under &#167;1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct) in determining the<br />offense level for the instant offense).<br />3. When a sentence is imposed pursuant to subsection (b), the court should adjust<br />for any term of imprisonment already served as a result of the conduct taken into<br />account in determining the instant sentence (e.g., if the appropriate total<br />punishment determined under this subsection for all offenses is 30 months and<br />the defendant has already served 10 months of the prior undischarged term of<br />imprisonment, the court should impose a sentence of 20 months concurrent with<br />the prior undischarged term).<br />4. Where the defendant is serving an unexpired term of imprisonment in<br />circumstances other than those set forth in subsections (a) or (b), the court shall<br />impose a consecutive sentence to the extent necessary to fashion a sentence<br />resulting in incremental punishment for the multiple offenses. To the extent<br />practicable, the court shall impose a sentence for the instant offense that results<br />in a combined sentence that approximates the total punishment that would have<br />been imposed under &#167;5G1.2 (Sentencing on Multiple Counts of Conviction) had<br />all of the offenses been federal offenses for which sentences were being imposed<br />at the same time. Where the defendant is serving a term of imprisonment for a<br />state offense, the information available may permit only a rough estimate of the<br />total punishment that would have been imposed under the guidelines. It is not<br />intended that the above methodology be applied in a manner that unduly<br />complicates or prolongs the sentencing process. In fashioning an appropriate<br />incremental punishment, the court should consider whether the offense was<br />committed while the defendant was on bail or other release status from another<br />offense. In such cases, a reasonable incremental penalty appropriately would<br />include an additional enhancement equivalent to that provided in &#167;2J1.7<br />(Commission of Offense While on Release).",<br />and inserting in lieu thereof:<br />"2. Subsection (b) (which may apply only if subsection (a) does not apply), addresses<br />cases in which the conduct resulting in the undischarged term of imprisonment<br />has been fully taken into account under &#167;1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct) in<br />determining the offense level for the instant offense. This can occur, for<br />example, where a defendant is prosecuted in both federal and state court, or in<br />two or more federal jurisdictions, for the same criminal conduct or for different<br />criminal transactions that were part of the same course of conduct.<br />When a sentence is imposed pursuant to subsection (b), the court should adjust<br />for any term of imprisonment already served as a result of the conduct taken into<br />account in determining the sentence for the instant offense. Example: The<br />defendant has been convicted of a federal offense charging the sale of 40 grams<br />of cocaine. Under &#167;1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct), the defendant is held accountable<br />for the sale of an additional 15 grams of cocaine that is part of the same course<br />of conduct for which the defendant has been convicted and sentenced in state<br />court (the defendant received a nine-month sentence of imprisonment, of which<br />he has served six months at the time of sentencing on the instant federal offense).<br />The guideline range applicable to the defendant is 10-16 months (Chapter Two<br />offense level of 14 for sale of 55 grams of cocaine; 2-level reduction for<br />Amendment 465 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003<br /><br />acceptance of responsibility; final offense level of 12; Criminal History Category<br />I). The court determines that a sentence of 13 months provides the appropriate<br />total punishment. Because the defendant has already served six months on the<br />related state charge, a sentence of seven months, imposed to run concurrently<br />with the remainder of the defendant’s state sentence, achieves this result. For<br />clarity, the court should note on the Judgment in a Criminal Case Order that the<br />sentence imposed is not a departure from the guidelines because the defendant<br />has been credited for guideline purposes under &#167;5G1.3(b) with six months served<br />in state custody.<br />3. Where the defendant is subject to an undischarged term of imprisonment in<br />circumstances other than those set forth in subsections (a) or (b), subsection (c)<br />applies and the court shall impose a consecutive sentence to the extent necessary<br />to fashion a sentence resulting in a reasonable incremental punishment for the<br />multiple offenses. In some circumstances, such incremental punishment can be<br />achieved by the imposition of a sentence that is concurrent with the remainder of<br />the unexpired term of imprisonment. In such cases, a consecutive sentence is not<br />required. To the extent practicable, the court should consider a reasonable<br />incremental penalty to be a sentence for the instant offense that results in a<br />combined sentence of imprisonment that approximates the total punishment that<br />would have been imposed under &#167;5G1.2 (Sentencing on Multiple Counts of<br />Conviction) had all of the offenses been federal offenses for which sentences<br />were being imposed at the same time. It is recognized that this determination<br />frequently will require an approximation. Where the defendant is serving a term<br />of imprisonment for a state offense, the information available may permit only<br />a rough estimate of the total punishment that would have been imposed under the<br />guidelines. Where the offense resulting in the undischarged term of<br />imprisonment is a federal offense for which a guideline determination has<br />previously been made, the task will be somewhat more straightforward, although<br />even in such cases a precise determination may not be possible.<br />It is not intended that the above methodology be applied in a manner that unduly<br />complicates or prolongs the sentencing process. Additionally, this methodology<br />does not, itself, require the court to depart from the guideline range established<br />for the instant federal offense. Rather, this methodology is meant to assist the<br />court in determining the appropriate sentence (e.g., the appropriate point within<br />the applicable guideline range, whether to order the sentence to run concurrently<br />or consecutively to the undischarged term of imprisonment, or whether a<br />departure is warranted). Generally, the court may achieve an appropriate<br />sentence through its determination of an appropriate point within the applicable<br />guideline range for the instant federal offense, combined with its determination<br />of whether that sentence will run concurrently or consecutively to the<br />undischarged term of imprisonment.<br />Illustrations of the Application of Subsection (c):<br />(A) The guideline range applicable to the instant federal offense is 24-30<br />months. The court determines that a total punishment of 36 months’<br />imprisonment would appropriately reflect the instant federal offense and<br />the offense resulting in the undischarged term of imprisonment. The<br />undischarged term of imprisonment is an indeterminate sentence of<br />imprisonment with a 60-month maximum. At the time of sentencing on<br />the instant federal offense, the defendant has served ten months on the<br />undischarged term of imprisonment. In this case, a sentence of 26<br /><br />months’ imprisonment to be served concurrently with the remainder of<br />the undischarged term of imprisonment would (1) be within the guideline<br />range for the instant federal offense, and (2) achieve an appropriate total<br />punishment (36 months).<br />(B) The applicable guideline range for the instant federal offense is 24-30<br />months. The court determines that a total punishment of 36 months’<br />imprisonment would appropriately reflect the instant federal offense and<br />the offense resulting in the undischarged term of imprisonment. The<br />undischarged term of imprisonment is a six-month determinate sentence.<br />At the time of sentencing on the instant federal offense, the defendant has<br />served three months on the undischarged term of imprisonment. In this<br />case, a sentence of 30 months’ imprisonment to be served consecutively<br />to the undischarged term of imprisonment would (1) be within the<br />guideline range for the instant federal offense, and (2) achieve an<br />appropriate total punishment (36 months).<br />(C) The applicable guideline range for the instant federal offense is 24-30<br />months. The court determines that a total punishment of 60 months’<br />imprisonment would appropriately reflect the instant federal offense and<br />the offense resulting in the undischarged term of imprisonment. The<br />undischarged term of imprisonment is a 12-month determinate sentence.<br />In this case, a sentence of 30 months’ imprisonment to be served<br />consecutively to the undischarged term of imprisonment would be the<br />greatest sentence imposable without departure for the instant federal<br />offense.<br />(D) The applicable guideline range for the instant federal offense is 24-30<br />months. The court determines that a total punishment of 36 months’<br />imprisonment would appropriately reflect the instant federal offense and<br />the offense resulting in the undischarged term of imprisonment. The<br />undischarged term of imprisonment is an indeterminate sentence with a<br />60-month maximum. At the time of sentencing on the instant federal<br />offense, the defendant has served 22 months on the undischarged term of<br />imprisonment. In this case, a sentence of 24 months to be served<br />concurrently with the remainder of the undischarged term of<br />imprisonment would be the lowest sentence imposable without departure<br />for the instant federal offense.".</td><td>Reason for Amendment: This amendment deletes the prong of &#167;5G1.3(b) pertaining to the<br />sentencing of a defendant subject to an undischarged term of imprisonment previously imposed<br />pursuant to the Sentencing Reform Act because the Commission found a number of problems<br />in implementation. Cases previously addressed by this prong henceforth will be addressed by<br />subsection (c), which is designed to produce a similar result but requires less precise<br />calculations. Consistent with the structure of the Guidelines Manual, subsection (c) is expressly<br />designated a policy statement.

Further reduction in offense level (or sentence) due to a plea agreement<br />will tend to undermine the sentencing guidelines.<br />The second paragraph of subsection (a) provides that a plea agreement that<br />includes the dismissal of a charge, or a plea agreement not to pursue a potential charge,<br />shall not prevent the conduct underlying that charge from being considered under the<br />provisions of &#167;1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct) in connection with the count(s) of which the<br />defendant is convicted.

Under subsection (b)(1), the last date of the offense of conviction is the<br />controlling date for ex post facto purposes. For example, if the offense of<br />conviction (i.e., the conduct charged in the count of the indictment or information<br />of which the defendant was convicted) was determined by the court to have been<br />committed between October 15, 1991 and October 28, 1991, the date of October<br />28, 1991 is the controlling date for ex post facto purposes. This is true even if the<br />defendant’s conduct relevant to the determination of the guideline range under<br />Amendment 474 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003<br /><br />&#167;1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct) included an act that occurred on November 2, 1991<br />(after a revised Guideline Manual took effect).";<br />and in the caption by deleting "Note" and inserting in lieu thereof "Notes".<br />The Commentary to &#167;1B1.11 captioned "Background" is amended by inserting the following<br />additional sentence as the first sentence of the first paragraph:<br />"Subsections (a) and (b)(1) provide that the court should apply the Guidelines Manual<br />in effect on the date the defendant is sentenced unless the court determines that doing so<br />would violate the ex post facto clause in Article I, &#167; 9 of the United States Constitution.";<br />and by inserting the following additional paragraphs at the end:<br />" Subsection (b)(2) provides that the Guidelines Manual in effect on a particular<br />date shall be applied in its entirety.<br />Subsection (b)(3) provides that where the defendant is convicted of two offenses,<br />the first committed before, and the second after, a revised edition of the Guidelines<br />Manual became effective, the revised edition of the Guidelines Manual is to be applied<br />to both offenses, even if the revised edition results in an increased penalty for the first<br />offense. Because the defendant completed the second offense after the amendment to the<br />guidelines took effect, the ex post facto clause does not prevent determining the sentence<br />for that count based on the amended guidelines. For example, if a defendant pleads<br />guilty to a single count of embezzlement that occurred after the most recent edition of the<br />Guidelines Manual became effective, the guideline range applicable in sentencing will<br />encompass any relevant conduct (e.g., related embezzlement offenses that may have<br />occurred prior to the effective date of the guideline amendments) for the offense of<br />conviction. The same would be true for a defendant convicted of two counts of<br />embezzlement, one committed before the amendments were enacted, and the second<br />after. In this example, the ex post facto clause would not bar application of the amended<br />guideline to the first conviction; a contrary conclusion would mean that such defendant<br />was subject to a lower guideline range than if convicted only of the second offense.<br />Decisions from several appellate courts addressing the analogous situation of the<br />constitutionality of counting pre-guidelines criminal activity as relevant conduct for a<br />guidelines sentence support this approach. See United States v. Ykema, 887 F.2d 697<br />(6th Cir. 1989) (upholding inclusion of pre-November 1, 1987, drug quantities as<br />relevant conduct for the count of conviction, noting that habitual offender statutes<br />routinely augment punishment for an offense of conviction based on acts committed<br />before a law is passed), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 1062 (1990); United States v. Allen, 886<br />F.2d 143 (8th Cir. 1989) (similar); see also United States v. Cusack, 901 F.2d 29 (4th Cir.<br />1990) (similar).<br />Moreover, the approach set forth in subsection (b)(3) should be followed<br />regardless of whether the offenses of conviction are the type in which the conduct is<br />grouped under &#167;3D1.2(d). The ex post facto clause does not distinguish between<br />groupable and nongroupable offenses, and unless that clause would be violated,<br />Congress’ directive to apply the sentencing guidelines in effect at the time of sentencing<br />must be followed. Under the guideline sentencing system, a single sentencing range is<br /><br />determined based on the defendant’s overall conduct, even if there are multiple counts<br />of conviction (see &#167;&#167;3D1.1-3D1.5, 5G1.2). Thus, if a defendant is sentenced in January<br />1992 for a bank robbery committed in October 1988 and one committed in November<br />1991, the November 1991 Guidelines Manual should be used to determine a combined<br />guideline range for both counts. See generally United States v. Stephenson, 921 F.2d<br />438 (2d Cir. 1990) (holding that the Sentencing Commission and Congress intended that<br />the applicable version of the guidelines be applied as a ‘cohesive and integrated whole’<br />rather than in a piecemeal fashion).<br />Consequently, even in a complex case involving multiple counts that occurred<br />under several different versions of the Guidelines Manual, it will not be necessary to<br />compare more than two manuals to determine the applicable guideline range -- the<br />manual in effect at the time the last offense of conviction was completed and the manual<br />in effect at the time of sentencing.".</td><td>Reason for Amendment: This amendment expands &#167;1B1.11 to address what has become a<br />frequently asked hotline question and troublesome application issue -- the application of<br />amended guidelines to multiple count cases in which the effective date of guideline revision(s)<br />occurs between the offenses of conviction. The issue has also produced litigation before several<br />appellate courts. See United States v. Castro, 972 F.2d 1107 (9th Cir. 1992), cert. denied, 113<br />S. Ct. 1350 (1993); United States v. Seligsohn, 981 F.2d 1418 (3d Cir. 1992); United States v.<br />Hartzog, 983 F.2d 604 (4th Cir. 1993).

Consolidation of offense guidelines in this manner<br />has a number of practical advantages: it shortens and simplifies the Guidelines Manual and<br />reduces the likelihood of inconsistency in phraseology and definitions from section to section;<br />it will reduce possible confusion and litigation as to which guideline applies to particular<br />conduct; it will reduce the number of conforming amendments required whenever similar<br />sections are amended; and it will aid the development of case law because cases involving<br />similar or identical concepts and definitions can be referenced under one guideline rather than<br />different guidelines.</td><td>Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1993.</td></tr><tr><td class="n">480</td><td>Amendment 480</td><td>The Commentary to &#167;2B1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note<br />2 by inserting the following additional sentence as the fourth sentence of the first paragraph:<br />"Loss does not include the interest that could have been earned had the funds not been<br />stolen.";<br />and by inserting the following additional paragraphs as the second and third paragraphs:<br />"Where the offense involved making a fraudulent loan or credit card application, or other<br />unlawful conduct involving a loan or credit card, the loss is to be determined under the<br />principles set forth in the Commentary to &#167;2F1.1 (Fraud and Deceit).<br />In certain cases, an offense may involve a series of transactions without a corresponding<br />increase in loss. For example, a defendant may embezzle $5,000 from a bank and<br />conceal this embezzlement by shifting this amount from one account to another in a<br />series of nine transactions over a six-month period. In this example, the loss is $5,000<br />(the amount taken), not $45,000 (the sum of the nine transactions), because the additional<br />transactions did not increase the actual or potential loss.".<br />The Commentary to &#167;2B1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by deleting Note 3 as<br />follows:<br />"3. The loss need not be determined with precision, and may be inferred from any<br />reasonably reliable information available, including the scope of the operation.",<br /><br />and inserting in lieu thereof:<br />"3. For the purposes of subsection (b)(1), the loss need not be determined with<br />precision. The court need only make a reasonable estimate of the loss, given the<br />available information. This estimate, for example, may be based upon the<br />approximate number of victims and the average loss to each victim, or on more<br />general factors such as the scope and duration of the offense.".<br />The Commentary to &#167;2B5.3 is amended by inserting the following immediately before<br />"Background":<br />"Application Note:<br />1. ‘Infringing items’ means the items that violate the copyright or trademark laws<br />(not the legitimate items that are infringed upon).".<br />The Commentary to &#167;2B6.1 captioned "Application Note" is amended in the caption by deleting<br />"Note" and inserting in lieu thereof "Notes"; and by inserting the following additional Note:<br />"2. The ‘corresponding number of levels from the table in &#167;2F1.1 (Fraud and<br />Deceit),’ as used in subsection (b)(1), refers to the number of levels<br />corresponding to the retail value of the motor vehicles or parts involved.".<br />Section 2F1.1(b)(3) is amended by deleting "or process" and by inserting in lieu thereof ", or<br />process not addressed elsewhere in the guidelines".<br />The Commentary to &#167;2F1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 5 in the first<br />sentence by inserting a comma immediately following "decree"; and by inserting the following<br />additional sentence at the end:<br />"This subsection does not apply to conduct addressed elsewhere in the guidelines; e.g.,<br />a violation of a condition of release (addressed in &#167;2J1.7 (Offense Committed While on<br />Release)) or a violation of probation (addressed in &#167;4A1.1 (Criminal History<br />Category)).".<br />The Commentary to &#167;2F1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 7(b) in the<br />second paragraph by inserting the following additional sentence at the end:<br />"Where the loss determined above significantly understates or overstates the seriousness<br />of the defendant’s conduct, an upward or downward departure may be warranted.".<br />The Commentary to &#167;2F1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 10 by deleting<br />"the primary" and inserting in lieu thereof "a primary"; by inserting "; or the fraud caused or<br />risked reasonably foreseeable, substantial non-monetary harm" immediately following "was<br />non-monetary"; by deleting "physical or psychological harm" and inserting in lieu thereof<br />"reasonably foreseeable, physical or psychological harm or severe emotional trauma"; by<br />deleting the period immediately following "institution" and inserting in lieu thereof a<br />semicolon; by inserting a new subdivision, immediately following subdivision (e), as follows:<br />Amendment 482 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003<br /><br />"(f) the offense involved the knowing endangerment of the solvency of one or more<br />victims.";<br />and by inserting the following additional sentence at the end of the last paragraph:<br />"In such cases, a downward departure may be warranted.".<br />The Commentary to &#167;2F1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 11 by deleting<br />the last two sentences as follows:<br />"The statutes provide for increased maximum terms of imprisonment for the use or<br />possession of device-making equipment and the production or transfer of more than five<br />identification documents or fifteen access devices. The court may find it appropriate to<br />enhance the sentence for violations of these statutes in a manner similar to the treatment<br />of analogous counterfeiting offenses under Part B of this Chapter.",<br />and inserting in lieu thereof:<br />"Where the primary purpose of the offense involved the unlawful production, transfer,<br />possession, or use of identification documents for the purpose of violating, or assisting<br />another to violate, the laws relating to naturalization, citizenship, or legal resident status,<br />apply &#167;2L2.1 or &#167;2L2.2, as appropriate, rather than &#167;2F1.1. In the case of an offense<br />involving false identification documents or access devices, an upward departure may be<br />warranted where the actual loss does not adequately reflect the seriousness of the<br />conduct.".</td><td>Reason for Amendment: This amendment makes the definitions of loss in &#167;&#167;2B1.1 (Larceny,<br />Embezzlement, and Other Forms of Theft) and 2F1.1 (Fraud and Deceit) more consistent.<br />Although the term "reasonably reliable information" is deleted from &#167;2B1.1 (there is no<br />corresponding term in &#167;2F1.1), no substantive change results because the reliability of the<br />information considered in respect to all cases is already addressed in &#167;6A1.3 (Resolution of<br />Disputed Factors). In addition, this amendment provides additional guidance for the<br />determination of loss in cases that are referenced to &#167;2B1.1, but have loss characteristics closely<br />resembling offenses referenced to &#167;2F1.1, and in cases in which simply adding the amounts<br />from a series of transactions does not reflect the amount taken or put at risk. This amendment<br />also clarifies the meaning of the term "infringing items" in &#167;2B5.3, and expressly provides that<br />the reference in &#167;2B6.1 to the table in &#167;2F1.1 is to be applied using the retail value of the stolen<br />parts. In addition, this amendment clarifies the operation of &#167;2F1.1(b)(3) to avoid inappropriate<br />double counting. Finally, this amendment revises the Commentary to &#167;2F1.1 by expanding<br />Application Note 10 to provide guidance in cases in which the monetary loss does not<br />adequately reflect the seriousness of the offense, and by clarifying Application<br />Note 11 and conforming the phraseology in this application note to that used elsewhere in the<br />guidelines.</td><td>Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1993.</td></tr><tr><td class="n">481</td><td>Amendment 481</td><td>Section 2B3.1(b)(1) is amended by inserting "(A)" immediately following "If";<br />and by inserting "or (B) the offense involved carjacking," immediately before "increase".<br /><br />Section 2B3.1 is amended by inserting the following additional subsection:<br />"(c) Cross Reference<br />(1) If a victim was killed under circumstances that would constitute murder<br />under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1111 had such killing taken place within the territorial<br />or maritime jurisdiction of the United States, apply &#167;2A1.1 (First Degree<br />Murder).".<br />The Commentary to &#167;2B3.1 captioned "Statutory Provisions" is amended by inserting ", 2119"<br />immediately following "2118(a)".<br />The Commentary to &#167;2B3.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 1 by inserting<br />the following additional paragraph at the end:<br />"‘Carjacking’ means the taking or attempted taking of a motor vehicle from the person<br />or presence of another by force and violence or by intimidation.".<br />The Commentary to &#167;2B3.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by deleting Note 6 as<br />follows:<br />"6. If the defendant was convicted under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2113(e) and in committing the<br />offense or attempting to flee or escape, a participant killed any person, apply<br />&#167;2A1.1 (First Degree Murder). Otherwise, if death results, see Chapter Five, Part<br />K (Departures).";<br />and by renumbering Note 7 as Note 6.</td><td>Reason for Amendment: This amendment adds a specific offense characteristic for carjacking<br />to &#167;2B3.1, references 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2119 (carjacking offenses) to this guideline, and adds a cross<br />reference to this guideline to address the circumstance in which a victim is murdered during the<br />offense.</td><td>Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1993.</td></tr><tr><td class="n">482</td><td>Amendment 482</td><td>The Commentary to &#167;2D1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note<br />1 by deleting "21 U.S.C. &#167; 841." and inserting in lieu thereof:<br />"21 U.S.C. &#167; 841, except as expressly provided. Mixture or substance does not include<br />materials that must be separated from the controlled substance before the controlled<br />substance can be used. Examples of such materials include the fiberglass in a<br />cocaine/fiberglass bonded suitcase, beeswax in a cocaine/beeswax statue, and waste<br />water from an illicit laboratory used to manufacture a controlled substance. If such<br />material cannot readily be separated from the mixture or substance that appropriately is<br />counted in the Drug Quantity Table, the court may use any reasonable method to<br />approximate the weight of the mixture or substance to be counted.<br />An upward departure nonetheless may be warranted when the mixture or substance<br />counted in the Drug Quantity Table is combined with other, non-countable material in<br />Amendment 484 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003<br /><br />an unusually sophisticated manner in order to avoid detection.".</td><td>Reason for Amendment: This amendment addresses an inter-circuit conflict regarding the<br />meaning of the term "mixture or substance," as used in &#167;2D1.1 by expressly providing that this<br />term does not include portions of a drug mixture that have to be separated from the controlled<br />substance before the controlled substance can be used. This issue has arisen, subsequent to the<br />United States Supreme Court decision in Chapman v. United States, 111 S. Ct. 1919 (1991),<br />in two types of cases. The first type of case involves a controlled substance bonded to, or<br />suspended in, another substance (e.g., cocaine mixed with beeswax); however, the controlled<br />substance is not usable until it is separated from the other substance. See, e.g., United States<br />v. Mahecha-Onofre, 936 F.2d 623 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 112 S. Ct. 648 (1991); United States<br />v. Restrepo-Contreras, 942 F.2d 96 (1st Cir. 1991), cert. denied, 112 S. Ct. 955 (1992). The<br />second type of case involves the waste produced from an illicit laboratory used to manufacture<br />a controlled substance or chemicals confiscated before the chemical processing of the controlled<br />substance is completed. The waste product is typically water or chemicals used to either<br />remove impurities or form a precipitate (the precipitate, in some cases, being the controlled<br />substance). Typically, a small amount of controlled substance remains in the waste water; often<br />this amount is too small to quantify and is listed as a trace amount (no weight given) in DEA<br />reports. In these types of cases, the waste product is not consumable. The chemicals seized<br />before the end of processing are also not usable in that form because further processing must<br />take place before they can be used. See, e.g., United States v.

The court may depart to a sentence no lower than<br />the guideline range that would have resulted if the defendant’s Chapter Two<br />offense level had been offense level 36. Provided, that a defendant is not eligible<br />for a downward departure under this provision if the defendant:<br />(a) has one or more prior felony convictions for a crime of violence or a<br />controlled substance offense as defined in &#167;4B1.2 (Definitions of Terms<br />Used in Section 4B1.1);<br />(b) qualifies for an adjustment under &#167;3B1.3 (Abuse of Position of Trust or<br />Use of Special Skill);<br />(c) possessed or induced another participant to use or possess a firearm in the<br /><br />offense;<br />(d) had decision-making authority;<br />(e) owned the controlled substance or financed any part of the offense; or<br />(f) sold the controlled substance or played a substantial part in negotiating<br />the terms of the sale.<br />Example: A defendant, who the court finds meets the criteria for a downward<br />departure under this provision, has a Chapter Two offense level of 40, a 2-level<br />reduction for a minor role from &#167;3B1.2, and a 3-level reduction for acceptance<br />of responsibility from &#167;3E1.1.

Instead, treat each dose of LSD on the carrier<br />medium as equal to 0.4 mg of LSD for the purposes of the Drug Quantity Table.".<br />The Commentary to &#167;2D1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in note 11 by deleting<br />the first entry in the "Typical Weight Per Unit Table" as follows:<br />"LSD (Lysergic acid diethylamide) 0.05 mg".<br />The Commentary to &#167;2D1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by inserting the<br />following additional note:<br />"18. LSD on a blotter paper carrier medium typically is marked so that the number of<br />doses (‘hits’) per sheet readily can be determined. When this is not the case, it<br />is to be presumed that each 1/4 inch by 1/4 inch section of the blotter paper is<br />equal to one dose.<br />In the case of liquid LSD (LSD that has not been placed onto a carrier medium),<br />using the weight of the LSD alone to calculate the offense level may not<br />adequately reflect the seriousness of the offense. In such a case, an upward<br />departure may be warranted.".<br />The Commentary to &#167;2D1.1 captioned "Background" is amended by inserting the following<br />paragraphs at the end:<br />"Because the weights of LSD carrier media vary widely and typically far exceed<br />the weight of the controlled substance itself, the Commission has determined that basing<br />offense levels on the entire weight of the LSD and carrier medium would produce<br />unwarranted disparity among offenses involving the same quantity of actual LSD (but<br /><br />different carrier weights), as well as sentences disproportionate to those for other, more<br />dangerous controlled substances, such as PCP. Consequently, in cases involving LSD<br />contained in a carrier medium, the Commission has established a weight per dose of 0.4<br />milligram for purposes of determining the base offense level.<br />The dosage weight of LSD selected exceeds the Drug Enforcement<br />Administration’s standard dosage unit for LSD of 0.05 milligram (i.e., the quantity of<br />actual LSD per dose) in order to assign some weight to the carrier medium. Because<br />LSD typically is marketed and consumed orally on a carrier medium, the inclusion of<br />some weight attributable to the carrier medium recognizes (A) that offense levels for<br />most other controlled substances are based upon the weight of the mixture containing the<br />controlled substance without regard to purity, and (B) the decision in Chapman v. United<br />States, 111 S. Ct. 1919 (1991) (holding that the term ‘mixture or substance’ in 21 U.S.C.<br />&#167; 841(b)(1) includes the carrier medium in which LSD is absorbed). At the same time,<br />the weight per dose selected is less than the weight per dose that would equate the<br />offense level for LSD on a carrier medium with that for the same number of doses of<br />PCP, a controlled substance that comparative assessments indicate is more likely to<br />induce violent acts and ancillary crime than is LSD. (Treating LSD on a carrier medium<br />as weighing 0.5 milligram per dose would produce offense levels equivalent to those for<br />PCP.) Thus, the approach decided upon by the Commission will harmonize offense<br />levels for LSD offenses with those for other controlled substances and avoid an undue<br />influence of varied carrier weight on the applicable offense level. Nonetheless, this<br />approach does not override the applicability of ‘mixture or substance’ for the purpose of<br />applying any mandatory minimum sentence (see Chapman; &#167;5G1.1(b)).".</td><td>Reason for Amendment: The Commission has found that the weights of LSD carrier media<br />vary widely and typically far exceed the weight of the controlled substance itself (e.g., LSD is<br />typically placed on blotter paper which generally weighs from 5 to 10 milligrams per dose; the<br />weight of the LSD itself per dose is generally from 0.02 to 0.08 milligram; the Drug<br />Enforcement Administration describes a standard dose of LSD as containing 0.05 milligram of<br />LSD). As a result, basing the offense level on the entire weight of the LSD and carrier medium<br />produces unwarranted disparity among offenses involving the same quantity of actual LSD but<br />different carrier weights, as well as sentences that are disproportionate to those for other, more<br />dangerous controlled substances, such as PCP, heroin, and cocaine. Under the guidelines prior<br />to the amendment, for example, 100 grams of heroin or 500 grams of cocaine (weights that<br />correspond to several thousand doses, the number depending upon the purity) result in the same<br />offense level as 125 doses of LSD on blotter paper (which has an average weight of 8<br />milligrams per dose) or 1 dose of LSD on a sugar cube (2000 milligrams per dose).<br />Consequently, in cases involving LSD contained in a carrier medium, this amendment<br />establishes a weight per dose of 0.4 milligram to be used for purposes of determining the base<br />offense level. The dosage weight of LSD selected by the Commission exceeds the Drug<br />Enforcement Administration’s standard dosage unit for LSD of 0.05 milligram (i.e., the quantity<br />of actual LSD per dose) in order to assign some weight to the carrier medium. Because LSD<br />typically is marketed and consumed orally on a carrier medium, the inclusion of some weight<br />attributable to the carrier medium recognizes (A) that offense levels for most other controlled<br />substances are based upon the weight of the mixture containing the controlled substance<br />without regard to purity, and (B) the decision in Chapman v. United States, 111 S. Ct. 1919<br />(1991) (holding that the term "mixture or substance" in 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(b)(1) includes the<br />carrier medium in which LSD is absorbed). At the same time, the weight per dose selected is<br />Amendment 488 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003<br /><br />less than the weight per dose that would equate the offense level for LSD on a carrier medium<br />with that for the same number of doses of PCP, a controlled substance that comparative<br />assessments indicate is more likely to induce violent acts and ancillary crime than is LSD.<br />Treating LSD on a carrier medium as weighing 0.5 milligram per dose would produce offense<br />levels equivalent to those for PCP (for example, 2000 doses of LSD at 0.5 milligram per dose<br />equals 1 gram of LSD -- corresponding to the lower limit of offense level 26; similarly, 2000<br />doses of PCP at 5 milligrams per dose, the standard amount of actual PCP in a dose, equals 10<br />grams of actual PCP -- corresponding to the lower limit of offense level 26). Thus, the approach<br />decided upon by the Commission will harmonize offense levels for LSD offenses with those<br />for other controlled substances and avoid an undue influence of varied carrier weight on the<br />applicable offense level. Nonetheless, this approach does not override the definition of mixture<br />or substance for purposes of applying any mandatory minimum sentence (see Chapman;<br />&#167;5G1.1(b)).</td><td>Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1993.</td></tr><tr><td class="n">487</td><td>Amendment 487</td><td>The Commentary to &#167;2K2.4 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note<br />2 by deleting:<br />"Provided, that where the maximum of the guideline range from Chapter Five, Part A<br />(Sentencing Table) determined by an offense level adjusted under the procedure<br />described in the preceding paragraph, plus the term of imprisonment required under<br />18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c) or &#167; 929(a), is less than the maximum of the guideline range that<br />would apply to the underlying offense absent such adjustment, the procedure described<br />in the preceding paragraph does not apply.

In addition, the defendant claims $10,000 in false tax credits.<br />Under Note (A) to subsection (c)(1), the tax loss is treated as $29,600 ($130,000 of actual<br />gross income minus $60,000 of reported gross income = $70,000 x 28% = $19,600, plus<br />$10,000 of false tax credits) unless sufficient information is available to make a more<br />accurate assessment of the tax loss.<br />Example 3: A defendant fails to file a tax return for a year in which his salary was<br />$24,000, and $2,600 in income tax was withheld by his employer. Under the note to<br />subsection (c)(2), the tax loss is treated as $2,200 ($24,000 of gross income x 20% =<br />$4,800, minus $2,600 of tax withheld) unless sufficient information is available to make<br />a more accurate assessment of the tax loss.<br />In determining the tax loss attributable to the offense, the court should use as many<br />methods set forth in subsection (c) and this commentary as are necessary given the<br />circumstances of the particular case. If none of the methods of determining the tax loss<br />set forth fit the circumstances of the particular case, the court should use any method of<br />determining the tax loss that appears appropriate to reasonably calculate the loss that<br />would have resulted had the offense been successfully completed.".<br />The Commentary to &#167;2T1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 3 (formerly<br />Note 5) by deleting "or local" and inserting in lieu thereof "local, or foreign".<br />The Commentary to &#167;2T1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 4 (formerly<br />Note 6) by deleting "&#167;2T1.1(b)(2)" and inserting in lieu thereof "subsection (b)(2)"; by inserting<br />a comma immediately following "applied"; and by inserting "or fictitious entities" immediately<br />following "shells".<br />The Commentary to &#167;2T1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by inserting the<br />following additional notes:<br />"5. A ‘credit claimed against tax’ is an item that reduces the amount of tax directly.<br />In contrast, a ‘deduction’ is an item that reduces the amount of taxable income.<br />6. ‘Gross income,’ for the purposes of this section, has the same meaning as it has<br />in 26 U.S.C. &#167; 61 and 26 C.F.R. &#167; 1.61.<br />7. If the offense involves both individual and corporate tax returns, the tax loss is<br />the aggregate tax loss from the offenses taken together.".<br /><br />The Commentary to &#167;2T1.1 captioned "Background" is amended by deleting:<br />" This guideline relies most heavily on the amount of tax evaded because the chief<br />interest protected by the statute is the collection of taxes. A greater evasion is obviously<br />more harmful to the treasury, and more serious than a smaller one with otherwise similar<br />characteristics. Furthermore, as the potential benefit from tax evasion increases, the<br />sanction necessary to deter also increases.<br />The overlapping imprisonment ranges in the Sentencing Table are intended to<br />minimize the significance of disputes. The consequence of an inexact estimate of the tax<br />loss is never severe, even when the tax loss is near the boundary of a range. For<br />example, although the difference between $39,999 and $40,001 results in a change from<br />level 10 to level 11, any sentence of eight to twelve months would be within the<br />guidelines regardless of the offense level determination made by the court. Indeed, any<br />sentence between ten and twelve months would be within the guidelines for a tax loss<br />ranging from $20,000 to $150,000. As a consequence, for all dollar amounts, the<br />Sentencing Table affords the court considerable latitude in evaluating other factors, even<br />when the amount of the tax loss is uncertain.<br />Under pre-guidelines practice, roughly half of all tax evaders were sentenced to<br />probation without imprisonment, while the other half received sentences that required<br />them to serve an average prison term of twelve months. This guideline is intended to<br />reduce disparity in sentencing for tax evasion and to somewhat increase average sentence<br />length. As a result, the number of purely probationary sentences will be reduced. The<br />Commission believes that any additional costs of imprisonment that may be incurred as<br />a result of the increase in the average term of imprisonment for tax evasion are<br />inconsequential in relation to the potential increase in revenue. According to estimates<br />current at the time this guideline was originally developed (1987), income taxes are<br />underpaid by approximately $90 billion annually.<br />Although under pre-guidelines practice some large-scale evaders served as much<br />as five years in prison, the average sentence length for defendants sentenced to a term of<br />imprisonment did not increase rapidly with the amount of tax evaded. Thus, the average<br />time served by those sentenced to a term of imprisonment for evading less than $10,000<br />in taxes was about nine months, while the corresponding figure for those evading over<br />$100,000 in taxes was about sixteen months. Guideline sentences should result in small<br />increases in the average length of imprisonment for most tax cases that involve less than<br />$100,000 in tax evaded. The increase is expected to be somewhat larger for cases<br />involving more taxes.<br />Failure to report criminally derived income is included as a factor for deterrence<br />purposes. Criminally derived income is generally difficult to establish, so that the tax<br />loss in such cases will tend to be substantially understated. An enhancement for<br />offenders who violate the tax laws as part of a pattern of criminal activity from which<br />they derive a substantial portion of their income also serves to implement the mandate<br />of 28 U.S.C. &#167; 994(i)(2). Estimates from pre-guidelines practice were that, on average,<br />the presence of this factor increased time served by the equivalent of 2 levels.<br />Although tax evasion always involves some planning, unusually sophisticated<br />Amendment 491 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003<br /><br />efforts to conceal the evasion decrease the likelihood of detection and therefore warrant<br />an additional sanction for deterrence purposes.

In determining the total tax loss attributable to the offense (see &#167;1B1.3(a)(2)), all<br />conduct violating the tax laws should be considered as part of the same course of<br />conduct or common scheme or plan unless the evidence demonstrates that the<br />conduct is clearly unrelated. See Application Note 3 of the Commentary to<br />&#167;2T1.1.<br />Background: Violations of 26 U.S.C. &#167; 7203 are usually serious misdemeanors that are<br />similar to tax evasion, except that there need be no affirmative act in support of the<br />offense. They are rarely prosecuted unless the defendant also owed taxes that he failed<br />to pay.<br />Because the conduct generally is tantamount to tax evasion, the guideline is<br />Amendment 491 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003<br /><br />similar to &#167;2T1.1. Because the offense is a misdemeanor, the offense level has been set<br />at one below the level corresponding to evasion of the same amount of taxes.<br />An alternative measure of the tax loss, 10 percent of gross income in excess of<br />$20,000, has been provided because of the potential difficulty of determining the amount<br />of tax the taxpayer owed. It is expected that this alternative measure generally will<br />understate the amount of tax owed.<br />The intended impact of this guideline is to increase the average time served for<br />this offense, and to increase significantly the number of violators who receive a term of<br />imprisonment. Under pre-guidelines practice, the average time served for this offense<br />was approximately 2.5 months, including those who were not sentenced to prison.<br />Considering only those who did serve a term of imprisonment, the average term was<br />about six to seven months.<br />&#167;2T1.3.

If the taxpayer is a corporation, use<br />34 percent in lieu of 28 percent.<br />(b) Specific Offense Characteristics<br />(1) If the defendant failed to report or to correctly identify<br />the source of income exceeding $10,000 in any year from<br />criminal activity, increase by 2 levels.

The amount by which the greater of gross income and taxable income was<br />understated, plus 100 percent of the total amount of any false credits claimed<br />against tax is calculated as follows: (1) determine the amount, if any, by which<br />the gross income was understated; (2) determine the amount, if any, by which the<br />taxable income was understated; and (3) determine the amount of any false<br />credit(s) claimed (a tax ‘credit’ is an item that reduces the amount of tax directly;<br />in contrast, a ‘deduction’ is an item that reduces the amount of taxable income).<br />Use the amount determined under step (1) or (2), whichever is greater, plus any<br />amount determined under step (3).<br />Background: This guideline covers conduct that usually is analogous to tax evasion,<br />although the elements differ. Accordingly, the offense is treated much like tax evasion.<br />Existence of a tax loss is not an element of these offenses. Furthermore, in<br />instances where the defendant is setting the groundwork for evasion of a tax that is<br />expected to become due in the future, he may make false statements that underreport<br />income that as of the time of conviction may not yet have resulted in a tax loss. In order<br />to gauge the seriousness of these offenses, the guidelines establish a rule for determining<br />a ‘tax loss’ based on the nature and magnitude of the false statements made.

The position of trust must have contributed in some substantial way to facilitating<br />the crime and not merely have provided an opportunity that could as easily have<br />been afforded to other persons. This adjustment, for example, would not apply<br />to an embezzlement by an ordinary bank teller.",<br />and inserting in lieu thereof:<br />"1. ‘Public or private trust’ refers to a position of public or private trust characterized<br />by professional or managerial discretion (i.e., substantial discretionary judgment<br />that is ordinarily given considerable deference). Persons holding such positions<br />ordinarily are subject to significantly less supervision than employees whose<br />responsibilities are primarily non-discretionary in nature. For this enhancement<br />to apply, the position of trust must have contributed in some significant way to<br />facilitating the commission or concealment of the offense (e.g., by making the<br />detection of the offense or the defendant’s responsibility for the offense more<br />difficult). This adjustment, for example, would apply in the case of an<br />embezzlement of a client’s funds by an attorney serving as a guardian, a bank<br />executive’s fraudulent loan scheme, or the criminal sexual abuse of a patient by<br />a physician under the guise of an examination. This adjustment would not apply<br />in the case of an embezzlement or theft by an ordinary bank teller or hotel clerk<br />because such positions are not characterized by the above-described factors.<br />Notwithstanding the preceding paragraph, because of the special nature of the<br />United States mail an adjustment for an abuse of a position of trust will apply to<br />any employee of the U.S. Postal Service who engages in the theft or destruction<br />of undelivered United States mail.".</td><td>Reason for Amendment: This amendment reformulates the definition of an abuse of position<br />of trust to better distinguish cases warranting this enhancement.</td><td>Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1993.</td></tr><tr><td class="n">491</td><td>Amendment 491</td><td>The Commentary to &#167;4A1.2 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note<br />1 by inserting the following additional sentence at the end of the first paragraph:<br />"Conduct that is part of the instant offense means conduct that is relevant conduct to the<br />instant offense under the provisions of &#167;1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct).".<br />The Commentary to &#167;4A1.2 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 6 in the first<br />sentence of the first paragraph by inserting "(A)" immediately before "have been reversed"; by<br />deleting the comma following "law"; and by inserting "or (B) have been ruled constitutionally<br />invalid in a prior case" immediately before "are not to be counted";<br />The Commentary to &#167;4A1.2 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 6 by deleting<br />the second sentence as follows:<br />"Also, sentences resulting from convictions that a defendant shows to have been<br />previously ruled constitutionally invalid are not to be counted.",<br />and inserting in lieu thereof:<br />"With respect to the current sentencing proceeding, this guideline and commentary do<br />not confer upon the defendant any right to attack collaterally a prior conviction or<br />sentence beyond any such rights otherwise recognized in law (e.g., 21 U.S.C. &#167; 851<br />expressly provides that a defendant may collaterally attack certain prior convictions).";<br />and by beginning a new paragraph with the third sentence.<br />The Commentary to &#167;4A1.2 captioned "Background" is amended by deleting the second<br />paragraph as follows:<br />"The Commission leaves for court determination the issue of whether a defendant may<br />collaterally attack at sentencing a prior conviction.".</td><td>Reason for Amendment: This amendment expressly provides that the term "part of the instant<br />offense" in &#167;4A1.2(a)(1) means relevant conduct as defined in &#167;1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct) to<br />avoid double counting and ensure consistency with other guideline provisions.<br />This amendment also clarifies the Commission’s intent with respect to whether &#167;4A1.2 confers<br />on defendants a right to attack prior convictions collaterally at sentencing, an issue on which<br />the appellate courts have differed. Compare, e.g., United States v. Canales, 960 F.2d 1311,<br />1316 (5th Cir. 1992) (Section 4A1.2 commentary indicates Commission intended to grant<br />sentencing courts discretion to entertain initial defendant challenges to prior convictions);<br />United States v. Jacobetz, 955 F.2d 786, 805 (2d Cir.) (similar), cert. denied, 113 S. Ct. 104<br />(1992); United States v. Cornog, 945 F.2d 1504, 1511 (11th Cir. 1991) (similar) with United<br />States v. Hewitt, 942 F.2d 1270, 1276 (8th Cir. 1991) (commentary indicates defendants may<br />only challenge use of prior convictions at sentencing by showing such conviction previously<br />ruled invalid). This amendment addresses this inter-circuit conflict in interpreting the<br />commentary by stating more clearly that the Commission does not intend to enlarge a<br />defendant’s right to attack collaterally a prior conviction at the current sentencing proceeding<br />beyond any right otherwise recognized in law.</td><td>Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1993.</td></tr><tr><td class="n">492</td><td>Amendment 492</td><td>The Commentary to &#167;6B1.2 is amended by inserting the following additional<br />paragraph at the end:<br />" The Commission encourages the prosecuting attorney prior to the entry of a plea<br />of guilty or nolo contendere under Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure<br />to disclose to the defendant the facts and circumstances of the offense and offender<br />characteristics, then known to the prosecuting attorney, that are relevant to the<br />application of the sentencing guidelines. This recommendation, however, shall not be<br />construed to confer upon the defendant any right not otherwise recognized in law.".</td><td>Reason for Amendment: This amendment adds commentary to &#167;6B1.2 recommending that<br />the prosecuting attorney disclose to the defendant the facts and circumstances of the offense and<br />offender characteristics then known to the prosecuting attorney that are relevant to the<br />application of the guidelines in order to encourage plea negotiations that realistically reflect<br />probable outcomes.</td><td>Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1993.</td></tr><tr><td class="n">493</td><td>Amendment 493</td><td>Appendix A (Statutory Index) is amended in the second paragraph of the<br />introduction by deleting "or an attempt" and inserting in lieu thereof ", attempt, or solicitation".<br />Appendix A (Statutory Index) is amended by inserting the following at the appropriate place<br />by title and section:<br />Amendment 495 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003<br /><br />"16 U.S.C. &#167; 742j-1(a) 2Q2.1",<br />"16 U.S.C. &#167; 773e(a)(2),<br />(3),(4),(6) 2A2.4",<br />"16 U.S.C. &#167; 773g 2A2.4",<br />"16 U.S.C. &#167; 916c 2Q2.1",<br />"16 U.S.C. &#167; 916f 2Q2.1",<br />"16 U.S.C. &#167; 973c(a)(8),<br />(10),(11),(12) 2A2.4",<br />"16 U.S.C. &#167; 973e 2A2.4",<br />"16 U.S.C. &#167; 1417(a)(5),(6),<br />(b)(2) 2A2.4",<br />"16 U.S.C. &#167; 3606 2A2.4",<br />"16 U.S.C. &#167; 3637(a)(2),<br />(3),(4),(6),(c) 2A2.4",<br />"16 U.S.C. &#167; 4223 2Q2.1",<br />"16 U.S.C. &#167; 4224 2Q2.1",<br />"16 U.S.C. &#167; 4910(a) 2Q2.1",<br />"16 U.S.C. &#167; 4912(a)(2)(A) 2Q2.1",<br />"16 U.S.C. &#167; 5009(5),(6),<br />(7),(8) 2A2.4",<br />"16 U.S.C. &#167; 5010(b) 2A2.4",<br />"18 U.S.C. &#167; 43 2B1.3",<br />"18 U.S.C. &#167; 228 2J1.1",<br />"18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(h) 2K2.1",<br />"18 U.S.C. &#167; 2119 2B3.1",<br />"18 U.S.C. &#167; 2322 2B6.1",<br />"22 U.S.C. &#167; 2197(n) 2F1.1",<br />"26 U.S.C. &#167; 7208 2F1.1",<br />"26 U.S.C. &#167; 7212(a)<br />(omnibus clause) 2J1.2, 2T1.1",<br />"26 U.S.C. &#167; 7232 2F1.1",<br />"29 U.S.C. &#167; 530 2B3.2",<br />"29 U.S.C. &#167; 1131 2E5.3",<br />"30 U.S.C. &#167; 1461(a)(3),<br />(4),(5),(7) 2A2.4",<br />"30 U.S.C. &#167; 1463 2A2.4",<br />"42 U.S.C. &#167; 1973gg-10 2H2.1",<br />"42 U.S.C. &#167; 9151(2),(3),<br />(4),(5), 2A2.4",<br />"42 U.S.C. &#167; 9152(d) 2A2.4",<br />"46 U.S.C.

The Commission does not<br />foreclose the possibility that there may be some unusual set of circumstances in which<br />the exclusion of such conduct may not adequately reflect the defendant’s culpability; in<br />such a case, an upward departure may be warranted.".<br />The Commentary to &#167;1B1.3 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 9(B) by deleting<br />"and the time interval between the offenses" and inserting in lieu thereof:<br />", the regularity (repetitions) of the offenses, and the time interval between the offenses.<br />When one of the above factors is absent, a stronger presence of at least one of the other<br />factors is required.

For example, where the<br />statutory maximum term of imprisonment under 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(b)(1)(C) is increased<br />from twenty years to thirty years because the defendant has one or more qualifying prior<br />drug convictions, the ‘Offense Statutory Maximum’ for the purposes of this guideline is<br />twenty years and not thirty years.".</td><td>Reason for Amendment: This amendment defines the term "offense statutory maximum" in<br />&#167;4B1.1 to mean the statutory maximum prior to any enhancement based on prior criminal<br />record (i.e., an enhancement of the statutory maximum sentence that itself was based upon the<br />Amendment 506 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003<br /><br />defendant’s prior criminal record will not be used in determining the alternative offense level<br />under this guideline).

This interpretation is in accord with the<br />view stated in United States v. Gullickson, 982 F.2d 1231, 1236 (8th Cir. 1993).

Although the Chapter Two sexual abuse guidelines do not<br />provide for enhancement for repeat sex offenses, Chapter Four (Criminal History and Criminal<br />Livelihood) does include a determination of the seriousness of the defendant’s criminal record<br />based upon prior convictions (&#167;4A1.1). Section 4B1.1 (Career Offender) also provides<br />substantially enhanced penalties for offenders who engage in a crime of violence (including<br />forcible sexual offenses) or controlled substance trafficking offense, having been sentenced<br />previously on two or more occasions for offenses of either type.

The<br />Commission found that, in general, the current guidelines provide appropriate penalties for<br />these offenses.

In cases involving fewer than fifty plants, the statute is<br />silent as to the equivalency. For cases involving fewer than fifty plants, the Commission<br />has adopted an equivalency of 100 grams per plant, or the actual weight of the usable<br />marihuana, whichever is greater.",<br />and by inserting in lieu thereof:<br />" For marihuana plants, the Commission has adopted an equivalency of 100 grams<br />per plant, or the actual weight of the usable marihuana, whichever is greater.".</td><td>Reason for Amendment: For offenses involving 50 or more marihuana plants, the existing<br />&#167;2D1.1 (Unlawful Manufacturing, Importing, Exporting, or Trafficking; Attempt or Conspiracy)<br />uses an equivalency of one plant = one kilogram of marihuana, reflecting the quantities<br />associated with the five- and ten-year mandatory minimum penalties in 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841. For<br />offenses involving fewer than 50 marihuana plants, the guidelines use an equivalency of one<br />plant = 100 grams of marihuana, unless the weight of the actual marihuana is greater. In<br />actuality, a marihuana plant does not produce a yield of one kilogram of marihuana. The one<br />plant = 100 grams of marihuana equivalency used by the Commission for offenses involving<br />fewer than 50 marihuana plants was selected as a reasonable approximation of the actual average<br />yield of marihuana plants taking into account (1) studies reporting the actual yield of marihuana<br />plants (37.5 to 412 grams depending on growing conditions); (2) that all plants regardless of size<br />are counted for guideline purposes while, in actuality, not all plants will produce useable<br />marihuana (e.g., some plants may die of disease before maturity, and when plants are grown<br />outdoors some plants may be consumed by animals); and (3) that male plants, which are counted<br />for guideline purposes, are frequently culled because they do not produce the same quality of<br />marihuana as do female plants. To enhance fairness and consistency, this amendment adopts<br />the equivalency of 100 grams per marihuana plant for all guideline determinations.</td><td>Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1995.</td></tr><tr><td class="n">514</td><td>Amendment 514</td><td>Section 2D1.1(c)(10) is amended by deleting:<br />"20 KG or more of Secobarbital (or the equivalent amount of other Schedule I or II<br />Depressants) or Schedule III substances (except Anabolic Steroids);<br />40,000 or more units of Anabolic Steroids.",<br />and by inserting in lieu thereof:<br />"40,000 or more units of Schedule I or II Depressants or Schedule III substances.".<br />Section 2D1.1(c)(11) is amended by deleting:<br />"At least 10 KG but less than 20 KG of Secobarbital (or the equivalent amount of other<br />Schedule I or II Depressants) or Schedule III substances (except Anabolic Steroids);<br />At least 20,000 but less than 40,000 units of Anabolic Steroids.",<br /><br />and by inserting in lieu thereof:<br />"At least 20,000 but less than 40,000 units of Schedule I or II Depressants or Schedule<br />III substances.".<br />Section 2D1.1(c)(12) is amended by deleting:<br />"At least 5 KG but less than 10 KG of Secobarbital (or the equivalent amount of other<br />Schedule I or II Depressants) or Schedule III substances (except Anabolic Steroids);<br />At least 10,000 but less than 20,000 units of Anabolic Steroids.",<br />and by inserting in lieu thereof:<br />"At least 10,000 but less than 20,000 units of Schedule I or II Depressants or Schedule<br />III substances.".<br />Section 2D1.1(c)(13) is amended by deleting:<br />"At least 2.5 KG but less than 5 KG of Secobarbital (or the equivalent amount of other<br />Schedule I or II Depressants) or Schedule III substances (except Anabolic Steroids);<br />At least 5,000 but less than 10,000 units of Anabolic Steroids.",<br />and by inserting in lieu thereof:<br />"At least 5,000 but less than 10,000 units of Schedule I or II Depressants or Schedule III<br />substances.".<br />Section 2D1.1(c)(14) is amended by deleting:<br />"At least 1.25 KG but less than 2.5 KG of Secobarbital (or the equivalent amount of other<br />Schedule I or II Depressants) or Schedule III substances (except Anabolic Steroids);<br />At least 2,500 but less than 5,000 units of Anabolic Steroids;<br />20 KG or more of Schedule IV substances.",<br />and inserting in lieu thereof:<br />"At least 2,500 but less than 5,000 units of Schedule I or II Depressants or Schedule III<br />substances;<br />40,000 or more units of Schedule IV substances.".<br />Section 2D1.1(c)(15) is amended by deleting:<br />"At least 500 G but less than 1.25 KG of Secobarbital (or the equivalent amount of other<br />Schedule I or II Depressants) or Schedule III substances (except Anabolic Steroids);<br />At least 1,000 but less than 2,500 units of Anabolic Steroids;<br />At least 8 KG but less than 20 KG of Schedule IV substances.",<br />and inserting in lieu thereof:<br />Amendment 517 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003<br /><br />"At least 1,000 but less than 2,500 units of Schedule I or II Depressants or Schedule III<br />substances;<br />At least 16,000 but less than 40,000 units of Schedule IV substances.".<br />Section 2D1.1(c)(16) is amended by deleting:<br />"At least 125 G but less than 500 G of Secobarbital (or the equivalent amount of other<br />Schedule I or II Depressants) or Schedule III substances (except Anabolic Steroids);<br />At least 250 but less than 1,000 units of Anabolic Steroids;<br />At least 2 KG but less than 8 KG of Schedule IV substances;<br />20 KG or more of Schedule V substances.",<br />and inserting in lieu thereof:<br />"At least 250 but less than 1,000 units of Schedule I or II Depressants or Schedule III<br />substances;<br />At least 4,000 but less than 16,000 units of Schedule IV substances;<br />40,000 or more units of Schedule V substances.".<br />Section 2D1.1(c)(17) is amended by deleting:<br />"Less than 125 G of Secobarbital (or the equivalent amount of other Schedule I or II<br />Depressants) or Schedule III substances (except Anabolic Steroids);<br />Less than 250 units of Anabolic Steroids;<br />Less than 2 KG of Schedule IV substances;<br />Less than 20 KG of Schedule V substances.",<br />and inserting in lieu thereof:<br />"Less than 250 units of Schedule I or II Depressants or Schedule III substances;<br />Less than 4,000 units of Schedule IV substances;<br />Less than 40,000 units of Schedule V substances.".<br />Section 2D1.1(c) is amended in the notes following the Drug Quantity Table by inserting the<br />following additional note as the sixth note:<br />"In the case of Schedule I or II Depressants, Schedule III substances (except anabolic<br />steroids), Schedule IV substances, and Schedule V substances, one ‘unit’ means one pill,<br />capsule, or tablet.

Schedule I and II<br />Depressants and Schedule III, IV, and V substances are almost always in pill, capsule, or tablet<br />Amendment 517 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003<br /><br />form. The current guidelines use the total weight of the pill, capsule, or tablet containing the<br />controlled substance. This method leads to anomalies because the weight of most pills is<br />determined primarily by the filler rather than the controlled substance. Thus, heavy pills lead<br />to higher offense levels even though there is little or no relationship between gross weight and<br />the potency of the pill. Applying the Drug Quantity Table according to the number of pills will<br />both simplify guideline application and more fairly assess the scale and seriousness of the<br />offense.</td><td>Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1995.</td></tr><tr><td class="n">515</td><td>Amendment 515</td><td>Section 2D1.1(c) is amended in the notes following the Drug Quantity Table<br />by inserting the following additional notes at the end:<br />"Hashish, for the purposes of this guideline, means a resinous substance of cannabis that<br />includes (i) one or more of the tetrahydrocannabinols (as listed in 21 C.F.R.<br />&#167; 1308.11(d)(25)), (ii) at least two of the following: cannabinol, cannabidiol, or<br />cannabichromene, and (iii) fragments of plant material (such as cystolith fibers).<br />Hashish oil, for the purposes of this guideline, means a preparation of the soluble<br />cannabinoids derived from cannabis that includes (i) one or more of the<br />tetrahydrocannabinols (as listed in 21 C.F.R. &#167; 1308.11(d)(25)), (ii) at least two of the<br />following: cannabinol, cannabidiol, or cannabichromene, and (iii) is essentially free of<br />plant material (e.g., plant fragments).

However, where the court finds that the defendant did not intend to produce<br />and was not reasonably capable of producing the negotiated amount, the court shall<br />exclude from the guideline calculation the amount that it finds the defendant did not<br />intend to produce and was not reasonably capable of producing.",<br />and inserting in lieu thereof:<br />"In an offense involving an agreement to sell a controlled substance, the agreed-upon<br />quantity of the controlled substance shall be used to determine the offense level unless<br />the sale is completed and the amount delivered more accurately reflects the scale of the<br />offense. For example, a defendant agrees to sell 500 grams of cocaine, the transaction<br />is completed by the delivery of the controlled substance - actually 480 grams of cocaine,<br />and no further delivery is scheduled. In this example, the amount delivered more<br />accurately reflects the scale of the offense. In contrast, in a reverse sting, the agreed-<br />upon quantity of the controlled substance would more accurately reflect the scale of the<br />offense because the amount actually delivered is controlled by the government, not by<br />the defendant. If, however, the defendant establishes that he or she did not intend to<br />provide, or was not reasonably capable of providing, the agreed-upon quantity of the<br />controlled substance, the court shall exclude from the offense level determination the<br />amount of controlled substance that the defendant establishes that he or she did not<br />intend to provide or was not reasonably capable of providing.".<br />The Commentary to &#167;2D1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by deleting Note 13<br />as follows:<br />"13. If subsection (b)(2)(B) applies, do not apply &#167;3B1.3 (Abuse of Position of Trust<br />or Use of Special Skill).".<br />The Commentary to &#167;2D1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by deleting Note 14<br />as follows:<br />Amendment 518 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003<br /><br />"14. D-lysergic acid, which is generally used to make LSD, is classified as a Schedule<br />III controlled substance (to which &#167;2D1.1 applies) and as a listed precursor (to<br />which &#167;2D1.11 applies).

For purposes of the guidelines, a ‘plant’ is an organism having leaves and a<br />readily observable root formation (e.g., a marihuana cutting having roots, a<br />rootball, or root hairs is a marihuana plant).".</td><td>Reason for Amendment: This is an eight-part amendment. First, this amendment adds<br />definitions of hashish and hashish oil to &#167;2D1.1 (Unlawful Manufacturing, Importing,<br />Exporting, or Trafficking; Attempt or Conspiracy) in the notes following the Drug Quantity<br />Table. These terms are not defined by statute or in the existing guidelines, leading to litigation<br />as to which substances are to be classified as hashish or hashish oil, as opposed to marihuana.<br />See United States v. Gravelle, 819 F. Supp. 1076 (S.D. Fla. 1993); United States v. Schultz,<br />810 F. Supp. 230 (S.D. Ohio 1992).<br />Second, this amendment clarifies the treatment of marihuana that has a moisture content<br />sufficient to render it unusable without drying (e.g., a bale of marihuana left in the rain or<br />recently harvested marihuana that has not had time to dry). In such cases, using the weight of<br />the wet marihuana can increase the offense level for a factor that bears no relationship to the<br />scale of the offense or the marketable form of the marihuana. Prior to the effective date of the<br />1993 amendments, two circuits had approved weighing wet marihuana despite the fact that the<br />marihuana was not in a usable form. United States v. Pinedo-Montoya, 966 F.2d 591 (10th Cir.<br />1992); United States v. Garcia, 925 F.2d 170 (7th Cir. 1991). Although Application Note 1 in<br />the Commentary to &#167;2D1.1, effective November 1, 1993 (pertaining to unusable parts of a<br />mixture or substance) should produce the appropriate result because marihuana must be dried<br />before being used, this type of case is sufficiently distinct to warrant a specific reference in this<br />application note to ensure correct application of the guideline.<br />Third, this amendment simplifies the Commentary to &#167;2D1.1 by consolidating application notes<br />8 and 13.<br />Fourth, this amendment deletes an outdated application note in the Commentary to &#167;2D1.1<br />pertaining to the classification of d-lysergic acid as a listed precursor chemical.<br />Fifth, this amendment addresses the issue of what constitutes a marihuana plant. Several<br />circuits have confronted the issue of when a cutting from a marihuana plant becomes a "plant."<br /><br />The appellate courts generally have held that the term "plant" should be defined by "its plain<br />and ordinary dictionary meaning. . . . [A] marihuana ‘plant’ includes those cuttings<br />accompanied by root balls." United States v. Edge, 989 F.2d 871, 878 (6th Cir. 1993) (quoting<br />United States v. Eves, 932 F.2d 856, 860 (10th Cir. 1991), appeal after remand, 30 F.3d 134<br />(6th Cir. 1994)). See also United States v. Malbrough, 922 F.2d 458, 465 (8th Cir. 1990)<br />(acquiescing in the district court’s apparent determination that certain marihuana cuttings that<br />did not have their own "root system" should not be counted as plants), cert. denied, 501 S. Ct.<br />1258 (1991); United States v. Carlisle, 907 F.2d 94, 96 (9th Cir. 1990) (finding that cuttings<br />were plants where each cutting had previous degrees of root formation not clearly erroneous);<br />United States v. Angell, 794 F. Supp. 874, 875 (D. Minn. 1990) (refusing to count as plants<br />marihuana cuttings that have no visible root structure), aff’d in part and rev’d in part, 11 F.3d<br />806 (8th Cir.), cert. denied, 114 S. Ct. 3747 (1994); United States v. Fitol, 733 F. Supp. 1312,<br />1316 (D. Minn. 1990) ("individual cuttings, planted with the intent of growing full size plants,<br />and which had grown roots, are ‘plants’ both within common parlance and within Section<br />841(b)"); United States v. Speltz, 733 F. Supp. 1311, 1312 (D. Minn. 1990) (small marihuana<br />plants, e.g., cuttings with roots, are nonetheless still marihuana plants), aff’d, 938 F.2d 188 (8th<br />Cir. 1991). Because this issue arises frequently, this amendment adds an application note to<br />the Commentary of &#167;2D1.1 setting forth the definition of a plant for guidelines purposes.<br />Sixth, this amendment provides equivalencies for two additional controlled substances: (1)<br />khat, and (2) levo-alpha-acetylmethadol (LAAM) in the Drug Equivalency Tables in the<br />Commentary to &#167;2D1.1.<br />Seventh, this amendment deletes the distinction between d- and l-methamphetamine in the<br />Drug Equivalency Tables in the Commentary to &#167;2D1.1. L-methamphetamine, which is a rather<br />weak form of methamphetamine, is rarely seen and is not made intentionally, but rather results<br />from a botched attempt to produce d-methamphetamine. Under this amendment,<br />l-methamphetamine would be treated the same as d-methamphetamine (i.e., as if an attempt to<br />manufacture or distribute d-methamphetamine). Currently, unless the methamphetamine is<br />specifically tested to determine its form, litigation can result over whether the<br />methamphetamine is l- methamphetamine or d-methamphetamine. In addition, there is another<br />form of methamphetamine (dl-methamphetamine) that is not listed in the Drug Equivalency<br />Table. The listing of l-methamphetamine as a separate form of methamphetamine has led to<br />litigation as to how dl-methamphetamine should be treated. In United States v. Carroll, 6 F.3d<br />735 (11th Cir. 1993), cert. denied, 114 S. Ct. 1234 (1994), a case in which the Eleventh Circuit<br />held that dl-methamphetamine should be treated as d-methamphetamine, the majority and<br />dissenting opinions both point out the complexity engendered by the current distinction<br />between d- and l- methamphetamine. Under this amendment, all forms of methamphetamine<br />are treated alike, thereby simplifying guideline application.<br />Eighth, this amendment revises the Commentary to &#167;2D1.1 to provide that in a case involving<br />negotiation for a quantity of a controlled substance, the negotiated quantity is used to determine<br />the offense level unless the completed transaction establishes a different quantity, or the<br />defendant establishes that he or she was not reasonably capable of producing the negotiated<br />amount or otherwise did not intend to produce that amount.

This<br />reflects that only one listed precursor typically is used in a given manufacturing<br />process. For example, in the case of an offense involving 300 grams of<br />piperidine and 800 grams of benzyl cyanide, the piperidine is converted to 600<br />grams of ephedrine and the benzyl cyanide is converted to 800 grams of<br />ephedrine, using the Precursor Chemical Equivalency Table, for a total of 1400<br />grams of ephedrine. Applying the Chemical Quantity Table to 1400 grams (1.4<br />kilograms) of ephedrine results in a base offense level of 22.",<br />and inserting in lieu thereof:<br />"4. When two or more list I chemicals are used together in the same manufacturing<br /><br />process, calculate the offense level for each separately and use the quantity that<br />results in the greatest base offense level. In any other case, the quantities should<br />be added together (using the List I Chemical Equivalency Table) for the purpose<br />of calculating the base offense level.<br />Examples:<br />(a) The defendant was in possession of five kilograms of ephedrine and three<br />kilograms of hydriodic acid. Ephedrine and hydriodic acid typically are<br />used together in the same manufacturing process to manufacture<br />methamphetamine. Therefore, the base offense level for each listed<br />chemical is calculated separately and the list I chemical with the higher<br />base offense level is used. Five kilograms of ephedrine result in a base<br />offense level of 24; 300 grams of hydriodic acid result in a base offense<br />level of 14. In this case, the base offense level would be 24.<br />(b) The defendant was in possession of five kilograms of ephedrine and two<br />kilograms of phenylacetic acid. Although both of these chemicals are<br />used to manufacture methamphetamine, they are not used together in the<br />same manufacturing process. Therefore, the quantity of phenylacetic acid<br />should be converted to an ephedrine equivalency using the List I<br />Chemical Equivalency Table and then added to the quantity of ephedrine.<br />In this case, the two kilograms of phenylacetic acid convert to two<br />kilograms of ephedrine (see List I Chemical Equivalency Table),<br />resulting in a total equivalency of seven kilograms of ephedrine.".<br />The Commentary to &#167;2D1.11 is amended by deleting "listed precursor" wherever it appears and<br />inserting in lieu thereof "list I"; and by deleting "listed essential" and inserting in lieu thereof<br />in each instance "list II".<br />The Commentary to &#167;2D1.11 captioned "Background" is amended in the second sentence by<br />deleting "Listed precursor chemicals are critical to the formation of a controlled substance and"<br />and inserting in lieu thereof "List I chemicals are important to the manufacture of a controlled<br />substance and usually".<br />The Commentary to &#167;2D1.11 captioned "Background" is amended by deleting the last sentence<br />as follows:<br />"Listed essential chemicals are generally solvents, catalysts, and reagents, and do not<br />become part of the finished product.",<br />and inserting in lieu thereof:<br />"List II chemicals are generally used as solvents, catalysts, and reagents.".</td><td>Reason for Amendment: The Domestic Chemical Diversion Act of 1993, Pub. L. 103-200,<br />107 Stat. 2333, changed the designations of the listed chemicals from "listed precursor<br />chemicals" and "listed essential chemicals" to "list I chemicals" and "list II chemicals,"<br />Amendment 519 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003<br /><br />respectively. This amendment conforms &#167;2D1.11 (Unlawfully Distributing, Importing,<br />Exporting or Possessing a Listed Chemical; Attempt or Conspiracy) to these statutory changes.<br />The Act also adds pills containing ephedrine as a list I chemical. Ephedrine itself is a list I<br />chemical under 21 U.S.C. &#167; 802(34). Pills containing ephedrine previously were not covered<br />by the statute and, thus, legally could be purchased "over the counter." Purchases of these pills<br />were sometimes made in large quantities and the pills crushed and processed to extract the<br />ephedrine (which can be used to make methamphetamine). Unlike ephedrine, which is<br />purchased from a chemical company and is virtually 100 percent pure, these tablets contain a<br />substantially lower percentage of ephedrine (about 25 percent). To avoid unwarranted<br />disparity, this amendment adds a note to &#167;2D1.11 providing that the amount of actual ephedrine<br />contained in a pill is to be used in determining the offense level.<br />In addition, the Act removes three chemicals from, and adds two others to, the listed chemicals<br />controlled under the Controlled Substances Act. Two of the chemicals removed from the list<br />are not currently listed in &#167;2D1.11 because the Commission was aware that they are not used<br />in the manufacture of any controlled substance. The third chemical removed from the list, d-<br />lysergic acid, was listed both as a listed chemical in &#167;2D1.11 and as a controlled substance in<br />&#167;2D1.1 (Unlawful Manufacturing, Importing, Exporting, or Trafficking; Attempt or<br />Conspiracy). This amendment conforms &#167;2D1.11 by deleting all references to d-lysergic acid.<br />The two chemicals added as listed chemicals are benzaldehyde and nitroethane. Both of these<br />chemicals are used to make methamphetamine. The base offense levels for listed chemicals<br />in &#167;2D1.11 are determined by reference to the most common controlled substance the chemical<br />is used to manufacture; consequently, this amendment adds these chemicals to the Chemical<br />Quantity Table based on information provided by the Drug Enforcement Administration<br />regarding their use in the production of methamphetamine.<br />A number of the chemicals in the Chemical Quantity Table in &#167;2D1.11 are used in the same<br />process to make a controlled substance. A note at the end of the existing Precursor Chemical<br />Equivalency Table addresses this situation for hydriodic acid and ephedrine. This amendment<br />expands this note to cover other chemicals that similarly are used together.<br />In addition, this amendment corrects Application Note 3 of the Commentary to &#167;2D1.11 with<br />respect to an example of a listed chemical that is used with P2P to manufacture<br />methamphetamine and a reference to a subdivision of the Drug Equivalency Tables in the<br />Commentary to &#167;2D1.1.</td><td>Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1995.</td></tr><tr><td class="n">517</td><td>Amendment 517</td><td>Section 2D1.12(a) is amended by inserting "(Apply the greater)" immediately<br />after "Base Offense Level"; and by deleting "12" and inserting in lieu thereof:<br />"(1) 12, if the defendant intended to manufacture a controlled substance or knew or<br />believed the prohibited equipment was to be used to manufacture a controlled<br />substance; or<br />(2) 9, if the defendant had reasonable cause to believe the prohibited equipment was<br />to be used to manufacture a controlled substance.".</td><td>Reason for Amendment: The Domestic Chemical Diversion Act of 1993, Pub.

Section 2D1.12 (Unlawful Possession,<br />Manufacture, Distribution, or Importation of Prohibited Flask or Equipment; Attempt or<br />Conspiracy) applies to this conduct. Consistent with the treatment of similar conduct under<br />&#167;&#167;2D1.11(b)(2) and 2D1.13(b)(2), this amendment provides an alternative base offense level<br />in &#167;2D1.12 to address the case in which the defendant had reasonable cause to believe, but not<br />actual knowledge or belief, that the equipment was to be used to manufacture a controlled<br />substance.</td><td>Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1995.</td></tr><tr><td class="n">518</td><td>Amendment 518</td><td>Chapter Two, Part H, Subpart 1 is amended by deleting:<br />"Introductory Commentary<br />This subpart covers violations of civil rights statutes that typically penalize<br />conduct involving death or bodily injury more severely than discriminatory or<br />intimidating conduct not involving such injury.<br />The addition of two levels to the offense level applicable to the underlying<br />offense in this subpart reflects the fact that the harm involved both the underlying<br />conduct and activity intended to deprive a person of his civil rights.

For example, in the case of a conspiracy<br />to interfere with a person’s civil rights (a violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 241) that<br />involved an aggravated assault (the use of force) to deny certain rights or benefits<br />in furtherance of discrimination (a violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 245), the underlying<br />offense in respect to both the violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 241 (to which &#167;2H1.1<br />applies) and the violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 245 (to which &#167;2H1.3 applies) would<br />be the aggravated assault.<br />‘2 plus the offense level applicable to any underlying offense’ means 2 levels<br />above the offense level (base offense level plus any applicable specific offense<br />characteristics and cross references) from the offense guideline in Chapter Two<br />that most closely corresponds to the underlying offense. For example, if the<br />underlying offense was second degree murder, which under &#167;2A1.2 has an<br />offense level of 33, ‘2 plus the offense level applicable to any underlying<br />offense’ would be 33 + 2 = 35. If the underlying offense was assault, criminal<br />sexual conduct, kidnapping, abduction or unlawful restraint, the offense level<br />from the guideline for the most comparable offense in &#167;&#167;2A2.1-2A4.2 (Assault,<br />Criminal Sexual Abuse, and Kidnapping, Abduction, or Unlawful Restraint)<br />would first be determined, and 2 levels then would be added. If the underlying<br />offense was damage to property by means of arson or an explosive device, the<br />offense level from &#167;2K1.4 (Arson; Property Damage By Use of Explosives)<br />would first be determined and 2 levels would be added. If the offense was<br />property damage by other means, the offense level from &#167;2B1.3 (Property<br />Damage or Destruction) would first be determined and 2 levels would be added.<br />If the offense was a conspiracy or attempt to commit arson, ‘2 plus the offense<br />level applicable to any underlying offense’ would be the offense level from the<br />guideline applicable to a conspiracy or attempt to commit arson plus 2 levels.<br />In certain cases, the count of which the defendant is convicted may set forth<br />conduct that constitutes more than one underlying offense (e.g., two instances of<br />assault, or one instance of assault and one instance of arson). In such cases,<br />determine the offense level for the underlying offense by treating each<br />underlying offense as if contained in a separate count of conviction. To<br />determine which of the alternative base offense levels (e.g., &#167;2H1.1(a)(1) or<br />(a)(2)) results in the greater offense level, apply Chapter Three, Parts A, B, C,<br />and D to each alternative base offense level. Use whichever results in the greater<br />offense level. Example: The defendant is convicted of one count of conspiracy<br />to violate civil rights that included two level 12 underlying offenses (of a type<br />not grouped together under Chapter Three, Part D). No adjustment from Chapter<br />Three, Parts A, B, or C applies. The base offense level from &#167;2H1.1(a)(1) is 15.<br />The offense level for each underlying offense from &#167;2H1.1(a)(2) is 14 (2 + 12).<br />Under Chapter Three, Part D (Multiple Counts), the two level 14 underlying<br /><br />offenses result in a combined offense level of 16. This offense level is greater<br />than the alternative base offense level of 15 under &#167;2H1.1(a)(1). Therefore, the<br />case is treated as if there were two counts, one for each underlying offense, with<br />a base offense level under &#167;2H1.1(a)(2) of 14 for each underlying offense.<br />2. Where the adjustment in &#167;2H1.1(b)(1) is applied, do not apply &#167;3B1.3 (Abuse<br />of Position of Trust or Use of Special Skill).<br />Background: This section applies to intimidating activity by various groups, including<br />formally and informally organized groups as well as hate groups. The maximum term<br />of imprisonment authorized by statute is ten years; except where death results, the<br />maximum term of imprisonment authorized by statute is life imprisonment.

Where the adjustment in &#167;2H1.3(b)(1) is applied, do not apply &#167;3B1.3 (Abuse<br />of Position of Trust or Use of Special Skill).<br />Amendment 521 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003<br /><br />4. In the case of a violation of 42 U.S.C. &#167; 3631, apply this guideline where the<br />offense involved the threat or use of force. Otherwise, apply &#167;2H1.5.<br />Background: The statutes covered by this guideline provide federal protection for the<br />exercise of civil rights in a variety of contexts (e.g., voting, employment, public<br />accommodations, etc.). The base offense level in &#167;2H1.3(a) reflects that the threat or use<br />of force is inherent in the offense. The maximum term of imprisonment authorized by<br />statute is one year if no bodily injury results, ten years if bodily injury results, and life<br />imprisonment if death results.<br />&#167;2H1.4.

See the discussion<br />in the Commentary to &#167;2H1.1.<br />2. Do not apply the adjustment from &#167;3B1.3 (Abuse of Position of Trust or Use of<br />Special Skill).<br />Background: This maximum term of imprisonment authorized by 18 U.S.C. &#167; 242 is one<br />year if no bodily injury results, ten years if bodily injury results, and life imprisonment<br />if death results. A base offense level of 10 is prescribed at &#167;2H1.4(a)(1) providing a<br />guideline sentence near the one-year statutory maximum for cases not resulting in death<br />or bodily injury because of the compelling public interest in deterring and adequately<br />punishing those who violate civil rights under color of law. The Commission intends to<br />recommend that this one-year statutory maximum penalty be increased. An alternative<br />base offense level is provided at &#167;2H1.4(a)(2). The 6-level increase under subsection<br />(a)(2) reflects the 2-level increase that is applied to other offenses covered in this Part<br />plus a 4-level increase for the commission of the offense under actual or purported legal<br />authority. This 4-level increase is inherent in the base offense level of 10 under<br />subsection (a)(1).<br />Enhancement under &#167;3B1.3 (Abuse of Position of Trust or Use of Special Skill) is<br />inappropriate because the base offense level in &#167;2H1.4(a) reflects that the abuse of actual<br />or purported legal authority is inherent in the offense.<br /><br />&#167;2H1.5.

This adjustment applies to offenses where an unusually vulnerable victim is<br />made a target of criminal activity by the defendant. The adjustment would apply,<br />for example, in a fraud case where the defendant marketed an ineffective cancer<br />cure or in a robbery where the defendant selected a handicapped victim. But it<br />would not apply in a case where the defendant sold fraudulent securities by mail<br />to the general public and one of the victims happened to be senile. Similarly, for<br />example, a bank teller is not an unusually vulnerable victim solely by virtue of<br />the teller’s position in a bank.<br />2. Do not apply this adjustment if the offense guideline specifically incorporates<br />this factor. For example, where the offense guideline provides an enhancement<br />for the age of the victim, this guideline should not be applied unless the victim<br />was unusually vulnerable for reasons unrelated to age.".<br />A replacement guideline with accompanying commentary is inserted as &#167;3A1.1 (Hate Crime<br />Motivation or Vulnerable Victim).<br />The Commentary to &#167;2H4.1 captioned "Application Note" is amended in Note 1 by deleting<br />"2 plus the offense" and inserting in lieu thereof "Offense".</td><td>Reason for Amendment: This is a five-part amendment. First, the amendment adds an<br />additional subsection to &#167;3A1.1 (Vulnerable Victim) to implement the directive contained in<br />Section 280003 of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 by providing<br />a three-level increase in the offense level for offenses that are "hate crimes." Second, the<br />amendment consolidates &#167;&#167;2H1.1 (Offenses Involving Individual Rights), 2H1.3 (Use of Force<br />or Threat of Force to Deny Benefits or Rights in Furtherance of Discrimination; Damage to<br />Religious Real Property), 2H1.4 (Interference with Civil Rights Under Color of Law), and<br />2H1.5 (Other Deprivations of Rights Benefits in Furtherance of Discrimination) into a revised<br />&#167;2H1.1 (Offenses Involving Individual Rights). This revised guideline provides greater<br />consistency in offense levels for similar conduct, reflects the additional enhancement now<br />contained in &#167;3A1.1, and better reflects the seriousness of the underlying conduct. Third, the<br />amendment references violations of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 248 (the Freedom of Access to Clinic<br />Entrances Act of 1994, Pub. L. 103-259, 108 Stat. 694) to the consolidated &#167;2H1.1. Fourth,<br />the amendment clarifies the operation of &#167;3A1.1 with respect to a vulnerable victim. Fifth, the<br />amendment addresses the directive to the Commission in section 240002 of the Violent Crime<br />Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 (pertaining to elderly victims of crimes of violence).<br />Section 280003 of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 directs the<br />Commission to provide a minimum enhancement of three levels for offenses that the finder of<br />fact at trial determines are hate crimes. This directive also instructs the Commission to ensure<br />that there is reasonable consistency with other guidelines and that duplicative punishments for<br />the same offense are avoided. The congressional directive in section 280003 requires that the<br />three-level hate crimes enhancement apply where "the finder of fact at trial determines beyond<br />a reasonable doubt" that the offense of conviction was a hate crime. This amendment makes<br />the enhancement applicable if either the finder of fact at trial or, in the case of a guilty or nolo<br />contendere plea, the court at sentencing determines that the offense was a hate crime. By<br />broadening the applicability of the congressionally mandated enhancement, this amendment<br />will avoid unwarranted sentencing disparity based on the mode of conviction. The<br /><br />Commission’s general guideline promulgation authority, see 28 U.S.C. &#167; 994, permits such a<br />broadening of the enhancement.<br />The addition of a generally applicable Chapter Three hate crimes enhancement requires<br />amendment of the civil rights offense guidelines to avoid duplicative punishments. In addition,<br />to further the Commission’s goal of simplifying the operation of the guidelines, the proposed<br />amendment consolidates the four current civil rights offense guidelines into one guideline and<br />adjusts these guidelines to take into account the new enhancement under &#167;3A1.1(a).<br />The Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act of 1994 makes it a crime to interfere with<br />access to reproductive services or to interfere with certain religious activities. This Act<br />criminalizes a broad array of conduct, from non-violent obstruction of the entrance to a clinic<br />to murder. The amendment treats these violations in the same way as other offenses involving<br />individual rights.<br />Section 240002 of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 directs the<br />Commission to ensure that the guidelines provide sufficiently stringent penalties for crimes of<br />violence against elderly victims. Upon review of the guidelines, the Commission determined<br />that the penalties currently provided generally appear appropriate; however, this amendment<br />strengthens the Commentary to &#167;3A1.1 in one area by expressly providing a basis for an<br />upward departure if both the current offense and a prior offense involved a vulnerable victim<br />(including an elderly victim), regardless of the type of offense.<br />Finally, Section 250003 of the Violent Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 directs the<br />Commission to review, and if necessary, amend the sentencing guidelines to ensure that victim-<br />related adjustments for fraud offenses against older victims are adequate. Section 250003 also<br />directs the Commission to study and report to the Congress on this issue. See Report to<br />Congress: Adequacy of Penalties for Fraud Offenses Involving Elderly Victims (March 13,<br />1995). Although the Commission found that the current guidelines generally provided<br />adequate penalties in these cases, it noted some inconsistency in the application of &#167;3A1.1<br />regarding whether this adjustment required proof that the defendant had "targeted the victim<br />on account of the victim’s vulnerability." This amendment revises the Commentary of &#167;3A1.1<br />to clarify application with respect to this issue.</td><td>Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1995.</td></tr><tr><td class="n">519</td><td>Amendment 519</td><td>Section &#167;2K2.1(a)(1) is amended by deleting:<br />"defendant had at least two prior felony convictions of either a crime of violence or a<br />controlled substance offense, and the instant offense involved a firearm listed in<br />26 U.S.C. &#167; 5845(a)",<br />and inserting in lieu thereof:<br />"offense involved a firearm described in 26 U.S.C. &#167; 5845(a) or 18 U.S.C. &#167; 921(a)(30),<br />and the defendant had at least two prior felony convictions of either a crime of violence<br />or a controlled substance offense".<br />Amendment 522 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003<br /><br />Section &#167;2K2.1(a)(3) is amended by deleting:<br />"defendant had one prior felony conviction of either a crime of violence or a controlled<br />substance offense, and the instant offense involved a firearm listed in 26 U.S.C.<br />&#167; 5845(a)",<br />and inserting in lieu thereof:<br />"offense involved a firearm described in 26 U.S.C. &#167; 5845(a) or 18 U.S.C. &#167; 921(a)(30),<br />and the defendant had one prior conviction of either a crime of violence or controlled<br />substance offense".<br />Section &#167;2K2.1(a)(4)(B) is amended by deleting "listed in 26 U.S.C. &#167; 5845(a)" and inserting<br />in lieu thereof "described in 26 U.S.C. &#167; 5845(a) or 18 U.S.C. &#167; 921(a)(30)".<br />Section 2K2.1(a)(5) is amended by deleting "listed in 26 U.S.C. &#167; 5845(a)" and inserting in lieu<br />thereof "described in 26 U.S.C. &#167; 5845(a) or 18 U.S.C. &#167; 921(a)(30)".<br />Section 2K2.1(a)(8) is amended by deleting "or (m)" and by inserting in lieu thereof "(m), (s),<br />(t), or (x)(1)".<br />The Commentary to &#167;2K2.1 captioned "Statutory Provisions" is amended by deleting "(r)" and<br />inserting in lieu thereof "(r)-(w), (x)(1)"; and by deleting "(g)" and inserting in lieu thereof "(g),<br />(h), (j)-(n)".<br />The Commentary to &#167;2K2.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by deleting:<br />"3. ‘Firearm listed in 26 U.S.C. &#167; 5845(a)’ includes: (i) any short-barreled rifle or<br />shotgun or any weapon made therefrom; (ii) a machinegun; (iii) a silencer; (iv)<br />a destructive device; or (v) any ‘other weapon,’ as that term is defined by 26<br />U.S.C. &#167; 5845(e).

The legislative history of this<br />provision suggests that the phrase ‘maximum term authorized’ should be construed as<br />the maximum term authorized by statute. See S.

The amendment responds to a decision<br />by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in United States v.<br />Price, 990 F.2d 1367 (D.C. Cir. 1993). In Price, the court invalidated application of the career<br />offender guideline to a defendant convicted of a drug conspiracy because 28 U.S.C. &#167; 994(h),<br />which the Commission cites as the mandating authority for the career offender guideline, does<br />not expressly refer to inchoate offenses. The court indicated that it did not foreclose<br />Commission authority to include conspiracy offenses under the career offender guideline by<br />drawing upon its broader guideline promulgation authority in 28 U.S.C. &#167; 994(a).

Sections 40221 and 250002 add<br />similar "mandatory" restitution provisions for offenses involving domestic violence (18 U.S.C.<br />&#167; 2264) and telemarketing fraud (18 U.S.C. &#167; 2327). These provisions also require that<br />compliance with a restitution order be a condition of probation or supervised release, have<br />broader definitions of loss than 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3663, and apply "notwithstanding section 3663,<br />and in addition to any civil or criminal penalty authorized by law." This amendment adds<br />commentary to &#167;5E1.1 (Restitution) to alert courts to these statutory provisions.<br />In addition, this amendment conforms &#167;5E1.1 to the redesignation of 49 U.S.C. &#167; 1472(h), (i),<br />(j), and (n) as 49 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 46312, 46502(a), (b), and 46504, and the redesignation of Rule<br />32(c)(2)(D) as Rule 32(b)(4)(D).</td><td>Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1995.</td></tr><tr><td class="n">528</td><td>Amendment 528</td><td>Chapter Five, Part K, Subpart Two is amended by inserting an additional policy<br />statement as &#167;5K2.17 (High-Capacity, Semiautomatic Firearms).</td><td>Reason for Amendment: This amendment addresses the directive in section 110501 of the<br />Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 to provide an appropriate<br />enhancement for a crime of violence or drug trafficking crime if a semiautomatic firearm is<br />involved.<br />According to data reviewed by the Commission, semiautomatic firearms are used in 50-70<br />percent of offenses involving a firearm. Thus, offenses involving a semiautomatic firearm<br />represent the typical or "heartland" case under the guidelines. Consequently, the firearms<br />enhancements in the guidelines for crimes of violence and drug trafficking can be considered<br />to take into account the fact that firearms involved in these offenses typically are<br />semiautomatic. Moreover, the "firepower" or "dangerousness" of semiautomatic firearms,<br />compared to other types of firearms, varies substantially with caliber and magazine capacity.<br />For example, a .25 caliber, six-shot semiautomatic pistol is not considered as having as much<br />firepower as a .38 caliber, six-shot revolver or a .357 magnum, six-shot revolver. A nine-<br />millimeter semiautomatic pistol fires a somewhat more powerful cartridge than a .38 caliber<br />revolver and a somewhat less powerful cartridge than a .357 magnum revolver. But some nine-<br />millimeter semiautomatic pistols hold from 14-18 cartridges, compared to six cartridges for a<br />revolver. A high magazine capacity, nine-millimeter semiautomatic pistol can be said to have<br />significantly more firepower than a revolver because it can fire a significantly larger number<br />of shots without reloading.<br />If harm actually results (e.g., death or bodily injury), the guidelines generally take that harm<br />into account directly. Consequently, in considering any distinction between semiautomatic<br />firearms and other firearms, the issue is whether there is any significant difference in the risk<br />of harm. The difference in the risk of harm also varies widely with the circumstances of the<br />offense. For example, in a robbery at very close range, the difference in the likelihood of death<br />or bodily injury between a revolver and semiautomatic pistol would seem to be small. In<br />contrast, in a drive-by shooting the greater firepower of a semiautomatic weapon likely would<br />have a more significant effect on the likelihood of death or injury.<br />After considering the above factors, the Commission determined that the most appropriate<br />approach at this time was to provide a specific basis for an upward departure when a high-<br />capacity semiautomatic firearm is possessed in connection with a crime of violence or drug<br />trafficking offense, thereby allowing the courts the flexibility to take this factor into account<br />as appropriate in the circumstances of the particular case.</td><td>Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1995.</td></tr><tr><td class="n">529</td><td>Amendment 529</td><td>Chapter Five, Part K, Subpart Two is amended by inserting an additional policy<br />statement as &#167;5K1.18 (Violent Street Gangs).</td><td>Reason for Amendment: This amendment expressly provides a basis for an upward departure<br />in the case of a defendant subject to a statutorily enhanced maximum penalty under 18 U.S.C.<br />Amendment 533 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003<br /><br />&#167; 521 (pertaining to criminal street gangs), as enacted by section 150000 of the Violent Crime<br />and Law Enforcement Act of 1994.</td><td>Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1995.</td></tr><tr><td class="n">530</td><td>Amendment 530</td><td>Section 7B1.3(g)(2) is amended by deleting "the defendant may, to the extent<br />permitted by law, be ordered to recommence supervised release upon release from<br />imprisonment" and inserting in lieu thereof:<br />"the court may include a requirement that the defendant be placed on a term of<br />supervised release upon release from imprisonment. The length of such a term of<br />supervised release shall not exceed the term of supervised release authorized by statute<br />for the offense that resulted in the original term of supervised release, less any term of<br />imprisonment that was imposed upon revocation of supervised release. 18 U.S.C. &#167;<br />3583(h)".<br />The Commentary to &#167;7B1.3 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 2 by deleting:<br />".

Subsection (c) provides for the use of certain alternatives to imprisonment upon<br />revocation. It is to be noted, however, that a court may decide that not every<br />alternative is authorized by statute in every circumstance. For example, in<br />United States v. Behnezhad, 907 F.2d 896 (9th Cir. 1990), the Ninth Circuit held<br />that where a term of supervised release was revoked there was no statutory<br />authority to impose a further term of supervised release. Under this decision, in<br />the case of a revocation of a term of supervised release, an alternative that is<br />contingent upon imposition of a further term of supervised release (e.g., a period<br />of imprisonment followed by a period of community confinement or detention<br />as a condition of supervised release) cannot be implemented. The Commission<br />has transmitted to the Congress a proposal for a statutory amendment to address<br />this issue.";<br />and by renumbering the remaining notes accordingly.<br />The Commentary to &#167;7B1.4 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by deleting:<br /><br />"5. Under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3565(a), upon a finding that a defendant violated a condition<br />of probation by being in possession of a controlled substance, the court is<br />required ‘to revoke the sentence of probation and sentence the defendant to not<br />less than one-third of the original sentence.’ Under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3583(g), upon<br />a finding that a defendant violated a condition of supervised release by being in<br />possession of a controlled substance, the court is required ‘to terminate<br />supervised release and sentence the defendant to serve in prison not less than<br />one-third of the term of supervised release.’ The Commission leaves to the court<br />the determination of whether evidence of drug usage established solely by<br />laboratory analysis constitutes ‘possession of a controlled substance’ as set forth<br />in 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 3565(a) and 3583(g).<br />6. Under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3565(b), upon a finding that a defendant violated a condition<br />of probation by the actual possession of a firearm, the court is required ‘to revoke<br />the sentence of probation and impose any other sentence that was available ... at<br />the time of initial sentencing.’",<br />and inserting in lieu thereof:<br />"5. Upon a finding that a defendant violated a condition of probation or supervised<br />release by being in possession of a controlled substance or firearm or by refusing<br />to comply with a condition requiring drug testing, the court is required to revoke<br />probation or supervised release and impose a sentence that includes a term of<br />imprisonment. 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 3565(b), 3583(g).<br />6. In the case of a defendant who fails a drug test, the court shall consider whether<br />the availability of appropriate substance abuse programs, or a defendant’s current<br />or past participation in such programs, warrants an exception from the<br />requirement of mandatory revocation and imprisonment under 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167;<br />3565(b) and 3583(g). 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 3563(a), 3583(d).".</td><td>Reason for Amendment: Section 110505 of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement<br />Act of 1994 amends 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3583(e)(3) by specifying that a defendant whose supervised<br />release term is revoked may not be required to serve more than five years in prison if the<br />offense that resulted in the term of supervised release is a Class A felony. The provision also<br />amends section 3583(g) by eliminating the mandatory re-imprisonment period of at least one-<br />third of the term of supervised release if the defendant possesses a controlled substance.<br />Additionally, the provision requires the courts to revoke probation or supervised release and<br />impose a sentence that includes a term of imprisonment if the defendant is found to be in<br />possession of a firearm, or refuses to participate in drug testing. Finally, the provision<br />expressly authorizes the court to order an additional, limited period of supervision following<br />revocation of supervised release and re-imprisonment.<br />Section 20414 of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 makes<br />mandatory a condition of probation requiring that the defendant refrain from any unlawful use<br />of a controlled substance. 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3563(a)(4). The section also establishes a condition that<br />the defendant, with certain exceptions, submit to periodic drug tests. The existing mandatory<br />condition of probation requiring the defendant not to possess a controlled substance remains<br />Amendment 534 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003<br /><br />unchanged. 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3563(a)(3). Similar requirements are made with respect to conditions<br />of supervised release. 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3583(d).<br />Section 110506 of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 mandates<br />revocation of probation and imposition of a term of imprisonment if the defendant violates<br />probation by possessing a controlled substance or a firearm, or by refusing to comply with drug<br />testing. 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3565(b). It does not require revocation in the case of use of a controlled<br />substance (although use presumptively may establish possession). No minimum term of<br />imprisonment is required other than a sentence that includes a "term of imprisonment"<br />consistent with the sentencing guidelines and revocation policy statements. Similar<br />requirements are set forth in 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3583(g) with respect to conditions of supervised<br />release.<br />Section 20414 permits "an exception in accordance with United States Sentencing Commission<br />guidelines" from the mandatory revocation provisions of section 3565(b), "when considering<br />any action against a defendant who fails a drug test administered in accordance with [section<br />3563(a)(4)]." The exception from the mandatory revocation provisions appears limited to a<br />defendant who fails the test and does not appear to apply to a defendant who refuses to take the<br />test.<br />This amendment conforms &#167;&#167;7B1.3 (Revocation of Probation or Supervised Release) and<br />7B1.4 (Term of Imprisonment) to these revised statutory provisions.</td><td>Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1995.</td></tr><tr><td class="n">531</td><td>Amendment 531</td><td>Appendix A (Statutory Index) is amended by inserting the following at the<br />appropriate place by title and section:<br />"7 U.S.C. &#167;

Subsection (b) (which may apply only if subsection (a) does not apply),<br />addresses cases in which the conduct resulting in the undischarged term of<br />imprisonment has been fully taken into account under &#167;1B1.3 (Relevant<br />Conduct) in determining the offense level for the instant offense. This can occur,<br />for example, where a defendant is prosecuted in both federal and state court, or<br />in two or more federal jurisdictions, for the same criminal conduct or for<br />different criminal transactions that were part of the same course of conduct.<br />When a sentence is imposed pursuant to subsection (b), the court should adjust<br />for any term of imprisonment already served as a result of the conduct taken into<br />account in determining the sentence for the instant offense. Example: The<br />defendant has been convicted of a federal offense charging the sale of 30 grams<br /><br />of cocaine. Under &#167;1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct), the defendant is held accountable<br />for the sale of an additional 15 grams of cocaine that is part of the same course<br />of conduct for which the defendant has been convicted and sentenced in state<br />court (the defendant received a nine-month sentence of imprisonment, of which<br />he has served six months at the time of sentencing on the instant federal offense).<br />The guideline range applicable to the defendant is 10-16 months (Chapter Two<br />offense level of 14 for sale of 45 grams of cocaine; 2-level reduction for<br />acceptance of responsibility; final offense level of 12; Criminal History Category<br />I). The court determines that a sentence of 13 months provides the appropriate<br />total punishment. Because the defendant has already served six months on the<br />related state charge, a sentence of seven months, imposed to run concurrently<br />with the remainder of the defendant’s state sentence, achieves this result. For<br />clarity, the court should note on the Judgment in a Criminal Case Order that the<br />sentence imposed is not a departure from the guidelines because the defendant<br />has been credited for guideline purposes under &#167;5G1.3(b) with six months served<br />in state custody.<br />3. Where the defendant is subject to an undischarged term of imprisonment in<br />circumstances other than those set forth in subsections (a) or (b), subsection (c)<br />applies and the court shall impose a consecutive sentence to the extent necessary<br />to fashion a sentence resulting in a reasonable incremental punishment for the<br />multiple offenses. In some circumstances, such incremental punishment can be<br />achieved by the imposition of a sentence that is concurrent with the remainder<br />of the unexpired term of imprisonment. In such cases, a consecutive sentence is<br />not required. To the extent practicable, the court should consider a reasonable<br />incremental penalty to be a sentence for the instant offense that results in a<br />combined sentence of imprisonment that approximates the total punishment that<br />would have been imposed under &#167;5G1.2 (Sentencing on Multiple Counts of<br />Conviction) had all of the offenses been federal offenses for which sentences<br />were being imposed at the same time. It is recognized that this determination<br />frequently will require an approximation. Where the defendant is serving a term<br />of imprisonment for a state offense, the information available may permit only<br />a rough estimate of the total punishment that would have been imposed under the<br />guidelines. Where the offense resulting in the undischarged term of<br />imprisonment is a federal offense for which a guideline determination has<br />previously been made, the task will be somewhat more straightforward, although<br />even in such cases a precise determination may not be possible.<br />It is not intended that the above methodology be applied in a manner that unduly<br />complicates or prolongs the sentencing process. Additionally, this methodology<br />does not, itself, require the court to depart from the guideline range established<br />for the instant federal offense. Rather, this methodology is meant to assist the<br />court in determining the appropriate sentence (e.g., the appropriate point within<br />the applicable guideline range, whether to order the sentence to run concurrently<br />or consecutively to the undischarged term of imprisonment, or whether a<br />departure is warranted). Generally, the court may achieve an appropriate<br />sentence through its determination of an appropriate point within the applicable<br />guideline range for the instant federal offense, combined with its determination<br />Amendment 535 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003<br /><br />of whether that sentence will run concurrently or consecutively to the<br />undischarged term of imprisonment.<br />Illustrations of the Application of Subsection (c):<br />(A) The guideline range applicable to the instant federal offense is 24-30<br />months. The court determines that a total punishment of 36 months’<br />imprisonment would appropriately reflect the instant federal offense and<br />the offense resulting in the undischarged term of imprisonment. The<br />undischarged term of imprisonment is an indeterminate sentence of<br />imprisonment with a 60-month maximum. At the time of sentencing on<br />the instant federal offense, the defendant has served ten months on the<br />undischarged term of imprisonment. In this case, a sentence of 26<br />months’ imprisonment to be served concurrently with the remainder of<br />the undischarged term of imprisonment would (1) be within the guideline<br />range for the instant federal offense, and (2) achieve an appropriate total<br />punishment (36 months).<br />(B) The applicable guideline range for the instant federal offense is 24-30<br />months. The court determines that a total punishment of 36 months’<br />imprisonment would appropriately reflect the instant federal offense and<br />the offense resulting in the undischarged term of imprisonment. The<br />undischarged term of imprisonment is a six-month determinate sentence.<br />At the time of sentencing on the instant federal offense, the defendant has<br />served three months on the undischarged term of imprisonment. In this<br />case, a sentence of 30 months’ imprisonment to be served consecutively<br />to the undischarged term of imprisonment would (1) be within the<br />guideline range for the instant federal offense, and (2) achieve an<br />appropriate total punishment (36 months).<br />(C) The applicable guideline range for the instant federal offense is 24-30<br />months. The court determines that a total punishment of 60 months’<br />imprisonment would appropriately reflect the instant federal offense and<br />the offense resulting in the undischarged term of imprisonment. The<br />undischarged term of imprisonment is a 12-month determinate sentence.<br />In this case, a sentence of 30 months’ imprisonment to be served<br />consecutively to the undischarged term of imprisonment would be the<br />greatest sentence imposable without departure for the instant federal<br />offense.<br />(D) The applicable guideline range for the instant federal offense is 24-30<br />months. The court determines that a total punishment of 36 months’<br />imprisonment would appropriately reflect the instant federal offense and<br />the offense resulting in the undischarged term of imprisonment. The<br />undischarged term of imprisonment is an indeterminate sentence with a<br />60-month maximum. At the time of sentencing on the instant federal<br />offense, the defendant has served 22 months on the undischarged term of<br />imprisonment. In this case, a sentence of 24 months to be served<br /><br />concurrently with the remainder of the undischarged term of<br />imprisonment would be the lowest sentence imposable without departure<br />for the instant federal offense.<br />4. If the defendant was on federal or state probation, parole, or supervised release<br />at the time of the instant offense, and has had such probation, parole, or<br />supervised release revoked, the sentence for the instant offense should be<br />imposed to be served consecutively to the term imposed for the violation of<br />probation, parole, or supervised release in order to provide an incremental<br />penalty for the violation of probation, parole, or supervised release (in accord<br />with the policy expressed in &#167;&#167;7B1.3 and 7B1.4)",<br />and inserting in lieu thereof:<br />"2. Adjusted concurrent sentence - subsection (b) cases. When a sentence is<br />imposed pursuant to subsection (b), the court should adjust the sentence for any<br />period of imprisonment already served as a result of the conduct taken into<br />account in determining the guideline range for the instant offense if the court<br />determines that period of imprisonment will not be credited to the federal<br />sentence by the Bureau of Prisons. Example: The defendant is convicted of a<br />federal offense charging the sale of 30 grams of cocaine. Under &#167;1B1.3<br />(Relevant Conduct), the defendant is held accountable for the sale of an<br />additional 15 grams of cocaine, an offense for which the defendant has been<br />convicted and sentenced in state court. The defendant received a nine-month<br />sentence of imprisonment for the state offense and has served six months on that<br />sentence at the time of sentencing on the instant federal offense. The guideline<br />range applicable to the defendant is 10-16 months (Chapter Two offense level of<br />14 for sale of 45 grams of cocaine; 2-level reduction for acceptance of<br />responsibility; final offense level of 12; Criminal History Category I). The court<br />determines that a sentence of 13 months provides the appropriate total<br />punishment. Because the defendant has already served six months on the related<br />state charge as of the date of sentencing on the instant federal offense, a sentence<br />of seven months, imposed to run concurrently with the three months remaining<br />on the defendant’s state sentence, achieves this result. For clarity, the court<br />should note on the Judgment in a Criminal Case Order that the sentence imposed<br />is not a departure from the guideline range because the defendant has been<br />credited for guideline purposes under &#167;5G1.3(b) with six months served in state<br />custody that will not be credited to the federal sentence under 18 U.S.C. &#167;<br />3585(b).<br />3. Concurrent or consecutive sentence - subsection (c) cases. In circumstances not<br />covered under subsection (a) or (b), subsection (c) applies. Under this<br />subsection, the court may impose a sentence concurrently, partially concurrently,<br />or consecutively. To achieve a reasonable punishment and avoid unwarranted<br />disparity, the court should consider the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3584<br />(referencing 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(a)) and be cognizant of:<br />(a) the type (e.g., determinate, indeterminate/parolable) and length of the<br />Amendment 535 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003<br /><br />prior undischarged sentence;<br />(b) the time served on the undischarged sentence and the time likely to be<br />served before release;<br />(c) the fact that the prior undischarged sentence may have been imposed in<br />state court rather than federal court, or at a different time before the same<br />or different federal court; and<br />(d) any other circumstance relevant to the determination of an appropriate<br />sentence for the instant offense.<br />4. Partially concurrent sentence. In some cases under subsection (c), a partially<br />concurrent sentence may achieve most appropriately the desired result. To<br />impose a partially concurrent sentence, the court may provide in the Judgment<br />in a Criminal Case Order that the sentence for the instant offense shall commence<br />(A) when the defendant is released from the prior undischarged sentence, or (B)<br />on a specified date, whichever is earlier. This order provides for a fully<br />consecutive sentence if the defendant is released on the undischarged term of<br />imprisonment on or before the date specified in the order, and a partially<br />concurrent sentence if the defendant is not released on the undischarged term of<br />imprisonment by that date.<br />5. Complex situations. Occasionally, the court may be faced with a complex case<br />in which a defendant may be subject to multiple undischarged terms of<br />imprisonment that seemingly call for the application of different rules. In such<br />a case, the court may exercise its discretion in accordance with subsection (c) to<br />fashion a sentence of appropriate length and structure it to run in any appropriate<br />manner to achieve a reasonable punishment for the instant offense.<br />6. Revocations. If the defendant was on federal or state probation, parole, or<br />supervised release at the time of the instant offense, and has had such probation,<br />parole, or supervised release revoked, the sentence for the instant offense should<br />be imposed to run consecutively to the term imposed for the violation of<br />probation, parole, or supervised release in order to provide an incremental<br />penalty for the violation of probation, parole, or supervised release. See &#167;7B1.3<br />(Revocation of Probation or Supervised Release) (setting forth a policy that any<br />imprisonment penalty imposed for violating probation or supervised release<br />should be consecutive to any sentence of imprisonment being served or<br />subsequently imposed).".<br />The Commentary to &#167;5G1.3 captioned "Background" is amended by deleting:<br />"This guideline provides direction to the court when a term of imprisonment is imposed<br />on a defendant who is already subject to an undischarged term of imprisonment. See 18<br />U.S.C. &#167; 3584. Except in the cases in which subsection (a) applies, this guideline is<br />intended to result in an appropriate incremental punishment for the instant offense that<br />most nearly approximates the sentence that would have been imposed had all the<br /><br />sentences been imposed at the same time.",<br />and inserting in lieu thereof:<br />"In a case in which a defendant is subject to an undischarged sentence of imprisonment,<br />the court generally has authority to impose an imprisonment sentence on the current<br />offense to run concurrently with or consecutively to the prior undischarged term.<br />18 U.S.C. &#167; 3584(a). Exercise of that authority, however, is predicated on the court’s<br />consideration of the factors listed in 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(a), including any applicable<br />guidelines or policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.".</td><td>Reason for Amendment: This is a two-part amendment. First, this amendment clarifies the<br />application of subsections (a) and (b) of this guideline. Second, in circumstances covered by<br />the policy statement in subsection (c), this amendment affords the sentencing court additional<br />flexibility to impose, as appropriate, a consecutive, concurrent, or partially concurrent sentence<br />in order to achieve a reasonable punishment for the instant offense.<br />Authority to impose a partially concurrent sentence is found in the Sentencing Reform Act of<br />1984 (SRA). In enacting 28 U.S.C. &#167; 994(l)(1), Congress contemplated that 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3584<br />would allow imposition of partially concurrent sentences, in addition to fully concurrent or<br />consecutive sentences. ("It is the Committee’s intent that, to the extent feasible, the sentences<br />for each of the multiple offenses be determined separately and the degree to which they should<br />overlap be specified.") S. Rep. No. 225, 98th Cong., 1st Sess. 177 (1983). Without the ability<br />to fashion such a sentence, the instruction to the Commission in 28 U.S.C. &#167; 994(l)(1) to<br />provide a reasonable incremental penalty for additional offenses could not be implemented<br />successfully in certain situations, particularly when the defendant’s release date on an<br />undischarged term of imprisonment cannot be determined readily in advance (e.g., in the case<br />of an indeterminate sentence subject to parole release).<br />Prior to the SRA, only the Bureau of Prisons had the authority to commence a federal sentence<br />prior to the defendant’s release from imprisonment on a state sentence. See, e.g., United States<br />v. Segal, 549 F.2d 1293, 1301 (9th Cir. 1977). SRA legislative history pertaining to 18 U.S.C.<br />&#167; 3584 indicates that this new section was intended to authorize imposition of a federal prison<br />sentence to run concurrently or consecutively to a state prison sentence.

First, the amendment implements<br />the congressional directives in section 2 of the Sex Crimes Against Children Prevention Act<br />of 1995, Pub. L. 104-71, 109 Stat. 774, by providing a two-level enhancement above the<br />currently prescribed offense level for offenses involving the sexual exploitation of minors. The<br />two-level enhancement is provided in the base offense levels under &#167;&#167;2G2.1, 2G2.2, and<br />2G2.4.<br />Second, the amendment implements the congressional directive in section 3 of the above-noted<br />Act by providing a two-level enhancement for offenses involving the sexual exploitation of a<br />minor if a computer was used to transmit certain notices or advertisements of material<br />involving minors engaged in sexually explicit conduct or to transport or ship that material. The<br />enhancement in &#167;2G2.2(b)(5) applies to the transmission of the material or of the notice or<br />advertisement of the material. The enhancement in &#167;2G2.4(b)(3) applies only if the<br />defendant’s possession of the material resulted from the defendant’s use of a computer. In<br />addition to these congressionally directed enhancements, the amendment adds a two-level<br />enhancement under &#167;2G2.1(b)(3) if a computer was used to solicit participation in sexually<br />explicit conduct by or with a minor for the purpose of producing sexually explicit material.<br />Third, the amendment revises the Commentary to &#167;2G2.2 to consolidate the definitions<br />applicable to this guideline in the first application note and address several additional issues.<br />The amendment revises the definition of "pattern of activity involving the sexual abuse or<br />exploitation of a minor" to clarify that "sexual abuse or exploitation," for purposes of<br />&#167;2G2.2(b)(4), requires that the defendant personally had participated in such conduct. The<br />amendment defines "sexual abuse or exploitation" to mean conduct constituting criminal sexual<br />abuse, sexual exploitation, or abusive sexual contact and to exclude trafficking in child<br />pornography. These revisions are consistent with United States v. Chapman, 60 F.3d 894 (1st<br />Cir. 1995) and United States v. Ketcham, 80 F.3d 789 (3d Cir. 1996), both of which held that<br />the defendant’s transportation or distribution of child pornography is not sexual exploitation<br />within the meaning of the "pattern of activity" enhancement in &#167;2G2.2(b)(4). In addition, the<br />amendment clarifies that the "pattern of activity" may include acts of sexual abuse or<br />exploitation that were not committed during the course of the offense or that did not result in<br /><br />a conviction. This revision responds in part to the holding in Chapman, 60 F.3d at 901, that<br />the "pattern of activity" enhancement is inapplicable to past sexual abuse or exploitation<br />unrelated to the offense of conviction. The amended language expressly provides that such<br />conduct may be considered. Accordingly, the conduct considered for purposes of the "pattern<br />of activity" enhancement is broader than the scope of relevant conduct typically considered<br />under &#167;1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct). In addition, the amendment provides that an upward<br />departure may be warranted if the defendant (1) did not engage in a "pattern of activity" but<br />nevertheless abused a minor at any time, or (2) engaged in a "pattern of activity" but the<br />enhancement does not adequately reflect the seriousness of the sexual abuse or exploitation.<br />In addition, the amendment clarifies that prior convictions counted as part of the "pattern of<br />activity" also may be counted as part of the defendant’s criminal history under Chapter Four,<br />if those convictions meet the criteria set forth in the relevant guidelines of that chapter.<br />Fourth, the amendment makes the "Statutory Provisions" in the Commentary to &#167;&#167;2G2.1 and<br />2G2.2 more comprehensive by adding 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2258(a) and (b) to the list of statutory<br />provisions covered by those guidelines.</td><td>Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1996.</td></tr><tr><td class="n">535</td><td>Amendment 535</td><td>Sections 2G1.1 and 2G1.2 are deleted in their entirety as follows:<br />"&#167;2G1.1. Transportation for the Purpose of Prostitution or Prohibited Sexual Conduct<br />(a) Base Offense Level: 14<br />(b) Specific Offense Characteristic<br />(1) If the offense involved the use of physical force, or coercion by<br />threats or drugs or in any manner, increase by 4 levels.<br />(c) Special Instruction<br />(1) If the offense involved the transportation of more than one<br />person, Chapter Three, Part D (Multiple Counts) shall be applied<br />as if the transportation of each person had been contained in a<br />separate count of conviction.<br />Commentary<br />Statutory Provisions: 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1328; 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2421, 2422.<br />Application Notes:<br />1.

The enhancement for physical force, or coercion, anticipates no bodily injury. If bodily<br />injury results, an upward departure may be warranted.

This factor would apply, for<br />example, where the ability of the person being transported to appraise or control conduct<br />was substantially impaired by drugs or alcohol. In the case of transportation involving<br />an adult, rather than a minor, this characteristic generally will not apply where the<br />alcohol or drug was voluntarily taken.<br />4.

Subsection (b)(4) is intended to have broad application and includes offenses involving<br />a minor entrusted to the defendant, whether temporarily or permanently. For example,<br />teachers, day care providers, baby-sitters, or other temporary caretakers are among those<br />who would be subject to this enhancement. In determining whether to apply this<br />adjustment, the court should look to the actual relationship that existed between the<br />defendant and the child and not simply to the legal status of the defendant-child<br />relationship.<br />6. If the adjustment in subsection (b)(4) applies, do not apply &#167;3B1.3 (Abuse of Position<br />of Trust or Use of Special Skill).<br />7. The cross reference in subsection (c)(1) is to be construed broadly to include all<br />instances where the offense involved employing, using, persuading, inducing, enticing,<br />coercing, transporting, permitting, or offering or seeking by notice or advertisement, a<br />minor to engage in sexually explicit conduct for the purpose of producing any visual<br />depiction of such conduct.".<br />A replacement guideline with accompanying commentary is inserted as &#167;2G1.1 (Promoting<br />Prostitution or Prohibited Sexual Conduct).<br />Chapter 1, Part A, Subpart 4(b) is amended in the fourth paragraph by deleting:<br />"For example, the Commentary to &#167;2G1.1 (Transportation for the Purpose of Prostitution or<br />Prohibited Sexual Conduct) recommends a downward departure of eight levels where a<br />commercial purpose was not involved.".<br />Section 3D1.2(d) is amended in the third paragraph by deleting "2G1.2,".</td><td>Reason for Amendment: This is a three-part amendment. First, this amendment consolidates<br />&#167;&#167;2G1.1 (Transportation for the Purpose of Prostitution or Prohibited Sexual Conduct) and<br />2G1.2 (Transportation of a Minor for the Purpose of Prostitution or Prohibited Sexual Conduct)<br />in furtherance of the Commission’s goal of simplifying the operation of the guidelines. The<br />enhancement pertaining to the age of the victim in subsection (b)(2) is increased by two levels<br />to reflect the two-level higher base offense level of former &#167;2G1.2. The consolidated offense<br />guideline incorporates the cross references of &#167;2G1.2, provides a definition of the term<br />"victim," and clarifies that the guideline covers offenses under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2423(a), but not 18<br />U.S.C. &#167; 2423(b) (a statutory provision referenced in Appendix A to &#167;&#167;2A3.1, 2A3.2, and<br />2A3.3).<br />Second, this amendment implements the congressional directive in section 4 of the Sex Crimes<br />Against Children Prevention Act of 1995, Pub. L. 104-71, 109 Stat. 774, by providing a three-<br />level increase in the enhancement for offenses involving the transportation of minors with<br />intent to engage in prostitution or other prohibited sexual conduct. This three-level increase<br />is provided in the specific offense characteristic pertaining to the age of the victim in subsection<br />(b)(2) and is in addition to the two-level increase in this enhancement described in the first part<br /><br />of this amendment.<br />Third, this amendment addresses 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2422(b), a new offense created by section 508<br />of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, Pub. L. 104-104, 110 Stat. 56. That offense makes<br />it unlawful, in interstate or foreign commerce, including through the mail, or within the special<br />maritime or territorial jurisdiction of the United States, to knowingly persuade, induce, entice,<br />or coerce an individual under the age of 18 years to engage in prostitution or other prohibited<br />sexual conduct. The amendment brings this new offense within the scope of the consolidated<br />guideline. As revised, the guideline is broadly applicable to offenses that involve "promoting<br />prostitution or prohibited sexual conduct."

With respect to &#167;&#167;2C1.1, 2C1.7, 2E1.1, and 2E1.2, the amendment, and<br />an express provision in each of these guidelines, provide a different procedure because these<br />guidelines are the only four offense guidelines in which the inclusion of Chapter Three<br />adjustments in the comparison is likely to make a difference.</td><td>Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1997.</td></tr><tr><td class="n">545</td><td>Amendment 545</td><td>Section 1B1.10 is amended in the title by deleting "Retroactivity" and inserting<br />in lieu thereof "Reduction in Term of Imprisonment as a Result".<br />Section 1B1.10(b) is amended by deleting "sentence" in both instances and inserting in lieu<br />thereof "the term of imprisonment"; and by inserting ", except that in no event may the reduced<br />term of imprisonment be less than the term of imprisonment the defendant has already served"<br />after "sentenced".<br />The Commentary to &#167;1B1.10 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by inserting after Note<br />2 the following additional notes:<br />"3. Under subsection (b), the amended guideline range and the term of imprisonment<br />already served by the defendant limit the extent to which an eligible defendant’s<br />sentence may be reduced under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3582(c)(2). When the original<br />sentence represented a downward departure, a comparable reduction below the<br />amended guideline range may be appropriate; however, in no case shall the term<br />of imprisonment be reduced below time served. Subject to these limitations, the<br />sentencing court has the discretion to determine whether, and to what extent, to<br />reduce a term of imprisonment under this section.<br />4. Only a term of imprisonment imposed as part of the original sentence is<br />authorized to be reduced under this section. This section does not authorize a<br />reduction in the term of imprisonment imposed upon revocation of supervised<br />release.<br />5. If the limitation in subsection (b) relating to time already served precludes a<br />reduction in the term of imprisonment to the extent the court determines<br />otherwise would have been appropriate as a result of the amended guideline<br />range, the court may consider any such reduction that it was unable to grant in<br />connection with any motion for early termination of a term of supervised release<br />under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3583(e)(1). However, the fact that a defendant may have<br />served a longer term of imprisonment than the court determines would have been<br />appropriate in view of the amended guideline range shall not, without more,<br />provide a basis for early termination of supervised release. Rather, the court<br />should take into account the totality of circumstances relevant to a decision to<br />terminate supervised release, including the term of supervised release that would<br />have been appropriate in connection with a sentence under the amended<br />guideline range.".<br />Amendment 549 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003<br /><br />The Commentary to &#167;1B1.10 captioned "Background" is amended in the third paragraph by<br />inserting "to determine an amended guideline range under subsection (b)" after "retroactively";<br />and by inserting before the fourth paragraph the following additional paragraph:<br />"The listing of an amendment in subsection (c) reflects policy determinations by the<br />Commission that a reduced guideline range is sufficient to achieve the purposes of<br />sentencing and that, in the sound discretion of the court, a reduction in the term of<br />imprisonment may be appropriate for previously sentenced, qualified defendants. The<br />authorization of such a discretionary reduction does not otherwise affect the lawfulness<br />of a previously imposed sentence, does not authorize a reduction in any other component<br />of the sentence, and does not entitle a defendant to a reduced term of imprisonment as<br />a matter of right.".</td><td>Reason for Amendment: This amendment makes a number of substantive and clarifying<br />changes in the policy statement relating to retroactive application of an amendment that reduces<br />a guideline range. The amendment provides that, in exercising discretion to reduce the term<br />of imprisonment of an incarcerated defendant, a court may not reduce the term of imprisonment<br />below time served (or, put differently, grant a greater reduction in imprisonment than the<br />imprisonment time remaining to be served). In those cases in which the combination of time<br />already served and this limitation preclude a defendant from receiving the full reduction the<br />court would be inclined to grant as a result of an amended guideline range, the amended<br />commentary instructs that the court may weigh the equities of such a situation in connection<br />with a separate motion for early termination of supervised release under 18 U.S.C. &#167;<br />3583(e)(1). The amendment also makes clear that, contrary to the holding in United States v.<br />Etherton, 101 F.3d 80 (9th Cir. 1996), a reduction in the term of imprisonment imposed upon<br />revocation of supervised release is not authorized by the policy statement. Finally, the<br />amendment makes a number of changes in the title and text of the policy statement to improve<br />the precision of the language, adds commentary emphasizing court discretion in applying<br />amendments that the Commission has listed for possible retroactive application, and adds<br />background commentary more fully describing the legal consequences flowing from a<br />Commission decision to list an amendment for possible retroactive application.</td><td>Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1997.</td></tr><tr><td class="n">546</td><td>Amendment 546</td><td>Section 2A2.2(b) is amended by inserting after subdivision (4) the following<br />additional subdivision:<br />"(5) If the offense involved the violation of a court protection order, increase by 2<br />levels.".<br />Chapter Two, Part A, Subpart 6 is amended in the title by inserting "or Harassing" after<br />"Threatening"; and by inserting ", Stalking, and Domestic Violence" after "Communications".<br />Section 2A6.1 is amended in the title by inserting "or Harassing" after "Threatening".<br />Section 2A6.1 is amended by deleting subsection (a) as follows:<br />"(a) Base Offense Level: 12",<br /><br />and inserting in lieu thereof:<br />"(a) Base Offense Level:<br />(1) 12; or<br />(2) 6, if the defendant is convicted of an offense under 47 U.S.C.<br />&#167; 223(a)(1)(C), (D), or (E) that did not involve a threat to injure<br />a person or property.".<br />Section 2A6.1(b) is amended by redesignating subdivision (2) as subdivision (4); and by<br />inserting after subdivision (1) the following new subdivisions:<br />"(2) If the offense involved more than two threats, increase by 2 levels.<br />(3) If the offense involved the violation of a court protection order,<br />increase by 2 levels.".<br />Section 2A6.1(b)(4), as redesignated, is amended by deleting "If specific offense<br />characteristic &#167;2A6.1(b)(1) does not apply, and" and inserting in lieu thereof "If (A)<br />subsection (a)(2) and subdivisions (1), (2), and (3) do not apply, and (B)".<br />The Commentary to &#167;2A6.1 captioned "Statutory Provisions" is amended by inserting<br />"; 47 U.S.C. &#167; 223(a)(1)(C)-(E)" after "879".<br />The Commentary to &#167;2A6.1 captioned "Application Note" is amended by deleting "Note"<br />and inserting in lieu thereof "Notes"; and by inserting after Note 1 the following<br />additional note:<br />"2.

For example, if the<br />defendant engaged in several acts of mailing threatening letters to the same<br />victim over a period of years (including acts that occurred prior to the<br />offense), then for purposes of determining whether subsections (b)(1),<br />(b)(2), and (b)(3) apply, the court shall consider only those prior acts of<br />threatening the victim that have a substantial and direct connection to the<br />offense.<br />For purposes of Chapter Three, Part D (Multiple Counts), multiple counts<br />involving making a threatening or harassing communication to the same<br />victim are grouped together under &#167;3D1.2 (Groups of Closely Related<br />Counts).

Stalking or Domestic Violence<br />(a) Base Offense Level: 14<br />(b) Specific Offense Characteristic<br />(1) If the offense involved one of the following<br />aggravating factors: (A) the violation of a court<br />protection order; (B) bodily injury; (C)<br />possession, or threatened use, of a dangerous<br />weapon; or (D) a pattern of activity involving<br />stalking, threatening, harassing, or assaulting the<br />same victim, increase by 2 levels. If the offense<br />involved more than one of these aggravating<br />factors, increase by 4 levels.<br />(c) Cross Reference<br />(1) If the offense involved conduct covered by<br />another offense guideline from Chapter Two, Part<br />A (Offenses Against the Person), apply that<br />offense guideline, if the resulting offense level is<br />greater than that determined above.<br />Commentary<br />Statutory Provisions: 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2261-2262.<br />Application Notes:<br />1. For purposes of this guideline—<br />‘Bodily injury’ and ‘dangerous weapon’ are defined in the Commentary to<br />&#167;1B1.1 (Application Instructions).<br />‘Pattern of activity involving stalking, threatening, harassing, or assaulting the<br />same victim’ means any combination of two or more separate instances of<br />stalking, threatening, harassing, or assaulting the same victim, whether or not<br />such conduct resulted in a conviction. For example, a single instance of stalking<br />accompanied by a separate instance of threatening, harassing, or assaulting the<br />same victim constitutes a pattern of activity for purposes of this guideline.<br /><br />‘Stalking’ means traveling with the intent to injure or harass another person and,<br />in the course of, or as a result of, such travel, placing the person in reasonable<br />fear of death or serious bodily injury to the person or the person’s immediate<br />family. See 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2261A. ‘Immediate family’ has the meaning set forth<br />in 18 U.S.C. &#167; 115(c)(2).<br />2. Subsection (b)(1) provides for a two-level or four-level enhancement based on<br />the degree to which the offense involved aggravating factors listed in that<br />subsection. If the offense involved aggravating factors more serious than the<br />factors listed in subsection (b)(1), the cross reference in subsection (c) most<br />likely will apply, if the resulting offense level is greater, because the more<br />serious conduct will be covered by another offense guideline from Chapter Two,<br />Part A. For example, &#167;2A2.2 (Aggravated Assault) most likely would apply<br />pursuant to subsection (c) if the offense involved assaultive conduct in which<br />injury more serious than bodily injury occurred or if a dangerous weapon was<br />used rather than merely possessed.<br />3. In determining whether subsection (b)(1)(D) applies, the court shall consider,<br />under the totality of the circumstances, any conduct that occurred prior to or<br />during the offense; however, conduct that occurred prior to the offense must be<br />substantially and directly connected to the offense. For example, if a defendant<br />engaged in several acts of stalking the same victim over a period of years<br />(including acts that occurred prior to the offense), then for purposes of<br />determining whether subsection (b)(1)(D) applies, the court shall look to the<br />totality of the circumstances, considering only those prior acts of stalking the<br />victim that have a substantial and direct connection to the offense.<br />Prior convictions taken into account under subsection (b)(1)(D) are also counted<br />for purposes of determining criminal history points pursuant to Chapter Four,<br />Part A (Criminal History).<br />4. For purposes of Chapter Three, Part D (Multiple Counts), multiple counts<br />involving stalking, threatening, or harassing the same victim are grouped<br />together (and with counts of other offenses involving the same victim that are<br />covered by this guideline) under &#167;3D1.2 (Groups of Closely Related Counts).<br />For example, if the defendant is convicted of two counts of stalking the<br />defendant’s ex-spouse under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2261A and one count of interstate<br />domestic violence involving an assault of the ex-spouse under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2261,<br />the stalking counts would be grouped together with the interstate domestic<br />violence count. This grouping procedure avoids unwarranted ‘double counting’<br />with the enhancement in subsection (b)(1)(D) (for multiple acts of stalking,<br />threatening, harassing, or assaulting the same victim) and recognizes that the<br />stalking and interstate domestic violence counts are sufficiently related to warrant<br />grouping.<br />Multiple counts that are cross referenced to another offense guideline pursuant<br />to subsection (c) are to be grouped together if &#167;3D1.2 would require grouping<br />of those counts under that offense guideline. Similarly, multiple counts cross<br />Amendment 549 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003<br /><br />referenced pursuant to subsection (c) are not to be grouped together if &#167;3D1.2<br />would preclude grouping of the counts under that offense guideline. For<br />example, if the defendant is convicted of multiple counts of threatening an ex-<br />spouse in violation of a court protection order under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2262 and the<br />counts are cross referenced to &#167;2A6.1 (Threatening or Harassing<br />Communications), the counts would group together because Application Note 2<br />of &#167;2A6.1 specifically requires grouping. In contrast, if the defendant is<br />convicted of multiple counts of assaulting the ex-spouse in violation of a court<br />protection order under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2262 and the counts are cross referenced to<br />&#167;2A2.2 (Aggravated Assault), the counts probably would not group together<br />inasmuch as &#167;3D1.2(d) specifically precludes grouping of counts covered by<br />&#167;2A2.2 and no other provision of &#167;3D1.2 would likely apply to require grouping.<br />Multiple counts involving different victims are not to be grouped under &#167;3D1.2.<br />5. If the defendant received an enhancement under subsection (b)(1) but that<br />enhancement does not adequately reflect the extent or seriousness of the conduct<br />involved, an upward departure may be warranted. For example, an upward<br />departure may be warranted if the defendant stalked the victim on many<br />occasions over a prolonged period of time.".</td><td>Reason for Amendment: This is a five-part amendment. First, this amendment addresses the<br />new offense of interstate stalking, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2261A, which was enacted as section 1069 of<br />the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1997, Pub. L. 104–201, 110 Stat. 2422.<br />That offense makes it unlawful to travel across a state line or within federal jurisdiction with<br />the intent to injure or harass another person and, in the course of, or as a result of, such travel,<br />to place that person in reasonable fear of death or serious bodily injury to that person or that<br />person’s immediate family.<br />The amendment adds a new guideline, &#167;2A6.2 (Stalking or Domestic Violence), to cover the<br />stalking offense. The new guideline provides for a base offense level of 14 and an<br />enhancement for the presence of one or more aggravating factors that are often part of a<br />stalking offense, including the violation of a court protection order and the presence of a pattern<br />of stalking, harassing, threatening, or assaultive conduct. The new guideline also provides for<br />a cross reference to other Chapter Two guidelines if the offense involved more serious conduct,<br />such as aggravated assault or kidnapping, that would produce a greater offense level. In<br />addition, the new guideline permits the consideration of prior stalking, harassing, threatening,<br />or assaultive conduct if that conduct is directly and substantially related to the offense.<br />The new guideline also incorporates the definitions of “bodily injury” and “dangerous weapon”<br />found in &#167;1B1.1 (Application Instructions). The definition of bodily injury found in the<br />guidelines differs from the definition of bodily injury in 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2266 that is applicable to<br />interstate stalking and interstate domestic violence offenses. The definition of “bodily injury”<br />in 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2266 explicitly includes sexual abuse, but the guideline definition of “bodily<br />injury” does not. However, the Commission is fully aware that criminal sexual abuse often is<br />part of a domestic violence offense under 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2261 and 2262 and may be part of a<br />stalking offense under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2261A. It is the view of the Commission that the new<br />guideline provides an adequate mechanism for taking into account the occurrence of criminal<br /><br />sexual abuse in any of these offenses. This is because the guideline definition of “serious<br />bodily injury” in &#167;1B1.1 deems serious bodily injury -- a more serious gradient of bodily injury<br />-- to have occurred if the offense involved conduct constituting criminal sexual abuse under 18<br />U.S.C. &#167; 2241 or &#167; 2242 or any similar offense under state law. Under the new guideline, any<br />offense that involved criminal sexual abuse almost certainly will be subject to the cross<br />reference to another offense guideline and to the rule deeming such conduct to be serious<br />bodily injury (for purposes of applying a serious bodily injury enhancement in that other<br />guideline to the offense). Therefore, in all likelihood, the sentence will be enhanced for the<br />occurrence of criminal sexual abuse because the case will be cross referenced to another<br />guideline that enhances for serious bodily injury.<br />Second, the amendment changes the manner in which the offenses of interstate domestic<br />violence, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2261, and interstate violation of a protection order, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2262, are<br />treated under the guidelines. Instead of being referenced to the guidelines that may cover<br />underlying conduct, the amendment brings those offenses under the ambit of the new guideline,<br />&#167;2A6.2. This change recognizes that the aggravating factors accounted for in the new guideline<br />often are present in these offenses as well.<br />Third, the amendment adds an enhancement to &#167;2A2.2 (Aggravated Assault), if the offense<br />involved the violation of a court protection order, to ensure an appropriately severe offense<br />level for stalking, domestic violence, and other cases that are sentenced under the aggravated<br />assault guideline and involve this factor.<br />Fourth, the amendment addresses several new harassing telecommunications offenses,<br />47 U.S.C. &#167; 223(a)(1)(C)-(E), which were enacted in section 502 of the Telecommunications<br />Act of 1996, Pub. L. 104–104, 110 Stat. 56. Those offenses make it unlawful to make a<br />telephone call or utilize a telecommunications device, whether or not conversation or<br />communication ensues, without disclosing one’s identity and with the intent to annoy, abuse,<br />threaten, or harass any person at the called number or who receives the communication; make<br />or cause the telephone of another to repeatedly or continuously ring, with the intent to harass<br />any person at the called number; or make repeated telephone calls or repeatedly initiate<br />conversation with a telecommunications device, during which conversation or communication<br />ensues, solely to harass any person at the called number or who receives the communication.<br />The amendment incorporates these new offenses into &#167;2A6.1 (Threatening Communications).<br />Recognizing that these offenses carry only a two-year maximum term of imprisonment, the<br />amendment provides an alternative offense level of 6 (as compared to 12), if the defendant is<br />convicted of any of these offenses and there was no threat to injure a person or property. The<br />amendment also adds enhancements if the offense involved more than two threats or the<br />violation of a court protection order.<br />Fifth, this amendment addresses a circuit conflict regarding the enhancement in &#167;2A6.1 that<br />provides a 6-level increase if the offense involved any conduct evidencing an intent to carry<br />out a threat. Specifically, the conflict is whether or not conduct which occurred prior to the<br />making of the threat can evidence an intent to carry out the threat. Compare United States v.<br />Hornick, 942 F.2d 105 (2d Cir. 1991) (“a person cannot take action that will constitute proof<br />of his intent to carry out a threat until after the threat has been made”) cert. denied, 502 U.S.<br />1061 (1992) with United States v. Taylor, 88 F.3d 938 (11th Cir. 1996) (“the essential inquiry<br />for &#167;2A6.1(b)(1) is whether the facts of the case, taken as a whole, establish a sufficiently direct<br />Amendment 551 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003<br /><br />connection between the defendant’s pre-threat conduct and his threat”); United States v.<br />Sullivan, 75 F.3d 297 (7th Cir. 1996)(same); United States v. Gary, 18 F.3d 1123 (4th Cir.)<br />(same), cert. denied 513 U.S. 844 (1994); United States v. Hines, 26 F.3d 1469 (9th Cir.<br />1994)(same).<br />The amendment essentially adopts the Eleventh Circuit’s view by adding an application note<br />to both &#167;&#167;2A6.1 and 2A6.2 to provide that conduct which occurred prior to the offense shall<br />be considered in determining specified enhancements in those guidelines if the prior conduct<br />is substantially and directly connected to the offense.</td><td>Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1997.</td></tr><tr><td class="n">547</td><td>Amendment 547</td><td>The Commentary to &#167;2A2.4 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note<br />1 by inserting the following after "(Aggravated Assault).":<br />"Conversely, the base offense level does not reflect the possibility that the defendant<br />may create a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury to another person in the<br />course of fleeing from a law enforcement official (although an offense under 18 U.S.C.<br />&#167; 758 for fleeing or evading a law enforcement checkpoint at high speed will often, but<br />not always, involve the creation of that risk).

The amendment adopts the majority appellate view, which holds that a<br />sentencing court should consider the defendant’s relevant conduct when determining whether<br />the vulnerable victim enhancement applies. See, e.g., United States v. Haggard, 41 F.3d 1320,<br />1326 (9th Cir. 1994) (proper to consider harm caused to victims beyond the defendant’s offense<br />of conviction); United States v.

The<br />amendment changes the last sentence of Application Note 1 so that it no longer suggests the<br />use of a heightened standard of proof.

The Commission defined "maximum term authorized" to<br />mean the maximum term authorized for the offense of conviction not including any sentencing<br />enhancement provisions that apply because of the defendant’s prior criminal record. The<br />Supreme Court held that under &#167; 994’s plain and unambiguous language, "maximum term<br />authorized" must be read to include all applicable statutory sentencing enhancements. The<br />proposed amendment makes a straightforward change to the commentary to &#167;4B1.1, the career<br />offender guideline, to reflect the LaBonte decision. Specifically, the definition of "maximum<br />term authorized" is proposed to be changed to reflect that the "maximum term authorized"<br />includes all sentencing enhancements that apply because of the defendant’s prior criminal<br />record.</td><td>Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1997.</td></tr><tr><td class="n">565</td><td>Amendment 565</td><td>Section &#167;4B1.2(1) is amended by deleting "(1)" and inserting in lieu thereof<br />"(a)"; by inserting a comma after "law" and after "one year"; by deleting "(i)" and inserting in<br />lieu thereof "(1)"; and by deleting "(ii)" and inserting in lieu thereof "(2)".<br />Section &#167;4B1.2(2) is amended by deleting "(2)" and inserting in lieu thereof "(b)"; by deleting<br />"a" after "under"; and by deleting "prohibiting" and inserting in lieu thereof ", punishable by<br />imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, that prohibits".<br />Section &#167;4B1.2(3) is amended by deleting "(3)" and inserting in lieu thereof "(c)"; by deleting<br />"(A)" and inserting in lieu thereof "(1)"; and by deleting "(B)" and inserting in lieu thereof<br />"(2)".<br />The Commentary to &#167;4B1.2 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 1 by inserting<br />at the beginning "For purposes of this guideline—"; by deleting "The terms ‘crime" and<br />inserting in lieu thereof "‘Crime";<br />and by inserting at the end the following new paragraphs:<br />"‘Crime of violence’ includes murder, manslaughter, kidnapping, aggravated assault,<br />forcible sex offenses, robbery, arson, extortion, extortionate extension of credit, and<br />burglary of a dwelling.

This<br />amendment makes each of these offenses a "controlled substance offense" under the career<br />offender guideline. This decision is based on the Commission’s view that there is such a close<br />connection between possession of a listed chemical or prohibited flask or equipment with intent<br />to manufacture a controlled substance and actually manufacturing a controlled substance that<br />the former offenses are fairly considered as controlled substance trafficking offenses.<br />The amendment also clarifies that certain other offenses are "crimes of violence" or "controlled<br />substance offenses" if the offense of conviction established that the underlying offense was a<br />"crime of violence" or "controlled substance offense."

This<br />issue has arisen in a number of hotline calls.

To the extent<br />that any of the above-noted statutory provisions conflict with the<br />provisions of this guideline, the applicable statutory provision shall<br />control.<br />Background: Section 3553(a)(7) of Title 18 requires the court, ‘in determining<br />the particular sentence to be imposed,’ to consider ‘the need to provide restitution<br />to any victims of the offense.’ Section 3556 of Title 18 authorizes the court to<br />impose restitution in accordance with 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 3663 and 3664, which<br />authorize restitution for violations of Title 18 or 49 U.S.C. &#167; 46312, &#167; 46502, or<br />&#167; 46504. For other offenses, restitution may be imposed as a condition of<br />probation or supervised release. See 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3563(b)(3) as amended by<br />Section 7110 of Pub. L. No. 100-690 (1988).<br />A court’s authority to decline to order restitution is limited. Subsection<br />(a)(1) of this guideline requires the court to order restitution for offenses under<br />Title 18, United States Code, or 49 U.S.C. &#167; 46312, &#167; 46502, or &#167; 46504, unless<br />full restitution has already been made or ‘the court determines that the<br />complication and prolongation of the sentencing process resulting from the<br />fashioning of an order of restitution . . . outweighs the need to provide restitution<br />to any victims.’ 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3663(d). The legislative history of 18 U.S.C. &#167;<br />3579, the precursor of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3663, states that even ‘[i]n those unusual<br />Amendment 571 APPENDIX C - VOLUME I November 1, 2003<br /><br />cases where the precise amount owed is difficult to determine, the section<br />authorizes the court to reach an expeditious, reasonable determination of<br />appropriate restitution by resolving uncertainties with a view toward achieving<br />fairness to the victim.’ S. Rep. No. 532, 97th Cong., 2d Sess. 31, reprinted in<br />1982 U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Ad. News 2515, 2537. If the court does not order<br />restitution, or orders only partial restitution, it must state its reasons for doing so.<br />18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(c). Subsection (a)(2) provides for restitution as a condition of<br />probation or supervised release for offenses not set forth in Title 18, United<br />States Code, or 49 U.S.C. &#167; 46312, &#167; 46502, or &#167; 46504.<br />In determining whether to impose an order of restitution, and the amount<br />of restitution, the court shall consider the amount of loss the victim suffered as<br />a result of the offense, the financial resources of the defendant, the financial<br />needs of the defendant and his dependents, and other factors the court deems<br />appropriate. 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3664(a).<br />Pursuant to Rule 32(b)(4)(D), Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the<br />probation officer’s presentence investigation report must contain a victim impact<br />statement. That report must contain information about the financial impact on<br />the victim and the defendant’s financial condition. The sentencing judge may<br />base findings on the presentence report or other testimony or evidence supported<br />by a preponderance of the evidence. 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3664(d).<br />Unless the court orders otherwise, restitution must be made immediately.<br />18 U.S.C. &#167; 3663(f)(3).

Compare, United States v. Labat, 915 F.2d 603<br />(10th Cir. 1990)(requiring imposition of punitive fine before costs of imprisonment fine can<br />be imposed) with United States v. Sellers, 42 F.3d 116 (2d Cir. 1994)(not requiring imposition<br />of punitive fine before ordering costs of imprisonment fine), cert. denied, 116 S.Ct. 93 (1995).<br />Recognizing that a fine for costs of imprisonment and/or supervision is not statutorily required<br />and rarely is imposed, the Commission has elected to dispense with the requirement that courts<br />determine a separate, additional fine for such costs. Instead, the amendment provides that the<br />court shall take such costs into consideration in determining the appropriate amount of a<br />punitive fine.<br />Because, under the amended procedure, it no longer will be necessary to determine a separate<br />fine increment for costs associated with implementing the sentence, the issue on which the<br />circuit courts have differed should not arise.
