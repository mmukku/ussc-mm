The results of a drug test administered in accordance with the preceding subsection shall be subject to confirmation only if the results are positive, the defendant is subject to possible imprisonment for such failure, and either the defendant denies the accuracy of such test or there is some other reason to question the results of the test. A drug test confirmation shall be a urine drug test confirmed using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry techniques or such test as the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts after consultation with the Secretary of Health and Human Services may determine to be of equivalent accuracy. The court shall consider whether the availability of appropriate substance abuse treatment programs, or an individual\u2019s current or past participation in such programs, warrants an exception in accordance with United States Sentencing Commission guidelines from the rule of section 3583(g) when considering any action against a defendant who fails a drug test.

The report shall include, to the extent practicable, a complete accounting of the losses to each victim, any restitution owed pursuant to a plea agreement, and information relating to the economic circumstances of each defendant. If the number or identity of victims cannot be reasonably ascertained, or other circumstances exist that make this requirement clearly impracticable, the probation officer shall so inform the court.</p><p><strong>(b)</strong> The court shall disclose to both the defendant and the attorney for the Government all portions of the presentence or other report pertaining to the matters described in subsection (a) of this section.</p><p><strong>(c)</strong> The provisions of this chapter, chapter 227, and Rule 32(c) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure shall be the only rules applicable to proceedings under this section.</p><p><strong>(d)(1)</strong> Upon the request of the probation officer, but not later than 60 days prior to the date initially set for sentencing, the attorney for the Government, after consulting, to the extent practicable, with all identified victims, shall promptly provide the probation officer with a listing of the amounts subject to restitution.</p><p><strong>(2)</strong> The probation officer shall, prior to submitting the presentence report under subsection (a), to the extent practicable\u2014</p><blockquote><p><strong>(A)</strong> provide notice to all identified victims of\u2014</p><blockquote><p><strong>(i)</strong> the offense or offenses of which the defendant was convicted;</p><p><strong>(ii)</strong> the amounts subject to restitution submitted to the probation officer;</p><p><strong>(iii)</strong> the opportunity of the victim to submit information to the probation officer concerning the amount of the victim\u2019s losses;</p><p><strong>(iv)</strong> the scheduled date, time, and place of the sentencing hearing;</p><p><strong>(v)</strong> the availability of a lien in favor of the victim pursuant to subsection (m)(1)(B); and</p><p><strong>(vi)</strong> the opportunity of the victim to file with the probation officer a separate affidavit relating to the amount of the victim\u2019s losses subject to restitution; and</p></blockquote><p><strong>(B)</strong> provide the victim with an affidavit form to submit pursuant to subparagraph (A)(vi).</p></blockquote><p><strong>(3)</strong> Each defendant shall prepare and file with the probation officer an affidavit fully describing the financial resources of the defendant, including a complete listing of all assets owned or controlled by the defendant as of the date on which the defendant was arrested, the financial needs and earning ability of the defendant and the defendant\u2019s dependents, and such other information that the court requires relating to such other factors as the court deems appropriate.</p><p><strong>(4)</strong> After reviewing the report of the probation officer, the court may require additional documentation or hear testimony.

The court may also accept notification of a material change in the defendant\u2019s economic circumstances from the United States or from the victim. The Attorney General shall certify to the court that the victim or victims owed restitution by the defendant have been notified of the change in circumstances. Upon receipt of the notification, the court may, on its own motion, or the motion of any party, including the victim, adjust the payment schedule, or require immediate payment in full, as the interests of justice require.</p><p><strong>(l)</strong> A conviction of a defendant for an offense involving the act giving rise to an order of restitution shall estop the defendant from denying the essential allegations of that offense in any subsequent Federal civil proceeding or State civil proceeding, to the extent consistent with State law, brought by the victim.</p><p><strong>(m)(1)(A)(i)</strong> An order of restitution may be enforced by the United States in the manner provided for in subchapter C of chapter 227 and subchapter B of chapter 229 of this title; or</p><p><strong>(ii)</strong> by all other available and reasonable means.</p><p><strong>(B)</strong> At the request of a victim named in a restitution order, the clerk of the court shall issue an abstract of judgment certifying that a judgment has been entered in favor of such victim in the amount specified in the restitution order.

This will require that, as a starting point in its development of the initial sets of guidelines for particular categories of cases, the Commission ascertain the average sentences imposed in such categories of cases prior to the creation of the Commission, and in cases involving sentences to terms of imprisonment, the length of such terms actually served. The Commission shall not be bound by such average sentences, and shall independently develop a sentencing range that is consistent with the purposes of sentencing described in section 3553(a)(2) of Title 18, United States Code.</p><p><strong>(n)</strong> The Commission shall assure that the guidelines reflect the general appropriateness of imposing a lower sentence than would otherwise be imposed, including a sentence that is lower than that established by statute as a minimum sentence, to take into account a defendant\u2019s substantial assistance in the investigation or prosecution of another person who has committed an offense.</p><p><strong>(o)</strong> The Commission periodically shall review and revise, in consideration of comments and data coming to its attention, the guidelines promulgated pursuant to the provisions of this section.

Such an amendment or modification shall be accompanied by a statement of the reasons therefor and shall take effect on a date specified by the Commission, which shall be no earlier than 180 days after being so submitted and no later than the first day of November of the calendar year in which the amendment or modification is submitted, except to the extent that the effective date is revised or the amendment is otherwise modified or disapproved by Act of Congress.</p><p><strong>(q)</strong> The Commission and the Bureau of Prisons shall submit to Congress an analysis and recommendations concerning maximum utilization of resources to deal effectively with the Federal prison population.

Rehabilitation of the defendant alone shall not be considered an extraordinary and compelling reason.</p><p><strong>(u)</strong> If the Commission reduces the term of imprisonment recommended in the guidelines applicable to a particular offense or category of offenses, it shall specify in what circumstances and by what amount the sentences of prisoners serving terms of imprisonment for the offense may be reduced.</p><p><strong>(v)</strong> The Commission shall ensure that the general policy statements promulgated pursuant to subsection (a)(2) include a policy limiting consecutive terms of imprisonment for an offense involving a violation of a general prohibition and for an offense involving a violation of a specific prohibition encompassed within the general prohibition.</p><p><strong>(w)(1)</strong> The Chief Judge of each district court shall ensure that, within 30 days following entry of judgment in every criminal case, the sentencing court submits to the Commission, in a format approved and required by the Commission, a written report of the sentence, the offense for which it is imposed, the age, race, sex of the offender, and information regarding factors made relevant by the guidelines.
