This amendment implements the<br />directive to the Commission in the Veterans’ Cemetery Protection Act of 1997, Pub. L.<br />105–101, &#167; 2, 111 Stat. 2202, 2202 (1997). This Act directs the Commission to provide a<br />sentence enhancement of not less than two levels for any offense against the property of a<br />national cemetery. In response to the legislation, this amendment adds a two-level<br />enhancement to &#167;&#167;2B1.1 (Theft), 2B1.3 (Property Destruction), and 2K1.4 (Arson).<br />"National cemetery" is defined in the same way as that term is defined in the statute.</td><td>Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1998.</td></tr><tr><td class="n">578</td><td>Amendment 578</td><td>Section 2F1.1(b) is amended by striking subdivision (5) in its entirety as<br />follows:<br />"(5) If the offense involved the use of foreign bank accounts or transactions to<br />conceal the true nature or extent of the fraudulent conduct, and the offense<br />level as determined above is less than level 12, increase to level 12.",<br />and inserting:<br />"(5) (A) If the defendant relocated, or participated in relocating, a fraudulent<br />scheme to another jurisdiction to evade law enforcement or regulatory<br />officials; (B) if a substantial part of a fraudulent scheme was committed<br />from outside the United States; or (C) if the offense otherwise involved<br />November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II Amendment 577<br /><br />sophisticated concealment, increase by 2 levels.

For purposes of subsection (b)(5)(B), ‘United States’ means each of the 50<br />states, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the<br />United States Virgin Islands, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, and<br />American Samoa.<br />For purposes of subsection (b)(5)(C), ‘sophisticated concealment’ means<br />especially complex or especially intricate offense conduct in which<br />deliberate steps are taken to make the offense, or its extent, difficult to<br />detect. Conduct such as hiding assets or transactions, or both, through the<br />use of fictitious entities, corporate shells, or offshore bank accounts<br />ordinarily indicates sophisticated concealment.".<br />The Commentary to &#167;2F1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by adding at the end<br />the following new note:<br />"20. ‘Mass-marketing,’ as used in subsection (b)(7), means a plan, program,<br />promotion, or campaign that is conducted through solicitation by telephone,<br />mail, the Internet, or other means to induce a large number of persons to (A)<br />purchase goods or services; (B) participate in a contest or sweepstakes; or<br />(C) invest for financial profit. The enhancement would apply, for example,<br />if the defendant conducted or participated in a telemarketing campaign that<br />solicited a large number of individuals to purchase fraudulent life insurance<br />policies.".<br />Section 2T1.1(b) is amended by striking subdivision (2) in its entirety as follows:<br />"(2) If sophisticated means were used to impede discovery of the existence or<br />extent of the offense, increase by 2 levels.",<br />and inserting the following:<br />"(2) If the offense involved sophisticated concealment, increase by 2 levels.".<br />The Commentary to &#167;2T1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by striking Note 4<br />in its entirety as follows:<br />"4. ‘Sophisticated means,’ as used in subsection (b)(2), includes conduct that<br />is more complex or demonstrates greater intricacy or planning than a<br />Amendment APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003<br /><br />routine tax-evasion case. An enhancement would be applied, for example,<br />where the defendant used offshore bank accounts, or transactions through<br />corporate shells or fictitious entities.",<br />and inserting the following:<br />"4.

For purposes of subsection (b)(1), ‘sophisticated concealment’ means<br />especially complex or especially intricate offense conduct in which<br />deliberate steps are taken to make the offense, or its extent, difficult to<br />detect. Conduct such as hiding assets or transactions, or both, through the<br />use of fictitious entities, corporate shells, or offshore bank accounts<br />ordinarily indicates sophisticated concealment.".</td><td>Reason for Amendment: This amendment has three purposes: (1) to provide an increase<br />for fraud offenses that use mass-marketing to carry out the fraud; (2) to provide an increase<br />for fraud offenses that involve conduct, such as sophisticated concealment, that makes it<br />difficult for law enforcement authorities to discover the offense or apprehend the offender;<br />and (3) to clarify and conform an existing enhancement that provides an increase for tax<br />offenses that similarly involve sophisticated concealment.<br />First, this amendment adds a two-level enhancement in the fraud guideline for offenses that<br />are committed through mass-marketing. The Commission identified mass-marketing as a<br />central component of telemarketing fraud and also determined that there were other<br />fraudulent schemes that relied on mass-marketing to perpetrate the offense (for example,<br />Internet fraud). Accordingly, rather than provide a limited enhancement for telemarketing<br />fraud only, the Commission determined that a generally applicable specific offense<br />characteristic in the fraud guideline would better provide consistent and proportionate<br />sentencing increases for similar types of fraud, while also ensuring increased sentences for<br />persons who engage in mass-marketed telemarketing fraud.<br />Second, this amendment provides an increase for fraud offenses that involve conduct, such<br />as sophisticated concealment, that makes it difficult for law enforcement authorities to<br />discover the offense or apprehend the offenders. The new enhancement provides a two-level<br />increase and a "floor" offense level of level 12 in the fraud guideline and replaces the current<br />enhancement for "the use of foreign bank accounts or transactions to conceal the true nature<br />or extent of fraudulent conduct." There are three alternative provisions to the enhancement.<br />The first two prongs address conduct that the Commission has been informed often relates<br />to telemarketing fraud, although the conduct also may occur in connection with fraudulent<br />schemes perpetrated by other means. Specifically, the Commission has been informed that<br />fraudulent telemarketers increasingly are conducting their operations from Canada and other<br />locations outside the United States. Additionally, testimony offered at a Commission<br />hearing on telemarketing fraud indicated that telemarketers often relocate their schemes to<br />other jurisdictions once they know or suspect that enforcement authorities have discovered<br />the scheme. Both types of conduct are specifically covered by the new enhancement. The<br />third prong provides an increase if any offense covered by the fraud guideline otherwise<br />involves sophisticated concealment. This prong addresses cases in which deliberate steps<br />are taken to make the offense, or its extent, difficult to detect.<br />Third, this amendment provides a two-level enhancement for conduct related to sophisticated<br />concealment of a tax offense. The primary purpose of this amendment is to conform the<br />language of the current enhancement for “sophisticated means” in the tax guidelines to the<br />essentially equivalent language of the new sophisticated concealment enhancement provided<br />in the fraud guideline. Additionally, the amendment resolves a circuit conflict regarding<br />whether the enhancement applies based on the personal conduct of the defendant or the<br />Amendment 577 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003<br /><br />overall offense conduct for which the defendant is accountable. Consistent with the usual<br />relevant conduct rules, application of this new enhancement for sophisticated concealment<br />accordingly is based on the overall offense conduct for which the defendant is accountable.</td><td>Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1998.</td></tr><tr><td class="n">579</td><td>Amendment 579</td><td>Section 2K2.1(a) is amended in subdivision (4) by striking "the defendant"<br />after "20, if"; in subdivision (4)(A) by inserting "the defendant" before "had one"; in<br />subdivision (4)(B) by striking "is a prohibited person, and"; and in subdivision (4)(B) by<br />inserting "; and the defendant (i) is a prohibited person; or (ii) is convicted under 18 U.S.C.<br />&#167; 922(d)" after "&#167; 921(a)(30)".<br />Section 2K2.1(a)(6) is amended by inserting "(A)" after "defendant"; and by inserting "; or<br />(B) is convicted under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(d)" after "person".<br />The Commentary to &#167;2K2.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 6 by striking<br />"or" before "(vi)"; and by inserting "; or (vii) has been convicted in any court of a<br />misdemeanor crime of domestic violence as defined in 18 U.S.C. &#167; 921(a)(33)" after<br />"&#167; 922(d)(8)".<br />The Commentary to &#167;2K2.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 12 in the first<br />paragraph by striking "924(j) or (k), or 26 U.S.C. &#167; 5861(g) or (h)" and inserting "924 (l) or<br />(m)"; and in the second paragraph by striking "only" after "if the"; and by inserting "or 26<br />U.S.C. &#167; 5861(g) or (h)" after "922(k)".</td><td>Reason for Amendment: This amendment has three purposes: (1) to change the definition<br />of "prohibited person" in the firearms guideline so that it includes a person convicted of a<br />misdemeanor crime of domestic violence; (2) to provide the same base offense levels for<br />both a prohibited person and a person who is convicted under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(d) of<br />transferring a firearm to a prohibited person; and (3) to make several technical and<br />conforming changes to the firearms guideline.<br />The first part of the amendment amends Application Note 6 of &#167;2K2.1 (Unlawful Receipt,<br />Possession, or Transportation of Firearms or Ammunition; Prohibited Transactions Involving<br />Firearms or Ammunition) to include a person convicted of a misdemeanor crime of domestic<br />violence within the scope of "prohibited person" for purposes of that guideline. It also<br />defines "misdemeanor crime of domestic violence" by reference to the new statutory<br />definition of that term in 18 U.S.C. &#167; 921(a).<br />This part of the amendment addresses section 658 of the Treasury, Postal Service, and<br />General Government Appropriations Act, Pub. L. 104–208, 110 Stat. 3009 (1996) (contained<br />in the Omnibus Consolidated Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 1997). Section 658<br />amended 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(d) to prohibit the sale of a firearm or ammunition to a person who<br />has been convicted in any court of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence. It also<br />amended 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(g) to prohibit a person who has been convicted in any court of a<br />misdemeanor crime of domestic violence from transporting or receiving a firearm or<br />ammunition. Section 922(s)(3)(B)(i), which lists the information a person not licensed under<br />18 U.S.C. &#167; 923 must include in a statement to the handgun importer, manufacturer, or<br />dealer, was amended to require certification that the person to whom the gun is transferred<br />was not convicted in any court of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence. Section 658<br /><br />also amended 18 U.S.C. &#167; 921(a) to define "misdemeanor crime of domestic violence".<br />Violations of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(d) and (g) are covered by &#167;2K2.1. The new provisions at<br />&#167; 922(d) (sale of a firearm to a "prohibited person") and &#167; 922(g) (transporting, possession,<br />and receipt of a firearm by a "prohibited person") affect Application Note 6 of &#167;2K2.1,<br />which defines "prohibited person". This part of the amendment conforms Application Note<br />6 of &#167;2K2.1 to the new statutory provisions.<br />The second part of this amendment increases the base offense level for a defendant who is<br />convicted under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(d), which prohibits the transfer of a firearm to a prohibited<br />person. Specifically, this part amends the two alternative base offense levels that pertain to<br />prohibited persons in the firearms guideline in order to make those offense levels applicable<br />to the person who transfers the firearm to the prohibited person. A person who is convicted<br />under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(d) has been shown beyond a reasonable doubt either to have known,<br />or to have had reasonable cause to believe, that the transferee was a prohibited person.<br />The third part of this amendment makes two technical and conforming changes in<br />Application Note 12 of &#167;2K2.1. First, the amendment corrects statutory references to 18<br />U.S.C. &#167; 924(j) and (k), which were added as a result of the Violent Crime Control and Law<br />Enforcement Act of 1994, Pub. L. 103–322, 108 Stat. 1796 (1994). In the Economic<br />Espionage Act of 1996, Pub. L. 104–294, 110 Stat. 3488 (1996), Congress again amended<br />18 U.S.C. &#167; 924 and redesignated the provisions as subsections (l) and (m). The amendment<br />conforms Application Note 12 to that redesignation. Second, the amendment corrects the<br />misplacement of the reference to 26 U.S.C. &#167; 5861(g) and (h).</td><td>Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1998.</td></tr><tr><td class="n">580</td><td>Amendment 580</td><td>The Commentary to &#167;2J1.6 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in<br />Note 3 in the first paragraph by striking "3D1.2" and inserting "3D1.1"; and by striking the<br />second paragraph in its entirety as follows:<br />"Otherwise, in the case of a conviction on both the underlying offense and the<br />failure to appear, the failure to appear is treated under &#167;3C1.1 (Obstructing or<br />Impeding the Administration of Justice) as an obstruction of the underlying offense;<br />and the failure to appear count and the count(s) for the underlying offense are<br />grouped together under &#167;3D1.2(c). Note that although 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3146(b)(2) does<br />not require a sentence of imprisonment on a failure to appear count, it does require<br />that any sentence of imprisonment on a failure to appear count be imposed<br />consecutively to any other sentence of imprisonment. Therefore, in such cases, the<br />combined sentence must be constructed to provide a ‘total punishment’ that satisfies<br />the requirements both of &#167;5G1.2 (Sentencing on Multiple Counts of Conviction) and<br />18 U.S.C. &#167; 3146(b)(2). For example, where the combined applicable guideline<br />range for both counts is 30-37 months and the court determines a ‘total punishment’<br />of 36 months is appropriate, a sentence of thirty months for the underlying offense<br />plus a consecutive six months sentence for the failure to appear count would satisfy<br />these requirements.",<br />and inserting the following as the new second paragraph:<br />"In the case of a conviction on both the underlying offense and the failure to appear,<br />Amendment 579 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003<br /><br />the failure to appear is treated under &#167;3C1.1 (Obstructing or Impeding the<br />Administration of Justice) as an obstruction of the underlying offense, and the<br />failure to appear count and the count or counts for the underlying offense are<br />grouped together under &#167;3D1.2(c). (Note that 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3146(b)(2) does not<br />require a sentence of imprisonment on a failure to appear count, although if a<br />sentence of imprisonment on the failure to appear count is imposed, the statute<br />requires that the sentence be imposed to run consecutively to any other sentence of<br />imprisonment. Therefore, unlike a count in which the statute mandates both a<br />minimum and a consecutive sentence of imprisonment, the grouping rules of<br />&#167;&#167;3D1.1-3D1.5 apply. See &#167;3D1.1(b), comment. (n.1), and &#167;3D1.2, comment.<br />(n.1).) The combined sentence will then be constructed to provide a ‘total<br />punishment’ that satisfies the requirements both of &#167;5G1.2 (Sentencing on Multiple<br />Counts of Conviction) and 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3146(b)(2). For example, if the combined<br />applicable guideline range for both counts is 30-37 months and the court determines<br />that a ‘total punishment’ of 36 months is appropriate, a sentence of 30 months for<br />the underlying offense plus a consecutive six months’ sentence for the failure to<br />appear count would satisfy these requirements. (Note that the combination of this<br />instruction and increasing the offense level for the obstructive, failure to appear<br />conduct has the effect of ensuring an incremental, consecutive punishment for the<br />failure to appear count, as required by 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3146(b)(2).)".<br />The Commentary to &#167;2J1.6 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by redesignating Note<br />4 as Note 5; and by inserting the following as new Note 4:<br />"4. If a defendant is convicted of both the underlying offense and the failure to<br />appear count, and the defendant committed additional acts of obstructive<br />behavior (e.g., perjury) during the investigation, prosecution, or sentencing<br />of the instant offense, an upward departure may be warranted. The upward<br />departure will ensure an enhanced sentence for obstructive conduct for<br />which no adjustment under &#167;3C1.1 (Obstruction of Justice) is made because<br />of the operation of the rules set out in Application Note 3.".<br />The Commentary to &#167;2P1.2 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 2 by striking<br />" as amended," after "18 U.S.C. &#167; 1791(c),"; and by inserting "by the inmate" after "served".<br />The Commentary to &#167;2P1.2 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 2 by inserting<br />before the first paragraph the following:<br />"In a case in which the defendant is convicted of the underlying offense and an<br />offense involving providing or possessing a controlled substance in prison, group<br />the offenses together under &#167;3D1.2(c). (Note that 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1791(b) does not<br />require a sentence of imprisonment, although if a sentence of imprisonment is<br />imposed on a count involving providing or possessing a controlled substance in<br />prison, section 1791(c) requires that the sentence be imposed to run consecutively<br />to any other sentence of imprisonment for the controlled substance. Therefore,<br />unlike a count in which the statute mandates both a minimum and a consecutive<br />sentence of imprisonment, the grouping rules of &#167;&#167;3D1.1-3D1.5 apply. See<br />&#167;3D1.1(b), comment. (n.1), and &#167;3D1.2, comment. (n.1).)

For example, if the combined applicable guideline range for<br />both counts is 30-37 months and the court determines a ‘total punishment’ of 36<br />months is appropriate, a sentence of 30 months for the underlying offense plus a<br />consecutive six months’ sentence for the providing or possessing a controlled<br />substance in prison count would satisfy these requirements.".<br />The Commentary to &#167;3C1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 6 by striking<br />"Where" and inserting "If"; and by striking "where" both places it appears and inserting "if".<br />The Commentary to &#167;3C1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 7 in the first<br />sentence by striking "Where" and inserting "If"; by striking "both of the" and inserting "both<br />of an"; by inserting "(e.g., 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3146 (Penalty for failure to appear); 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1621<br />(Perjury generally))" after "obstruction offense" the first place it appears; and by striking "the<br />underlying" the first place it appears and inserting "an underlying".<br />Section 3D1.1(b) is amended by striking the first sentence in its entirety as follows:<br />"Any count for which the statute mandates imposition of a consecutive sentence is<br />excluded from the operation of &#167;&#167;3D1.2-3D1.5.",<br />and inserting the following:<br />"Exclude from the application of &#167;&#167;3D1.2-3D1.5 any count for which the statute<br />(1) specifies a term of imprisonment to be imposed; and (2) requires that such term<br />of imprisonment be imposed to run consecutively to any other term of<br />imprisonment.".<br />The Commentary to &#167;3D1.1 captioned "Application Note" is amended by striking Note 1 in<br />its entirety as follows:<br />"1. Counts for which a statute mandates imposition of a consecutive sentence<br />are excepted from application of the multiple count rules. Convictions on<br />such counts are not used in the determination of a combined offense level<br />under this Part, but may affect the offense level for other counts. A<br />conviction for 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c) (use of firearm in commission of a crime<br />of violence) provides a common example. In the case of a conviction under<br />18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c), the specific offense characteristic for weapon use in the<br />primary offense is to be disregarded to avoid double counting. See<br />Commentary to &#167;2K2.4 (Use of Firearm, Armor-Piercing Ammunition, or<br />Explosive During or in Relation to Certain Crimes). Example: The<br />defendant is convicted of one count of bank robbery (18 U.S.C. &#167; 2113),<br />and one count of use of a firearm in the commission of a crime of violence<br />(18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c)). The two counts are not grouped together, and the<br />offense level for the bank robbery count is computed without application of<br />an enhancement for weapon possession or use.

Subsection (b) applies if a statute (A) specifies a term of imprisonment to<br />be imposed; and (B) requires that such term of imprisonment be imposed<br />to run consecutively to any other term of imprisonment. See, e.g., 18<br />U.S.C. &#167; 924(c) (requiring mandatory term of five years to run<br />consecutively). The multiple count rules set out under this Part do not<br />apply to a count of conviction covered by subsection (b). However, a count<br />covered by subsection (b) may affect the offense level determination for<br />other counts. For example, a defendant is convicted of one count of bank<br />robbery (18 U.S.C. &#167; 2113), and one count of use of a firearm in the<br />commission of a crime of violence (18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c)). The two counts<br />are not grouped together pursuant to this guideline, and, to avoid<br />unwarranted double counting, the offense level for the bank robbery count<br />under &#167;2B3.1 (Robbery) is computed without application of the<br />enhancement for weapon possession or use as otherwise required by<br />subsection (b)(2) of that guideline. Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c), the<br />mandatory five-year sentence on the weapon-use count runs consecutively<br />to the guideline sentence imposed on the bank robbery count. See<br />&#167;5G1.2(a).<br />Unless specifically instructed, subsection (b) does not apply when imposing<br />a sentence under a statute that requires the imposition of a consecutive term<br />of imprisonment only if a term of imprisonment is imposed (i.e., the statute<br />does not otherwise require a term of imprisonment to be imposed). See,<br />e.g., 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3146 (Penalty for failure to appear); 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(a)(4)<br />(regarding penalty for 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(q) (possession or discharge of a<br />firearm in a school zone)); 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1791(c) (penalty for providing or<br />possessing a controlled substance in prison). Accordingly, the multiple<br />count rules set out under this Part do apply to a count of conviction under<br />this type of statute.".<br />The Commentary to &#167;3D1.2 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 1 in the third<br />sentence by striking "mandates imposition of a consecutive sentence" and inserting "(A)<br />specifies a term of imprisonment to be imposed; and (B) requires that such term of<br />imprisonment be imposed to run consecutively to any other term of imprisonment"; and by<br />inserting "; id., comment.

That sentence then runs consecutively to the<br />sentences imposed on the other counts.",<br />November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II Amendment 579<br /><br />and inserting the following:<br />"Subsection (a) applies if a statute (1) specifies a term of imprisonment to be<br />imposed; and (2) requires that such term of imprisonment be imposed to run<br />consecutively to any other term of imprisonment. See, e.g., 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c)<br />(requiring mandatory term of five years to run consecutively to any other term of<br />imprisonment). The term of years to be imposed consecutively is determined by the<br />statute of conviction, and is independent of a guideline sentence on any other<br />count.".<br />The Commentary to &#167;5G1.2 is amended in the last paragraph in the fourth sentence by<br />inserting ", e.g.," after "See"; and by adding at the end the following new sentence:<br />"Subsection (a) also applies in certain other instances in which an independently<br />determined and consecutive sentence is required. See, e.g., Application Note 3 of<br />the Commentary to &#167;2J1.6 (Failure to Appear by Defendant), relating to failure to<br />appear for service of sentence.".</td><td>Reason for Amendment: The purpose of this amendment is to clarify how several<br />guideline provisions, including those on grouping multiple counts of conviction, work<br />together to ensure an incremental, consecutive penalty for a failure to appear count. This<br />amendment addresses a circuit conflict regarding whether the guideline procedure of<br />grouping the failure to appear count of conviction with the count of conviction for the<br />underlying offense violates the statutory mandate of imposing a consecutive sentence.<br />Compare United States v. Agoro, 996 F.2d 1288 (1st Cir. 1993) (grouping rules apply), and<br />United States v. Flores, No. 93-3771, 1994 WL 163766 (6th Cir. May 2, 1994) (unpublished)<br />(same), with United States v.

The amendment<br />maintains the current grouping rules for failure to appear and obstruction of justice, but<br />addresses internal inconsistencies among different guidelines and explains how the guideline<br />provisions work together to ensure an incremental, consecutive penalty for the failure to<br />appear count. Specifically, the amendment (1) more clearly distinguishes between statutes<br />that require imposition of a consecutive term of imprisonment only if imprisonment is<br />imposed (e.g., 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3146 (Penalty for failure to appear); 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1791(b), (c)<br />(Penalty for providing or possessing contraband in prison)), and statutes that require both a<br />minimum term of imprisonment and a consecutive sentence (e.g., 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c) (Use<br />of a firearm in relation to crime of violence or drug trafficking offense)); (2) states that the<br />method outlined for determining a sentence for failure to appear and similar statutes ensures<br />an incremental, consecutive punishment; (3) adds an upward departure provision if offense<br />conduct involves multiple obstructive acts; (4) makes conforming changes in &#167;2P1.2<br />(Providing or Possessing Contraband in Prison) because the relevant statute, 18 U.S.C.<br />&#167; 1791, is similar to 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3146; and (5) makes conforming changes in &#167;&#167;3C1.1,<br />3D1.1, 3D1.2, and 5G1.2.</td><td>Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1998.</td></tr><tr><td class="n">581</td><td>Amendment 581</td><td>The Commentary to &#167;3B1.3 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in the<br />first paragraph of Note 1 in the third sentence by striking “enhancement” and inserting<br />“adjustment”; by inserting "public or private" after "position of"; in the fourth sentence by<br />striking "would apply" and inserting "applies"; and in the last sentence by striking "would"<br />Amendment 579 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003<br /><br />and inserting "does.".<br />The Commentary to &#167;3B1.3 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by redesignating<br />Note 2 as Note 3; and by inserting the following as new Note 2:<br />"2. This adjustment also applies in a case in which the defendant provides<br />sufficient indicia to the victim that the defendant legitimately holds a<br />position of private or public trust when, in fact, the defendant does not. For<br />example, the adjustment applies in the case of a defendant who (A)<br />perpetrates a financial fraud by leading an investor to believe the defendant<br />is a legitimate investment broker; or (B) perpetrates a fraud by representing<br />falsely to a patient or employer that the defendant is a licensed physician.<br />In making the misrepresentation, the defendant assumes a position of trust,<br />relative to the victim, that provides the defendant with the same opportunity<br />to commit a difficult-to-detect crime that the defendant would have had if<br />the position were held legitimately.".<br />The Commentary to &#167;3B1.3 captioned "Background" is amended by inserting after the first<br />sentence the following:<br />"The adjustment also applies to persons who provide sufficient indicia to the victim<br />that they legitimately hold a position of public or private trust when, in fact, they do<br />not.".</td><td>Reason for Amendment: The purpose of this amendment is to establish that the two-level<br />increase for abuse of a position of trust applies to a defendant who is an imposter, as well as<br />to a person who legitimately holds and abuses a position of trust. This amendment resolves<br />a circuit conflict on that issue. Compare United States v. Gill, 99 F.3d 484 (1st Cir. 1996)<br />(adjustment applied to defendant who posed as licensed psychologist), and United States v.<br />Queen, 4 F.3d 925 (10th Cir. 1993) (adjustment applied to defendant who posed as financial<br />broker), cert. denied, 510 U.S. 1182 (1994), with United States v. Echevarria, 33 F.3d 175<br />(2d Cir. 1994) (defendant who poses as physician does not occupy a position of trust). The<br />amendment adopts the majority appellate view and provides that the abuse of position of<br />trust adjustment applies to an imposter who pretends to hold a position of trust when in fact<br />he does not. The Commission has determined that, particularly from the perspective of the<br />crime victim, an imposter who falsely assumes and takes advantage of a position of trust is<br />as culpable and deserving of increased punishment as is a defendant who abuses an actual<br />position of trust.</td><td>Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1998</td></tr><tr><td class="n">582</td><td>Amendment 582</td><td>Section 3C1.1 is amended by inserting "(A)" after "If"; by inserting "the<br />course of" after "during"; and by inserting "of conviction, and (B) the obstructive conduct<br />related to (i) the defendant’s offense of conviction and any relevant conduct; or (ii) a closely<br />related offense" after "instant offense".<br />The Commentary to &#167;3C1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 2 by striking<br />“enhancement” each place it appears, and inserting “adjustment”; in the second sentence by<br />striking "Note 3" and inserting "Note 4"; in the third sentence by striking "Note 4" and<br />inserting "Note 5"; and in the fourth sentence by striking "Notes 3 and 4" and inserting<br />November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II Amendment 581<br /><br />"Notes 4 and 5".<br />The Commentary to &#167;3C1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 4 in the first<br />paragraph by striking "Note 7" and inserting "Note 8".<br />The Commentary to &#167;3C1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by redesignating<br />Notes 1 through 8, as Notes 2 through 9, respectively; and by inserting the following as new<br />Note 1:<br />"1.

This amendment resolves a circuit conflict on that issue.<br />Compare United States v. Belletiere, 971 F.2d 961 (3d Cir. 1992) (lying about drug use is<br />not obstructive conduct that impedes government’s investigation of instant offense), and<br />United States v.

If a departure is warranted, the<br />extent of the departure should reflect the extent to which the reduced mental<br />capacity contributed to the commission of the offense.<br />Commentary<br />Application Note:<br />1. For purposes of this policy statement—<br />‘Significantly reduced mental capacity’ means the defendant, although<br />convicted, has a significantly impaired ability to (A) understand the<br />wrongfulness of the behavior comprising the offense or to exercise the<br />power of reason; or (B) control behavior that the defendant knows is<br />wrongful.".</td><td>Reason for Amendment: The purpose of this amendment is to allow (except under certain<br />November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II Amendment 583<br /><br />circumstances) a diminished capacity departure if there is sufficient evidence that the<br />defendant committed the offense while suffering from a significantly reduced mental<br />capacity. This amendment addresses a circuit conflict regarding whether the diminished<br />capacity departure is precluded if the defendant committed a "crime of violence" as that term<br />is defined in the career offender guideline. Compare United States v. Poff, 926 F.2d 588<br />(7th Cir.) (en banc) (definition of "non-violent offense" necessarily excludes a crime of<br />violence), cert. denied, 502 U.S. 827 (1991), United States v.

Askari, 140 F. 3d 536 (3d Cir. 1998) (en banc)<br />("non-violent offenses" are those that do not involve a reasonable perception that force<br />against persons may be used in committing the offense), abrogating United States v. Rosen,<br />896 F.2d 789 (3d Cir. 1990) (non-violent offense means the opposite of crime of violence).<br />The amendment replaces the current policy statement with a new provision that essentially<br />represents a compromise approach to the circuit conflict. The new policy statement allows<br />a diminished capacity departure if there is sufficient evidence that the defendant committed<br />the offense while suffering from a significantly reduced mental capacity, except under the<br />following three circumstances: (1) the significantly reduced mental capacity was caused by<br />the voluntary use of drugs or other intoxicants; (2) the facts and circumstances of the<br />defendant’s offense indicate a need to protect the public because the offense involved actual<br />violence or a serious threat of violence; or (3) the defendant’s criminal history indicates a<br />need to incarcerate the defendant to protect the public. The amendment also adds an<br />application note that defines "significantly reduced mental capacity" in accord with the<br />decision in United States v. McBroom, 124 F.3d 533 (3d Cir. 1997). The McBroom court<br />concluded that "significantly reduced mental capacity" included both cognitive impairments<br />(i.e., an inability to understand the wrongfulness of the conduct or to exercise the power of<br />reason) and volitional impairments (i.e., an inability to control behavior that the person<br />knows is wrongful).

Second, this amendment<br />deletes the reference in the supervised release guideline to "just punishment" as a reason for<br />the imposition of curfew as a condition of supervised release. The need to provide "just<br />punishment" is not included in 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3583(c) as a permissible factor to be considered<br />in imposing a term of supervised release. Third, this amendment amends the guidelines<br />pertaining to conditions of probation and supervised release to indicate that discretionary (as<br />opposed to mandatory) conditions are advisory policy statements of the Commission, not<br />binding guidelines.</td><td>Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1998.</td></tr><tr><td class="n">586</td><td>Amendment 586</td><td>Section 5K2.0 is amended in the first paragraph in the first sentence by<br />inserting a comma after "3553(b)"; by striking "guideline" and inserting "guidelines"; in the<br />second sentence by striking "guidelines" and inserting "guideline range"; in the third<br />sentence by striking "controlling" after "The"; by striking "can only be made by the courts"<br />and inserting "rests with the sentencing court on a case-specific basis"; in the last sentence<br />by inserting "determining" after "consideration in"; by striking "guidelines" the second place<br />it appears and inserting "guideline range"; by striking "guideline level" and inserting<br />"weight"; by inserting "under the guidelines" after "factor"; and by inserting before the<br />period at the end "or excessive".<br />November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II Amendment 585<br /><br />Section 5K2.0 is amended in the last paragraph by striking "An" and inserting "Finally, an";<br />by striking "not ordinarily relevant" and inserting ", in the Commission’s view, ‘not<br />ordinarily relevant’"; and by striking "in a way that is important to the statutory purposes of<br />sentencing".<br />The Commentary to &#167;5K2.0 is amended by inserting before the first paragraph the following:<br />" The United States Supreme Court has determined that, in reviewing a<br />district court’s decision to depart from the guidelines, appellate courts are to apply<br />an abuse of discretion standard, because the decision to depart embodies the<br />traditional exercise of discretion by the sentencing court. Koon v. United States,<br />116 S. Ct. 2035 (1996). Furthermore, ‘[b]efore a departure is permitted, certain<br />aspects of the case must be found unusual enough for it to fall outside the heartland<br />of cases in the Guideline. To resolve this question, the district court must make a<br />refined assessment of the many facts bearing on the outcome, informed by its<br />vantage point and day-to-day experience in criminal sentencing. Whether a given<br />factor is present to a degree not adequately considered by the Commission, or<br />whether a discouraged factor nonetheless justifies departure because it is present in<br />some unusual or exceptional way, are matters determined in large part by<br />comparison with the facts of other Guidelines cases. District Courts have an<br />institutional advantage over appellate courts in making these sorts of determinations,<br />especially as they see so many more Guidelines cases than appellate courts do.’ Id.<br />at 2046-47.".</td><td>Reason for Amendment: The purpose of this amendment is to reference specifically in the<br />general departure policy statement the United States Supreme Court’s decision in United<br />States v.

It also more specifically requires that the guidelines provide "an<br />additional appropriate sentencing enhancement, if the offense involved sophisticated means,<br />including but not limited to sophisticated concealment efforts, such as perpetrating the<br />offense from outside the United States," and "an additional appropriate sentencing<br />enhancement for cases in which a large number of vulnerable victims, including but not<br />limited to [telemarketing fraud victims over age 55], are affected by a fraudulent scheme or<br />schemes."<br />This amendment responds to the directives by building upon the amendments to the fraud<br />guideline, &#167;2F1.1, that were submitted to Congress on May 1, 1998. (See amendment 577,<br />supra.) Those amendments added a specific offense characteristic for "mass-marketing,"<br />which is defined to include telemarketing, and a specific offense characteristic for<br />sophisticated concealment.<br />This amendment broadens the "sophisticated concealment" enhancement to cover<br />"sophisticated means" of executing or concealing a fraud offense. In addition, the<br />amendment increases the enhancement under the vulnerable victim guideline, &#167;3A1.1, for<br />offenses that impact a large number of vulnerable victims.<br />This amendment also makes a conforming amendment to &#167;2B5.1 in the definition of "United<br />States".<br />In designing enhancements that may apply more broadly than the Act’s above-stated<br />directives minimally require, the Commission acts consistently with other directives in the<br />Act (e.g., section 6(c)(4) (requiring the Commission to ensure that its implementing<br />amendments are reasonably consistent with other relevant directives to the Commission and<br />other parts of the sentencing guidelines)) and with its basic mandate in sections 991 and 994<br />of title 28, United States Code (e.g., 28 U.S.C. &#167; 991(b)(1)(B)) (requiring sentencing policies<br />that avoid unwarranted disparities among similarly situated defendants)).<br />Amendment 587 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003</td><td>Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1998.</td></tr><tr><td class="n">589</td><td>Amendment 589</td><td>The Commentary to &#167;2C1.4 captioned "Background" is amended by striking<br />the last sentence as follows:<br />" Both offenses are misdemeanors for which the maximum term of imprisonment<br />authorized by statute is one year.".<br />The Commentary to &#167;2J1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 2 in the third<br />sentence by inserting "(a)(1) and to any offense under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 228(a)(2) and (3)" after<br />“228"; and in the fourth sentence by inserting "(a)(1)" after "228".</td><td>Reason for Amendment: This is a two-part amendment. First, this amendment amends the<br />commentary in the contempt guideline, &#167;2J1.1, pertaining to offenses under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 228<br />involving the willful failure to pay court-ordered child support. The commentary notes that<br />the contempt guideline applies to second and subsequent offenses under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 228<br />because a first offense is a Class B misdemeanor not covered by the guidelines.<br />However, in the Deadbeat Parents Punishment Act of 1998, Pub. L. 105–187, Congress<br />amended 18 U.S.C. &#167; 228 to add two new violations of that section (found at 18 U.S.C.<br />&#167; 228(a)(2) and (3)) and to make even the first offense under those new violations a felony<br />that would be subject to the guidelines. Accordingly, the commentary in the contempt<br />guideline is amended to reflect that it is only the first offense under a violation of 18 U.S.C.<br />&#167; 228(a)(1) that is not covered by the guideline.<br />Second, this amendment updates and corrects the background commentary of &#167;2C1.4, the<br />guideline that covers offenses involving unlawful compensation for federal employees and<br />bank officials. Currently the background commentary states that 18 U.S.C. &#167; 209 (involving<br />the unlawful supplementation of the salary of various federal employees) and 18 U.S.C.<br />&#167;1909 (prohibiting bank examiners from performing any service for compensation for banks<br />or bank officials) both are misdemeanors for which the maximum term of imprisonment is<br />one year. In fact, however, as a result of enacted legislation, the maximum term of<br />imprisonment for violations of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 209 is now five years if the conduct is willful.<br />The amendment deletes the sentence of the commentary that describes the maximum term<br />of imprisonment for these offenses.</td><td>Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1998.</td></tr><tr><td class="n">590</td><td>Amendment 590</td><td>Appendix A (Statutory Index) is amended in the line referenced to "18 U.S.C.<br />&#167; 924(i)" by striking " 2A1.1, 2A1.2" and inserting "2K2.1";<br />by striking:<br />"18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(j)-(n) 2K2.1",<br />and inserting:<br />"18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(j)(1) 2A1.1, 2A1.2",<br />November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II Amendment 589<br /><br />"18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(j)(2) 2A1.3, 2A1.4",<br />"18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(k)-(o) 2K2.1";<br />and by inserting, after the line referenced to "18 U.S.C. &#167; 2252" the following new line:<br />"18 U.S.C. &#167; 2252A 2G2.2, 2G2.4".</td><td>Reason for Amendment: This amendment updates the Statutory Index by adding a<br />reference to a recently created offense (pertaining to the use of a computer to commit certain<br />child pornography offenses) and by correcting the references to a number of firearms<br />offenses in response to congressional redesignations of those offenses.<br />Specifically, Congress recently enacted 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2252A, which makes it unlawful to<br />traffic in, receive, or possess child pornography, including by computer. The amendment<br />references this offense to &#167;2G2.2 (trafficking in child pornography) and &#167;2G2.4 (possession<br />of child pornography).<br />In addition, in the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, Pub. L.<br />103–322, and the Economic Espionage Act of 1996, Pub. L. 104-294, Congress redesignated<br />a number of firearms provisions in 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924. The amendment changes the references<br />in the Statutory Index to a number of these offenses in response to the congressional<br />redesignations.</td><td>Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 1998.</td></tr><tr><td class="n">591</td><td>Amendment 591</td><td>Chapter Two, Part B, Subpart 5 is amended by striking &#167;2B5.3 in its entirety<br />as follows:<br />"&#167;2B5.3.

Such violations are similar to copyright offenses and are therefore covered by this<br />guideline.".<br />A replacement guideline with accompanying commentary is inserted as &#167;2B5.3 (Criminal<br />Infringement of Copyright or Trademark).</td><td>Reason for Amendment: This amendment is in response to section 2(g) of the No<br />Electronic Theft (NET) Act of 1997, Pub. L. 105–147 ("the Act"). The Act directs the<br />Commission to ensure that the applicable guideline range for intellectual property offenses<br />(including offenses set forth at section 506(a) of title 17, United States Code, and sections<br />2319, 2319A, and 2320 of title 18, United States Code) is "sufficiently stringent to deter such<br />a crime." It also more specifically requires that the guidelines "provide for consideration of<br />the retail value and quantity of the items with respect to which the intellectual property<br />offense was committed."<br />The amendment responds to the directives, first, by making changes to the monetary<br />calculation found in the copyright and trademark infringement guideline, &#167;2B5.3. In<br />addition, the amendment makes a number of other modifications to the infringement<br />guideline, including the addition of several mitigating and aggravating factors, as further<br />means of providing just and proportionate punishment while also seeking to achieve<br />sufficient deterrence.<br />The monetary calculation in &#167;2B5.3(b)(1), similar to the loss enhancement in the theft and<br />fraud guidelines, serves as an approximation of the pecuniary harm caused by the offense<br />and is a principal factor in determining the offense level for intellectual property offenses.<br />Prior to this amendment, the monetary calculation for all intellectual property crimes was<br />based on the retail value of the infringing item multiplied by the quantity of infringing items.<br />In response to the directive, the Commission refashioned this enhancement so as to use the<br />retail value of the infringed item, multiplied by the number of infringing items, as a means<br />of approximating the pecuniary harm for cases in which that calculation is believed most<br />likely to provide a reasonable estimate of the resulting harm. Use of that calculation is<br />believed to provide a reasonable approximation for those classes of infringement cases in<br />which it is highly likely that the sale of an infringing item results in a displaced sale of the<br />legitimate, infringed item. The amendment also requires that the retail value of the infringed<br />item, multiplied by the number of infringing items, be used in certain other cases for reasons<br />of practicality.<br />However, based upon a review of cases sentenced under the former &#167;2B5.3 over two years,<br />the Commission further determined that using the above formula likely would overstate<br />substantially the pecuniary harm caused to copyright and trademark owners in some cases<br />currently sentenced under the guideline. For those cases, a one-to-one correlation between<br />the sale of infringing items and the displaced sale of legitimate, infringed items is unlikely<br />because the inferior quality of the infringing item and/or the greatly discounted price at<br />which it is sold suggests that many purchasers of infringing items would not, or could not,<br />have purchased the infringed item in the absence of the availability of the infringing item.<br />November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II Amendment 590<br /><br />The Commission therefore determined that, for these latter classes of cases (referred to in<br />Application Note 2(B)), the retail value of the infringing item, multiplied by the number of<br />those items, provides a more reasonable approximation of lost revenues to the copyright or<br />trademark owner, and hence, of the pecuniary harm resulting from the offense.<br />This amendment also increases the base offense level from level 6 to level 8. The two-level<br />increase in the base offense level brings the infringement guideline more in line with offense<br />levels that would pertain under the fraud guideline, &#167;2F1.1, assuming applicability under that<br />guideline of the two-level enhancement for more than minimal planning. Based on a review<br />of cases sentenced under the infringement guideline, if a more than minimal planning<br />enhancement did exist in that guideline, it would apply in the vast majority of such cases<br />because they involve this kind of aggravating conduct. Rather than provide a separate<br />enhancement within the revised guideline for "more than minimal planning" conduct, the<br />Commission determined that the infringement guideline should incorporate this type of<br />conduct into the base offense level.<br />This amendment also provides an enhancement of two levels, and a minimum offense level<br />of level 12, if the offense involved the manufacture, importation, or uploading of infringing<br />items. The Commission determined that defendants who engage in such conduct are more<br />culpable than other intellectual property offenders because they place infringing items into<br />the stream of commerce, thereby enabling others to infringe the copyright or trademark. A<br />review of cases sentenced under the guideline indicated applicability of this enhancement<br />to approximately two-thirds of the cases.<br />This amendment also provides a two-level downward adjustment (but not less than offense<br />level 8) if the offense was not committed for commercial advantage or private financial gain.<br />This adjustment reflects the fact that the Act establishes lower statutory penalties for offenses<br />that were not committed for commercial advantage or private financial gain.<br />This amendment also provides an enhancement of two levels, and a minimum offense level<br />of level 13, if the offense involved the conscious or reckless risk of serious bodily injury or<br />possession of a dangerous weapon in connection with the offense. Testimony received by<br />the Commission indicated that the conscious or reckless risk of serious bodily injury may<br />occur in some cases involving counterfeit consumer products. The Commission determined<br />that this kind of aggravating conduct in connection with infringement cases should be treated<br />under the guidelines in the same way it is treated in connection with fraud cases; therefore,<br />this enhancement is consistent with an identical provision in the fraud guideline.<br />The amendment also contains an application note expressly providing that the adjustment<br />in &#167;3B1.3 (Abuse of Position of Trust or Use of Special Skill) will apply if the defendant de-<br />encrypted or otherwise circumvented a technological security measure to gain initial access<br />to an infringed item. As stated in the background commentary to &#167;3B1.3, persons who use<br />such a special skill to facilitate or commit a crime generally are viewed as more culpable.<br />Finally, this amendment contains two encouraged upward departure provisions. The<br />Commission received public comment that indicated that infringement may cause substantial<br />harm to the reputation of the copyright or trademark owner that is not accounted for in the<br />monetary calculation. Public comment also indicated that some copyright and trademark<br />offenses are committed in connection with, or in furtherance of, the criminal activities of<br />certain organized crime enterprises. The amendment invites the court to consider an<br />appropriate upward departure if either of these aggravating circumstances are present.<br />Amendment 590 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003</td><td>Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is May 1, 2000.</td></tr><tr><td class="n">592</td><td>Amendment 592</td><td>Section 1B1.1 is amended by striking subsection (a) in its entirety and<br />inserting:<br />"(a) Determine, pursuant to &#167;1B1.2 (Applicable Guidelines), the offense<br />guideline section from Chapter Two (Offense Conduct) applicable to the<br />offense of conviction.

Compare United States v. Chandler, 125 F.3d 892, 897-98<br />(5th Cir. 1997) ("First, utilizing the Statutory Index located in Appendix A, the court<br />determines the offense guideline section ‘most applicable to the offense of conviction.’"<br />Once the appropriate guideline is identified, a court can take relevant conduct into account<br />only as it relates to factors set forth in that guideline); United States v.

"[S]ection 2D1.2 is intended<br />not to identify a specific offense characteristic which would, where applicable, increase the<br />offense level over the base level assigned by &#167;2D1.1, but rather to define the base offense<br />level for violations of 21 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 859, 860 and 861."); United States v. Saavedra, 148 F.3d<br />1311 (11th Cir. 1998) (defendant’s uncharged but relevant conduct is actually irrelevant to<br />determining the sentencing guideline applicable to the defendant’s offense; such conduct is<br />properly considered only after the applicable guideline has been selected when the court is<br />analyzing the various sentencing considerations within the guideline chosen, such as the base<br />offense level, specific offense characteristics, and any cross references), with United States<br />v.

Oppedahl, 998 F.2d 584 (8th<br />Cir. 1993) (applying &#167;2D1.2 to defendant convicted of conspiracy to distribute and possess<br />Amendment 591 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003<br /><br />with intent to distribute based on fact that defendant’s relevant conduct involved distribution<br />within 1,000 feet of a school); United States v.

Pa), aff’d<br />(unpub.), 8 F.3d 814 (3d Cir. 1993) (looking to relevant conduct to determine appropriate<br />guideline).<br />In promulgating this amendment, the Commission also was aware of case law that raises a<br />similar issue regarding selection of a Chapter Two (Offense Conduct) guideline, different<br />from that referenced in the Statutory Index (Appendix A), based on factors other than the<br />conduct charged in the offense of conviction. See United States v. Smith, 186 F.3d 290 (3d<br />Cir. 1999) (determining that &#167;2F1.1 (Fraud and Deceit) was most appropriate guideline<br />rather than the listed guideline of &#167;2S1.1 (Laundering of Monetary Instruments)); United<br />States v. Brunson, 882 F. 2d 151, 157 (5th Cir. 1989) ("It is not completely clear to us under<br />what circumstances the Commission contemplated deviation from the suggested guidelines<br />for an ‘atypical’ case.").<br />The amendment modifies &#167;&#167;1B1.1(a), 1B1.2(a), and the Statutory Index’s introductory<br />commentary to clarify the inter-relationship among these provisions. The clarification is<br />intended to emphasize that the sentencing court must apply the offense guideline referenced<br />in the Statutory Index for the statute of conviction unless the case falls within the limited<br />"stipulation" exception set forth in &#167;1B1.2(a). Therefore, in order for the enhanced penalties<br />in &#167;2D1.2 to apply, the defendant must be convicted of an offense referenced to &#167;2D1.2,<br />rather than simply have engaged in conduct described by that guideline. Furthermore, the<br />amendment deletes Application Note 3 of &#167;1B1.2 (Applicable Guidelines), which provided<br />that in many instances it would be appropriate for the court to consider the actual conduct<br />of the offender, even if such conduct did not constitute an element of the offense. This<br />application note describes a consideration that is more appropriate when applying &#167;1B1.3<br />(Relevant Conduct), and its current placement in &#167;1B1.2 apparently has caused confusion<br />in applying that guideline’s principles to determine the offense conduct guideline in Chapter<br />Two most appropriate for the offense of conviction. In particular, the note has been used by<br />some courts to permit a court to decline to use the offense guideline referenced in the<br />Statutory Index in cases that were allegedly "atypical" or "outside the heartland."

If the defendant’s criminal history includes a prior sentence for conduct that<br />is similar to the instant offense, an upward departure may be warranted.<br />Background: This section applies to offenses involving the criminal sexual abuse<br />of an individual who had not attained the age of 16 years.

A<br />two-level enhancement is provided in subsection (b)(2) for such cases. It is assumed<br />that at least a four-year age difference exists between the victim and the defendant,<br />as specified in 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2243(a).

If the offense<br />involved criminal sexual abuse of a minor who<br />had not attained the age of 12 years, &#167;2A3.1 shall<br />apply, regardless of the ‘consent’ of the victim.<br />(3) If the offense did not involve promoting<br />prostitution, and neither subsection (c)(1) nor<br />(c)(2) is applicable, apply &#167;2A3.2 (Criminal<br />Sexual Abuse of a Minor Under the Age of<br />Sixteen Years (Statutory Rape) or Attempt to<br />Commit Such Acts) or &#167;2A3.4 (Abusive Sexual<br />Contact or Attempt to Commit Abusive Sexual<br />Contact), as appropriate.<br />(d) Special Instruction<br />(1) If the offense involved more than one victim,<br />Chapter Three, Part D (Multiple Counts) shall be<br />applied as if the promoting of prostitution or<br />prohibited sexual conduct in respect to each victim<br />had been contained in a separate count of<br />conviction.<br />Commentary<br />Statutory Provisions: 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1328; 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2421, 2422, 2423(a), 2425.<br />Application Notes:<br />1. For purposes of this guideline—<br />‘Minor’ means an individual who had not attained the age of 18 years.<br />‘Participant’ has the meaning given that term in Application Note 1 of<br />&#167;3B1.1 (Aggravating Role).<br />Amendment 592 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003<br /><br />‘Prohibited sexual conduct’ has the meaning given that term in Application<br />Note 1 of &#167;2A3.1 (Criminal Sexual Abuse; Attempt to Commit Criminal<br />Sexual Abuse).<br />‘Promoting prostitution’ means persuading, inducing, enticing, or coercing<br />a person to engage in prostitution, or to travel to engage in, prostitution.<br />‘Victim’ means a person transported, persuaded, induced, enticed, or<br />coerced to engage in, or travel for the purpose of engaging in, prostitution<br />or prohibited sexual conduct, whether or not the person consented to the<br />prostitution or prohibited sexual conduct. Accordingly, ‘victim’ may<br />include an undercover law enforcement officer.<br />2. Subsection (b)(1) provides an enhancement for physical force, or coercion,<br />that occurs as part of a prostitution offense and anticipates no bodily injury.<br />If bodily injury results, an upward departure may be warranted. See<br />Chapter Five, Part K (Departures). For purposes of subsection (b)(1),<br />‘coercion’ includes any form of conduct that negates the voluntariness of<br />the behavior of the victim. This enhancement would apply, for example, in<br />a case in which the ability of the victim to appraise or control conduct was<br />substantially impaired by drugs or alcohol. In the case of an adult victim,<br />rather than a victim less than 18 years of age, this characteristic generally<br />will not apply if the drug or alcohol was voluntarily taken.<br />3. For the purposes of &#167;3B1.1 (Aggravating Role), a victim, as defined in this<br />guideline, is considered a participant only if that victim assisted in the<br />promoting of prostitution or prohibited sexual conduct in respect to another<br />victim.<br />4. For the purposes of Chapter Three, Part D (Multiple Counts), each person<br />transported, persuaded, induced, enticed, or coerced to engage in, or travel<br />to engage in, prostitution or prohibited sexual conduct is to be treated as a<br />separate victim. Consequently, multiple counts involving more than one<br />victim are not to be grouped together under &#167;3D1.2 (Groups of Closely-<br />Related Counts). In addition, subsection (d)(1) directs that if the relevant<br />conduct of an offense of conviction includes the promoting of prostitution<br />or prohibited sexual conduct in respect to more than one victim, whether<br />specifically cited in the count of conviction, each such victim shall be<br />treated as if contained in a separate count of conviction.<br />5. Subsection (b)(3) is intended to have broad application and includes<br />offenses involving a victim less than 18 years of age entrusted to the<br />defendant, whether temporarily or permanently. For example, teachers, day<br />care providers, baby-sitters, or other temporary caretakers are among those<br />who would be subject to this enhancement. In determining whether to<br />apply this enhancement, the court should look to the actual relationship that<br />existed between the defendant and the victim and not simply to the legal<br />status of the defendant-victim relationship.<br />6. If the enhancement in subsection (b)(3) applies, do not apply subsection<br />November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II Amendment 592<br /><br />(b)(4) or &#167;3B1.3 (Abuse of Position of Trust or Use of Special Skill).<br />7. The enhancement in subsection (b)(4)(A) applies in cases involving the<br />misrepresentation of a participant’s identity to persuade, induce, entice,<br />coerce, or facilitate the travel of, a minor to engage in prostitution.<br />Subsection (b)(4)(A) is intended to apply only to misrepresentations made<br />directly to a minor or to a person who exercises custody, care, or<br />supervisory control of the minor. Accordingly, the enhancement in<br />subsection (b)(4)(A) would not apply to a misrepresentation made by a<br />participant to an airline representative in the course of making travel<br />arrangements for the minor.<br />The misrepresentation to which the enhancement in subsection (b)(4)(A)<br />may apply includes misrepresentation of a participant’s name, age,<br />occupation, gender, or status, as long as the misrepresentation was made<br />with the intent to persuade, induce, entice, coerce, or facilitate the travel of,<br />a minor to engage in prostitution. Accordingly, use of a computer screen<br />name, without such intent, would not be a sufficient basis for application of<br />the enhancement.<br />In determining whether subsection (b)(4)(B) applies, the court should<br />closely consider the facts of the case to determine whether a participant’s<br />influence over the minor compromised the voluntariness of the minor’s<br />behavior.<br />In a case in which a participant is at least 10 years older than the minor,<br />there shall be a rebuttable presumption, for purposes of subsection<br />(b)(4)(B), that such participant unduly influenced the minor to engage in<br />prostitution. In such a case, some degree of undue influence can be<br />presumed because of the substantial difference in age between the<br />participant and the minor.<br />8. Subsection (b)(5) provides an enhancement if a computer or an Internet-<br />access device was used to (A) persuade, induce, entice, coerce, or facilitate<br />the travel of, a minor to engage in prostitution; or (B) entice, encourage,<br />offer, or solicit a person to engage in prohibited sexual conduct with a<br />minor. Subsection (b)(5)(A) is intended to apply only to the use of a<br />computer or an Internet-access device to communicate directly with a minor<br />or with a person who exercises custody, care, or supervisory control of the<br />minor. Accordingly, the enhancement in subsection (b)(5)(A) would not<br />apply to the use of a computer or an Internet-access device to obtain airline<br />tickets for the minor from an airline’s Internet site.<br />9. The cross reference in subsection (c)(1) is to be construed broadly to<br />include all instances in which the offense involved employing, using,<br />persuading, inducing, enticing, coercing, transporting, permitting, or<br />offering or seeking by notice or advertisement, a person less than 18 years<br />of age to engage in sexually explicit conduct for the purpose of producing<br />any visual depiction of such conduct. For purposes of subsection (c)(1),<br />‘sexually explicit conduct’ has the meaning given that term in 18 U.S.C.<br />Amendment 592 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003<br /><br />&#167; 2256.<br />10. Subsection (c)(2) provides a cross reference to &#167;2A3.1 (Criminal Sexual<br />Abuse; Attempt to Commit Criminal Sexual Abuse) if the offense involved<br />criminal sexual abuse or attempt to commit criminal sexual abuse, as<br />defined in 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2241 or &#167; 2242. For example, the cross reference to<br />&#167;2A3.1 shall apply if the offense involved criminal sexual abuse; and (A)<br />the victim had not attained the age of 12 years (see 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2241(c));<br />(B) the victim had attained the age of 12 years but had not attained the age<br />of 16 years, and was placed in fear of death, serious bodily injury, or<br />kidnaping (see 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2241(a),(c)); or (C) the victim was threatened<br />or placed in fear other than fear of death, serious bodily injury, or kidnaping<br />(see 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2242(1)).<br />11. The cross reference in subsection (c)(3) addresses the case in which the<br />offense did not involve promoting prostitution, neither subsection (c)(1) nor<br />(c)(2) is applicable, and the offense involved prohibited sexual conduct<br />other than the conduct covered by subsection (c)(1) or (c)(2). In such case,<br />the guideline for the underlying prohibited sexual conduct is to be used; i.e.,<br />&#167;2A3.2 (Criminal Sexual Abuse of a Minor Under the Age of Sixteen Years<br />(Statutory Rape) or Attempt to Commit Such Acts) or &#167;2A3.4 (Abusive<br />Sexual Contact or Attempt to Commit Abusive Sexual Contact).<br />Background: This guideline covers offenses under chapter 117 of title 18, United<br />States Code. Those offenses involve promoting prostitution or prohibited sexual<br />conduct through a variety of means. Offenses that involve promoting prostitution<br />under chapter 117 of such title are sentenced under this guideline, unless other<br />prohibited sexual conduct occurs as part of the prostitution offense, in which case<br />one of the cross references would apply. Offenses under chapter 117 of such title<br />that do not involve promoting prostitution are to be sentenced under &#167;2G2.1<br />(Sexually Exploiting a Minor by Production of Sexually Explicit Visual or Printed<br />Material; Custodian Permitting Minor to Engage in Sexually Explicit Conduct;<br />Advertisement for Minors to Engage in Production), &#167;2A3.1 (Criminal Sexual<br />Abuse; Attempt to Commit Criminal Sexual Abuse), &#167;2A3.2 (Criminal Sexual<br />Abuse of a Minor Under the Age of Sixteen Years (Statutory Rape) or Attempt to<br />Commit Such Acts) or &#167;2A3.4 (Abusive Sexual Contact or Attempt to Commit<br />Abusive Sexual Contact), as appropriate, pursuant to the cross references provided<br />in subsection (c).".<br />Section 2G2.1(b) is amended by striking subdivision (3) in its entirety and inserting the<br />following:<br />"(3) If, for the purpose of producing sexually explicit material, the offense<br />involved (A) the knowing misrepresentation of a participant’s identity to<br />persuade, induce, entice, coerce, or facilitate the travel of, a minor to engage<br />sexually explicit conduct; or (B) the use of a computer or an Internet-access<br />device to (i) persuade, induce, entice, coerce, or facilitate the travel of, a<br />minor to engage in sexually explicit conduct, or to otherwise solicit<br />participation by a minor in such conduct; or (ii) solicit participation with<br />a minor in sexually explicit conduct, increase by 2 levels.".<br />November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II Amendment 592<br /><br />The Commentary to &#167;2G2.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by redesignating<br />Notes 1 through 3 as Notes 2 through 4, respectively; by inserting before redesignated Note<br />2 (formerly Note 1) the following:<br />"1.

".<br />The Commentary to &#167;2G3.2 captioned "Background" is amended by inserting "; Transferring<br />Obscene Matter to a Minor" after "Transporting Obscene Matter".<br />Appendix A (Statutory Index) is amended by inserting after the line referenced to "18 U.S.C.<br />&#167; 1468" the following new line:<br />"18 U.S.C. &#167; 1470 2G3.1";<br />and by inserting after the line referenced to "18 U.S.C. &#167; 2423(b)" the following new line:<br />"18 U.S.C. &#167; 2425 2G1.1".</td><td>Reason for Amendment: This is a six-part amendment. The amendment is promulgated<br />primarily in response to the Protection of Children from Sexual Predators Act of 1998, Pub.<br />L. 105–314 (the "Act"), which contained several directives to the Commission.<br />First, the amendment addresses the Act’s directives to provide enhancements to the<br />guidelines covering aggravated sexual abuse, sexual abuse, and sexual abuse of a minor if<br />(1) the defendant used a computer with the intent to persuade, induce, entice, coerce, or<br />facilitate the transport of a minor to engage in any prohibited sexual activity; and (2) the<br />defendant knowingly misrepresented the defendant’s actual identity with the intent to<br />persuade, induce, entice, coerce, or facilitate the transport of a minor to engage in any<br />November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II Amendment 592<br /><br />prohibited sexual conduct. The legislative history of the Act indicates congressional intent<br />to ensure that persons who misrepresent themselves to a minor, or use computers or Internet-<br />access devices to locate and gain access to a minor, are severely punished.<br />In response to these directives, the amendment provides separate, cumulative two-level<br />enhancements in the sexual abuse guidelines, &#167;&#167;2A3.2 (Criminal Sexual Abuse of a Minor<br />Under the Age of Sixteen Years (Statutory Rape) or Attempt to Commit Such Acts), 2A3.3<br />(Criminal Sexual Abuse of a Ward), and 2A3.4 (Abusive Sexual Contact), and in &#167;2G1.1<br />(Promoting Prostitution or Prohibited Sexual Conduct) for (1) the use of a computer or<br />Internet-access device with the intent to persuade, induce, entice, coerce, or facilitate the<br />transport of a minor to engage in any prohibited sexual conduct; and (2) misrepresentation<br />of a criminally responsible person’s identity with such an intent. The Commission has<br />determined that, for offenses sentenced under these guidelines, the use of a computer or<br />Internet-access device and the misrepresentation of identity represent separate, additional<br />harms and increase the culpability of a defendant or criminal participant who engages, or<br />attempts to engage, in such conduct. With respect to &#167;&#167;2A3.1 (Criminal Sexual Abuse;<br />Attempt to Commit Criminal Sexual Abuse) and 2G2.1 (Sexually Exploiting a Minor by<br />Production of Sexually Explicit Visual or Printed Material), the amendment treats these two<br />types of aggravating conduct as alternative triggers for one enhancement. In these<br />guidelines, the substantially higher base offense levels and other specific offense<br />characteristics provide alternative guideline mechanisms to account, at least in part, for these<br />harms and the defendant’s increased culpability. Accordingly, the Commission determined<br />that, in these guidelines, a single, two-level increase for the use of a computer or<br />misrepresentation adequately addresses the increased seriousness of these offenses.<br />Second, this amendment responds to the directive in the Act to provide a sentencing<br />enhancement for offenses under chapter 117 of title 18, United States Code (relating to the<br />transportation of minors for illegal sexual activity), while ensuring that the sentences,<br />guidelines, and policy statements for offenders convicted of such offenses are appropriately<br />severe and reasonably consistent with the other relevant directives and the relevant existing<br />guidelines. In furtherance of this directive, the Commission initiated a comprehensive<br />examination of &#167;&#167;2A3.2 and 2G1.1, the guidelines under which most cases prosecuted under<br />such chapter are sentenced. The Commission intends to continue its comprehensive review<br />of these guidelines and other guidelines that cover chapter 117 offenses in the next<br />amendment cycle.<br />The amendment implements the directive to provide an enhancement for chapter 117<br />offenses, in part, through the enhancements provided in &#167;&#167;2A3.2 and 2G1.1 for<br />misrepresentation of identity and use of a computer to facilitate such offenses. In addition,<br />the amendment provides an alternative basis for a sentencing enhancement if a participant<br />otherwise unduly influenced the victim to engage in prohibited sexual conduct. Despite the<br />fact that &#167;2A3.2 nominally applies to consensual sexual acts with a person who had not<br />attained the age of 16 years, Commission data indicated that many of the cases sentenced<br />under &#167;2A3.2, directly or via a cross reference from &#167;2G1.1, involve some aspect of undue<br />influence over the victim on the part of the defendant or other criminally responsible person.<br />Analysis of these cases revealed conduct such as coercion, enticement, or other forms of<br />undue influence by the defendant that compromised the voluntariness of the victim’s<br />behavior and, accordingly, increased the defendant’s culpability for the crime. This prong<br />of the new enhancement is designed to allow courts to consider closely the facts of the<br />individual case. Furthermore, a rebuttable presumption is created that the offense involved<br />Amendment 592 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003<br /><br />undue influence if a participant was at least 10 years older than the victim. Data reviewed<br />by the Commission suggested that such a presumption is appropriate because persons who<br />are much older than a minor are frequently in a position to manipulate the minor due to<br />increased knowledge, influence, and resources.<br />As a result of the Commission’s comprehensive assessment of &#167;&#167;2A3.2 and 2G1.1, the<br />amendment also makes several other modifications to these guidelines. The amendment<br />provides, in &#167;2A3.2, an alternative base offense level of level 18 if the offense involved a<br />violation of chapter 117 of title 18, United States Code. This alternative base offense level<br />more fully implements a directive in the Sex Crimes Against Children Prevention Act of<br />1995, Pub. L. 104–71, to provide at least a three-level increase for offenses under 18 U.S.C.<br />&#167; 2423(a) involving the transportation of minors for prostitution or other prohibited sexual<br />conduct. However, the amendment also provides for a three-level decrease if a defendant<br />receives the higher alternative base offense level of level 18 and none of certain listed<br />aggravating specific offense characteristics apply. This reduction recognizes that not all<br />defendants convicted under chapter 117 have necessarily engaged in a more aggravated form<br />of statutory rape conduct. The amendment also adds several definitions to &#167;2A3.2, including<br />clarifying that "victim" includes an undercover police officer who represents to the<br />perpetrator of the offense that the officer was under the age of 16 years. This change was<br />made to ensure that offenders who are apprehended in an undercover operation are<br />appropriately punished. In &#167;2G1.1, the amendment reallocates, without substantive change,<br />five offense levels from subsection (b)(2) to the base offense level, for offenses involving<br />a minor. Section 2G1.1(b)(1) also is amended to clarify that the offense must have involved<br />prostitution in order for the enhancement for coercion, threats, or drugs to apply. The<br />amendment also clarifies that, in &#167;&#167;2A3.2(c)(1) and 2G1.1(c)(2), the cross reference to<br />&#167;2A3.1 shall apply if the offense involved criminal sexual abuse of a minor under the age<br />of 12 years, regardless of the "consent" of the victim. Review of Commission data indicated<br />that the cross reference to &#167;2A3.1 currently is not being applied in many cases in which the<br />offense conduct suggests it should. In both &#167;&#167;2A3.2 and 2G1.1, the amendment also<br />precludes application of the new enhancement for misrepresentation of identity and/or undue<br />influence if the victim is in the custody, care, or supervisory control of the defendant.<br />Third, the amendment addresses the directive in the Act to clarify that the term "distribution<br />of pornography" applies to the distribution of pornography for both monetary remuneration<br />and a non-pecuniary interest. In response to the directive, the amendment modifies the<br />enhancement in &#167;2G2.2 (Trafficking in Material Involving the Sexual Exploitation of a<br />Minor), relating to the distribution of child pornographic material, as well as a similar<br />enhancement in &#167;2G3.1 (Importing, Mailing, or Transporting Obscene Matter; Transferring<br />Obscene Matter to a Minor), relating to the distribution of obscene material. For each of<br />these enhancements, the amendment (1) modifies the definition of "distribution" to mean any<br />act, including production, transportation, and possession with intent to distribute, related to<br />the transfer of the material, regardless of whether it was for pecuniary gain; and (2) provides<br />for varying levels of enhancement depending upon the purpose and audience of the<br />distribution. These varying levels are intended to respond to increased congressional<br />concerns, as indicated in the legislative history of the Act, that pedophiles, including those<br />who use the Internet, are using child pornographic and obscene material to desensitize<br />children to sexual activity, to convince children that sexual activity involving children is<br />normal, and to entice children to engage in sexual activity.<br />Fourth, the amendment clarifies the meaning of the term "item" in subsection (b)(2) of<br /><br />&#167;2G2.4 (Possession of Materials Depicting a Minor Engaged in Sexually Explicit Conduct).<br />That subsection provides a two-level enhancement if the offense involved possession of ten<br />or more items of child pornography. The amendment adopts the holding of all circuits that<br />have addressed the matter that a computer file qualifies as an item for purposes of the<br />enhancement. The amendment also provides for an invited upward departure if the offense<br />involves a large number of visual depictions of child pornography, regardless of the number<br />of "items" involved. This provision invites courts to depart upward in cases in which a<br />particular item, such as a book or a computer file, contains an unusually large number of<br />pornographic images involving children.<br />Fifth, the amendment addresses the new offense of transferring obscene matter to a minor,<br />codified at 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1470, by referencing the offense in the Statutory Index (Appendix<br />A) to &#167;2G3.1.<br />Sixth, the amendment addresses the new offense of prohibiting the knowing transmittal of<br />identifying information about minors for criminal sexual purposes, codified at 18 U.S.C.<br />&#167; 2425, by referencing the new offense in the Statutory Index to &#167;2G1.1.</td><td>Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2000.</td></tr><tr><td class="n">594</td><td>Amendment 594</td><td>Section 2B5.3, effective May 1, 2000 (see Amendment 590, supra), is<br />repromulgated, with minor editorial changes, as follows:<br />"&#167;2B5.3.

For<br />additional statutory provision(s), see Appendix A (Statutory Index).<br />Application Notes:<br />1. Definitions.—For purposes of this guideline:<br />‘Commercial advantage or private financial gain’ means the receipt, or<br />expectation of receipt, of anything of value, including other protected<br />works.<br />‘Infringed item’ means the copyrighted or trademarked item with respect to<br />which the crime against intellectual property was committed.<br />‘Infringing item’ means the item that violates the copyright or trademark<br />laws.<br />‘Uploading’ means making an infringing item available on the Internet or<br />a similar electronic bulletin board with the intent to enable other persons to<br />download or otherwise copy, or have access to, the infringing item.<br />2. Determination of Infringement Amount.—This note applies to the<br />determination of the infringement amount for purposes of subsection (b)(1).<br />(A) Use of Retail Value of Infringed Item.—The infringement amount<br />is the retail value of the infringed item, multiplied by the number<br />of infringing items, in a case involving any of the following:<br />(i) The infringing item (I) is, or appears to a reasonably<br />informed purchaser to be, identical or substantially<br />equivalent to the infringed item; or (II) is a digital or<br />electronic reproduction of the infringed item.<br />(ii) The retail price of the infringing item is not less than 75%<br />of the retail price of the infringed item.<br />(iii) The retail value of the infringing item is difficult or<br />impossible to determine without unduly complicating or<br />prolonging the sentencing proceeding.<br />(iv) The offense involves the illegal interception of a satellite<br />cable transmission in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2511. (In a<br />case involving such an offense, the ‘retail value of the<br />infringed item’ is the price the user of the transmission<br />would have paid to lawfully receive that transmission, and<br />the ‘infringed item’ is the satellite transmission rather than<br />the intercepting device.)<br />November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II Amendment 593<br /><br />(v) The retail value of the infringed item provides a more<br />accurate assessment of the pecuniary harm to the copyright<br />or trademark owner than does the retail value of the<br />infringing item.<br />(B) Use of Retail Value of Infringing Item.—The infringement amount<br />is the retail value of the infringing item, multiplied by the number<br />of infringing items, in any case not covered by subdivision (A) of<br />this Application Note, including a case involving the unlawful<br />recording of a musical performance in violation of 18 U.S.C.<br />&#167; 2319A.<br />(C) Retail Value Defined.—For purposes of this Application Note, the<br />‘retail value’ of an infringed item or an infringing item is the retail<br />price of that item in the market in which it is sold.<br />(D) Determination of Infringement Amount in Cases Involving a<br />Variety of Infringing Items.—In a case involving a variety of<br />infringing items, the infringement amount is the sum of all<br />calculations made for those items under subdivisions (A) and (B)<br />of this Application Note. For example, if the defendant sold both<br />counterfeit videotapes that are identical in quality to the infringed<br />videotapes and obviously inferior counterfeit handbags, the<br />infringement amount, for purposes of subsection (b)(1), is the sum<br />of the infringement amount calculated with respect to the<br />counterfeit videotapes under subdivision (A)(i) (i.e., the quantity of<br />the infringing videotapes multiplied by the retail value of the<br />infringed videotapes) and the infringement amount calculated with<br />respect to the counterfeit handbags under subdivision (B) (i.e., the<br />quantity of the infringing handbags multiplied by the retail value<br />of the infringing handbags).<br />3. Uploading.—With respect to uploading, subsection (b)(2) applies only to<br />uploading with the intent to enable other persons to download or otherwise<br />copy, or have access to, the infringing item. For example, this subsection<br />applies in the case of illegally uploading copyrighted software to an Internet<br />site, but it does not apply in the case of downloading or installing that<br />software on a hard drive on the defendant’s personal computer.<br />4. Application of &#167;3B1.3.—If the defendant de-encrypted or otherwise<br />circumvented a technological security measure to gain initial access to an<br />infringed item, an adjustment under &#167;3B1.3 (Abuse of Position of Trust or<br />Use of Special Skill) shall apply.<br />5. Upward Departure Considerations.—If the offense level determined under<br />this guideline substantially understates the seriousness of the offense, an<br />upward departure may be warranted. The following is a non-exhaustive list<br />of factors that the court may consider in determining whether an upward<br />departure may be warranted:<br />Amendment 593 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003<br /><br />(A) The offense involved substantial harm to the reputation of the<br />copyright or trademark owner.<br />(B) The offense was committed in connection with, or in furtherance<br />of, the criminal activities of a national, or international, organized<br />criminal enterprise.<br />Background: This guideline treats copyright and trademark violations much like<br />theft and fraud. Similar to the sentences for theft and fraud offenses, the sentences<br />for defendants convicted of intellectual property offenses should reflect the nature<br />and magnitude of the pecuniary harm caused by their crimes. Accordingly, similar<br />to the loss enhancement in the theft and fraud guidelines, the infringement amount<br />in subsection (b)(1) serves as a principal factor in determining the offense level for<br />intellectual property offenses.<br />Subsection (b)(1) implements section 2(g) of the No Electronic Theft (NET)<br />Act of 1997, Pub. L. 105–147, by using the retail value of the infringed item,<br />multiplied by the number of infringing items, to determine the pecuniary harm for<br />cases in which use of the retail value of the infringed item is a reasonable estimate<br />of that harm. For cases referred to in Application Note 2(B), the Commission<br />determined that use of the retail value of the infringed item would overstate the<br />pecuniary harm or otherwise be inappropriate. In these types of cases, use of the<br />retail value of the infringing item, multiplied by the number of those items, is a more<br />reasonable estimate of the resulting pecuniary harm.<br />Section 2511 of title 18, United States Code, as amended by the Electronic<br />Communications Act of 1986, prohibits the interception of satellite transmission for<br />purposes of direct or indirect commercial advantage or private financial gain. Such<br />violations are similar to copyright offenses and are therefore covered by this<br />guideline.".</td><td>Reason for Amendment: This amendment is in response to section 2(g) of the No<br />Electronic Theft (NET) Act of 1997, Pub. L. 105–147 ("the Act"). The Act directs the<br />Commission to ensure that the applicable guideline range for intellectual property offenses<br />(including offenses set forth at section 506(a) of title 17, United States Code, and sections<br />2319, 2319A, and 2320 of title 18, United States Code) is "sufficiently stringent to deter such<br />a crime." It also more specifically requires that the guidelines "provide for consideration of<br />the retail value and quantity of the items with respect to which the intellectual property<br />offense was committed."<br />The amendment responds to the directives by making changes to the monetary calculation<br />found in &#167;2B5.3 (Criminal Infringement of Copyright or Trademark). In addition, the<br />amendment makes a number of other modifications to the infringement guideline, including<br />the addition of several mitigating and aggravating factors, as further means of providing just<br />and proportionate punishment while also seeking to achieve sufficient deterrence.<br />The monetary calculation in &#167;2B5.3(b)(1), similar to the loss enhancement in the theft and<br />fraud guidelines, serves as an approximation of the pecuniary harm caused by the offense<br />and is a principal factor in determining the offense level for intellectual property offenses.<br />Prior to this amendment, the monetary calculation for all intellectual property crimes was<br /><br />based on the retail value of the infringing item multiplied by the quantity of infringing items.<br />In response to the directive, the Commission refashioned this enhancement so as to use the<br />retail value of the infringed item, multiplied by the number of infringing items, as a means<br />of approximating the pecuniary harm for cases in which that calculation is believed most<br />likely to provide a reasonable estimate of the resulting harm. Use of that calculation is<br />believed to provide a reasonable approximation for those classes of infringement cases in<br />which it is highly likely that the sale of an infringing item results in a displaced sale of the<br />legitimate, infringed item. The amendment also requires that the retail value of the infringed<br />item, multiplied by the number of infringing items, be used in certain other cases for reasons<br />of practicality.<br />However, based upon a review of cases sentenced under the former &#167;2B5.3 over two years,<br />the Commission further determined that using the above formula likely would overstate<br />substantially the pecuniary harm caused to copyright and trademark owners in some cases<br />currently sentenced under the guideline. For those cases, a one-to-one correlation between<br />the sale of infringing items and the displaced sale of legitimate, infringed items is unlikely<br />because the inferior quality of the infringing item and/or the greatly discounted price at<br />which it is sold suggests that many purchasers of infringing items would not, or could not,<br />have purchased the infringed item in the absence of the availability of the infringing item.<br />The Commission therefore determined that, for these latter classes of cases (referred to in<br />Application Note 2(B)), the retail value of the infringing item, multiplied by the number of<br />those items, provides a more reasonable approximation of lost revenues to the copyright or<br />trademark owner, and hence, of the pecuniary harm resulting from the offense.<br />This amendment also increases the base offense level from level 6 to level 8. The two-level<br />increase in the base offense level brings the infringement guideline more in line with offense<br />levels that would pertain under &#167;2F1.1 (Fraud and Deceit), assuming applicability under that<br />guideline of the two-level enhancement for more than minimal planning. Based on a review<br />of cases sentenced under the infringement guideline, if a more than minimal planning<br />enhancement did exist in that guideline, it would apply in the vast majority of such cases<br />because they involve this kind of aggravating conduct. Rather than provide a separate<br />enhancement within the revised guideline for "more than minimal planning" conduct, the<br />Commission determined that the infringement guideline should incorporate this type of<br />conduct into the base offense level.<br />This amendment also provides an enhancement of two levels, and a minimum offense level<br />of level 12, if the offense involved the manufacture, importation, or uploading of infringing<br />items. The Commission determined that defendants who engage in such conduct are more<br />culpable than other intellectual property offenders because they place infringing items into<br />the stream of commerce, thereby enabling others to infringe the copyright or trademark. A<br />review of cases sentenced under the guideline indicated applicability of this enhancement<br />to approximately two-thirds of the cases.<br />This amendment also provides a two-level downward adjustment (but to a resulting offense<br />level that is not less than offense level 8) if the offense was not committed for commercial<br />advantage or private financial gain. This adjustment reflects the fact that the Act establishes<br />lower statutory penalties for offenses that were not committed for commercial advantage or<br />private financial gain.<br />This amendment also provides an enhancement of two levels, and a minimum offense level<br />Amendment 593 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003<br /><br />of level 13, if the offense involved the conscious or reckless risk of serious bodily injury or<br />possession of a dangerous weapon in connection with the offense. Testimony received by<br />the Commission indicated that the conscious or reckless risk of serious bodily injury may<br />occur in some cases involving counterfeit consumer products. The Commission determined<br />that this kind of aggravating conduct in connection with infringement cases should be treated<br />under the guidelines in the same way it is treated in connection with fraud cases; therefore,<br />this enhancement is consistent with an identical provision in the fraud guideline.<br />The amendment also contains an application note expressly providing that the adjustment<br />in &#167;3B1.3 (Abuse of Position of Trust or Use of Special Skill) shall apply if the defendant<br />de-encrypted or otherwise circumvented a technological security measure to gain initial<br />access to an infringed item. As stated in the background commentary to &#167;3B1.3, persons<br />who use such a special skill to facilitate or commit a crime generally are viewed as more<br />culpable.<br />Finally, this amendment contains two encouraged upward departure provisions. The<br />Commission received public comment that indicated that infringement may cause substantial<br />harm to the reputation of the copyright or trademark owner that is not accounted for in the<br />monetary calculation.

In taking<br />this action, the Commission follows the approach set forth in the original guidelines for the<br />other principal controlled substances for which mandatory minimum penalties have been<br />established by Congress. No change was made in the guideline penalties for<br />methamphetamine mixture offenses because those penalties already corresponded to the<br />mandatory minimum penalties as amended by the Act.

L.<br />105–184 ("the Act").<br />The Act directs the Commission to provide for "substantially increased penalties" for<br />telemarketing frauds. It also more specifically requires that the guidelines provide "an<br />additional appropriate sentencing enhancement, if the offense involved sophisticated means,<br />including but not limited to sophisticated concealment efforts, such as perpetrating the<br />offense from outside the United States," and "an additional appropriate sentencing<br />enhancement for cases in which a large number of vulnerable victims, including but not<br />limited to [telemarketing fraud victims over age 55], are affected by a fraudulent scheme or<br />schemes."<br />This amendment responds to the directives by building upon the amendments to the fraud<br />guideline, &#167;2F1.1 (Fraud and Deceit), that were submitted to Congress on May 1, 1998. (See<br />Amendment 577, supra). Those amendments added a specific offense characteristic for<br />"mass-marketing," which is defined to include telemarketing, and a specific offense<br />characteristic for sophisticated concealment.<br />This amendment broadens the "sophisticated concealment" enhancement to cover<br />"sophisticated means" of executing or concealing a fraud offense. In addition, the<br />amendment increases the enhancement under &#167;3A1.1 (Hate Crime Motivation or Vulnerable<br />Victim), for offenses that impact a large number of vulnerable victims.<br />This amendment also makes a conforming amendment to &#167;2B5.1 in the definition of "United<br />States".<br />In designing enhancements that may apply more broadly than the Act’s above-stated<br />directives minimally require, the Commission acts consistently with other directives in the<br />Act (e.g., section 6(c)(4) (requiring the Commission to ensure that its implementing<br />amendments are reasonably consistent with other relevant directives to the Commission and<br />other parts of the sentencing guidelines)) and with its basic mandate in sections 991 and 994<br />of title 28, United States Code (e.g., 28 U.S.C. &#167; 991(b)(1)(B)) (requiring sentencing policies<br />that avoid unwarranted disparities among similarly situated defendants)).<br /><br />Pursuant to the emergency amendment authority of the Act, this amendment previously was<br />promulgated as a temporary measure effective November 1, 1998.

This subsection focuses principally on an aggravated form of identity<br />theft known as ‘affirmative identity theft’ or ‘breeding,’ in which a defendant uses<br />another individual’s name, social security number, or some other form of<br />identification (the ‘means of identification’) to ‘breed’ (i.e., produce or obtain) new<br />or additional forms of identification. Because 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1028(d) broadly defines<br />‘means of identification,’ the new or additional forms of identification can include<br />items such as a driver’s license, a credit card, or a bank loan. This subsection<br />provides a minimum offense level of level 12, in part, because of the seriousness of<br />the offense. The minimum offense level accounts for the fact that the means of<br />identification that were ‘bred’ (i.e., produced or obtained) often are within the<br />defendant’s exclusive control, making it difficult for the individual victim to detect<br />that the victim’s identity has been ‘stolen.’ Generally, the victim does not become<br />November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II Amendment 596<br /><br />aware of the offense until certain harms have already occurred (e.g., a damaged<br />credit rating or inability to obtain a loan). The minimum offense level also accounts<br />for the non-monetary harm associated with these types of offenses, much of which<br />may be difficult or impossible to quantify (e.g., harm to the individual’s reputation<br />or credit rating, inconvenience, and other difficulties resulting from the offense).<br />The legislative history of the Identity Theft and Assumption Deterrence Act of 1998<br />indicates that Congress was especially concerned with providing increased<br />punishment for this type of harm.<br />Subsection (b)(6) implements, in a broader form, the instruction to the<br />Commission in section 6(c)(2) of Public Law 105–184.<br />Subsection (b)(7)(B) implements, in a broader form, the instruction to the<br />Commission in section 110512 of Public Law 103–322.<br />Subsection (b)(8)(A) implements, in a broader form, the instruction to the<br />Commission in section 961(m) of Public Law 101–73.<br />Subsection (b)(8)(B) implements the instruction to the Commission in<br />section 2507 of Public Law 101–647.<br />Subsection (c) implements the instruction to the Commission in section<br />805(c) of Public Law 104–132.".</td><td>Reason for Amendment: This is a five-part amendment. First, this amendment provides<br />a two-level increase and a minimum offense level of level 12 for offenses involving (1) the<br />possession or use of equipment that is used to manufacture access devices; (2) the production<br />of, or trafficking in, unauthorized and counterfeit access devices, such as stolen credit cards<br />and cloned wireless telephones; or (3) affirmative identity theft (i.e., unlawfully producing<br />from any means of identification any other means of identification). Affirmative identity<br />theft, referred to in the research and analysis conducted by the Commission as the "breeding"<br />of identification means, will result in an enhanced penalty in any case in which there is a<br />transfer or use of another person’s means of identification unlawfully to produce or "breed"<br />additional means of identification, or in which there is the possession of five or more means<br />of identification that were unlawfully produced.<br />Second, this amendment provides a rebuttable presumption that the offense involved more<br />than minimal planning, and it contains a rule to avoid "double counting" between the<br />existing enhancement for "sophisticated means" based on the same conduct.<br />Third, the amendment provides a revised minimum loss rule for offenses involving<br />counterfeit or unauthorized access devices. Specifically, this rule requires that a minimum<br />loss amount of $500 per access device be used when calculating the loss involved in the<br />offense. However, for offenses that involve only the possession, and not the use, of a means<br />of telecommunications access that identifies a specific telecommunications instrument or<br />telecommunications account (e.g., an ESN/MIN pair used to obtain telecommunications<br />service in a wireless telephone), the rule provides a minimum loss amount of $100 per<br />unused means.<br />Fourth, this amendment provides an encouraged upward departure if the offense level does<br />Amendment 596 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003<br /><br />not adequately reflect the seriousness of the offense conduct. Examples of cases in which<br />a departure may be warranted include those in which (1) an identity theft caused substantial<br />harm to the victim’s reputation or credit record; (2) an individual is arrested, or is denied a<br />job, because of a misidentification that results from an identity theft; or (3) a defendant<br />essentially assumed the victim’s identity.<br />Fifth, this amendment incorporates the statutory definitions of 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1028 and 1029,<br />although it also broadens the definitions of "counterfeit access device" and "device-making<br />equipment" for guideline purposes.<br />This amendment responds to the directives to the Commission contained in section 4 of the<br />Identity Theft and Assumption Deterrence Act of 1998, Pub. L. 105–318(b)(1) ("ITADA")<br />and section 2 of the Wireless Telephone Protection Act, Pub. L. 105–172 ("WTPA"). For<br />the reasons discussed below and because of the overlap in some of the statutory definitions<br />in the ITADA and the WTPA (particularly "access device," "telecommunication identifying<br />information," and "means of identification"), enhancements have been consolidated into a<br />single guideline amendment.<br />The ITADA and the WTPA directed the Commission to "review and amend the Federal<br />sentencing guidelines and the policy statements of the Commission" to provide appropriate<br />punishment for identity theft offenses under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1028 and for offenses under 18<br />U.S.C. &#167; 1029 related to the cloning of wireless telephones.<br />The WTPA directed the Commission to review, among other factors, "the range of conduct<br />covered by" cloning offenses. Although cloned telephones may be possessed and used in<br />connection with a variety of offenses, the Commission determined that the possession or use<br />of a cloned phone does not necessarily increase the seriousness of the underlying offense.<br />However, the Commission decided that offenders who manufacture or distribute cloned<br />telephones are more culpable than offenders who only possess them. Accordingly, the new<br />enhancements at &#167;2F1.1(b)(5)(A) and (B) recognize that such offenders warrant greater<br />punishment. However, to ensure that the guidelines apply consistently to similarly serious<br />conduct regardless of the technology employed, this amendment provides for a broader<br />enhancement that applies to the manufacture or distribution of any access device, including<br />a cloned telephone.<br />The ITADA directed the Commission to assess certain specific factors in its consideration<br />of appropriate penalties for identity theft, including: the number of victims; the harm to a<br />victim’s reputation and inconvenience caused by the offense; the number of means of<br />identification, identification documents, or false identification documents involved in the<br />offense; the range of offense conduct; and, the adequacy of the value of loss to an individual<br />victim as a measure for establishing penalties.<br />In conducting research pursuant to the ITADA, the Commission learned that identity theft,<br />as defined broadly under the new statutory provisions at 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1028(a)(7) and<br />1028(d)(3), occurs along a continuum of offense conduct. The most basic type of identity<br />theft occurs when a thief steals a wallet and uses a stolen credit card to make a purchase or<br />forges a signature to cash a stolen check. However, after analyzing the legislative history<br />of the ITADA and Commission data, the Commission determined that the more aggravated<br />and sophisticated forms of identity theft, about which Congress seemed particularly<br />concerned, should be the focus of enhanced punishment under the guidelines. Such offense<br /><br />conduct, which generally occurs within the context of financial and credit account take-<br />overs, involves affirmative activity to generate or "breed" another level of identification<br />means without the knowledge of the individual victim whose identification means are<br />misused, purloined, or "taken over". This activity is considered more sophisticated because<br />of the additional steps the perpetrator takes to "breed" additional means of identification in<br />order to conceal and continue the fraudulent conduct. Such sophisticated conduct makes<br />detection by both the individual and institutional victims much more difficult. It also has the<br />potential to increase harm, both monetary and non-monetary, to the individual victims (about<br />whom Congress was particularly concerned in enacting the ITADA), and can result in<br />substantial disruption of record-keeping by governmental agencies and private financial<br />institutions upon which the stream of commerce depends. Thus, the Commission determined<br />that this aggravated offense conduct, in contrast to the most basic forms of identity theft,<br />merits enhanced punishment.<br />Accordingly, amended section &#167;2F1.1(b)(5)(C) recognizes that the conduct of generating or<br />"breeding" identification means warrants substantial additional penalties. The minimum<br />offense level of level 12 accounts for the fact that the defendant in an identity theft case<br />typically has exclusive control over the "bred" means of identification, making it difficult<br />for the individual victim to detect that the victim’s identity has been stolen until substantial<br />harms (e.g., a damaged credit rating) have occurred. The minimum offense level also<br />accounts for the non-monetary harms associated with identity theft (e.g., harm to reputation<br />or credit rating), which typically are difficult to quantify. However, for cases in which the<br />nature and scope of the harm to an individual victim is so egregious that the two-level<br />enhancement and minimum offense level provide insufficient punishment, the amendment<br />invites an upward departure.<br />The WTPA directed the Commission to review "the extent to which the value of the loss<br />caused by the offenses. . . is an adequate measure for establishing penalties. . . ." The<br />amendment provides a minimum loss rule in &#167;2F1.1 that extends to all access devices, not<br />just to cloned wireless telephones. In so doing, similar fraud cases will be treated similarly<br />regardless of the technology or type of access device used in the offense. Additionally, the<br />Commission’s research and data supported increasing the minimum loss amount, previously<br />provided only in &#167;2B1.1 (Larceny, Embezzlement, and Other Forms of Theft), from $100<br />to $500 per access device. However, the data were insufficient to support using this<br />increased amount in cases that involve only the possession, and not the use, of means of<br />telecommunications access that identify a specific telecommunications instrument or account<br />(e.g., ESN/MIN pairs of wireless telephones). (An example of such a case is a defendant<br />who possesses a list of ESN/MIN pairs but has not used any of those pairs to clone wireless<br />telephones.) For such cases, the Commission decided that the minimum loss amount should<br />be $100 per unused means.</td><td>Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2000.</td></tr><tr><td class="n">598</td><td>Amendment 598</td><td>Section 2F1.1(b), as amended by Amendment 595 (see supra), is further<br />amended in subdivision (4) by striking "; or" after "agency" and inserting a semicolon; by<br />inserting "a misrepresentation or other fraudulent action during the course of a bankruptcy<br />proceeding; or (C) a" after "(B)"; and by inserting "prior, specific" before "judicial".<br />The Commentary to &#167;2F1.1 captioned "Application Notes", as amended by Amendment 595<br />(see supra), is further amended by striking Note 6 in its entirety and inserting the following:<br />Amendment 596 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003<br /><br />"6. Subsection (b)(4)(C) provides an enhancement if the defendant commits a<br />fraud in contravention of a prior, official judicial or administrative warning,<br />in the form of an order, injunction, decree, or process, to take or not to take<br />a specified action. A defendant who does not comply with such a prior,<br />official judicial or administrative warning demonstrates aggravated criminal<br />intent and deserves additional punishment. If it is established that an entity<br />the defendant controlled was a party to the prior proceeding that resulted in<br />the official judicial or administrative action, and the defendant had<br />knowledge of that prior decree or order, this enhancement applies even if<br />the defendant was not a specifically named party in that prior case. For<br />example, a defendant whose business previously was enjoined from selling<br />a dangerous product, but who nonetheless engaged in fraudulent conduct to<br />sell the product, is subject to this enhancement. This enhancement does not<br />apply if the same conduct resulted in an enhancement pursuant to a<br />provision found elsewhere in the guidelines (e.g., a violation of a condition<br />of release addressed in &#167;2J1.7 (Commission of Offense While on Release)<br />or a violation of probation addressed in &#167;4A1.1 (Criminal History<br />Category)).<br />If the conduct that forms the basis for an enhancement under (b)(4)(B) or<br />(C) is the only conduct that forms the basis for an adjustment under &#167;3C1.1<br />(Obstruction of Justice), do not apply an adjustment under &#167;3C1.1.".<br />The Commentary to &#167;2F1.1 captioned "Background", as amended by Amendment 595 (see<br />supra), is further amended by striking the fourth sentence of the fourth paragraph and<br />inserting the following:<br />"The commission of a fraud in the course of a bankruptcy proceeding subjects the defendant<br />to an enhanced sentence because that fraudulent conduct undermines the bankruptcy process<br />as well as harms others with an interest in the bankruptcy estate.".</td><td>Reason for Amendment: The amendment was prompted by the circuit conflict regarding<br />whether the enhancement in &#167;2F1.1 (Fraud and Deceit) for "violation of any judicial or<br />administrative order, injunction, decree, or process" applies to false statements made during<br />bankruptcy proceedings. Compare United States v. Saacks, 131 F.3d 540 (5th Cir. 1997)<br />(bankruptcy fraud implicates the violation of a judicial or administrative order or process<br />within the meaning of the enhancement; United States v. Michalek, 54 F.3d 325 (7th Cir.<br />1995) (bankruptcy fraud is a "special procedure"; it is a violation of a specific adjudicatory<br />process); United States v. Lloyd, 947 F.2d 339 (8th Cir. 1991) (knowing concealment of<br />assets in bankruptcy fraud violates "judicial process"); United States v. Welch, 103 F.3d 906<br />(9th Cir. 1996) (same); United States v. Messner, 107 F.3d 1448 (10th Cir. 1997) (same);<br />United States v. Bellew, 35 F.3d 518 (11th Cir. 1994) (knowing concealment of assets<br />during bankruptcy proceedings qualifies as a violation of a "judicial order"), with United<br />States v. Shadduck, 112 F.3d 523 (1st Cir. 1997) (falsely filling out bankruptcy forms does<br />not violate judicial process since the debtor is not accorded a position of trust). See also<br />United States v. Carrozella, 105 F. 3d 796 (2d Cir. 1997) (district court erred in enhancing<br />the sentence for violation of judicial process in the case of a defendant who filed false<br />accounts in probate court).<br />The majority of circuits have held that the current enhancement applies to a defendant who<br /><br />conceals assets in a bankruptcy case because the conduct violates a judicial order or violates<br />judicial process. Commission data indicate that, in fiscal year 1998, 41 defendants received<br />an increase for either "violation of a judicial order . . . or misrepresentation of a charitable<br />organization." The data did not distinguish between the two parts of the enhancement.<br />This amendment creates a separate and distinct basis for a two-level enhancement under the<br />fraud guideline for a misrepresentation or false statement made in the course of a bankruptcy<br />proceeding. Additionally, the existing enhancement and its accompanying commentary are<br />modified to make clear that, in order for the enhancement to apply in a fraud case not<br />involving a bankruptcy proceeding, there must be a false statement in violation of a specific,<br />prior order. Therefore, any case involving a bankruptcy fraud will result in a two-level<br />enhancement, but in the case of a non-bankruptcy fraud, the enhancement will apply only<br />if a defendant was given prior notice of a particular action. The Commission has decided<br />to treat bankruptcy fraud more severely because of its adverse impact on the bankruptcy<br />judicial process and because of the additional harm and seriousness involved in such<br />conduct. See United States v. Saacks, 131 F.3d 540, 543<br />(5th Cir. 1997) (noting that bankruptcy fraud is more serious than "the most pedestrian<br />federal fraud offense").</td><td>Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2000.</td></tr><tr><td class="n">599</td><td>Amendment 599</td><td>Section 2K2.4 is amended by striking subsection (a) in its entirety and<br />inserting the following:<br />"(a) If the defendant, whether or not convicted of another crime, was convicted<br />of violating:<br />(1) Section 844(h) of title 18, United States Code, the guideline<br />sentence is the term of imprisonment required by statute.<br />(2) Section 924(c) or section 929(a) of title 18, United States Code, the<br />guideline sentence is the minimum term of imprisonment required<br />by statute.".<br />The Commentary to &#167;2K2.4 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by striking Note 1<br />in its entirety and inserting the following:<br />"1. Section 844(h) of title 18, United State Code, provides a mandatory term of<br />imprisonment of 10 years (or 20 years for the second or subsequent<br />offense). Sections 924(c) and 929(a) of title 18, United States Code,<br />provide mandatory minimum terms of imprisonment (e.g., not less than five<br />years). Subsection (a) reflects this distinction. Accordingly, the guideline<br />sentence for a defendant convicted under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 844(h) is the term<br />required by the statute, and the guideline sentence for a defendant convicted<br />under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c) or &#167; 929(a) is the minimum term required by the<br />relevant statute. Each of 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 844(h), 924(c), and 929(a) requires<br />a term of imprisonment imposed under this section to run consecutively to<br />any other term of imprisonment.<br />A sentence above the minimum term required by 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c) or<br />Amendment 598 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003<br /><br />&#167; 929(a) is an upward departure from the guideline sentence.

See Application Note 3.".<br />The Commentary to &#167;2K2.4 captioned "Background" is amended by striking the first<br />sentence in its entirety and inserting the following:<br />"Section 844(h) of title 18, United States Code, provides a mandatory term of<br />imprisonment. Sections 924(c) and 929(a) of title 18, United States Code, provide<br />mandatory minimum terms of imprisonment. A sentence imposed pursuant to any<br />of these statutes must be imposed to run consecutively to any other term of<br />imprisonment.".<br />The Commentary to &#167;3D1.1 captioned "Application Note" is amended in Note 1 in the<br />second sentence by striking "mandatory term of five years" and inserting "mandatory<br />minimum terms of imprisonment, based on the conduct involved,"; and in the seventh<br />sentence by inserting "minimum" after "mandatory".<br />The Commentary to &#167;5G1.2 is amended in the second sentence of the last paragraph by<br />striking "mandatory term of five years" and inserting "mandatory minimum terms of<br />imprisonment, based on the conduct involved,".</td><td>Reason for Amendment: This amendment revises &#167;2K2.4 (Use of Firearm, Armor-Piercing<br />Ammunition, or Explosive During or in Relation to Certain Crimes) to (1) clarify how the<br />minimum, consecutive terms of imprisonment mandated by the statutes indexed to this<br />guideline should be treated for purposes of guideline application; and (2) specify guideline<br />sentences, for all statutes indexed to &#167;2K2.4, that comply with the Commission’s mandate<br />in 28 U.S.C. &#167; 994(b)(2) (requiring guideline sentencing ranges in which the maximum shall<br />not exceed the minimum by more than the greater of 25 percent or six months). The Act to<br />Throttle the Criminal Use of Guns, Pub. L. 105–386, changed the penalty provisions in 18<br />U.S.C. &#167; 924(c) from fixed terms of years to ranges of "not less than" various terms of years.<br />This effectively establishes mandatory minimum terms of imprisonment with implicit<br />maximum terms of life. Section 929(a) of title 18, United States Code, contains similar<br />provisions. Section 2K2.4 continues to provide that, in both cases, the term of imprisonment<br />imposed under the statute should be determined independently of the usual guideline<br />application rules and the sentence imposed should run consecutively to any other term of<br />imprisonment. See &#167;5G1.2(a). However, &#167;2K2.4 previously stated that the term of<br />imprisonment was that "required by statute." Because two of the statutes indexed to the<br />guideline now provide for terms of a range of years, questions arose as to whether any<br />sentence within the statutorily authorized range complied with the guidelines.<br />The amendment clarifies that the guideline sentence is the minimum term required by the<br />statute of conviction, that a term greater than this minimum is an upward departure and<br />should be imposed using the normal standards and procedures that apply to departures from<br />the guideline range, and that such upward departures are invited under certain circumstances.<br />See 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(b). For example, career offenders who are convicted both of an<br /><br />offense under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c) and of an underlying crime of violence or drug trafficking<br />typically will receive lengthy guideline sentences. This amendment modifies Application<br />Note 1 of &#167;2K2.4 to encourage an upward departure in the unusual circumstance in which<br />an offender is convicted only of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c) and would have qualified as a career<br />offender if that guideline applied to such convictions, or in other unusual circumstances in<br />which the sentence in a particular case does not adequately reflect the seriousness of the<br />defendant’s criminal history. Because 18 U.S.C. &#167; 844(h) still provides for fixed terms of<br />imprisonment, the amendment differentiates it from the two statutes that provide for terms<br />of a range of years.<br />The amendment also contains technical and conforming changes: &#167;&#167;3D1.1 (Procedure for<br />Determining Offense Level on Multiple Counts) and 5G1.2 (Sentencing on Multiple Counts<br />of Conviction) are revised to reflect a change to the penalty provision of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c).</td><td>Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2000.</td></tr><tr><td class="n">600</td><td>Amendment 600</td><td>The Commentary to &#167;2K2.4 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in<br />Note 2 in the second paragraph by striking "paragraph" after "preceding" and inserting<br />"paragraphs"; and by striking the first paragraph in its entirety and inserting the following:<br />"If a sentence under this guideline is imposed in conjunction with a sentence for an<br />underlying offense, do not apply any specific offense characteristic for possession,<br />brandishing, use, or discharge of an explosive or firearm when determining the<br />sentence for the underlying offense. A sentence under this guideline accounts for<br />any explosive or weapon enhancement for the underlying offense of conviction,<br />including any such enhancement that would apply based on conduct for which the<br />defendant is accountable under &#167;1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct). Do not apply any<br />weapon enhancement in the guideline for the underlying offense, for example, if (A)<br />a co-defendant, as part of the jointly undertaken criminal activity, possessed a<br />firearm different from the one for which the defendant was convicted under 18<br />U.S.C. &#167; 924(c); or (B) in an ongoing drug trafficking offense, the defendant<br />possessed a firearm other than the one for which the defendant was convicted under<br />18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c). However, if a defendant is convicted of two armed bank<br />robberies, but is convicted under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c) in connection with only one of<br />the robberies, a weapon enhancement would apply to the bank robbery which was<br />not the basis for the 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c) conviction.<br />If the explosive or weapon that was possessed, brandished, used, or discharged in<br />the course of the underlying offense also results in a conviction that would subject<br />the defendant to an enhancement under &#167;2K1.3(b)(3) (pertaining to possession of<br />explosive material in connection with another felony offense) or &#167;2K2.1(b)(5)<br />(pertaining to possession of any firearm or ammunition in connection with another<br />felony offense), do not apply that enhancement. A sentence under this guideline<br />accounts for the conduct covered by these enhancements because of the relatedness<br />of that conduct to the conduct that forms the basis for the conviction under 18<br />U.S.C. &#167; 844(h), &#167; 924(c) or &#167; 929(a). For example, if in addition to a conviction<br />for an underlying offense of armed bank robbery, the defendant was convicted of<br />being a felon in possession under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(g), the enhancement under<br />Amendment 599 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003<br /><br />&#167;2K2.1(b)(5) would not apply.".<br />The Commentary to &#167;2K2.4 captioned "Application Notes", as amended by Amendment 600<br />(see supra), is further amended in Note 5 (formerly Note 4) in the third sentence by inserting<br />"brandishing," after "possession,".<br />The Commentary to &#167;2K2.4 captioned "Background" is amended in the second sentence by<br />inserting "brandishing," after "use,".</td><td>Reason for Amendment: This amendment expands the commentary in Application Note<br />2 of &#167;2K2.4 (Use of Firearm, Armor-Piercing Ammunition, or Explosive During or in<br />Relation to Certain Crimes) to clarify under what circumstances defendants sentenced for<br />violations of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c) in conjunction with convictions for other offenses may<br />receive weapon enhancements contained in the guidelines for those other offenses. The<br />amendment directs that no guideline weapon enhancement should be applied when<br />determining the sentence for the crime of violence or drug trafficking offense underlying the<br />18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c) conviction, nor for any conduct with respect to that offense for which the<br />defendant is accountable under &#167;1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct). Guideline weapon<br />enhancements may be applied, however, when determining the sentence for counts of<br />conviction outside the scope of relevant conduct for the underlying offense (e.g., a<br />conviction for a second armed bank robbery for which no 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c) conviction was<br />obtained).<br />For similar reasons, this amendment also expands the application note to clarify that<br />offenders who receive a sentence under &#167;2K2.4 should not receive enhancements under<br />&#167;2K1.3(b)(3) (pertaining to explosive material connected with another offense), or<br />&#167;2K2.1(b)(5) (pertaining to firearms or ammunition possessed, used, or transferred in<br />connection with another offense) with respect to any weapon, ammunition, or explosive<br />connected to the offense underlying the count of conviction sentenced under &#167;2K2.4.<br />The purposes of this amendment are to (1) avoid unwarranted disparity and duplicative<br />punishment; and (2) conform application of guideline weapon enhancements with general<br />guideline principles. The relevant application note to &#167;2K2.4 previously stated that if a<br />sentence was imposed under &#167;2K2.4 in conjunction with a sentence for "an underlying<br />offense," no weapon enhancement should be applied with respect to the guideline for the<br />underlying offense. Some courts interpreted "underlying offense" narrowly to mean only<br />the "crime of violence" or "drug trafficking offense" that forms the basis for the 18 U.S.C.<br />&#167; 924(c) conviction. See, e.g., United States v. Flennory,145 F.3d 1264, 1268-69 (11th Cir.<br />1998), cert. denied, 119 S.Ct. 1130 (1999). But see United States v. Smith, 196 F.3d 676,<br />679-82 (6th Cir. 1999) (a conviction under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(g) qualifies as an "underlying<br />offense," and thus, application of the enhancement in &#167;2K2.1(b)(5) was impermissible<br />double-counting). In other cases, offenders have received both the mandated statutory<br />penalty and a guideline weapon enhancement in circumstances in which the guidelines<br />generally would require a single weapon enhancement. See United States v. Gonzalez, 183<br />F.3d 1315, 1325-26 (11th Cir.), cert. denied, 120 S.Ct. 996 (2000) (both statutory and<br />guideline increases may be imposed if defendant and accomplice used different weapons as<br />part of a joint undertaking); United States v. Willett, 90 F.3d 404, 407-08 (9th Cir. 1996)<br />(not double counting to apply both increases for separate weapons possessed by defendant).<br />But see United States v. Knobloch, 131 F.3d 366, 372 (3d Cir. 1996) (error to apply<br />guideline enhancement in addition to statutory penalty "even if the section 924(c)(1)<br /><br />sentence is for a different weapon than the weapon upon which the enhancement is<br />predicated.").<br />The amendment clarifies application of the commentary, consistent with the definition of<br />"offense" found in &#167;1B1.1 (Application Note 1(l)) and with general guideline principles. It<br />addresses disparate application arising from conflicting interpretations of the current<br />guideline in different courts, and is intended to avoid the duplicative punishment that results<br />when sentences are increased under both the statutes and the guidelines for substantially the<br />same harm.<br />Finally, Application Notes 2 and 4 and the Background Commentary of &#167;2K2.4 are revised<br />to reflect changes to 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c), made by the Act to Throttle the Criminal Use of<br />Guns, Pub.

Shores, 966 F.2d 1383 (11th Cir. 1992) (toy gun carried but<br />never used by a defendant qualifies as a dangerous weapon because of its potential, if it were<br />used, to arouse fear in victims and dangerous reactions by police or security personnel) and<br />United States v. Dixon, 982 F.2d 116 (3rd Cir. 1992) (hand wrapped in a towel qualifies as<br />a dangerous weapon if the defendant’s actions created the impression that the defendant<br />possessed a dangerous weapon).<br />The amendment also deletes the term "displayed" wherever it appears in the Guidelines<br />Manual in an enhancement with "brandished." Because "brandished" applies in any case in<br />which "all or part of the weapon was displayed," the Commission determined the inclusion<br />of "displayed" in these enhancements is redundant. This part of the amendment is not<br />intended to make a substantive change in the guidelines.</td><td>Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2000.</td></tr><tr><td class="n">603</td><td>Amendment 603</td><td>Chapter One, Part A, Subpart 4(b) is amended in the fifth sentence of the first<br />paragraph by striking "and" before "the last"; and by inserting ", and &#167;5K2.19 (Post-<br />Sentencing Rehabilitative Efforts)" after "(Coercion and Duress)".<br />Chapter Five, Part K, Subpart 2, is amended by inserting at the end the following:<br />Amendment 602 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003<br /><br />"&#167;5K2.19. Post-Sentencing Rehabilitative Efforts (Policy Statement)<br />Post-sentencing rehabilitative efforts, even if exceptional,<br />undertaken by a defendant after imposition of a term of<br />imprisonment for the instant offense are not an appropriate basis<br />for a downward departure when resentencing the defendant for that<br />offense. (Such efforts may provide a basis for early termination of<br />supervised release under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3583(e)(1).)<br />Commentary<br />Background: The Commission has determined that post-sentencing rehabilitative measures<br />should not provide a basis for downward departure when resentencing a defendant initially<br />sentenced to a term of imprisonment because such a departure would (1) be inconsistent with<br />the policies established by Congress under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3624(b) and other statutory<br />provisions for reducing the time to be served by an imprisoned person; and (2) inequitably<br />benefit only those who gain the opportunity to be resentenced de novo.".</td><td>Reason for Amendment: This amendment was prompted by the circuit conflict regarding<br />whether sentencing courts may consider an offender’s post-offense rehabilitative efforts<br />while in prison or on probation as a basis for downward departure at resentencing following<br />an appeal. Compare United States v. Rhodes, 145 F.3d 1375, 1379 (D.C. Cir. 1998) (post-<br />conviction rehabilitation is not a prohibited factor and, therefore, sentencing courts may<br />consider it as a possible ground for downward departure at resentencing); United States v.<br />Bradstreet, 207 F.3d 76 (1st Cir. 2000); United States v. Core, 125 F.3d 74, 75 (2d Cir. 1997)<br />("We find nothing in the pertinent statutes or the Sentencing Guidelines that prevents a<br />sentencing judge from considering post-conviction rehabilitation in prison as a basis for<br />departure if resentencing becomes necessary.") cert. denied, 118 S. Ct. 735 (1998); United<br />States v. Sally,116 F.3d 76, 80 (3d Cir. 1997) (holding that "post-offense rehabilitations<br />efforts, including those which occur post-conviction, may constitute a sufficient factor<br />warranting a downward departure"); United States v. Rudolph, 190 F.3d 720, 723 (6th Cir.<br />1999); United States v. Green, 152 F.3d 1202, 1207 (9th Cir. 1998) (same), with United<br />States v. Sims, 174 F.3d 911 (8th Cir. 1999) (district court lacks authority at resentencing<br />following an appeal to depart on ground of post-conviction rehabilitation which occurred<br />after the original sentencing; refuses to extend holding regarding departures for post-offense<br />rehabilitation to conduct that occurs in prison; departure based on post-conviction conduct<br />infringes on statutory authority of the Bureau of Prisons to grant good-time credits). In<br />Sims, the Eighth Circuit concluded that a rule allowing a departure at resentencing based on<br />post-sentencing rehabilitation would result in unwarranted disparity because resentencing<br />would be a fortuitous event benefitting only some defendants; would reinstate a parole-like<br />system; and would interfere with the authority of the Bureau of Prisons to award good-time<br />credits. See Sims, 174 F.3d at 912-13; Rhodes, 145 F.3d at 1384 (Silberman, J., dissenting).<br />The Commission determined that post-sentencing rehabilitative efforts should not provide<br />a basis for a downward departure when resentencing a defendant initially sentenced to a term<br />of imprisonment because such a departure would (1) be inconsistent with policies established<br />by Congress under the Sentencing Reform Act, including the provisions of 18 U.S.C. &#167;<br />3624(b) for reducing the time to be served by an imprisoned person; and (2) inequitably<br />benefit only those few who gain the opportunity to be resentenced de novo, while others,<br />whose rehabilitative efforts may have been more substantial, could not benefit simply<br /><br />because they chose not to appeal or appealed unsuccessfully. Additionally, prohibition on<br />downward departure for post-sentencing rehabilitative efforts is consistent with Commission<br />policies expressed in &#167;1B1.10 (Reduction in Term of Imprisonment as a Result of Amended<br />Guideline Range). This amendment does not restrict departures based on extraordinary post-<br />offense rehabilitative efforts prior to sentencing. Such departures<br />have been allowed by every circuit that has ruled on the matter post-Koon. See e.g., United<br />States v. Brock, 108 F.3d 31 (4th Cir. 1997).</td><td>Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2000.</td></tr><tr><td class="n">604</td><td>Amendment 604</td><td>Chapter One, Part A, Subpart 4(d) is amended by adding an asterisk at the<br />end of the last paragraph after the period; and by adding at the end the following footnote:<br />"*Note: Although the Commission had not addressed ‘single acts of aberrant<br />behavior’ at the time the Introduction to the Guidelines Manual originally was<br />written, it subsequently addressed the issue in Amendment 603, effective November<br />1, 2000. (See Supplement to Appendix C, Amendment 603.)".<br />Chapter Five, Part K, Subpart 2, as amended by Amendment 602 (see supra), is further<br />amended by adding at the end the following:<br />"&#167;5K2.20. Aberrant Behavior (Policy Statement)<br />A sentence below the applicable guideline range may be warranted<br />in an extraordinary case if the defendant’s criminal conduct<br />constituted aberrant behavior. However, the court may not depart<br />below the guideline range on this basis if (1) the offense involved<br />serious bodily injury or death; (2) the defendant discharged a<br />firearm or otherwise used a firearm or a dangerous weapon; (3) the<br />instant offense of conviction is a serious drug trafficking offense;<br />(4) the defendant has more than one criminal history point, as<br />determined under Chapter Four (Criminal History and Criminal<br />Livelihood); or (5) the defendant has a prior federal, or state, felony<br />conviction, regardless of whether the conviction is countable under<br />Chapter Four.<br />Commentary<br />Application Notes:<br />1. For purposes of this policy statement—<br />‘Aberrant behavior’ means a single criminal occurrence or single criminal<br />transaction that (A) was committed without significant planning; (B) was<br />of limited duration; and (C) represents a marked deviation by the defendant<br />from an otherwise law-abiding life.<br />‘Dangerous weapon,’ ‘firearm,’ ‘otherwise used,’ and ‘serious bodily<br />injury’ have the meaning given those terms in the Commentary to<br />Amendment 603 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003<br /><br />&#167;1B1.1(Application Instructions).<br />‘Serious drug trafficking offense’ means any controlled substance offense<br />under title 21, United States Code, other than simple possession under 21<br />U.S.C. &#167; 844, that, because the defendant does not meet the criteria under<br />&#167;5C1.2 (Limitation on Applicability of Statutory Mandatory Minimum<br />Sentences in Certain Cases), results in the imposition of a mandatory<br />minimum term of imprisonment upon the defendant.<br />2. In determining whether the court should depart on the basis of aberrant<br />behavior, the court may consider the defendant’s (A) mental and emotional<br />conditions; (B) employment record; (C) record of prior good works; (D)<br />motivation for committing the offense; and (E) efforts to mitigate the effects<br />of the offense.".</td><td>Reason for Amendment: This amendment responds to a circuit conflict regarding whether,<br />for purposes of downward departure from the guideline range, a "single act of aberrant<br />behavior" (Chapter One, Part A, Subpart 4(d)) includes multiple acts occurring over a period<br />of time. Compare United States v. Grandmaison, 77 F.3d 555 (1st Cir. 1996) (Sentencing<br />Commission intended the word "single" to refer to the crime committed; therefore, "single<br />acts of aberrant behavior" include multiple acts leading up to the commission of the crime;<br />the district court should review the totality of circumstances); Zecevic v. United States<br />Parole Commission, 163 F.3d 731 (2d Cir. 1998) (aberrant behavior is conduct which<br />constitutes a short-lived departure from an otherwise law-abiding life, and the best test is the<br />totality of the circumstances); United States v. Takai, 941 F.2d 738 (9th Cir. 1991) ("single<br />act" refers to the particular action that is criminal, even though a whole series of acts lead up<br />to the commission of the crime); United States v. Pena, 930 F.2d 1486 (10th Cir. 1991)<br />(aberrational nature of the defendant’s conduct and other circumstances justified departure),<br />with United States v. Marcello, 13 F.3d 752 (3d Cir. 1994) (single act of aberrant behavior<br />requires a spontaneous, thoughtless, single act involving lack of planning); United States v.<br />Glick, 946 F.2d 335 (4th Cir. 1991) (conduct over a ten-week period involving a number of<br />actions and extensive planning was not "single act of aberrant behavior"); United States v.<br />Williams, 974 F.2d 25 (5th Cir. 1992) (a single act of aberrant behavior is generally<br />spontaneous or thoughtless); United States v. Carey, 895 F.2d 318 (7th Cir. 1990) (single act<br />of aberrant behavior contemplates a spontaneous and seemingly thoughtless act rather than<br />one which was the result of substantial planning); United States v. Garlich, 951 F.2d 161<br />(8th Cir. 1991) (fraud spanning one year and several transactions was not a "single act of<br />aberrant behavior"); United States v. Withrow, 85 F.3d 527 (11th Cir. 1996) (a single act of<br />aberrant behavior is not established unless the defendant is a first-time offender and the<br />crime was a thoughtless act rather than one that was the result of substantial planning);<br />United States v. Dyce, 78 F.3d 610 (D.C. Cir.), amd. on reh. 91 F.3d 1462 (D.C. Cir. 1996)<br />(same).<br />This amendment addresses the circuit conflict but does not adopt in toto either the majority<br />or minority circuit view on this issue. As a threshold matter, this amendment provides that<br />the departure is available only in an extraordinary case. However, the amendment defines<br />and describes "aberrant behavior" more flexibly than the interpretation of existing guideline<br />language followed by the majority of circuits that have allowed a departure for aberrant<br />behavior only in a case involving a single act that was spontaneous and seemingly<br />thoughtless. The Commission concluded that this application of the current language in<br /><br />Chapter One is overly restrictive and may preclude departures for aberrant behavior in<br />circumstances in which such a departure might be warranted. For this reason, the<br />Commission attempted to slightly relax the "single act" rule in some respects, and provide<br />guidance and limitations regarding what can be considered aberrant behavior. At the same<br />time, the Commission also chose not to adopt the "totality of circumstances" approach<br />endorsed by the minority of circuits, concluding that the latter approach is overly broad and<br />vague. The Commission anticipates that this compromise amendment will not broadly<br />expand departures for aberrant behavior.<br />The amendment creates a new policy statement and accompanying commentary in Chapter<br />Five, Part K (Departures) that sets forth the parameters of conduct and criminal history that<br />the Commission believes appropriately may warrant departure as "aberrant behavior." The<br />policy statement provides, in pertinent part, that "‘aberrant behavior’ means a single criminal<br />occurrence or single criminal transaction." The Commission intends that the phrases "single<br />criminal occurrence" and "single criminal transaction" will be somewhat broader than "single<br />act", but will be limited in potential applicability to offenses (1) committed without<br />significant planning; (2) of limited duration; and (3) that represent a marked deviation by the<br />defendant from an otherwise law-abiding life. For offense conduct to be considered for<br />departure as aberrant behavior, the offense conduct must, at a minimum, have these<br />characteristics. The Commission chose these characteristics after reviewing case law and<br />public comment that indicated some support for the appropriateness of these factors.<br />The policy statement places significant restrictions on the type of offense and the criminal<br />history of the offender that can be considered for this departure. The restrictions on the type<br />of offense that can qualify reflect a Commission concern that certain offense conduct is so<br />serious that a departure premised on a finding of aberrant behavior should not be available<br />to those offenders who engage in such conduct. Similarly, the restrictions on criminal<br />history reflect a Commission view that defendants with significant prior criminal records<br />should not qualify for a departure premised on the aberrant nature of their current conduct.<br />The Commission recognizes that a number of other factors may have some relevance in<br />evaluating the appropriateness of a departure based on aberrant behavior. Some of the<br />relevant factors identified in the case law and public comment are listed in an application<br />note.</td><td>Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2000.</td></tr><tr><td class="n">605</td><td>Amendment 605</td><td>The Commentary to &#167;1B1.4 captioned "Background" is amended by striking:<br />". For example, if the defendant committed two robberies, but as part of a plea<br />negotiation entered a guilty plea to only one, the robbery that was not taken into<br />account by the guidelines would provide a reason for sentencing at the top of the<br />guideline range. In addition, information that does not enter into the determination<br />of the applicable guideline sentencing range may be considered in determining<br />whether and to what extent to depart from the guidelines.",<br />and inserting:<br />"in determining a sentence within the guideline range or from considering that<br />information in determining whether and to what extent to depart from the guidelines.<br />Amendment 604 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003<br /><br />For example, if the defendant committed two robberies, but as part of a plea<br />negotiation entered a guilty plea to only one, the robbery that was not taken into<br />account by the guidelines would provide a reason for sentencing at the top of the<br />guideline range and may provide a reason for sentencing above the guideline<br />range.".<br />Chapter Five, Part K, Subpart 2, as amended by Amendment 603 (see supra), is further<br />amended by adding at the end the following:<br />"&#167;5K2.21. Dismissed and Uncharged Conduct (Policy Statement)<br />The court may increase the sentence above the guideline range to<br />reflect the actual seriousness of the offense based on conduct (1)<br />underlying a charge dismissed as part of a plea agreement in the<br />case, or underlying a potential charge not pursued in the case as<br />part of a plea agreement or for any other reason; and (2) that did<br />not enter into the determination of the applicable guideline range.".<br />Section 6B1.2(a) is amended in the second paragraph by striking "Provided, that" and<br />inserting "However,".<br />The Commentary to &#167;6B1.2 is amended in the fourth paragraph by adding at the end the<br />following:<br />"Section 5K2.21 (Dismissed and Uncharged Conduct) addresses the use, as a basis for<br />upward departure, of conduct underlying a charge dismissed as part of a plea agreement in<br />the case, or underlying a potential charge not pursued in the case as part of a plea<br />agreement.".</td><td>Reason for Amendment: This amendment addresses the circuit conflict regarding whether<br />a court can base an upward departure on conduct that was dismissed or not charged as part<br />of a plea agreement in the case. According to the majority of circuits, the sentencing court,<br />in determining the sentence to impose within the guideline range, or whether a departure<br />from the guidelines is warranted, may consider without limitation any information<br />concerning the background, character and conduct of the defendant, unless otherwise<br />prohibited by law. See &#167;1B1.4 (Information to be Used in Imposing Sentence) and 18<br />U.S.C. &#167; 3661. These courts hold that &#167;6B1.2 (Standards for Acceptance of Plea<br />Agreements) does not prohibit a court from considering conduct underlying counts dismissed<br />pursuant to a plea agreement. The minority circuit view holds that a departure based on<br />conduct uncharged or dismissed in the context of a plea agreement is inappropriate. Courts<br />holding the minority view emphasize the need to protect the expectations of the parties to<br />the plea agreement. Compare United States v. Figaro, 935 F.2d 4 (1st Cir. 1991) (allowing<br />upward departure based on uncharged conduct); United States v. Kim, 896 F.2d 678 (2d Cir.<br />1990) (allowing upward departure based on related conduct that formed the basis of<br />dismissed counts and based on prior similar misconduct not resulting in conviction); United<br />States v. Baird, 109 F.3d 856 (3d Cir.), cert. denied, 118 S. Ct. 243 (1997) (allowing upward<br />departure based on dismissed counts if the conduct underlying the dismissed counts is related<br />to the offense of conviction conduct) (citing United States v. Watts, 519 U.S. 148 (1997));<br />United States v. Barber, 119 F.2d 276, 283-84 (4th Cir. 1997) (en banc); United States v.<br />Cross, 121 F.3d 234 (6th Cir. 1997) (allowing upward departure based on dismissed<br /><br />conduct) (citing Watts); United States v. Ashburn, 38 F.3d 803 (5th Cir. 1994) (allowing<br />upward departure based on dismissed conduct); United States v. Big Medicine, 73 F.3d 994<br />(10th Cir. 1995) (allowing departure based on uncharged conduct), with United States v.<br />Ruffin, 997 F.2d 343 (7th Cir. 1993) (error to depart based on counts dismissed as part of<br />plea agreement); United States v.

Lawton, 193 F.3d 1087 (9th Cir. 1999) (court may not accept plea bargain and later<br />consider dismissed charges for upward departure in sentencing).<br />This amendment allows courts to consider for upward departure purposes aggravating<br />conduct that is dismissed or not charged in connection with a plea agreement. This approach<br />is consistent with the principles that underlie &#167;1B1.4 and 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3661 and preserves<br />flexibility for the sentencing judge to impose an appropriate sentence within the context of<br />a charge-reduction plea agreement.</td><td>Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2000.</td></tr><tr><td class="n">606</td><td>Amendment 606</td><td>Section 2B5.1(b)(2) is amended by inserting "level" after "increase to".<br />The Commentary to &#167;2D1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 20 by<br />striking "Under subsection (b)(5), the enhancement" and inserting "Subsection (b)(5)"; by<br />striking "under this subsection" and inserting "under subsection (b)(5)"; by striking "&#167;5B1.3"<br />and inserting "&#167;&#167;5B1.3"; and by striking "&#167;" before "5D1.3".<br />Section 2D1.11(b) is amended by adding at the end the following:<br />"(3) If the offense involved (A) an unlawful discharge, emission, or release into<br />the environment of a hazardous or toxic substance; or (B) the unlawful<br />transportation, treatment, storage, or disposal of a hazardous waste, increase<br />by 2 levels.".<br />The Commentary to &#167;2D1.11 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by adding at the<br />end the following:<br />"8.

L. 104–237. Specifically, the amendment amends<br />&#167;&#167;2D1.11 and 2D1.12 (Unlawful Possession, Manufacture, Distribution, or Importation of<br />Prohibited Flask or Equipment) to add an enhancement for environmental damage associated<br />with methamphetamine offenses. The Commission previously had intended to amend these<br />guidelines in this manner, but due to a technical oversight, the final amendment did not<br />implement that intent.<br />The Act directed the Commission to determine whether the guidelines adequately punish<br />environmental violations occurring in connection with precursor chemical offenses under 21<br />U.S.C. &#167; 841(d) and (g) (sentenced under &#167;2D1.11), and manufacturing equipment offenses<br />under 21 U.S.C. &#167; 843(a)(6) and (7) (sentenced under &#167;2D1.12).

Additionally, although the directive did not address manufacturing offenses under<br />21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(a), the Commission elected to use its broader guideline promulgation<br />authority under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 994(a) to ensure that environmental violations occurring in<br />connection with this more frequently occurring offense were treated similarly. Accordingly,<br />the published options also included amendments to &#167;2D1.1 (Unlawful Manufacturing,<br />Importing, Exporting, or Trafficking).<br />The published options were revised prior to final action by the Commission. However, in<br />the revision that was presented to the Commission for promulgation in late April 1997,<br />amendments to &#167;&#167;2D1.11 and 2D1.12 mistakenly were omitted from the option to provide<br />a specific offense characteristic, although that revision did refer to &#167;&#167;2D1.11 and 2D1.12 in<br />the synopsis and included amendments to these guidelines in the upward departure option.<br />(The revision did not include any amendments to guideline &#167;2D1.13, covering record-<br />keeping offenses, because, upon further examination, it seemed unlikely that offenses<br />sentenced under this guideline would involve environmental damage.) Accordingly, when<br />the Commission voted to adopt the option providing the specific offense characteristic for<br />&#167;&#167;2D1.1, 2D1.11, and 2D1.12, the vote effectively was limited to what was before the<br />Commission, i.e., an environmental damage enhancement for &#167;2D1.1 only. This amendment<br />corrects that error and makes minor, conforming changes to the relevant application note in<br />&#167;2D1.1.<br />Third, the amendment updates the Statutory Provisions of &#167;2K2.1 (Unlawful Receipt,<br />Possession, or Transportation of Firearms or Ammunition) to conform to statutory re-<br />designations made to 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924 (and already conformed in Appendix A (Statutory<br />Index)).<br />Finally, the amendment updates &#167;&#167;5B1.3 (Conditions of Probation) and 5D1.3 (Conditions<br />of Supervised Release). Effective November 26, 1998, 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 3563(a) and 3583(a)<br />were amended to add a new mandatory condition of probation and supervised release<br />requiring a person convicted of a sexual offense described in 18 U.S.C. &#167; 4042(c)(4)<br />(enumerating several sex offenses) to report to the probation officer the person’s address and<br />any subsequent change of address, and to register as a sex offender in the state in which the<br />person resides. See section 115 of Departments of Commerce, Justice, and State, the<br />Judiciary, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1998 (Pub. L. 105–119). Because the<br />effective date of this change was later than the effective date of the last issued Guidelines<br />Manual (November 1, 1998), the Commission did not amend &#167;&#167;5B1.3 and 5D1.3 to reflect<br />the new condition. However, the Commission did provide a footnote in each guideline<br />setting forth the new condition and alerting the user as to the date on which the condition<br />became effective. This amendment includes the sex offender condition as a specific<br />mandatory condition of probation and supervised release in both guidelines rather than in a<br />footnote.</td><td>Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2000.</td></tr><tr><td class="n">607</td><td>Amendment 607</td><td>Section 2D1.11(d) is amended in subdivision (9) by striking "At least 1.44<br />G but less than 1.92 KG of Isosafrole;" and inserting "At least 1.44 KG but less than 1.92<br />KG of Isosafrole;"; and by striking "At least 1.44 G but less than 1.92 KG of Safrole;" and<br />inserting "At least 1.44 KG but less than 1.92 KG of Safrole;".<br />November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II Amendment 608<br /><br />Section 2D1.11(d) is amended in subdivision (10) by striking "Less than 1.44 G" before "of<br />Isosafrole;" and inserting "Less than 1.44 KG"; and by striking "Less than 1.44 G" before<br />"of Safrole;" and inserting "Less than 1.44 KG".</td><td>Reason for Amendment: The amendment corrects a typographical error in the Chemical<br />Quantity Table in &#167;2D1.11 (Unlawfully Distributing, Importing, Exporting, or Possessing<br />a Listed Chemical) regarding certain quantities of Isosafrole and Safrole by changing those<br />quantities from grams to kilograms.</td><td>Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2000.</td></tr><tr><td class="n">608</td><td>Amendment 608</td><td>Section 1B1.10(c) is amended by striking "and 516." and inserting "516, 591,<br />599, and 606.".</td><td>Reason for Amendment: This amendment expands the listing in &#167;1B1.10(c) to implement<br />the directive in 28 U.S.C. &#167; 994(u) with respect to guideline amendments that may be<br />considered for retroactive application.</td><td>Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2000.</td></tr><tr><td class="n">609</td><td>Amendment 609</td><td>Section 2D1.1(b)(5) is amended by striking the comma after "substance" and<br />inserting a semicolon.<br />Section 2D1.1(b) is amended by redesignating subdivision (6) as subdivision (7); and by<br />inserting after subdivision (5) the following:<br />"(6) (Apply the greater):<br />(A) If the offense (i) involved the manufacture of amphetamine or<br />methamphetamine; and (ii) created a substantial risk of harm to (I)<br />human life other than a life described in subsection (b)(6)(B); or<br />(II) the environment, increase by 3 levels.

L. 106–878.<br />The Act requires the Commission to promulgate amendments under emergency amendment<br />authority. Although the Act generally provides that the Commission shall promulgate<br />various amendments "as soon as practicable," the substantial risk directive specifically<br />Amendment 608 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003<br /><br />requires that the amendment implementing the directive shall apply "to any offense occurring<br />on or after the date that is 60 days after the date of the enactment" of the Act.<br />The directive instructs the Commission to amend the federal sentencing guidelines with<br />respect to any offense relating to the manufacture, attempt to manufacture, or conspiracy to<br />manufacture amphetamine or methamphetamine in (1) the Controlled Substances Act (21<br />U.S.C. &#167; 801 et seq.); (2) the Controlled Substances Import and Export Act (21 U.S.C. &#167; 951<br />et seq.); or (3) the Maritime Drug Law Enforcement Act (46 U.S.C. App. &#167; 1901 et seq.).<br />The Act requires the Commission, in carrying out the substantial risk directive, to provide<br />the following enhancements—<br />(A) if the offense created a substantial risk of harm to human life (other than a life<br />described in subparagraph (B)) or the environment, increase the base offense level<br />for the offense—<br />(i) by not less than 3 offense levels above the applicable level in effect on<br />the date of the enactment of this Act; or<br />(ii) if the resulting base offense level after an increase under clause (i)<br />would be less than level 27, to not less than level 27; or<br />(B) if the offense created a substantial risk of harm to the life of a minor or<br />incompetent, increase the base offense level for the offense—<br />(i) by not less than 6 offense levels above the applicable level in effect on<br />the date of the enactment of this Act; or<br />(ii) if the resulting base offense level after an increase under clause (i)<br />would be less than level 30, to not less than level 30.<br />The pertinent aspects of this amendment are as follows:<br />(1) Guidelines Amended.—The amendment provides new enhancements in &#167;&#167;2D1.1<br />(Unlawful Manufacturing, Importing, Exporting, or Trafficking) and 2D1.10 (Endangering<br />Human Life While Illegally Manufacturing a Controlled Substance) that also apply in the<br />case of an attempt or a conspiracy to manufacture amphetamine or methamphetamine. The<br />amendment does not amend &#167;2D1.11 (Unlawfully Distributing, Importing, Exporting or<br />Possessing a Listed Chemical) or &#167;2D1.12 (Unlawful Possession, Manufacture, Distribution,<br />or Importation or Prohibited Flask or Equipment). Although offenses that involve the<br />manufacture of amphetamine or methamphetamine also are referenced in Appendix (A)<br />(Statutory Index) to &#167;&#167;2D1.11 and 2D1.12, the cross reference in these guidelines, which<br />applies if the offense involved the manufacture of a controlled substance, will result in<br />application of &#167;2D1.1 and accordingly, the new enhancements.<br />(2) Structure.—The basic structure of the amendment to &#167;&#167;2D1.1 and 2D1.10 tracks the<br />structure of the directive. Accordingly, in &#167;2D1.1, the amendment provides a three-level<br />increase and a minimum offense level of level 27 if the offense (A) involved the manufacture<br />of amphetamine or methamphetamine; and (B) created a substantial risk of either harm to<br />human life or the environment. For offenses that created a substantial risk of harm to the life<br /><br />of a minor or an incompetent, the amendment provides a six-level increase and a minimum<br />offense level of 30.<br />However, the structure of the amendment in &#167;2D1.10 differs from that in &#167;2D1.1 with<br />respect to the first prong of the enhancement (regarding substantial risk of harm to human<br />life or to the environment). Specifically, the amendment provides a three-level increase and<br />a minimum offense level of level 27 if the offense involved the manufacture of amphetamine<br />or methamphetamine without making application of the enhancement dependent upon<br />whether the offense also involved a substantial risk of either harm to human life or the<br />environment. Consideration of whether the offense involved a substantial risk of harm to<br />human life is unnecessary because &#167;2D1.10 applies only to convictions under 21 U.S.C. &#167;<br />858, and the creation of a substantial risk of harm to human life is an element of a &#167; 858<br />offense. Therefore, the base offense level already takes into account the substantial risk of<br />harm to human life. Consideration of whether the offense involved a substantial risk of harm<br />to the environment is unnecessary because the directive predicated application of the<br />enhancement on substantial risk of harm either to human life or to the environment, and the<br />creation of a substantial risk of harm to human life is necessarily present because it is an<br />element of the offense.<br />(3) Determining "Substantial Risk of Harm".—Neither the directive nor any statutory<br />provision defines "substantial risk of harm". Based on an analysis of relevant case law that<br />interpreted "substantial risk of harm", the amendment provides commentary setting forth<br />factors that may be relevant in determining whether a particular offense created a substantial<br />risk of harm.<br />(4) Definitions.—The definition of "incompetent" is modeled after several state statutes,<br />which proved useful for purposes of this amendment.<br />The definition of "minor" has the meaning given that term in Application Note 1 of the<br />Commentary to &#167;2A3.1 (Criminal Sexual Abuse).</td><td>Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is December 16, 2000.</td></tr><tr><td class="n">610</td><td>Amendment 610</td><td>The Commentary to &#167;2D1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in<br />Note 10 in the Drug Equivalency Tables in the subdivision captioned "LSD, PCP, and Other<br />Schedule I and II Hallucinogens (and their immediate precursors)*" in the line referenced<br />to "MDA" by striking "50 gm" and inserting "500 gm"; in the line referenced to "MDMA"<br />by striking "35 gm" and inserting "500 gm"; in the line referenced "MDEA" by striking "30<br />gm" and inserting "500 gm"; and by inserting "1 gm of Paramethoxymethamphetamine/PMA<br />= 500 gm of marihuana" after the line referenced to "MDEA".</td><td>Reason for Amendment: This amendment addresses the directive in the Ecstasy Anti-<br />Proliferation Act of 2000 (the "Act"), section 3664 of Pub. L. 106–310, which instructs the<br />Commission to provide, under emergency amendment authority, increased penalties for the<br />manufacture, importation, exportation, or trafficking of Ecstasy. The directive specifically<br />requires the Commission to increase the base offense level for 3,4-<br />Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), 3,4-Methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA),<br />3,4-Methylenedioxy-N-ethylamphetamine (MDEA), Paramethoxymethamphetamine (PMA),<br />and any other controlled substance that is marketed as Ecstasy and that has either a chemical<br />structure similar to MDMA or an effect on the central nervous system substantially similar<br />Amendment 609 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003<br /><br />to or greater than MDMA.<br />The amendment addresses the directive by amending the Drug Equivalency Table in &#167;2D1.1,<br />Application Note 10, to increase substantially the marihuana equivalencies for the specified<br />controlled substances, which has the effect of substantially increasing the penalties for<br />offenses involving Ecstasy. The new penalties for Ecstasy trafficking provide penalties<br />which, gram for gram, are more severe than those for powder cocaine. Currently under the<br />Drug Equivalency Table, one gram of powder cocaine has a marihuana equivalency of 200<br />grams. This amendment sets the marihuana equivalency for one gram of Ecstasy at 500<br />grams.<br />There are a combination of reasons why the Commission has substantially increased the<br />penalties in response to the congressional directive. Much evidence received by the<br />Commission indicated that Ecstasy: (1) has powerful pharmacological effects; (2) has the<br />capacity to cause lasting physical harms, including brain damage; and (3) is being abused<br />by rapidly increasing numbers of teenagers and young adults. Indeed, the market for Ecstasy<br />is overwhelmingly comprised of people under the age of 25 years.<br />Before voting to promulgate this amendment, the Commission considered whether the<br />penalty levels for Ecstasy should be set at the same levels as for heroin (i.e., one gram of<br />heroin has a marihuana equivalency of 1000 grams) and decided that somewhat lesser<br />penalties were appropriate for Ecstasy for a number of reasons: (1) the potential for addiction<br />is greater with heroin; (2) heroin distribution often involves violence while, at this time,<br />violence is not reported in Ecstasy markets; (3) because it is a narcotic and is often injected,<br />the risk of death from overdose is much greater from heroin; and (4) because heroin is often<br />injected, there are more secondary health consequences, such as infections and the<br />transmission of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis.<br />Finally, based on information regarding Ecstasy trafficking patterns, the penalty levels<br />chosen are appropriate and sufficient to target serious and high-level traffickers and to<br />provide appropriate punishment, deterrence, and incentives for cooperation. The penalty<br />levels chosen for Ecstasy offenses provide five year sentences for serious traffickers (those<br />whose relevant conduct involved at least 800 pills) and ten year sentences for high-level<br />traffickers (those whose relevant conduct involved at least 8,000 pills).</td><td>Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is May 1, 2001.</td></tr><tr><td class="n">611</td><td>Amendment 611</td><td>Section 2D1.1(c)(1) is amended by inserting after the fifth entry the<br />following:<br />"15 KG or more of Amphetamine, or 1.5 KG or more of Amphetamine (actual);".<br />Section 2D1.1(c)(2) is amended by inserting after the fifth entry the following:<br />"At least 5 KG but less than 15 KG of Amphetamine, or at least 500 G but less than 1.5 KG<br />of Amphetamine (actual);".<br />Section 2D1.1(c)(3) is amended by inserting after the fifth entry the following:<br />"At least 1.5 KG but less than 5 KG of Amphetamine, or at least 150 G but less than 500 G<br />November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II Amendment 610<br /><br />of Amphetamine (actual);".<br />Section 2D1.1(c)(4) is amended by inserting after the fifth entry the following:<br />"At least 500 G but less than 1.5 KG of Amphetamine, or at least 50 G but less than 150 G<br />of Amphetamine (actual);".<br />Section 2D1.1(c)(5) is amended by inserting after the fifth entry the following:<br />"At least 350 G but less than 500 G of Amphetamine, or at least 35 G but less than 50 G of<br />Amphetamine (actual);".<br />Section 2D1.1(c)(6) is amended by inserting after the fifth entry the following:<br />"At least 200 G but less than 350 G of Amphetamine, or at least 20 G but less than 35 G of<br />Amphetamine (actual);".<br />Section 2D1.1(c)(7) is amended by inserting after the fifth entry the following:<br />"At least 50 G but less than 200 G of Amphetamine, or at least 5 G but less than 20 G of<br />Amphetamine (actual);".<br />Section 2D1.1(c)(8) is amended by inserting after the fifth entry the following:<br />"At least 40 G but less than 50 G of Amphetamine, or at least 4 G but less than 5 G of<br />Amphetamine (actual);".<br />Section 2D1.1(c)(9) is amended by inserting after the fifth entry the following:<br />"At least 30 G but less than 40 G of Amphetamine, or at least 3 G but less than 4 G of<br />Amphetamine (actual);".<br />Section 2D1.1(c)(10) is amended by inserting after the fifth entry the following:<br />"At least 20 G but less than 30 G of Amphetamine, or at least 2 G but less than 3 G of<br />Amphetamine (actual);".<br />Section 2D1.1(c)(11) is amended by inserting after the fifth entry the following:<br />"At least 10 G but less than 20 G of Amphetamine, or at least 1 G but less than 2 G of<br />Amphetamine (actual);".<br />Section 2D1.1(c)(12) is amended by inserting after the fifth entry the following:<br />"At least 5 G but less than 10 G of Amphetamine, or at least 500 MG but less than 1 G of<br />Amphetamine (actual);".<br />Section 2D1.1(c)(13) is amended by inserting after the fifth entry the following:<br />"At least 2.5 G but less than 5 G of Amphetamine, or at least 250 MG but less than 500 MG<br />Amendment 610 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003<br /><br />of Amphetamine (actual);".<br />Section 2D1.1(c)(14) is amended by inserting after the fifth entry the following:<br />"Less than 2.5 G of Amphetamine, or less than 250 MG of Amphetamine (actual);".<br />Section 2D1.1(c) is amended in Note (B) of the "Notes to Drug Quantity Table" by inserting<br />", ‘Amphetamine (actual)’," after "terms ‘PCP (actual)’"; by inserting ", amphetamine," after<br />"substance containing PCP"; and by inserting ", amphetamine (actual)," after "weight of the<br />PCP (actual)".<br />The Commentary to &#167;2D1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 9 by<br />inserting ", amphetamine," after "PCP".<br />The Commentary to &#167;2D1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 10 in the<br />Drug Equivalency Tables in the subdivision captioned "Cocaine and Other Schedule I and<br />II Stimulants (and their immediate precursors)*" by striking "200 gm" after "1 gm of<br />Amphetamine =" and inserting "2 kg"; and by inserting "1 gm of Amphetamine (Actual) =<br />20 kg of marihuana" after the line referenced to "Amphetamine".</td><td>Reason for Amendment: This emergency amendment implements the directive in the<br />Methamphetamine Anti-Proliferation Act of 2000, section 3611 of Pub.

This<br />amendment also treats amphetamine and methamphetamine identically, at a 1:1 ratio (i.e.,<br />the same quantities of amphetamine and methamphetamine would result in the same base<br />offense level) because of the similarities of the two substances. Specifically, amphetamine<br />and methamphetamine (1) chemically are similar; (2) are produced by a similar method and<br />are trafficked in a similar manner; (3) share similar methods of use; (4) affect the same parts<br />of the brain; and (5) have similar intoxicating effects. The amendment also distinguishes<br />between pure amphetamine (i.e., amphetamine (actual)) and amphetamine mixture in the<br />same manner, and at the same quantities, as pure methamphetamine (i.e., methamphetamine<br />(actual)) and methamphetamine mixture, respectively. The amendment reflects the view that<br />the 1:1 ratio is appropriate given the seriousness of these two controlled substances.</td><td>Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is May 1, 2001.</td></tr><tr><td class="n">612</td><td>Amendment 612</td><td>Section 2D1.11 is amended by striking subsection (d), captioned "Chemical<br />Quantity Table*" and by striking the Notes that follow subsection (d), captioned "*Notes"<br />as follows:<br />" (d) CHEMICAL QUANTITY TABLE*<br />Listed Chemicals and Quantity Base Offense Level<br />(1) List I Chemicals Level 30<br />17.8 KG or more of Benzaldehyde;<br />November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C -

When two or more list I chemicals are used together in the same<br />manufacturing process, calculate the offense level for each separately and<br />use the quantity that results in the greatest base offense level. In any other<br />case, the quantities should be added together (using the List I Chemical<br />Equivalency Table) for the purpose of calculating the base offense level.<br />Examples:<br />(a) The defendant was in possession of five kilograms of ephedrine<br />and 300 grams of hydriodic acid. Ephedrine and hydriodic acid<br />typically are used together in the same manufacturing process to<br />manufacture methamphetamine. Therefore, the base offense level<br />for each listed chemical is calculated separately and the list I<br />chemical with the higher base offense level is used. Five kilograms<br />of ephedrine result in a base offense level of 26; 300 grams of<br />hydriodic acid result in a base offense level of 16. In this case, the<br />base offense level would be 26.<br />(b) The defendant was in possession of five kilograms of ephedrine<br />and two kilograms of phenylacetic acid. Although both of these<br />chemicals are used to manufacture methamphetamine, they are not<br />used together in the same manufacturing process. Therefore, the<br />quantity of phenylacetic acid should be converted to an ephedrine<br />equivalency using the List I Chemical Equivalency Table and then<br />added to the quantity of ephedrine. In this case, the two kilograms<br />of phenylacetic acid convert to two kilograms of ephedrine (see<br />List I Chemical Equivalency Table), resulting in a total equivalency<br />of seven kilograms of ephedrine.",<br />and inserting the following:<br />November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II Amendment 611<br /><br />"4. Cases Involving Multiple Chemicals.—<br />(A) Determining the Base Offense Level for Two or More<br />Chemicals.—Except as provided in subdivision (B), if the offense<br />involves two or more chemicals, use the quantity of the single<br />chemical that results in the greatest offense level, regardless of<br />whether the chemicals are set forth in different tables or in different<br />categories (i.e., list I or list II) under subsections (d) and (e) of this<br />guideline.<br />Example: The defendant was in possession of five kilograms of<br />ephedrine and 300 grams of hydriodic acid. Ephedrine and<br />hydriodic acid typically are used together in the same<br />manufacturing process to manufacture methamphetamine. The<br />base offense level for each chemical is calculated separately and the<br />chemical with the higher base offense level is used. Five kilograms<br />of ephedrine result in a base offense level of level 38; 300 grams of<br />hydriodic acid result in a base offense level of level 26. In this<br />case, the base offense level would be level 38.<br />(B) Determining the Base Offense Level for Offenses involving<br />Ephedrine, Pseudoephedrine, or Phenylpropanolamine.—If the<br />offense involves two or more chemicals each of which is set forth<br />in the Ephedrine, Pseudoephedrine, and Phenylpropanolamine<br />Quantity Table, (i) aggregate the quantities of all such<br />chemicals, and (ii) determine the base offense level corresponding<br />to the aggregate quantity.<br />Example: The defendant was in possession of 80 grams of<br />ephedrine and 50 grams of phenylpropanolamine, an aggregate<br />quantity of 130 grams of such chemicals. The base offense level<br />corresponding to that aggregate quantity is level 32.<br />(C) Upward Departure.—In a case involving two or more chemicals<br />used to manufacture different controlled substances, or to<br />manufacture one controlled substance by different manufacturing<br />processes, an upward departure may be warranted if the offense<br />level does not adequately address the seriousness of the offense.".<br />The Commentary to &#167;2D1.11 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by striking Notes<br />5 and 6 in their entirety as follows:<br />"5. Where there are multiple list II chemicals, all quantities of the same list II<br />chemical are added together for purposes of determining the base offense<br />level. However, quantities of different list II chemicals are not aggregated<br />(see Note B to the Chemical Quantity Table). Thus, where multiple list II<br />chemicals are involved in the offense, the base offense level is determined<br />by using the base offense level for the single list II chemical resulting in the<br />greatest base offense level. For example, in the case of an offense involving<br />seven kilograms of methyl ethyl ketone and eight kilograms of acetone, the<br />Amendment 611 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003<br /><br />base offense level for the methyl ethyl ketone is 12 and the base offense<br />level for the acetone is 14; therefore, the base offense level is 14.<br />6. Where both list I chemicals and list II chemicals are involved, use the<br />greater of the base offense level for the list I chemicals or the list II<br />chemicals (see Note C to the Chemical Quantity Table).";<br />and by redesignating Notes 7 and 8 as Notes 5 and 6, respectively.<br />The Commentary to &#167;2D1.11 captioned "Background" is amended in the first sentence by<br />inserting "(including ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, and phenylpropanolamine)" after "list I<br />chemicals".<br />The Commentary to 2D1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 10 in the<br />"Drug Equivalency Tables" by inserting after the subdivision captioned "Schedule V<br />Substances******" the following new subdivision:<br />"List I Chemicals (relating to the manufacture of amphetamine or<br />methamphetamine)*******<br />1 gm of Ephedrine = 10 kg of marihuana<br />1 gm of Phenylpropanolamine = 10 kg of marihuana<br />1 gm of Pseudoephedrine = 10 kg of marihuana<br />*******Provided, that in a case involving ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, or<br />phenylpropanolamine tablets, use the weight of the ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, or<br />phenylpropanolamine contained in the tablets, not the weight of the entire tablets,<br />in calculating the base offense level.".</td><td>Reason for Amendment: This amendment is in response to the three-part directive in<br />section 3651 of the Methamphetamine Anti-Proliferation Act of 2000, Pub. L. 106–310 (the<br />"Act"), regarding enhanced punishment for trafficking in List I chemicals. That section<br />requires the Commission to promulgate an amendment implementing the directive under<br />emergency amendment authority.<br />First, this amendment provides a new chemical quantity table specifically for ephedrine,<br />pseudoephedrine, and phenylpropanolamine (PPA). The table ties the base offense levels<br />for these chemicals to the base offense levels for methamphetamine (actual) set forth in<br />&#167;2D1.1, assuming a 50 percent actual yield of the controlled substance from the chemicals.<br />(Methamphetamine (actual) is used rather than methamphetamine mixture because<br />ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, and PPA produce methamphetamine (actual)). This yield is<br />based on information provided by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) that the<br />typical yield of these substances for clandestine laboratories is 50 to 75 percent.<br />This new chemical quantity table has a maximum base offense level of level 38 (as opposed<br />to a maximum base offense level of level 30 for all other precursor chemicals). Providing<br />a maximum base offense level of level 38 complies with the directive to establish penalties<br />for these precursors that "correspond to the quantity of controlled substance that could have<br />reasonably been manufactured using the quantity of ephedrine, phenylpropanolamine, or<br />pseudoephedrine possessed or distributed." Additionally, this adjustment will have an<br />November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II Amendment 611<br /><br />impact on the relationship between &#167;&#167;2D1.1 and 2D1.11 by eliminating the six-level<br />distinction that currently exists between offenses that involve intent to manufacture<br />methamphetamine and offenses that involve an attempt to manufacture methamphetamine,<br />at least for offenses involving ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, and PPA.<br />This amendment eliminates the Ephedrine Equivalency Table in &#167;2D1.11 and, in its place,<br />provides an instruction for the court to determine the base offense level in cases involving<br />multiple precursors (other than ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, or PPA) by using the quantity<br />of the single chemical resulting in the greatest offense level. An upward departure is<br />provided for cases in which the offense level does not adequately address the seriousness of<br />the offense.<br />However, this amendment provides an exception to the rule for offenses that involve a<br />combination of ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, or PPA because these chemicals often are used<br />in the same manufacturing process. In a case that involves two or more of these chemicals,<br />the base offense level will be determined using the total quantity of these chemicals<br />involved. The purpose of this exception is twofold: (1) any of the three primary precursors<br />in the same table can be combined without difficulty; and (2) studies conducted by the DEA<br />indicate that because the manufacturing process for amphetamine and methamphetamine is<br />identical, there are cases in which the different precursors are included in the same batch of<br />drugs. If the chemical is PPA, amphetamine results; and if the chemical is ephedrine,<br />methamphetamine results.<br />Second, the amendment adds to the Drug Equivalency Tables in &#167;2D1.1 a conversion table<br />for these precursor chemicals, providing for a 50 percent conversion ratio. This is based on<br />data from the DEA that the actual yield from ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, or PPA typically<br />is in the range of 50 to 75 percent. The purpose of this part of the amendment is to achieve<br />the same punishment level (as is achieved by the first part of this amendment) for an offense<br />involving any of these precursor chemicals when such offense involved the manufacture of<br />methamphetamine and, as a result, is sentenced under &#167;2D1.1 pursuant to the cross reference<br />in &#167;2D1.11.<br />Third, this amendment increases the base offense level for Benzaldehyde, Hydriodic Acid,<br />Methylamine, Nitroethane, and Norpseudoephedrine by re-calibrating these levels to the<br />appropriate quantity of methamphetamine (actual) that could be produced assuming a 50<br />percent yield of chemical to drug and retaining a cap at level 30. Previously, these<br />chemicals had been linked to methamphetamine (mixture) penalty levels. Based on a study<br />conducted by the DEA, ephedrine and pseudoepehdrine are the primary precursors used to<br />make methamphetamine in the United States. Phenylproponolamine is the primary precursor<br />used to make amphetamine. Unlike the five additional List I chemicals, the chemical<br />structures of ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, and PPA are so similar to the resulting drug (i.e.,<br />methamphetamine or amphetamine) that the manufacture of methamphetamine or<br />amphetamine from ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, or PPA is a very simple one-step synthesis<br />which anyone can perform using a variety of chemical reagents. The manufacture of<br />methamphetamine or amphetamine from the five additional List I chemicals is a more<br />complex process which requires a heightened level of expertise.</td><td>Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is May 1, 2001.</td></tr><tr><td class="n">613</td><td>Amendment 613</td><td>The Commentary to &#167;2G1.1 captioned "Statutory Provisions" is amended by<br />Amendment 611 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003<br /><br />inserting "1591," before "2421".<br />The Commentary to &#167;2G1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 2 in the<br />fourth sentence by adding "(B)" after "purposes of subsection (b)(1)".<br />The Commentary to &#167;2G1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by adding at the end<br />the following:<br />"12.

This<br />amendment is in response to the directive found at section 112(b) of the Victims of<br />Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000 (the "Act"), Pub. L. 106–386. The<br />Commission expects to consider further revisions and additions to the specific offense<br />characteristics and punishment levels for these offenses, such as the possibility of providing<br />an alternative base offense level in &#167;2G1.1 (Promoting Prostitution or Prohibited Sexual<br />Conduct) for convictions under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1591 involving victims under the age of 14<br />years.<br />The directive confers emergency authority on the Commission to amend the federal<br />sentencing guidelines to reflect changes to 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1581(a) (Peonage), 1583<br />(Enticement into Slavery), and 1584 (Sale into Involuntary Servitude). The Commission<br />also is directed to consider how to address four new statutes: 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1589 (Forced<br />Labor); 1590 (Trafficking with Respect to Peonage, Involuntary Servitude or Forced Labor);<br />1591 (Sex Trafficking of Children by Force, Fraud or Coercion); and 1592 (Unlawful<br />Conduct with Respect to Documents in Furtherance of Peonage, Involuntary Servitude or<br />Forced Labor).<br />Specifically, the Commission is directed to "review and, if appropriate, amend the sentencing<br />guidelines applicable to . . . the trafficking of persons including . . . peonage, involuntary<br />servitude, slave trade offenses, and possession, transfer or sale of false immigration<br /><br />documents in furtherance of trafficking, and the Fair Labor Standards Act and the Migrant<br />and Seasonal Agricultural Worker Protection Act."<br />The Commission further is directed to "take all appropriate measures to ensure that these<br />sentencing guidelines . . . are sufficiently stringent to deter and adequately reflect the heinous<br />nature of these offenses." The Commission also is directed to "consider providing<br />sentencing enhancements" in cases which involve: (1) a large number of victims; (2) a<br />pattern of continued and flagrant violations; (3) the use or threatened use of a dangerous<br />weapon; or (4) the death or bodily injury of any person.<br />To address this multi-faceted directive, this amendment makes changes to several existing<br />guidelines and creates a new guideline for criminal violations of the Migrant and Seasonal<br />Agricultural Worker Protection Act. Although the directive instructs the Commission to<br />amend the guidelines applicable to the Fair Labor Standards Act (29 U.S.C. &#167; 201 et. seq.),<br />a criminal violation of the Fair Labor Standards Act is only a Class B misdemeanor. See 29<br />U.S.C. &#167; 216. Thus, the guidelines are not applicable to those offenses.<br />The amendment references the new offense at 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1591 to &#167;2G1.1. Section 1591<br />punishes a defendant who participates in the transporting or harboring of a person, or who<br />benefits from participating in such a venture, with the knowledge that force, fraud, or<br />coercion will be used to cause that person to engage in a commercial sex act or with<br />knowledge that the person is not 18 years old and will be forced to engage in a commercial<br />sex act. Despite the statute’s inclusion in a chapter of title 18 devoted mainly to peonage<br />offenses, section 1591 offenses are more analogous to the offenses referenced to the<br />prostitution guideline.<br />Section 1591 cases alternatively have been referred in Appendix A to &#167;2G2.1 (Sexually<br />Exploiting a Minor by Production of Sexually Explicit Visual or Printed Material; Custodian<br />Permitting Minor to Engage in Sexually Explicit Conduct; Advertisement for Minors to<br />Engage in Production). This has been done in anticipation that some portion of section 1591<br />cases will involve children being forced or coerced to engage in commercial sex acts for the<br />purpose of producing pornography. Such offenses, as recognized by the higher base offense<br />level at &#167;2G2.1, are more serious because they both involve specific harm to an individual<br />victim and further an additional criminal purpose, namely, commercial pornography.<br />The amendment maintains the view that &#167;2H4.1 (Peonage, Involuntary Servitude, and Slave<br />Trade) continues to be an appropriate tool for determining sentences for violations of 18<br />U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1581, 1583, and 1584. Section 2H4.1 also is designed to cover offenses under<br />three new statutes, 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1589, 1590, and 1592. Section 1589 punishes defendants<br />who provide or obtain the labor or services of another by the use of threats of serious harm<br />or physical restraint against a person, or by a scheme or plan intended to make the person<br />believe that if he or she did not perform the labor or services, he or she would suffer physical<br />restraint or serious harm. This statute also applies to defendants who provide or obtain labor<br />or services of another by abusing or threatening abuse of the law or the legal process. See<br />18 U.S.C. &#167; 1589.<br />Section 1590 punishes defendants who harbor, transport, or are otherwise involved in<br />obtaining, a person for labor or services. Section 1592 punishes a defendant who knowingly<br />possesses, destroys, or removes an actual passport, other immigration document, or<br />government identification document of another person in the course of a violation of &#167; 1581<br />Amendment 612 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003<br /><br />(peonage), &#167; 1583 (enticement into slavery), &#167; 1584 (sale into involuntary servitude), &#167; 1589<br />(forced labor), &#167; 1590 (trafficking with respect to these offenses), &#167; 1591 (sex trafficking of<br />children by force, fraud or coercion), or &#167; 1594(a) (attempts to violate these offenses).<br />Section 1592 also punishes a defendant who, with intent to violate &#167; 1581, &#167; 1583, &#167; 1584,<br />&#167; 1589, &#167; 1590, or &#167; 1591, knowingly possesses, destroys, or removes an actual passport,<br />other immigration document, or government identification document of another person.<br />These statutes prohibit the types of behaviors that have been traditionally sentenced under<br />&#167;2H4.1.<br />The amendment provides an alternative, less punitive base offense level of level 18 for those<br />who violate 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1592, an offense which limits participation in peonage cases to the<br />destruction or wrongful confiscation of a passport or other immigration document. This<br />alternative, lower base level reflects the lower statutory maximum sentence for &#167; 1592<br />offenses (i.e., 5 years).<br />Section 2H4.1(b)(2) has been expanded to provide a 4-level increase if a dangerous weapon<br />was used and a 2-level increase if a dangerous weapon was brandished or its use was<br />threatened. Currently, only actual use of a dangerous weapon is covered. This change<br />reflects the directive to consider an enhancement for the "use or threatened use of a<br />dangerous weapon." The commentary to &#167;2H4.1 is amended to clarify that the threatened<br />use of a dangerous weapon applies regardless of whether a dangerous weapon was actually<br />present.<br />The amendment also creates a new guideline, &#167;2H4.2 (Willful Violations of the Migrant and<br />Seasonal Agricultural Worker Protection Act), in response to the directive to amend the<br />guidelines applicable to such offenses. These offenses, which have a statutory maximum<br />sentence of one year imprisonment for first offenses and three years’ imprisonment for<br />subsequent offenses, currently are not referred to any specific guideline. The amendment<br />provides a base offense level of level 6 in recognition of the low statutory maximum<br />sentences set for these cases by Congress. Further, these offenses typically involve<br />violations of regulatory provisions. Setting the base offense level at level 6 provides<br />consistency with guidelines for other regulatory offenses. See, e.g., &#167;&#167;2N2.1 (Violations of<br />Statutes and Regulations Dealing With Any Food, Drug, Biological Product, Device,<br />Cosmetic, or Agricultural Product) and 2N3.1 (Odometer Laws and Regulations).<br />Subsections (b)(1), an enhancement for bodily injury, and (b)(2), an enhancement applicable<br />to defendants who commit the instant offense after previously sustaining a civil penalty for<br />similar misconduct, have been established to respond to the directive that the Commission<br />consider sentencing enhancement for these offense characteristics. This section addresses<br />the Department of Justice’s and the Department of Labor’s concern regarding prior<br />administrative and civil adjudications.<br />This amendment also addresses that portion of section 112 of the Act that amends chapter<br />77 of title 18, United States Code, to provide mandatory restitution for peonage and<br />involuntary servitude offenses. The amendment amends &#167;5E1.1 (Restitution) to include a<br />reference to 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1593 in the guideline provision regarding mandatory restitution.<br />By enactment of various sentencing enhancements and encouraged upward departures for<br />areas of concern identified by Congress, the Commission has provided for more severe<br />sentences for perpetrators of human trafficking offenses in keeping with the conclusion that<br />the offenses covered by this amendment are both heinous in nature and being committed<br />November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II Amendment 614<br /><br />with rapidly increasing frequency.</td><td>Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is May 1, 2001.</td></tr><tr><td class="n">614</td><td>Amendment 614</td><td>The Commentary to &#167;1B1.2 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in<br />Note 1 in the third sentence of the first paragraph by inserting "(written or made orally on<br />the record)" after "agreement".<br />The Commentary to &#167;1B1.2 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 1 by striking<br />the first two sentences of the third paragraph as follows:<br />"However, there is a limited exception to this general rule. Where a stipulation that<br />is set forth in a written plea agreement or made between the parties on the record<br />during a plea proceeding specifically establishes facts that prove a more serious<br />offense or offenses than the offense or offenses of conviction, the court is to apply<br />the guideline most applicable to the more serious offense or offenses established.",<br />and inserting:<br />"As set forth in the first paragraph of this note, an exception to this general rule is<br />that if a plea agreement (written or made orally on the record) contains a stipulation<br />that establishes a more serious offense than the offense of conviction, the guideline<br />section applicable to the stipulated offense is to be used. A factual statement or a<br />stipulation contained in a plea agreement (written or made orally on the record) is<br />a stipulation for purposes of subsection (a) only if both the defendant and the<br />government explicitly agree that the factual statement or stipulation is a stipulation<br />for such purposes. However, a factual statement or stipulation made after the plea<br />agreement has been entered, or after any modification to the plea agreement has<br />been made, is not a stipulation for purposes of subsection (a).".<br />The Commentary to &#167;1B1.2 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 1 in the third<br />paragraph by striking "may be imposed" and inserting "shall be imposed".<br />The Commentary to &#167;1B1.2 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 1 in the<br />second sentence of the fourth paragraph by striking "cases where" and inserting "a case in<br />which".</td><td>Reason for Amendment: This amendment addresses the circuit conflict regarding whether<br />admissions made by a defendant during a guilty plea hearing, without more, can be<br />considered stipulations for purposes of subsection (a) of &#167;1B1.2 (Application Instructions).<br />Compare, e.g., United States v. Nathan, 188 F.3d 190, 201 (3d Cir. 1999) (statements made<br />by defendants during the factual-basis hearing for a plea agreement do not constitute<br />stipulations for the purpose of this enhancement; a statement is a stipulation only if it is part<br />of a defendant’s written plea agreement or if both the government and the defendant<br />explicitly agree at a factual-basis hearing that the facts being placed on the record are<br />stipulations that might subject the defendant to &#167;1B1.2(a)); United States v.

Rutter, 897 F.2d<br />Amendment 613 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003<br /><br />1558, 1561 (10th Cir. 1990) (once the government agrees to a plea bargain without<br />extracting an admission, facts admitted by the defendant can be considered only as relevant<br />conduct in determining appropriate guideline range, not as stipulations under &#167;1B1.2(a)),<br />with United States v. Loos, 165 F.3d 504, 508 (7th Cir. 1998) (the objective behind<br />&#167;1B1.2(a) is best answered by interpreting "stipulations" to mean any acknowledgment by<br />the defendant that the defendant committed the acts that justify use of the more serious<br />guideline, not in the formal agreement); and United States v. Domino, 62 F.3d 716 (5th Cir.<br />1995) (same).<br />This amendment represents a narrow approach to the majority view that a factual statement<br />made by the defendant during the plea colloquy must be made as part of the plea agreement<br />in order to be considered a stipulation for purposes of &#167;1B1.2(a). This approach lessens the<br />possibility that the plea agreement will be modified during the course of the plea proceeding<br />without providing the parties, especially the defendant, with notice of the defendant’s<br />potential sentencing range.</td><td>Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2001.</td></tr><tr><td class="n">615</td><td>Amendment 615</td><td>The Commentary to &#167;2A2.2 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by<br />striking Notes 1 through 3 as follows:<br />"1. ‘Aggravated assault’ means a felonious assault that involved (A) a<br />dangerous weapon with intent to do bodily harm (i.e., not merely to<br />frighten), or (B) serious bodily injury, or (C) an intent to commit another<br />felony.<br />2.

Definitions.—For purposes of this guideline:<br />‘Aggravated assault’ means a felonious assault that involved (A) a<br />dangerous weapon with intent to cause bodily injury (i.e., not merely to<br />frighten) with that weapon; (B) serious bodily injury; or (C) an intent to<br />commit another felony.<br />‘Brandished,’ ‘bodily injury,’ ‘firearm,’ ‘otherwise used,’ ‘permanent or<br />life-threatening bodily injury,’ and ‘serious bodily injury,’ have the<br />meaning given those terms in &#167;1B1.1 (Application Instructions),<br />Application Note 1.<br /><br />‘Dangerous weapon’ has the meaning given that term in &#167;1B1.1,<br />Application Note 1, and includes any instrument that is not ordinarily used<br />as a weapon (e.g., a car, a chair, or an ice pick) if such an instrument is<br />involved in the offense with the intent to commit bodily injury.<br />2. Application of Subsection (b)(2).—In a case involving a dangerous weapon<br />with intent to cause bodily injury, the court shall apply both the base<br />offense level and subsection (b)(2).<br />3. More than Minimal Planning.—For purposes of subsection (b)(1), ‘more<br />than minimal planning’ means more planning than is typical for commission<br />of the offense in a simple form. ‘More than minimal planning’ also exists<br />if significant affirmative steps were taken to conceal the offense, other than<br />conduct to which &#167;3C1.1 (Obstructing or Impeding the Administration of<br />Justice) applies. For example, waiting to commit the offense when no<br />witnesses were present would not alone constitute more than minimal<br />planning. By contrast, luring the victim to a specific location or wearing a<br />ski mask to prevent identification would constitute more than minimal<br />planning.".<br />The Commentary to &#167;2A2.2 captioned "Background" is amended by striking the text of the<br />background as follows:<br />" This section applies to serious (aggravated) assaults. Such offenses<br />occasionally may involve planning or be committed for hire. Consequently, the<br />structure follows &#167;2A2.1.<br />There are a number of federal provisions that address varying degrees of<br />assault and battery. The punishments under these statutes differ considerably, even<br />among provisions directed to substantially similar conduct. For example, if the<br />assault is upon certain federal officers ‘while engaged in or on account of . . .<br />official duties,’ the maximum term of imprisonment under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 111 is three<br />years. If a dangerous weapon is used in the assault on a federal officer, the<br />maximum term of imprisonment is ten years. However, if the same weapon is used<br />to assault a person not otherwise specifically protected, the maximum term of<br />imprisonment under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 113(c) is five years. If the assault results in serious<br />bodily injury, the maximum term of imprisonment under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 113(f) is ten<br />years, unless the injury constitutes maiming by scalding, corrosive, or caustic<br />substances under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 114, in which case the maximum term of<br />imprisonment is twenty years.",<br />and inserting the following:<br />" This guideline covers felonious assaults that are more serious than minor<br />assaults because of the presence of an aggravating factor, i.e., serious bodily injury,<br />the involvement of a dangerous weapon with intent to cause bodily injury, or the<br />intent to commit another felony. Such offenses occasionally may involve planning<br />or be committed for hire. Consequently, the structure follows &#167;2A2.1 (Assault with<br />Intent to Commit Murder; Attempted Murder). This guideline also covers attempted<br />manslaughter and assault with intent to commit manslaughter. Assault with intent<br />Amendment 614 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003<br /><br />to commit murder is covered by &#167;2A2.1. Assault with intent to commit rape is<br />covered by &#167;2A3.1 (Criminal Sexual Abuse; Attempt to Commit Criminal Sexual<br />Abuse).<br />An assault that involves the presence of a dangerous weapon is aggravated<br />in form when the presence of the dangerous weapon is coupled with the intent to<br />cause bodily injury. In such a case, the base offense level and the weapon<br />enhancement in subsection (b)(2) take into account different aspects of the offense,<br />even if application of the base offense level and the weapon enhancement is based<br />on the same conduct.".</td><td>Reason for Amendment: This amendment responds to a circuit conflict regarding whether<br />the four-level enhancement in subsection (b)(2)(B) of &#167;2A2.2 (Aggravated Assault) for use<br />of a dangerous weapon during an aggravated assault is impermissible double counting.<br />Compare United States v. Williams, 954 F.2d 204, 205-08 (4th Cir. 1992) (applying the<br />dangerous weapon enhancement under &#167;2A2.2(b)(2)(B) for defendant’s use of his chair as<br />a dangerous weapon did not constitute impermissible double counting even though that<br />conduct increased the defendant’s offense level twice: first, by triggering the application of<br />the aggravated assault guideline, and second, as the basis for the four-level enhancement for<br />use of a dangerous weapon), with United States v. Hudson, 972 F.2d 504, 506-07 (2d Cir.<br />1992) (in a case in which the use of an automobile caused the crime to be classified as an<br />aggravated assault, the court may not enhance the base offense level under &#167;2A2.2(b) for use<br />of the same, non-inherently dangerous weapon).<br />This amendment addresses the circuit conflict by providing in the aggravated assault<br />guideline that (1) both the base offense level of level 15 and the weapon use enhancement<br />in subsection (b)(2) shall apply to aggravated assaults that involve a dangerous weapon with<br />intent to cause bodily harm; and (2) an instrument, such as a car or chair, that ordinarily is<br />not used as a weapon may qualify as a dangerous weapon for purposes of the use of the<br />aggravated assault guideline and the application of subsection (b)(2) when the defendant<br />involves it in the offense with the intent to cause bodily harm.</td><td>Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2001.</td></tr><tr><td class="n">616</td><td>Amendment 616</td><td>The Commentary to &#167;2A3.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by<br />striking Note 5 as follows:<br />"5.

L. 105–314<br />(the "Act"), which contains several directives to the Commission. In furtherance of the<br />directives, the Commission initiated a comprehensive examination of the guidelines under<br />which most sex crimes are sentenced. Amendment 592, effective November 1, 2000,<br />addressed a number of these directives. (See Amendment 592.)<br />The first part of the amendment addresses the Act’s directive to increase penalties in any<br />case in which the defendant engaged in a pattern of activity of sexual abuse or sexual<br />exploitation of a minor. In response to this directive, the amendment provides a new Chapter<br />Four (Criminal History and Criminal Livelihood) guideline, &#167;4B1.5 (Repeat and Dangerous<br />Sex Offender Against Minors), that focuses on repeat child sex offenders. This new<br />guideline works in a coordinated manner with &#167;4B1.1 (Career Offender) and creates a tiered<br />approach to punishing repeat child sex offenders.<br />The first tier, in &#167;4B1.5(a), aims to incapacitate repeat child sex offenders who have an<br />instant offense of conviction of sexual abuse of a minor and a prior felony conviction for<br />sexual abuse of a minor (but to whom &#167;4B1.1 does not apply). This provision subjects a<br />defendant to the greater of the offense level determined under Chapters Two and Three or<br />the offense level obtained from a table that, like the table in &#167;4B1.1, bases the applicable<br />offense level on the statutory maximum for the offense. In addition, the defendant is subject<br />to an enhanced criminal history category of not less than Category V, similar to &#167;4B1.1<br />(which provides for Category VI). By statute, defendants convicted of a federal sex offense<br />are subject to twice the statutory maximum penalty for a subsequent sex offense conviction.<br />This guideline provision effectuates the Commission’s and Congress's intent to punish repeat<br />child sex offenders severely.<br />The second tier, in &#167;4B1.5(b), provides a five-level increase in the offense level and a<br />minimum offense level of level 22 for defendants who are not subject to either &#167;4B1.1 or to<br />&#167;4B1.5(a) and who have engaged in a pattern of activity involving prohibited sexual conduct<br />with minors. This part of the guideline does not rely on prior convictions to increase the<br />penalty for those who have a pattern of activity of sexual abuse or exploitation of a minor.<br />The pattern of activity enhancement requires that the defendant engaged in prohibited sexual<br />conduct on at least two separate occasions and that at least two minors were victims of the<br />sexual conduct. This provision is similar to the existing five-level pattern of activity<br />enhancement in subsection (b)(4) of &#167;2G2.2 (Trafficking in Material Involving the Sexual<br />Exploitation of a Minor; Receiving, Transporting, Shipping, or Advertising Material<br />Involving the Sexual Exploitation of a Minor; Possessing Material Involving the Sexual<br />Exploitation of a Minor with Intent to Traffic) and effectuates the Commission’s and<br />Congress’s intent to punish severely offenders who engage in a pattern of activity involving<br />the sexual abuse or exploitation of minors.<br />Conforming amendments are made to the criminal sexual abuse guidelines in Chapter Two,<br />Amendment 615 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003<br /><br />Part A, Subpart 3 to delete the upward departure provisions for prior sentences for similar<br />conduct; that factor is now taken into account in the new guideline.<br />In addition to creating a new guideline, this part of the amendment also modifies &#167;5D1.2<br />(Term of Supervised Release) to provide that the recommended term of supervised release<br />for a defendant convicted of a sex crime is the maximum term authorized by statute.<br />Amendments to &#167;&#167;5B1.3 (Conditions of Probation) and 5D1.3 (Conditions of Supervised<br />Release) effectuate the Commission’s intent that offenders who commit sex crimes receive<br />appropriate treatment and monitoring.<br />The second part of the amendment addresses a circuit conflict regarding whether multiple<br />counts of possession, receipt, or transportation of images containing child pornography<br />should be grouped together pursuant to subsection (a) or (b) of &#167;3D1.2 (Groups of Closely<br />Related Counts). Resolution of the conflict depends, in part, on determining who is the<br />victim of the offense: the child depicted in the pornography images or society as a whole.<br />Six circuits have held that the child depicted is the victim, and, therefore, that the counts are<br />not grouped. See United States v. Norris, 159 F.3d 926 (5th Cir. 1998); United States v.<br />Hibbler, 159 F.3d 233 (6th Cir. 1998); United States v. Ketcham, 80 F.3d 789 (3d Cir.<br />1996); United States v. Rugh, 968 F.2d 750 (8th Cir. 1992); United States v. Boos, 127 F.3d<br />1207 (9th Cir. 1997), cert. denied, 522 U.S. 1066 (1998); and United States v. Tillmon, 195<br />F.3d 640 (11th Cir. 1999). In contrast, one circuit has held that society as a whole is the<br />victim of these types of offenses, and, therefore, that one count of interstate transportation<br />of child pornography does not group with a count of interstate transportation of a minor with<br />intent to engage in illegal sexual activity in a case in which the child portrayed in the<br />pornography was the same child transported. See United States v. Toler, 901 F.2d 399 (4th<br />Cir. 1990).<br />In addressing the circuit conflict, the Commission adopted a position that provides for<br />grouping of multiple counts of child pornography distribution, receipt, and possession<br />pursuant to &#167;3D1.2(d). Grouping multiple counts of these offenses pursuant to &#167;3D1.2(d)<br />is appropriate because these offenses typically are continuous and ongoing enterprises. This<br />grouping provision does not require the determination of whether counts involve the same<br />victim in order to calculate a combined adjusted offense level for multiple counts of<br />conviction which, particularly in these kinds of cases, could be complex and time<br />consuming. Consistent with the provisions of subsection (a)(2) of &#167;1B1.3 (Relevant<br />Conduct), this approach provides that additional images of child pornography (often<br />involved in the case, but outside of the offense of conviction) shall be considered by the<br />court in determining the appropriate sentence for the defendant if the conduct related to those<br />images is part of the same course of conduct or common scheme or plan.<br />The third part of the amendment makes several modifications to &#167;2A3.2 (Criminal Sexual<br />Abuse of a Minor Under the Age of Sixteen Years (Statutory Rape) or Attempt to Commit<br />Such Acts). The amendment responds to the directive in the Act to provide an enhancement<br />for offenses under chapter 117 of title 18, United States Code, involving the transportation<br />of minors for prostitution or prohibited sexual conduct. The amendment increases the<br />offense levels in &#167;2A3.2 and in &#167;2A3.4 (Abusive Sexual Contact or Attempt to Commit<br />Abusive Sexual Contact). The Act focuses on those individuals who travel to meet or<br />transport minors for illegal sexual activity by providing increased statutory maximum<br />penalties for those individuals. In response, the increase in penalties in these guidelines were<br />geared toward those individuals. Specifically, the amendment distinguishes between chapter<br /><br />117 offenses that involve the commission of a sexual act or sexual contact and those offenses<br />(e.g., sting cases) that do not, by providing an alternative base offense level in &#167;2A3.2 for<br />chapter 117 offenses that also involve the commission of a sexual act or sexual contact that<br />is three levels greater (i.e., level 24) than the base offense level applicable to chapter 117<br />offenses that do not involve a sexual act or sexual contact.<br />The amendment provides a three-level increase in the base offense level for offenses<br />sentenced under &#167;2A3.2, such that the base offense level (1) for statutory rape<br />unaccompanied by aggravating conduct is increased from level 15 to level 18; (2) for a<br />chapter 117 offense (unaccompanied by a sexual act or sexual contact) is increased from<br />level 18 to level 21; and (3) for a chapter 117 offense (accompanied by a sexual act or sexual<br />contact) results in a base offense level of level 24. The amendment reflects the seriousness<br />accorded criminal sexual abuse offenses by Congress, which provided for statutory<br />maximum penalties of 15 years’ imprisonment (or 30 years’ imprisonment with a prior<br />conviction for a sex crime). A defendant who transmits child pornography to a minor as a<br />means of enticing the minor to engage in illegal sexual activity will receive a sentence<br />increase when that defendant subsequently travels across state lines to engage in illegal<br />sexual activity with that minor. Therefore, this increase also maintains the proportionality<br />between &#167;&#167;2A3.2 and 2G2.2.<br />The third part of the amendment also makes conforming changes to &#167;2A3.2 to ensure that<br />some chapter 117 offenses that do not include aggravating conduct receive the offense level<br />applicable to statutory rape in its basic form. Technical changes made by the amendment<br />(such as the addition of headings and the reordering of applications notes) are not intended<br />to have substantive effect.</td><td>Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2001.</td></tr><tr><td class="n">617</td><td>Amendment 617</td><td>Section 2A6.2(a) is amended by striking "14" and inserting "18".<br />Section 2A6.2(c) is amended by striking subdivision (1) as follows:<br />"(1) If the offense involved conduct covered by another offense guideline from<br />Chapter Two, Part A (Offenses Against the Person), apply that offense<br />guideline, if the resulting offense level is greater than that determined<br />above.",<br />and inserting the following:<br />"(1) If the offense involved the commission of another criminal offense, apply<br />the offense guideline from Chapter Two, Part A (Offenses Against the<br />Person) most applicable to that other criminal offense, if the resulting<br />offense level is greater than that determined above.".<br />The Commentary to &#167;2A6.2 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 1 by striking<br />the 1-em dash and inserting a colon; and by striking the last paragraph as follows:<br />"‘Stalking’ means traveling with the intent to injure or harass another person and,<br />in the course of, or as a result of, such travel, placing the person in reasonable fear<br />of death or serious bodily injury to the person or the person’s immediate family.<br />Amendment 615 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003<br /><br />See 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2261A. ‘Immediate family’ has the meaning set forth in 18 U.S.C.<br />&#167; 115(c)(2).",<br />and inserting the following:<br />"‘Stalking’ means (A) traveling with the intent to kill, injure, harass, or intimidate<br />another person and, in the course of, or as a result of, such travel, placing the person<br />in reasonable fear of death or serious bodily injury to that person or an immediate<br />family member of that person; or (B) using the mail or any facility of interstate or<br />foreign commerce to engage in a course of conduct that places that person in<br />reasonable fear of the death of, or serious bodily injury to, that person or an<br />immediate family member of that person. See 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2261A. ‘Immediate<br />family member’ (A) has the meaning given that term in 18 U.S.C. &#167; 115(c)(2); and<br />(B) includes a spouse or intimate partner. ‘Course of conduct’ and ‘spouse or<br />intimate partner’ have the meaning given those terms in 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2266(2) and<br />(7), respectively.".<br />The Commentary to &#167;1B1.5 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 3 by<br />inserting after the first sentence the following:<br />"Consistent with the provisions of &#167;1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct), such other offense<br />includes conduct that may be a state or local offense and conduct that occurred<br />under circumstances that would constitute a federal offense had the conduct taken<br />place within the territorial or maritime jurisdiction of the United States.".</td><td>Reason for Amendment: This amendment addresses section 1107 of the Victims of<br />Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000, Pub. L 106–386 (the "Act"). That section<br />amends 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2261, 2261A, and 2262 to broaden the reach of those statutes to<br />include international travel to stalk, commit domestic violence, or violate a protective order.<br />Section 2261A also is amended to broaden the category of persons protected by this statute<br />to include intimate partners of the person stalked. The Act also creates a new offense at<br />section 2261A(2) that prohibits the use of the mail or any facility of interstate or foreign<br />commerce to commit a stalking offense. Several technical changes were also made to these<br />statutes.<br />The Act includes a directive to the Commission to amend the federal sentencing guidelines<br />to reflect the changes made to 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2261, with specific consideration to be given to<br />the following factors: (1) whether the guidelines relating to stalking offenses should be<br />modified in light of the amendment made by this subsection; and (2) whether any changes<br />the Commission may make to the guidelines pursuant to clause (1) should also be made with<br />respect to offenses under chapter 110A of title 18, United States Code (stalking and domestic<br />violence offenses).<br />For several reasons, the amendment refers the new stalking by mail offense, like other<br />stalking offenses, to &#167;2A6.2 (Stalking or Domestic Violence). First, the statutory penalties<br />for stalking by mail are the same as the statutory penalties for other stalking offenses.<br />Second, although there was some consideration to refer this new offense to &#167;2A6.1<br />(Threatening or Harassing Communications), stalking by mail offenses differ significantly<br />from threatening communications in that the former require the defendant’s intent to kill, or<br />injure a person, or place a person in reasonable fear of death or serious bodily injury. Third,<br />November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II Amendment 616<br /><br />referencing stalking by mail offenses to &#167;2A6.1 could result in these offenses receiving<br />higher penalties than other stalking offenses. For example, a defendant who writes a<br />threatening letter, violates a protective order, and engages in some conduct evidencing an<br />intent to carry out such threat, would receive an offense level of level 20 under &#167;2A6.1. A<br />defendant who engages in stalking by mail, violates a protective order, and actually commits<br />bodily injury on the person who is the subject of the protection order would have received,<br />prior to this amendment, an offense level of level 18 under &#167;2A6.2. This amendment reflects<br />the policy judgment that the second defendant should receive punishment equal to, or<br />perhaps greater than, that received by the first defendant. Accordingly, because of concern<br />for proportionality in sentencing stalking and domestic violence offenses relative to other<br />crimes, such as threatening or harassing communications, this amendment increases the base<br />offense level in &#167;2A6.2 from level 14 to level 18. Setting the base offense level at level 18<br />for stalking and domestic violence crimes ensures that these offenses are sentenced at or<br />above the offense levels for offenses involving threatening and harassing communications.<br />The amendment also conforms the definition of "stalking" in Application Note 1 of &#167;2A6.2<br />to the statutory changes made by the Act. Additionally, the amendment modifies the<br />language of subsection (c) in &#167;2A6.2 to clarify application of the cross reference. This<br />change is consistent with the amendment to Application Note 3 of &#167;1B1.5 (Interpretation of<br />References to Other Offense Guidelines), which also clarifies the operation of cross<br />references generally.<br />These revisions are designed to clarify that, unless otherwise specified, cross references in<br />Chapter Two (Offense Conduct) are to be determined consistently with the provisions of<br />&#167;1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct). Therefore, in a case in which the guideline includes a reference<br />to use another guideline if the conduct involved another offense, the other offense includes<br />conduct that may be a state or local offense and conduct that occurred under circumstances<br />that would constitute a federal offense had the conduct taken place within the territorial or<br />maritime jurisdiction of the United States.</td><td>Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2001.</td></tr><tr><td class="n">618</td><td>Amendment 618</td><td>Chapter Two is amended by striking the heading to Part B, the heading to<br />Subpart 1 of Part B, and the Introductory Commentary to such subpart as follows:<br />" PART B - OFFENSES INVOLVING PROPERTY<br />1.

For additional<br />statutory provision(s), see Appendix A (Statutory Index).<br />Application Notes:<br />1. ‘More than minimal planning,’ ‘firearm,’ and ‘destructive device’ are<br />defined in the Commentary to &#167;1B1.1 (Application Instructions).<br />‘Trade secret’ is defined in 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1839(3).<br />‘Foreign instrumentality’ and ‘foreign agent’ are defined in 18 U.S.C. &#167;<br />1839(1) and (2), respectively.<br />‘National cemetery’ means a cemetery (A) established under section 2400<br />of title 38, United States Code; or (B) under the jurisdiction of the Secretary<br />of the Army, the Secretary of the Navy, the Secretary of the Air Force, or<br />the Secretary of the Interior.<br />2. ‘Loss’ means the value of the property taken, damaged, or destroyed.<br />Ordinarily, when property is taken or destroyed the loss is the fair market<br />value of the particular property at issue. Where the market value is difficult<br />to ascertain or inadequate to measure harm to the victim, the court may<br />measure loss in some other way, such as reasonable replacement cost to the<br />victim. Loss does not include the interest that could have been earned had<br />the funds not been stolen. When property is damaged, the loss is the cost<br />of repairs, not to exceed the loss had the property been destroyed.<br />Examples: (1) In the case of a theft of a check or money order, the loss is<br />November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II Amendment 617<br /><br />the loss that would have occurred if the check or money order had been<br />cashed. (2) In the case of a defendant apprehended taking a vehicle, the<br />loss is the value of the vehicle even if the vehicle is recovered immediately.<br />If the offense involved making a fraudulent loan or credit card application,<br />or other unlawful conduct involving a loan, a counterfeit access device, or<br />an unauthorized access device, the loss is to be determined in accordance<br />with the Commentary to &#167;2F1.1 (Fraud and Deceit). For example, in<br />accordance with Application Note 17 of the Commentary to &#167;2F1.1, in a<br />case involving an unauthorized access device (such as a stolen credit card),<br />loss includes any unauthorized charge(s) made with the access device. In<br />such a case, the loss shall be not less than $500 per unauthorized access<br />device. For purposes of this application note, ‘counterfeit access device’<br />and ‘unauthorized access device’ have the meaning given those terms in 18<br />U.S.C. &#167; 1029(e)(2) and (e)(3), respectively.<br />In certain cases, an offense may involve a series of transactions without a<br />corresponding increase in loss. For example, a defendant may embezzle<br />$5,000 from a bank and conceal this embezzlement by shifting this amount<br />from one account to another in a series of nine transactions over a six-<br />month period. In this example, the loss is $5,000 (the amount taken), not<br />$45,000 (the sum of the nine transactions), because the additional<br />transactions did not increase the actual or potential loss.<br />In stolen property offenses (receiving, transporting, transferring,<br />transmitting, or possessing stolen property), the loss is the value of the<br />stolen property determined as in a theft offense.<br />In an offense involving unlawfully accessing, or exceeding authorized<br />access to, a ‘protected computer’ as defined in 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1030(e)(2)(A)<br />or (B), ‘loss’ includes the reasonable cost to the victim of conducting a<br />damage assessment, restoring the system and data to their condition prior<br />to the offense, and any lost revenue due to interruption of service.<br />In the case of a partially completed offense (e.g., an offense involving a<br />completed theft that is part of a larger, attempted theft), the offense level is<br />to be determined in accordance with the provisions of &#167;2X1.1 (Attempt,<br />Solicitation, or Conspiracy) whether the conviction is for the substantive<br />offense, the inchoate offense (attempt, solicitation, or conspiracy), or both;<br />see Application Note 4 in the Commentary to &#167;2X1.1.<br />3. For the purposes of subsection (b)(1), the loss need not be determined with<br />precision. The court need only make a reasonable estimate of the loss,<br />given the available information. This estimate, for example, may be based<br />upon the approximate number of victims and the average loss to each<br />victim, or on more general factors such as the scope and duration of the<br />offense.<br />4. Controlled substances should be valued at their estimated street value.<br />Amendment 617 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003<br /><br />5. ‘Undelivered United States mail’ means mail that has not actually been<br />received by the addressee or his agent (e.g., it includes mail that is in the<br />addressee’s mail box).<br />6. ‘From the person of another’ refers to property, taken without the use of<br />force, that was being held by another person or was within arms’ reach.<br />Examples include pick-pocketing or non-forcible purse-snatching, such as<br />the theft of a purse from a shopping cart.<br />7. Subsection (b)(5), referring to an ‘organized scheme to steal vehicles or<br />vehicle parts,’ provides an alternative minimum measure of loss in the case<br />of an ongoing, sophisticated operation such as an auto theft ring or ‘chop<br />shop.’ ‘Vehicles’ refers to all forms of vehicles, including aircraft and<br />watercraft.<br />8. ‘Financial institution,’ as used in this guideline, is defined to include any<br />institution described in 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 20, 656, 657, 1005-1007, and 1014;<br />any state or foreign bank, trust company, credit union, insurance company,<br />investment company, mutual fund, savings (building and loan) association,<br />union or employee pension fund; any health, medical or hospital insurance<br />association; brokers and dealers registered, or required to be registered, with<br />the Securities and Exchange Commission; futures commodity merchants<br />and commodity pool operators registered, or required to be registered, with<br />the Commodity Futures Trading Commission; and any similar entity,<br />whether or not insured by the federal government. ‘Union or employee<br />pension fund’ and ‘any health, medical, or hospital insurance association,’<br />as used above, primarily include large pension funds that serve many<br />individuals (e.g., pension funds of large national and international<br />organizations, unions, and corporations doing substantial interstate<br />business), and associations that undertake to provide pension, disability, or<br />other benefits (e.g., medical or hospitalization insurance) to large numbers<br />of persons.<br />9. An offense shall be deemed to have ‘substantially jeopardized the safety<br />and soundness of a financial institution’ if, as a consequence of the offense,<br />the institution became insolvent; substantially reduced benefits to<br />pensioners or insureds; was unable on demand to refund fully any deposit,<br />payment, or investment; was so depleted of its assets as to be forced to<br />merge with another institution in order to continue active operations; or was<br />placed in substantial jeopardy of any of the above.<br />10. ‘The defendant derived more than $1,000,000 in gross receipts from the<br />offense,’ as used in subsection (b)(6)(B), generally means that the gross<br />receipts to the defendant individually, rather than to all participants,<br />exceeded $1,000,000. ‘Gross receipts from the offense’ includes all<br />property, real or personal, tangible or intangible, which is obtained directly<br />or indirectly as a result of such offense. See 18 U.S.C. &#167; 982(a)(4).<br />11. If the defendant is convicted under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 225 (relating to a continuing<br />financial crimes enterprise), the offense level is that applicable to the<br />November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II Amendment 617<br /><br />underlying series of offenses comprising the ‘continuing financial crimes<br />enterprise.’<br />12. If subsection (b)(6)(A) or (B) applies, there shall be a rebuttable<br />presumption that the offense involved ‘more than minimal planning.’<br />13. If the offense involved theft or embezzlement from an employee pension or<br />welfare benefit plan (a violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 664) and the defendant was<br />a fiduciary of the benefit plan, an adjustment under &#167;3B1.3 (Abuse of<br />Position of Trust or Use of Special Skill) will apply. ‘Fiduciary of the<br />benefit plan’ is defined in 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1002(21)(A) to mean a person who<br />exercises any discretionary authority or control in respect to the<br />management of such plan or exercises authority or control in respect to<br />management or disposition of its assets, or who renders investment advice<br />for a fee or other direct or indirect compensation with respect to any<br />moneys or other property of such plan, or has any authority or responsibility<br />to do so, or who has any discretionary authority or responsibility in the<br />administration of such plan.<br />If the offense involved theft or embezzlement from a labor union (a<br />violation of 29 U.S.C. &#167; 501(c)) and the defendant was a union officer or<br />occupied a position of trust in the union as set forth in 29 U.S.C. &#167; 501(a),<br />an adjustment under &#167;3B1.3 (Abuse of Position of Trust or Use of Special<br />Skill) will apply.<br />14. In cases where the loss determined under subsection (b)(1) does not fully<br />capture the harmfulness of the conduct, an upward departure may be<br />warranted. For example, the theft of personal information or writings (e.g.,<br />medical records, educational records, a diary) may involve a substantial<br />invasion of a privacy interest that would not be addressed by the monetary<br />loss provisions of subsection (b)(1).<br />15. In cases involving theft of information from a ‘protected computer’, as<br />defined in 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1030(e)(2)(A) or (B), an upward departure may be<br />warranted where the defendant sought the stolen information to further a<br />broader criminal purpose.<br />Background: The value of the property stolen plays an important role in<br />determining sentences for theft and other offenses involving stolen property because<br />it is an indicator of both the harm to the victim and the gain to the defendant.<br />Because of the structure of the Sentencing Table (Chapter 5, Part A), subsection<br />(b)(1) results in an overlapping range of enhancements based on the loss.<br />The guidelines provide an enhancement for more than minimal planning,<br />which includes most offense behavior involving affirmative acts on multiple<br />occasions. Planning and repeated acts are indicative of an intention and potential<br />to do considerable harm. Also, planning is often related to increased difficulties of<br />detection and proof.<br />Consistent with statutory distinctions, an increased minimum offense level<br />Amendment 617 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003<br /><br />is provided for the theft of undelivered mail. Theft of undelivered mail interferes<br />with a governmental function, and the scope of the theft may be difficult to<br />ascertain.<br />Theft from the person of another, such as pickpocketing or non-forcible<br />purse-snatching, receives an enhanced sentence because of the increased risk of<br />physical injury. This guideline does not include an enhancement for thefts from the<br />person by means of force or fear; such crimes are robberies.<br />A minimum offense level of 14 is provided for offenses involving an<br />organized scheme to steal vehicles or vehicle parts. Typically, the scope of such<br />activity is substantial (i.e., the value of the stolen property, combined with an<br />enhancement for ‘more than minimal planning’ would itself result in an offense<br />level of at least 14), but the value of the property is particularly difficult to ascertain<br />in individual cases because the stolen property is rapidly resold or otherwise<br />disposed of in the course of the offense. Therefore, the specific offense<br />characteristic of ‘organized scheme’ is used as an alternative to ‘loss’ in setting the<br />offense level.<br />Subsection (b)(6)(A) implements, in a broader form, the instruction to the<br />Commission in section 961(m) of Public Law 101-73.<br />Subsection (b)(6)(B) implements the instruction to the Commission in<br />section 2507 of Public Law 101-647.<br />Subsection (b)(8) implements the instruction to the Commission in section<br />2 of Public Law 105–101.".<br />A replacement guideline with accompanying commentary is inserted as &#167;2B1.1 (Larceny,<br />Embezzlement, and Other Forms of Theft; Offenses Involving Stolen Property; Property<br />Damage or Destruction; Fraud and Deceit; Forgery; Offenses Involving Altered or<br />Counterfeit Instruments Other than Counterfeit Bearer Obligations of the United States).<br />Chapter Two, Part B is amended by striking &#167;2B1.3 and its accompanying commentary as<br />follows:<br />"&#167;2B1.3.

In some cases, the monetary value of the property damaged or destroyed<br />may not adequately reflect the extent of the harm caused. For example, the<br />destruction of a $500 telephone line or interference with a<br />telecommunications network may cause an interruption in service to<br />thousands of people for several hours, with attendant life-threatening delay<br />in the delivery of emergency medical treatment or disruption of other<br />important governmental or private services.

For additional statutory provision(s), see Appendix A<br />(Statutory Index).<br />Application Notes:<br />1. The adjustments in &#167;2F1.1(b)(4) are alternative rather than cumulative. If<br />in a particular case, however, both of the enumerated factors applied, an<br />upward departure might be warranted.<br />2. ‘More than minimal planning’ (subsection (b)(2)(A)) is defined in the<br />Commentary to &#167;1B1.1 (Application Instructions).<br />3. ‘Mass-marketing,’ as used in subsection (b)(3), means a plan, program,<br />promotion, or campaign that is conducted through solicitation by telephone,<br />mail, the Internet, or other means to induce a large number of persons to (A)<br />purchase goods or services; (B) participate in a contest or sweepstakes; or<br />(C) invest for financial profit. The enhancement would apply, for example,<br />if the defendant conducted or participated in a telemarketing campaign that<br />solicited a large number of individuals to purchase fraudulent life insurance<br />policies.<br />4. ‘Scheme to defraud more than one victim,’ as used in subsection (b)(2)(B),<br />refers to a design or plan to obtain something of value from more than one<br />November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II Amendment 617<br /><br />person. In this context, "victim" refers to the person or entity from which<br />the funds are to come directly. Thus, a wire fraud in which a single<br />telephone call was made to three distinct individuals to get each of them to<br />invest in a pyramid scheme would involve a scheme to defraud more than<br />one victim, but passing a fraudulently endorsed check would not, even<br />though the maker, payee and/or payor all might be considered victims for<br />other purposes, such as restitution.<br />5. Subsection (b)(4)(A) provides an adjustment for a misrepresentation that the<br />defendant was acting on behalf of a charitable, educational, religious or<br />political organization, or a government agency. Examples of conduct to<br />which this factor applies would include a group of defendants who solicit<br />contributions to a non-existent famine relief organization by mail, a<br />defendant who diverts donations for a religiously affiliated school by<br />telephone solicitations to church members in which the defendant falsely<br />claims to be a fund-raiser for the school, or a defendant who poses as a<br />federal collection agent in order to collect a delinquent student loan.<br />6. Subsection (b)(4)(C) provides an enhancement if the defendant commits a<br />fraud in contravention of a prior, official judicial or administrative warning,<br />in the form of an order, injunction, decree, or process, to take or not to take<br />a specified action. A defendant who does not comply with such a prior,<br />official judicial or administrative warning demonstrates aggravated criminal<br />intent and deserves additional punishment. If it is established that an entity<br />the defendant controlled was a party to the prior proceeding that resulted in<br />the official judicial or administrative action, and the defendant had<br />knowledge of that prior decree or order, this enhancement applies even if<br />the defendant was not a specifically named party in that prior case. For<br />example, a defendant whose business previously was enjoined from selling<br />a dangerous product, but who nonetheless engaged in fraudulent conduct to<br />sell the product, is subject to this enhancement. This enhancement does not<br />apply if the same conduct resulted in an enhancement pursuant to a<br />provision found elsewhere in the guidelines (e.g., a violation of a condition<br />of release addressed in &#167;2J1.7 (Commission of Offense While on Release)<br />or a violation of probation addressed in &#167;4A1.1 (Criminal History<br />Category)).<br />If the conduct that forms the basis for an enhancement under (b)(4)(B) or<br />(C) is the only conduct that forms the basis for an adjustment under &#167;3C1.1<br />(Obstruction of Justice), do not apply an adjustment under &#167;3C1.1.<br />7. Some fraudulent schemes may result in multiple-count indictments,<br />depending on the technical elements of the offense. The cumulative loss<br />produced by a common scheme or course of conduct should be used in<br />determining the offense level, regardless of the number of counts of<br />conviction. See Chapter Three, Part D (Multiple Counts).<br />8. Valuation of loss is discussed in the Commentary to &#167;2B1.1 (Larceny,<br />Embezzlement, and Other Forms of Theft). As in theft cases, loss is the<br />value of the money, property, or services unlawfully taken; it does not, for<br />Amendment 617 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003<br /><br />example, include interest the victim could have earned on such funds had<br />the offense not occurred. Consistent with the provisions of &#167;2X1.1<br />(Attempt, Solicitation, or Conspiracy), if an intended loss that the defendant<br />was attempting to inflict can be determined, this figure will be used if it is<br />greater than the actual loss. Frequently, loss in a fraud case will be the<br />same as in a theft case. For example, if the fraud consisted of selling or<br />attempting to sell $40,000 in worthless securities, or representing that a<br />forged check for $40,000 was genuine, the loss would be $40,000.<br />There are, however, instances where additional factors are to be considered<br />in determining the loss or intended loss:<br />(a) Fraud Involving Misrepresentation of the Value of an Item or<br />Product Substitution<br />A fraud may involve the misrepresentation of the value of an item<br />that does have some value (in contrast to an item that is worthless).<br />Where, for example, a defendant fraudulently represents that stock<br />is worth $40,000 and the stock is worth only $10,000, the loss is<br />the amount by which the stock was overvalued (i.e., $30,000). In<br />a case involving a misrepresentation concerning the quality of a<br />consumer product, the loss is the difference between the amount<br />paid by the victim for the product and the amount for which the<br />victim could resell the product received.<br />(b) Fraudulent Loan Application and Contract Procurement Cases<br />In fraudulent loan application cases and contract procurement<br />cases, the loss is the actual loss to the victim (or if the loss has not<br />yet come about, the expected loss). For example, if a defendant<br />fraudulently obtains a loan by misrepresenting the value of his<br />assets, the loss is the amount of the loan not repaid at the time the<br />offense is discovered, reduced by the amount the lending institution<br />has recovered (or can expect to recover) from any assets pledged to<br />secure the loan. However, where the intended loss is greater than<br />the actual loss, the intended loss is to be used.<br />In some cases, the loss determined above may significantly<br />understate or overstate the seriousness of the defendant’s conduct.<br />For example, where the defendant substantially understated his<br />debts to obtain a loan, which he nevertheless repaid, the loss<br />determined above (zero loss) will tend not to reflect adequately the<br />risk of loss created by the defendant’s conduct. Conversely, a<br />defendant may understate his debts to a limited degree to obtain a<br />loan (e.g., to expand a grain export business), which he genuinely<br />expected to repay and for which he would have qualified at a<br />higher interest rate had he made truthful disclosure, but he is unable<br />to repay the loan because of some unforeseen event (e.g., an<br />embargo imposed on grain exports) which would have caused a<br />default in any event. In such a case, the loss determined above may<br />November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II Amendment 617<br /><br />overstate the seriousness of the defendant’s conduct. Where the<br />loss determined above significantly understates or overstates the<br />seriousness of the defendant’s conduct, an upward or downward<br />departure may be warranted.<br />(c) Consequential Damages in Procurement Fraud and Product<br />Substitution Cases<br />In contrast to other types of cases, loss in a procurement fraud or<br />product substitution case includes not only direct damages, but also<br />consequential damages that were reasonably foreseeable. For<br />example, in a case involving a defense product substitution offense,<br />the loss includes the government’s reasonably foreseeable costs of<br />making substitute transactions and handling or disposing of the<br />product delivered or retrofitting the product so that it can be used<br />for its intended purpose, plus the government’s reasonably<br />foreseeable cost of rectifying the actual or potential disruption to<br />government operations caused by the product substitution.<br />Similarly, in the case of fraud affecting a defense contract award,<br />loss includes the reasonably foreseeable administrative cost to the<br />government and other participants of repeating or correcting the<br />procurement action affected, plus any increased cost to procure the<br />product or service involved that was reasonably foreseeable.<br />Inclusion of reasonably foreseeable consequential damages directly<br />in the calculation of loss in procurement fraud and product<br />substitution cases reflects that such damages frequently are<br />substantial in such cases.<br />(d) Diversion of Government Program Benefits<br />In a case involving diversion of government program benefits, loss<br />is the value of the benefits diverted from intended recipients or<br />uses.<br />(e) Davis-Bacon Act Cases<br />In a case involving a Davis-Bacon Act violation (a violation of 40<br />U.S.C. &#167; 276a, criminally prosecuted under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1001), the<br />loss is the difference between the legally required and actual wages<br />paid.<br />9. For the purposes of subsection (b)(1), the loss need not be determined with<br />precision. The court need only make a reasonable estimate of the loss,<br />given the available information. This estimate, for example, may be based<br />on the approximate number of victims and an estimate of the average loss<br />to each victim, or on more general factors, such as the nature and duration<br />of the fraud and the revenues generated by similar operations. The<br />offender’s gain from committing the fraud is an alternative estimate that<br />ordinarily will underestimate the loss.<br />Amendment 617 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003<br /><br />10. In the case of a partially completed offense (e.g., an offense involving a<br />completed fraud that is part of a larger, attempted fraud), the offense level<br />is to be determined in accordance with the provisions of &#167;2X1.1 (Attempt,<br />Solicitation, or Conspiracy) whether the conviction is for the substantive<br />offense, the inchoate offense (attempt, solicitation, or conspiracy), or both;<br />see Application Note 4 in the Commentary to &#167;2X1.1.<br />11. In cases in which the loss determined under subsection (b)(1) does not fully<br />capture the harmfulness and seriousness of the conduct, an upward<br />departure may be warranted. Examples may include the following:<br />(a) a primary objective of the fraud was non-monetary; or the fraud<br />caused or risked reasonably foreseeable, substantial non-monetary<br />harm;<br />(b) false statements were made for the purpose of facilitating some<br />other crime;<br />(c) the offense caused reasonably foreseeable, physical or<br />psychological harm or severe emotional trauma;<br />(d) the offense endangered national security or military readiness;<br />(e) the offense caused a loss of confidence in an important institution;<br />(f) the offense involved the knowing endangerment of the solvency of<br />one or more victims.<br />In a few instances, the loss determined under subsection (b)(1) may<br />overstate the seriousness of the offense. This may occur, for example,<br />where a defendant attempted to negotiate an instrument that was so<br />obviously fraudulent that no one would seriously consider honoring it. In<br />such cases, a downward departure may be warranted.<br />12. Offenses involving access devices, in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1028 and<br />1029, are also covered by this guideline. In such a case, an upward<br />departure may be warranted where the actual loss does not adequately<br />reflect the seriousness of the conduct.<br />Offenses involving identification documents, false identification documents,<br />and means of identification, in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1028, also are<br />covered by this guideline. If the primary purpose of the offense was to<br />violate, or assist another to violate, the law pertaining to naturalization,<br />citizenship, or legal resident status, apply &#167;2L2.1 (Trafficking in a<br />Document Relating to Naturalization) or &#167;2L2.2 (Fraudulently Acquiring<br />Documents Relating to Naturalization), as appropriate, rather than &#167;2F1.1.<br />13. If the fraud exploited vulnerable victims, an enhancement will apply. See<br />&#167;3A1.1 (Hate Crime Motivation or Vulnerable Victim).<br />November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II Amendment 617<br /><br />14. Sometimes, offenses involving fraudulent statements are prosecuted under<br />18 U.S.C. &#167; 1001, or a similarly general statute, although the offense is also<br />covered by a more specific statute. Examples include false entries<br />regarding currency transactions, for which &#167;2S1.3 would be more apt, and<br />false statements to a customs officer, for which &#167;2T3.1 likely would be<br />more apt. In certain other cases, the mail or wire fraud statutes, or other<br />relatively broad statutes, are used primarily as jurisdictional bases for the<br />prosecution of other offenses. For example, a state arson offense where a<br />fraudulent insurance claim was mailed might be prosecuted as mail fraud.<br />Where the indictment or information setting forth the count of conviction<br />(or a stipulation as described in &#167;1B1.2(a)) establishes an offense more<br />aptly covered by another guideline, apply that guideline rather than &#167;2F1.1.<br />Otherwise, in such cases, &#167;2F1.1 is to be applied, but a departure from the<br />guidelines may be considered.<br />15. For purposes of subsection (b)(5)—<br />‘Counterfeit access device’ (A) has the meaning given that term in 18<br />U.S.C. &#167; 1029(e)(2); and (B) also includes a telecommunications instrument<br />that has been modified or altered to obtain unauthorized use of<br />telecommunications service. ‘Telecommunications service’ has the<br />meaning given that term in 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1029(e)(9).<br />‘Device-making equipment’ (A) has the meaning given that term in 18<br />U.S.C. &#167; 1029(e)(6); and (B) also includes (i) any hardware or software that<br />has been configured as described in 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1029(a)(9); and (ii) a<br />scanning receiver referred to in 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1029(a)(8). ‘Scanning receiver’<br />has the meaning given that term in 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1029(e)(8).<br />‘Means of identification’ has the meaning given that term in 18 U.S.C.<br />&#167; 1028(d)(3), except that such means of identification shall be of an actual<br />(i.e., not fictitious) individual other than the defendant or a person for<br />whose conduct the defendant is accountable under &#167;1B1.3 (Relevant<br />Conduct).<br />‘Produce’ includes manufacture, design, alter, authenticate, duplicate, or<br />assemble. ‘Production’ includes manufacture, design, alteration,<br />authentication, duplication, or assembly.<br />‘Unauthorized access device’ has the meaning given that term in 18 U.S.C.<br />&#167; 1029(e)(3).<br />16. Subsection (b)(5)(C)(i) applies in a case in which a means of identification<br />of an individual other than the defendant (or a person for whose conduct the<br />defendant is accountable under &#167;1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct)) is used without<br />that individual’s authorization unlawfully to produce or obtain another<br />means of identification.<br />Examples of conduct to which this subsection should apply are as follows:<br />Amendment 617 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003<br /><br />(A) A defendant obtains an individual’s name and social security<br />number from a source (e.g., from a piece of mail taken from the<br />individual’s mailbox) and obtains a bank loan in that individual’s<br />name. In this example, the account number of the bank loan is the<br />other means of identification that has been obtained unlawfully.<br />(B) A defendant obtains an individual’s name and address from a<br />source (e.g., from a driver’s license in a stolen wallet) and applies<br />for, obtains, and subsequently uses a credit card in that individual’s<br />name. In this example, the credit card is the other means of<br />identification that has been obtained unlawfully.<br />Examples of conduct to which subsection (b)(5)(C)(i) should not apply are<br />as follows:<br />(A) A defendant uses a credit card from a stolen wallet only to make a<br />purchase. In such a case, the defendant has not used the stolen<br />credit card to obtain another means of identification.<br />(B) A defendant forges another individual’s signature to cash a stolen<br />check. Forging another individual’s signature is not producing<br />another means of identification.<br />Subsection (b)(5)(C)(ii) applies in any case in which the offense involved<br />the possession of 5 or more means of identification that unlawfully were<br />produced or obtained, regardless of the number of individuals in whose<br />name (or other identifying information) the means of identification were so<br />produced or so obtained.<br />In a case involving unlawfully produced or unlawfully obtained means of<br />identification, an upward departure may be warranted if the offense level<br />does not adequately address the seriousness of the offense. Examples may<br />include the following:<br />(A) The offense caused substantial harm to the victim’s reputation or<br />credit record, or the victim suffered a substantial inconvenience<br />related to repairing the victim’s reputation or a damaged credit<br />record.<br />(B) An individual whose means of identification the defendant used to<br />obtain unlawful means of identification is erroneously arrested or<br />denied a job because an arrest record has been made in the<br />individual’s name.<br />(C) The defendant produced or obtained numerous means of<br />identification with respect to one individual and essentially<br />assumed that individual’s identity.<br />17. In a case involving any counterfeit access device or unauthorized access<br />device, loss includes any unauthorized charges made with the counterfeit<br />November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II Amendment 617<br /><br />access device or unauthorized access device. In any such case, loss shall be<br />not less than $500 per access device. However, if the unauthorized access<br />device is a means of telecommunications access that identifies a specific<br />telecommunications instrument or telecommunications account (including<br />an electronic serial number/mobile identification number (ESN/MIN) pair),<br />and that means was only possessed, and not used, during the commission<br />of the offense, loss shall be not less than $100 per unused means. For<br />purposes of this application note, ‘counterfeit access device’ and<br />‘unauthorized access device’ have the meaning given those terms in<br />Application Note 15.<br />18. For purposes of subsection (b)(6)(B), ‘United States’ means each of the 50<br />states, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the<br />United States Virgin Islands, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, and<br />American Samoa.<br />For purposes of subsection (b)(6)(C), ‘sophisticated means’ means<br />especially complex or especially intricate offense conduct pertaining to the<br />execution or concealment of an offense. For example, in a telemarketing<br />scheme, locating the main office of the scheme in one jurisdiction but<br />locating soliciting operations in another jurisdiction would ordinarily<br />indicate sophisticated means. Conduct such as hiding assets or transactions,<br />or both, through the use of fictitious entities, corporate shells, or offshore<br />bank accounts also ordinarily would indicate sophisticated means.<br />The enhancement for sophisticated means under subsection (b)(6)(C)<br />requires conduct that is significantly more complex or intricate than the<br />conduct that may form the basis for an enhancement for more than minimal<br />planning under subsection (b)(2)(A).<br />If the conduct that forms the basis for an enhancement under subsection<br />(b)(6) is the only conduct that forms the basis for an adjustment under<br />&#167;3C1.1 (Obstruction of Justice), do not apply an adjustment under &#167;3C1.1.<br />19. ‘Financial institution,’ as used in this guideline, is defined to include any<br />institution described in 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 20, 656, 657, 1005-1007, and 1014;<br />any state or foreign bank, trust company, credit union, insurance company,<br />investment company, mutual fund, savings (building and loan) association,<br />union or employee pension fund; any health, medical or hospital insurance<br />association; brokers and dealers registered, or required to be registered, with<br />the Securities and Exchange Commission; futures commodity merchants<br />and commodity pool operators registered, or required to be registered, with<br />the Commodity Futures Trading Commission; and any similar entity,<br />whether or not insured by the federal government. ‘Union or employee<br />pension fund’ and ‘any health, medical, or hospital insurance association,’<br />as used above, primarily include large pension funds that serve many<br />individuals (e.g., pension funds of large national and international<br />organizations, unions, and corporations doing substantial interstate<br />business), and associations that undertake to provide pension, disability, or<br />other benefits (e.g., medical or hospitalization insurance) to large numbers<br />Amendment 617 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003<br /><br />of persons.<br />20. An offense shall be deemed to have ‘substantially jeopardized the safety<br />and soundness of a financial institution’ if, as a consequence of the offense,<br />the institution became insolvent; substantially reduced benefits to<br />pensioners or insureds; was unable on demand to refund fully any deposit,<br />payment, or investment; was so depleted of its assets as to be forced to<br />merge with another institution in order to continue active operations; or was<br />placed in substantial jeopardy of any of the above.<br />21. ‘The defendant derived more than $1,000,000 in gross receipts from the<br />offense,’ as used in subsection (b)(8)(B), generally means that the gross<br />receipts to the defendant individually, rather than to all participants,<br />exceeded $1,000,000. ‘Gross receipts from the offense’ includes all<br />property, real or personal, tangible or intangible, which is obtained directly<br />or indirectly as a result of such offense. See 18 U.S.C. &#167; 982(a)(4).<br />22. If the defendant is convicted under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 225 (relating to a continuing<br />financial crimes enterprise), the offense level is that applicable to the<br />underlying series of offenses comprising the ‘continuing financial crimes<br />enterprise.’<br />23. If subsection (b)(5), subsection (b)(8)(A), or subsection (b)(8)(B) applies,<br />there shall be a rebuttable presumption that the offense also involved more<br />than minimal planning for purposes of subsection (b)(2).<br />If the conduct that forms the basis for an enhancement under subsection<br />(b)(5) is the only conduct that forms the basis of an enhancement under<br />subsection (b)(6), do not apply an enhancement under subsection (b)(6).<br />Background: This guideline is designed to apply to a wide variety of fraud cases.<br />The statutory maximum term of imprisonment for most such offenses is five years.<br />The guideline does not link offense characteristics to specific code sections.<br />Because federal fraud statutes are so broadly written, a single pattern of offense<br />conduct usually can be prosecuted under several code sections, as a result of which<br />the offense of conviction may be somewhat arbitrary. Furthermore, most fraud<br />statutes cover a broad range of conduct with extreme variation in severity.<br />Empirical analyses of pre-guidelines practice showed that the most<br />important factors that determined sentence length were the amount of loss and<br />whether the offense was an isolated crime of opportunity or was sophisticated or<br />repeated. Accordingly, although they are imperfect, these are the primary factors<br />upon which the guideline has been based.<br />The extent to which an offense is planned or sophisticated is important in<br />assessing its potential harmfulness and the dangerousness of the offender,<br />independent of the actual harm. A complex scheme or repeated incidents of fraud<br />are indicative of an intention and potential to do considerable harm. In pre-<br />guidelines practice, this factor had a significant impact, especially in frauds<br />involving small losses. Accordingly, the guideline specifies a 2-level enhancement<br />November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II Amendment 617<br /><br />when this factor is present.<br />Use of false pretenses involving charitable causes and government agencies<br />enhances the sentences of defendants who take advantage of victims’ trust in<br />government or law enforcement agencies or their generosity and charitable motives.<br />Taking advantage of a victim’s self-interest does not mitigate the seriousness of<br />fraudulent conduct. However, defendants who exploit victims’ charitable impulses<br />or trust in government create particular social harm. The commission of a fraud in<br />the course of a bankruptcy proceeding subjects the defendant to an enhanced<br />sentence because that fraudulent conduct undermines the bankruptcy process as well<br />as harms others with an interest in the bankruptcy estate.<br />Offenses that involve the use of transactions or accounts outside the United<br />States in an effort to conceal illicit profits and criminal conduct involve a<br />particularly high level of sophistication and complexity. These offenses are difficult<br />to detect and require costly investigations and prosecutions. Diplomatic processes<br />often must be used to secure testimony and evidence beyond the jurisdiction of<br />United States courts. Consequently, a minimum level of 12 is provided for these<br />offenses.<br />Subsections (b)(5)(A) and(B) implement the instruction to the Commission<br />in section 4 of the Wireless Telephone Protection Act, Public Law 105–172.<br />Subsection (b)(5)(C) implements the directive to the Commission in section<br />4 of the Identity Theft and Assumption Deterrence Act of 1998, Public Law<br />105–318. This subsection focuses principally on an aggravated form of identity<br />theft known as ‘affirmative identity theft’ or ‘breeding,’ in which a defendant uses<br />another individual’s name, social security number, or some other form of<br />identification (the ‘means of identification’) to ‘breed’ (i.e., produce or obtain) new<br />or additional forms of identification. Because 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1028(d) broadly defines<br />‘means of identification,’ the new or additional forms of identification can include<br />items such as a driver’s license, a credit card, or a bank loan. This subsection<br />provides a minimum offense level of level 12, in part, because of the seriousness of<br />the offense. The minimum offense level accounts for the fact that the means of<br />identification that were ‘bred’ (i.e., produced or obtained) often are within the<br />defendant’s exclusive control, making it difficult for the individual victim to detect<br />that the victim’s identity has been ‘stolen.’ Generally, the victim does not become<br />aware of the offense until certain harms have already occurred (e.g., a damaged<br />credit rating or inability to obtain a loan). The minimum offense level also accounts<br />for the non-monetary harm associated with these types of offenses, much of which<br />may be difficult or impossible to quantify (e.g., harm to the individual’s reputation<br />or credit rating, inconvenience, and other difficulties resulting from the offense).<br />The legislative history of the Identity Theft and Assumption Deterrence Act of 1998<br />indicates that Congress was especially concerned with providing increased<br />punishment for this type of harm.<br />Subsection (b)(6) implements, in a broader form, the instruction to the<br />Commission in section 6(c)(2) of Public Law 105–184.<br />Subsection (b)(7)(B) implements, in a broader form, the instruction to the<br />Amendment 617 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003<br /><br />Commission in section 110512 of Public Law 103–322.<br />Subsection (b)(8)(A) implements, in a broader form, the instruction to the<br />Commission in section 961(m) of Public Law 101–73.<br />Subsection (b)(8)(B) implements the instruction to the Commission in<br />section 2507 of Public Law 101–647.<br />Subsection (c) implements the instruction to the Commission in section<br />805(c) of Public Law 104–132.<br />&#167;2F1.2.

Because the victims and their losses are difficult if not<br />impossible to identify, the gain, i.e., the total increase in value realized through<br />trading in securities by the defendant and persons acting in concert with him or to<br />whom he provided inside information, is employed instead of the victims’ losses.<br />Certain other offenses, e.g., 7 U.S.C. &#167; 13(e), that involve misuse of inside<br />information for personal gain also may appropriately be covered by this guideline.".<br />Chapter Two, Part B, Subpart 1, is amended by adding at the end the following:<br />"&#167;2B1.4.

For example, the defendant, the<br />sole owner of a Subchapter C corporation, fraudulently understates the corporation’s<br />income in the amount of $100,000 on the corporation’s tax return, diverts the funds<br />to the defendant’s own use, and does not report these funds on the defendant’s<br />individual tax return. For purposes of this example, assume the use of 34% with<br />respect to the corporate tax loss and the use of 28% with respect to the individual tax<br />loss. The tax loss attributable to the defendant’s corporate tax return is $34,000<br />($100,000 multiplied by 34%). The tax loss attributable to the defendant’s<br />individual tax return is $28,000 ($100,000 multiplied by 28%).

The<br />major parts of the amendment are: (1) consolidation of the theft, property destruction, and<br />fraud guidelines; (2) a revised, common loss table for the consolidated guideline, and a<br />similar table for tax offenses; (3) a revised, common definition of loss for the consolidated<br />guideline; (4) revisions to guidelines that refer to the loss table in the consolidated guideline;<br />(5) technical and conforming amendments; and (6) amendments regarding tax loss.<br />Consolidation of Theft, Property Destruction, and Fraud; Miscellaneous Revisions<br />The first part of this amendment consolidates the guidelines for theft, &#167;2B1.1 (Larceny,<br />Embezzlement, and Other Forms of Theft; Receiving, Transporting, Transferring,<br />Transmitting, or Possessing Stolen Property), property destruction, &#167;2B1.3 (Property<br />Damage or Destruction), and fraud, &#167;2F1.1 (Fraud and Deceit; Forgery; Offenses Involving<br />Altered or Counterfeit Instruments Other than Counterfeit Bearer Obligations of the United<br />States) into one guideline, &#167;2B1.1 (Theft, Property Destruction, and Fraud). Consolidation<br />will provide similar treatment for similar offenses for which pecuniary harm is a major factor<br />in determining the offense level and, therefore, decrease unwarranted sentencing disparity<br />that may be caused by undue complexity in the guidelines. Consolidation addresses<br />concerns raised over several years by probation officers, judges, and practitioners about the<br />difficulties of determining for particular cases, whether to apply &#167;2B1.1 or &#167;2F1.1 and the<br />disparate sentencing outcomes that can result depending on that decision. Commentators<br />have noted that inasmuch as theft and fraud offenses are conceptually similar, there is no<br />strong reason to sentence them differently.<br />The base offense level for the consolidated guideline is level 6. This maintains the base<br />offense level for fraud offenses, but represents a two-level increase for theft and property<br />destruction offenses, which prior to this amendment was level 4. The increase of two levels<br />in the base offense levels for theft and property destruction offenses will have minimal<br />impact for low-level theft offenses involving offenders in criminal history Category I or<br />Category II. Commission analysis indicates that only a few defendants will move from Zone<br />A (where probation without conditions of confinement is possible) to Zone B or Zone C, and<br />those that are moved into a zone at higher offense levels in the Sentencing Table generally<br />will have criminal history categories above Category I. As a result, the Commission decided<br />against promulgating a two-level reduction for offenses involving loss amounts less than<br />$2,000.<br />The amendment deletes the two-level enhancement for more than minimal planning<br />previously at &#167;&#167;2B1.1(b)(4)(A) and 2F1.1(b)(2)(A). The two-fold reason for this change<br />was to obviate the need for judicial fact-finding about this frequently occurring enhancement<br />and to avoid the potential overlap between the more than minimal planning enhancement and<br />the sophisticated means enhancement previously at &#167;2F1.1(b)(6) and now, by this<br />amendment, at &#167;2B1.1(b)(8).<br />November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II Amendment 617<br /><br />The amendment also eliminates the alternative prong of the more than minimal planning<br />enhancement, at &#167;2F1.1(b)(2)(B) prior to this amendment, which provided a two-level<br />increase if the offense involved more than one victim. The amendment replaces this<br />enhancement with a specific offense characteristic for offenses that involved large numbers<br />of victims. This change addresses three concerns. First, as a result of the consolidation, the<br />more-than-one-victim enhancement, if retained, would apply in cases that, prior to this<br />amendment, were not subject to such an enhancement. Second, a two-level increase in every<br />case involving more than one victim is arguably inconsistent with the approach in subsection<br />(b)(2) of &#167;3A1.1 (Hate Crime Motivation or Vulnerable Victim), which provides a two-level<br />increase if the offense involved a large number of vulnerable victims. Third, in practice, the<br />more than minimal planning enhancement was so closely linked with this enhancement that<br />the decision to eliminate the former argues strongly for also eliminating the latter.<br />The amendment provides a two-level enhancement for offenses involving ten or more, but<br />fewer than 50, victims, and a four-level increase for offenses involving 50 or more victims.<br />This provision is designed to provide a measured increment that results in increased<br />punishment for offenses involving larger numbers of victims. Its applicability to those cases<br />in which victims, both individuals and organizations, sustain an actual loss under subsection<br />(b)(1) or sustain bodily injury.<br />A special rule is provided for application of the victim enhancement for offenses involving<br />United States mail because of (i) the unique proof problems often attendant to such offenses,<br />(ii) the frequently significant, but difficult to quantify, non-monetary losses in such offenses,<br />and (iii) the importance of maintaining the integrity of the United States mail.<br />In addition, the amendment moves the mass-marketing enhancement into the new victim-<br />related specific offense characteristic, as an alternative to the two-level adjustment for more<br />than ten, but fewer than 50, victims. The provision is retained to remain responsive to the<br />congressional directive that led to its original promulgation and reflects the Commission’s<br />expectation that most telemarketing cases, or similar mass-marketing cases, will have at least<br />ten victims and, receive this enhancement. The mass-marketing alternative enhancement<br />also will continue to apply in cases in which mass-marketing has been used to target a large<br />number of persons, regardless of the number of persons who have sustained an actual loss<br />or injury.<br />In addition, the amendment provides that if a victim enhancement applies, the enhancement<br />under &#167;3A1.1(b)(2) for "a large number of vulnerable victims" does not also apply because<br />the more serious conduct already would have resulted in a higher penalty level.<br />In response to issues raised in a circuit conflict, the amendment revises the commentary<br />related to subsection (b)(4)(B) of &#167;2B1.1 to clarify the meaning of "person in the business<br />of receiving and selling stolen property." The amendment addresses an issue that has arisen<br />in case law regarding what conduct receives a defendant for the 4-level enhancement.<br />In determining the meaning of "in the business of", some circuits apply what has been<br />termed the "fence test", under which the court must consider (1) if the stolen property was<br />bought and sold, and (2) to what extent the stolen property transactions encouraged others<br />to commit property crimes. Other circuits have adopted the "totality of the circumstances<br />test" that focuses on the regularity and sophistication of the defendant's operation. Compare<br />United States v. Esquivel, 919 F.2d 957 (5th Cir. 1990), with United States v. St. Cyr, 997<br />Amendment 617 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003<br /><br />F.2d 698 (1st Cir. 1992). Under either test, courts consider the sophistication and regularity<br />of the business as well as the control, volume, turnover, relationship with thieves, and<br />connections with buyers. Although the factors considered by all of these circuits are similar,<br />the approaches are different.<br />After consideration, the Commission adopted the totality of circumstances approach because<br />it is more objective and more properly targets the conduct of the individual who is actually<br />in the business of fencing. See United States v. St. Cyr, supra.<br />In addition, this amendment resolves a circuit conflict regarding the scope of the<br />enhancement in the consolidated guideline for a misrepresentation that the defendant was<br />acting on behalf of a charitable, educational, religious, or political organization, or a<br />government agency. (Prior to this amendment, the enhancement was at subsection (b)(4)(A)<br />of &#167;2F1.1). The conflict concerns whether the misrepresentation enhancement applies only<br />in cases in which the defendant does not have any authority to act on behalf of the covered<br />organization or government agency or if it applies more broadly to cases in which the<br />defendant has a legitimate connection to the covered organization or government agency, but<br />misrepresents that the defendant is acting solely on behalf of that organization or agency.<br />Compare, e.g., United States v. Marcum, 16 F.3d 599 (4th Cir. 1994) (enhancement<br />appropriate even though defendant did not misrepresent his authority to act on behalf of the<br />organization but rather only misrepresented that he was conducting an activity wholly on<br />behalf of the organization), with United States v. Frazier, 53 F.3d 1105 (10th Cir. 1995)<br />(application of the enhancement is limited to cases in which the defendant exploits the victim<br />by claiming to have authority which in fact does not exist).<br />The amendment follows the broader view of the Fourth Circuit. It provides for application<br />of the enhancement, now, by this amendment, at &#167;2B1.1(b)(7)(A), if the defendant falsely<br />represented that the defendant was acting to obtain a benefit for a covered organization or<br />agency when, in fact, the defendant intended to divert all or part of that benefit (for example,<br />for the defendant’s personal gain), regardless of whether the defendant actually was<br />associated with the organization or government agency. The Commission determined that<br />the enhancement was appropriate in such cases because the representation that the defendant<br />was acting to obtain a benefit for the organization enables the defendant to commit the<br />offense. In the case of an employee who also holds a position of trust, the amendment<br />provides an application note instructing the court not to apply &#167;3B1.3 (Abuse of Position of<br />Trust or Use of Special Skill) if the same conduct forms the basis both for the enhancement<br />and the adjustment in &#167;3B1.3.<br />The amendment implements the directive in section 3 of the College Scholarship Fraud<br />Prevention Act of 2000, Public Law 106–420, by providing an additional alternative<br />enhancement that applies if the offense involves a misrepresentation to a consumer in<br />connection with obtaining, providing, or furnishing financial assistance for an institution of<br />higher education. The enhancement targets the provider of the financial assistance or<br />scholarship services, not the individual applicant for such assistance or scholarship,<br />consistent with the intent of the legislation.<br />This amendment makes two minor substantive changes to the enhancement for conscious or<br />reckless risk of serious bodily injury, now, by this amendment, at subsection (b)(11)(A).<br />First, it increases the minimum offense level from level 13 to level 14 to promote<br />proportionality within this guideline. For example, within the theft and fraud guidelines<br />November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II Amendment 617<br /><br />prior to this amendment, there were other specific offense characteristics that had a higher<br />floor offense level than the risk of bodily injury enhancement: (1) "chop shops" (level 14);<br />(2) jeopardizing the solvency of a financial institution (level 24); and (3) personally<br />receiving more than $1,000,000 from a financial institution (level 24). Second, it inserts<br />"death" before the term "or serious bodily injury" to clarify that the risk of the greater harm<br />also is covered. Including risk of death also provides consistency with similar provisions in<br />other parts of the Guidelines Manual, where risk of death is always included with risk of<br />serious bodily injury.<br />The amendment modifies the four-level increase and minimum offense level of level 24 for<br />a defendant who personally derives more than $1,000,000 in gross receipts from an offense<br />that affected a financial institution, now, by this amendment, at subsection (b)(12)(A). The<br />amendment retains the minimum offense level but reduces the four-level enhancement to two<br />levels because of the increased offense levels that will result from the loss table for the<br />consolidated guideline. The two-level increase was retained because elimination of the<br />enhancement entirely would not provide an appropriate punishment for those offenders<br />involved with losses that are in the $1,000,000 to $2,500,000 range of loss.<br />The enhancement also was modified to address issues about what it means to "affect" a<br />financial institution and how to apply the enhancement to a case in which there are more than<br />one financial institution involved. Accordingly, the revised provision focuses on whether<br />the defendant derived more than $1,000,000 in gross receipts from one or more financial<br />institutions as a result of the offense.<br />The amendment includes a new cross reference (subsection (c)(3)) that is more generally<br />applicable and intended to apply whenever a broadly applicable fraud statute is used to reach<br />conduct that is addressed more specifically in another Chapter Two guideline. Prior to this<br />amendment, the fraud guideline contained an application note that instructed the user to<br />move to another, more appropriate Chapter Two guideline, under specified circumstances.<br />Although this note was not a cross reference, but rather a reminder of the principles<br />enunciated in &#167;1B1.2, it operated like a cross reference in the sense that it required use of a<br />different guideline.<br />This amendment also makes a minor revision (adding "in a broader form") to the background<br />commentary regarding the implementation of the directive in section 2507 of Public Law<br />101–647, nullifying the effect of United States v. Tomasino, 206 F. 3d 739 (7th Cir. 2000).<br />Loss Tables<br />The amendment provides revised loss tables for this consolidated guideline and for the tax<br />offense guidelines. A principle feature of the new tables is that they expand the previously<br />existing one-level increments into two-level increments, thus increasing the range of losses<br />that correspond to an individual increment, compressing the table, and reducing fact-finding.<br />The new loss tables also provide substantial increases in penalties for moderate and higher<br />loss amounts, even, for fraud and theft offenses, notwithstanding the elimination of the two-<br />level enhancement for more than minimal planning. These higher penalty levels respond to<br />comments received from the Department of Justice, the Criminal Law Committee of the<br />Judicial Conference, and others, that the offenses sentenced under the guidelines<br />consolidated by this amendment under-punish individuals involved with moderate and high<br />loss amounts, relative to penalty levels for offenses of similar seriousness sentenced under<br />Amendment 617 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003<br /><br />other guidelines.<br />Some offenders accountable for relatively low dollar losses will receive slightly lower<br />offense levels under the new loss table for the consolidated guideline because of (1) the<br />elimination of the enhancement for more than minimal planning; (2) the change from one-<br />level to two-level increments for increasing loss amounts; (3) the selection of the breakpoints<br />for the loss increments (including $5,000 as the first loss amount that results in an increase);<br />and (4) the slope chosen for the relationship between increases in loss amount and increases<br />in offense level at the lower loss amounts. This amendment reflects a decision by the<br />Commission that this effect on penalty levels at lower loss amounts is appropriate for several<br />reasons: (1) the lower offense levels provide appropriate deterrence and punishment,<br />generally, (2) at lower offense levels more defendants will be subject to the court’s ability<br />to fashion sentencing alternatives as appropriate (see, e.g., &#167;5C1.1 (Imposition of a Term of<br />Imprisonment)); and (3) these penalty levels may facilitate the payment of restitution.<br />The loss table for the consolidated guideline provides the first of incremental increases for<br />cases in which loss exceeds $5,000, rather than $2,000 provided previously in &#167;2F1.1, or<br />$100 provided previously in &#167;2B1.1. The Commission believes this will reduce the fact-<br />finding burden on courts for less serious offenses that are generally subject to greater<br />sentencing flexibility because of the availability of alternatives to incarceration.<br />The amendment also provides a revised loss table in &#167;2T4.1 (Tax Table) for tax offenses that<br />ensures significantly higher penalty levels for offenses involving moderate and high tax loss<br />in a similar manner and degree as the loss table for the consolidated guideline. The new table<br />is designed to reflect more appropriately the seriousness of tax offenses and to maintain<br />proportionality with the offenses sentenced under the consolidated guideline.<br />The tax loss table is similar to the loss table for the consolidated guideline, except it does not<br />reduce generally any sentences for offenders involved with lower loss amounts. The tax<br />table provides its first increment for loss at $2,000, rather than the $5,000 threshold under<br />the consolidated guideline (and the $1,700 threshold under the tax loss table prior to this<br />amendment). These differences are intended to avoid unintended decreases that would occur<br />otherwise. The increases in the new tax loss table for offenders involved with lower loss<br />amounts are intended to maintain the long-standing treatment of tax offenses relative to theft<br />and fraud offenses.<br />Definition of Loss<br />This amendment provides a new definition of loss applicable to offenses previously<br />sentenced under &#167;&#167;2B1.1, 2B1.3, and 2F1.1. The revised definition makes clarifying and<br />substantive revisions to the definitions of loss previously in the commentary to &#167;&#167;2B1.1 and<br />2F1.1, resolves a number of circuit conflicts, addresses a variety of application issues, and<br />promotes consistency in application.<br />Significantly, the new definition of loss retains the core rule that loss is the greater of actual<br />and intended loss. The Commission concluded that, for cases in which intended loss is<br />greater than actual loss, the intended loss is a more appropriate initial measure of the<br />culpability of the offender. Conversely, in cases which the actual loss is greater, that amount<br />is a more appropriate measure of the seriousness of the offense.<br />November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II Amendment 617<br /><br />A definition is provided for intended loss that is consistent with the rule regarding the<br />interaction of actual and intended loss.<br />The amendment includes a resolution of the circuit conflict relating to the meaning and<br />application of intended loss.<br />The amendment resolves the conflict to provide that intended loss includes unlikely or<br />impossible losses that are intended, because their inclusion better reflects the culpability of<br />the offender. Compare United States v. Geevers, 226 F.3d 186 (3d Cir. 2000) (agreeing with<br />the majority of circuits holding that impossibility is not in and of itself a limit on the<br />intended loss for purposes of calculating sentences under the guidelines . . . impossibility<br />does not require a sentencing court to lower its calculations of intended loss); and United<br />States v. Coffman, 94 F.3d 330 (7th Cir. 1996) (rejecting the argument that a loss that cannot<br />possibly occur cannot be intended); United States v. Koenig, 952 F.2d 267 (9th Cir. 1991)<br />(holding that &#167;2F1.1 only requires a calculation of intended loss and does not require a<br />finding that the intentions were realistic); United States v. Klisser, 190 F. 3d 34, 36 (2d Cir.<br />1999) (same); United States v. Blitz, 151 F. 3d 1002, 1010 (9th Cir. 1998) (same); United<br />States v. Studevent, 116 F. 3d 1559, 1563 (D.C. Cir. 1997) (same); United States v. Wai-<br />Keung, 115 F. 3d 874, 877 (11th Cir. 1997) (same), with United States v. Galbraith, 20 F. 3d<br />1054, 1059 (10th Cir. 1993) (because intended loss only includes losses that are possible, in<br />an undercover sting operation the intended loss is zero); and United States v. Watkins, 994<br />F.2d 1192, 1196 (6th Cir. 1993) (holding that a limitation on the broad reach of the intended<br />loss rule is that the intended loss must have been possible to be considered relevant).<br />Accordingly, concepts such as "economic reality" or "amounts put at risk" will no longer be<br />considerations in the determination of intended loss. See United States v. Bonanno, 146<br />F.3d 502 (7th Cir. 1998) (holding that the relevant inquiry is how much the scheme put at<br />risk); and United States v. Wells, 127 F. 3d 739 (8th Cir. 1997) (citing United States v.<br />Morris, 18 F.3d 562 (8th Cir. 1994)) (holding that intended loss properly was measured by<br />the possible loss the defendant intended, and did not hinge on actual or net loss).<br />This amendment also resolves differing circuit interpretations of the standard of causation<br />applicable for actual loss, an issue that was not addressed expressly in the prior definition<br />of actual loss. Various circuits recognized three arguably inconsistent standards for loss<br />causation. First, &#167;1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct) provides that a defendant is responsible for all<br />losses – foreseen or unforeseen – that result from the defendant’s actions or that result from<br />the foreseeable actions of co-participants. See United States v. Sarno, 73 F.3d 1470 (9th Cir.<br />1995) (holding that "[a] sentence calculated pursuant to the loss tables . . . is properly based<br />on actual loss notwithstanding the fact that this loss may be greater than the intended,<br />expected or foreseeable loss"), cert. denied, 518 U.S. 1020 (1996); and United States v.<br />Lopreato, 83 F.3d 571 (2d Cir. 1996) (holding that in a bribery case, the defendant is<br />responsible for all losses, foreseeable or not). A second view is premised on the fact that<br />prior to this amendment commentary in &#167;2F1.1 limited the loss amount to the value of the<br />money, property, or services unlawfully taken. See United States v. Marlatt, 24 F.3d 1005<br />(7th Cir. 1994) (refusing to count foreseeable losses in loss figure because they did not<br />represent the actual thing taken). A third view is that the commentary’s explicit inclusion<br />of consequential damages in the loss determination for contract procurement and product<br />substitution cases implies that only non-consequential or direct damages are included in<br />other cases. See United States v. Thomas, 62 F.3d 1332 (11th Cir. 1995), cert. denied, 516<br />U.S. 1166 (1996) (only non-consequential or direct damages are included in loss). See also<br />Amendment 617 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003<br /><br />United States v. Daddona, 34 F.3d 163 (3d Cir.), cert. denied, 513 U.S. 1002 (1994) (holding<br />that merely incidental or consequential damages may not be counted in computing loss); and<br />United States v. Newman, 6 F.3d 623 (9th Cir. 1993) (holding that loss caused by the<br />defendant arsonist was only the value of the property destroyed by the fire, not costs of<br />putting out the fire).<br />The amendment defines "actual loss" as the "reasonably foreseeable pecuniary harm" that<br />resulted from the offense. The amendment incorporates this causation standard that, at a<br />minimum, requires factual causation (often called "but for" causation) and provides a rule<br />for legal causation (i.e., guidance to courts regarding how to draw the line as to what losses<br />should be included and excluded from the loss determination). Significantly, the application<br />of this causation standard in the great variety of factual contexts in which it is expected to<br />occur appropriately is entrusted to sentencing judges.<br />"Pecuniary harm" is defined in a manner that excludes emotional distress, harm to reputation,<br />and other non-economic harm, in order to foreclose the laborious effort sometimes necessary<br />to quantify non-economic harms (as in some tort proceedings, for example).<br />"Reasonably foreseeable pecuniary harm" is defined to include pecuniary harms that the<br />defendant knew or, under the circumstances, reasonably should have known, was a potential<br />result of the offense. The Commission determined that this standard better ensures the<br />inclusion in loss of those harms that reflect the seriousness of the offense and the culpability<br />of the offender.<br />The definition deletes the previous rule that, by negative implication, excludes consequential<br />damages (except in specified cases), thus resolving a circuit conflict. Compare United States<br />v. Izydore, 167 F.3d 213 (5th Cir. 1999) (the fact that the Commission prescribed<br />consequential losses in only specific fraud cases, and not others, is strong evidence that<br />consequential damages were omitted from the general loss definition by design rather than<br />mistake), with United States v. Gottfried, 58 F.3d 648 (D.C. Cir. 1995) (holding that merely<br />incidental or consequential damages may not be counted in computing loss). The<br />Commission decided, however, not to use the term "consequential damages," or any similar<br />civil law distinction between direct and indirect harms. Rather, the Commission determined<br />that the reasonable foreseeability standard provides sufficient guidance to courts as to what<br />type of harms are included in loss.<br />In addition, this amendment preserves the special provisions addressing loss in protected<br />computer offenses and the inclusion of consequential damages in product substitution and<br />contract procurement offenses; however, these special cases are re-characterized as rules of<br />construction to avoid any negative implications regarding other types of offenses.<br />The amendment reflects a decision by the Commission that interest and similar costs shall<br />be excluded from loss. However, the amendment provides that a departure may be<br />warranted in the rare case in which exclusion of interest will under-punish the offender.<br />Thus, the rule resolves the circuit split regarding whether "bargained for" interest may be<br />included in loss. Compare United States v. Henderson, 19 F.3d 917 (5th Cir.), cert. denied,<br />513 U.S. 877 (1994) (holding that interest should be included if the victim had a reasonable<br />expectation of receiving interest from the transaction); United States v. Gilberg, 75 F.3d 15<br />(1st Cir. 1996) (including in loss interest on fraudulently procured mortgage loan); and<br />United States v. Sharma, 190 F.3d 220 (3d Cir. 1999) (holding that Application Note 8 of<br />November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II Amendment 617<br /><br />&#167;2F1.1 requires the exclusion of "opportunity cost" interest, but did not intend to exclude<br />bargained-for interest), with United States v. Hoyle, 33 F.3d 415 (4th Cir. 1994), cert.<br />denied, 513 U.S. 1133 (1995) (excluding interest from the determination of loss for<br />sentencing purposes); and United States v. Guthrie, 144 F.3d 1006 (6th Cir. 1998) (holding<br />that when the defendant concealed assets in a bankruptcy proceeding, the lower court’s<br />determination that loss to creditors included interest was erroneous). This rule is consistent<br />with the general purpose of the loss determination to serve as a rough measurement of the<br />seriousness of the offense and culpability of the offender and avoids unnecessary litigation<br />regarding the amount of interest to be included.<br />The loss definition also excludes from loss certain costs incurred by the government and<br />victims in connection with criminal investigation and prosecution of the offense. Such losses<br />are likely to occur in a broad range of cases, would present a fact-finding burden in those<br />cases, and would not contribute to the ability of loss to perform its essential function.<br />The loss definition also provides for the exclusion from loss of certain economic benefits<br />transferred to victims, to be measured at the time of detection. This provision codifies the<br />"net loss" approach that has developed in the case law, with some modifications made for<br />policy reasons. This crediting approach is adopted because the seriousness of the offense<br />and the culpability of a defendant is better determined by using a net approach. This<br />approach recognizes that the offender who transfers something of value to the victim(s)<br />generally is committing a less serious offense than an offender who does not.<br />The amendment adopts "time of detection" as the most appropriate and least burdensome<br />time for measuring the value of the transferred benefits. The Commission determined that<br />valuing such benefits at the time of transfer would be especially problematic in cases in<br />which the offender misrepresented the value of an item that is difficult to value. Although<br />the time of detection standard will allow some fluctuation in value which may inure to the<br />defendant’s benefit or detriment, the Commission determined that, because the time of<br />detection is closer in time to the sentencing and occurs at a point when the authorities are<br />aware of the criminality, its use generally would make it easier to determine a more accurate<br />value of the benefit.<br />The definition of "time of detection" was adopted because there may be situations in which<br />it is difficult to prove that the defendant knew the offense was detected even if it was already<br />discovered. In addition, the words "about to be detected" are included to cover those<br />situations in which the offense is not yet detected, but the defendant knows it is about to be<br />detected. In such a case, it would be inappropriate to credit the defendant with benefits<br />transferred to the victim after that defendant’s awareness.<br />The definition of "loss" also provides special rules for certain schemes. One rule includes<br />in loss (and excludes from crediting) the benefits received by victims of persons fraudulently<br />providing professional services. This rule reverses case law that has allowed crediting (or<br />exclusion from loss) in cases in which services were provided by persons posing as attorneys<br />and medical personnel. See United States v. Maurello, 76 F.3d 1304 (3d Cir. 1996)<br />(calculating loss by subtracting the value of satisfactory legal services from amount of fees<br />paid to a person posing as a lawyer); and United States v. Reddeck, 22 F.3d 1504 (10th Cir.<br />1994) (reducing loss by the value of education received from a sham university). The<br />Commission determined that the seriousness of these offenses and the culpability of these<br />offenders is best reflected by a loss determination that does not credit the value of the<br />Amendment 617 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003<br /><br />unlicensed benefits provided. In addition, this provision eliminates the additional burden<br />that would be imposed on courts if required to determine the value of these benefits.<br />Similarly, the definition of loss provides a special rule that includes in loss (and excludes<br />from crediting) the value of items that were falsely represented as approved by a regulatory<br />agency, for which regulatory approval was obtained by fraud, or for which regulatory<br />approval was required but not obtained. The Commission determined that the seriousness<br />of these offenses and the culpability of these offenders is best reflected by a loss<br />determination that does not credit the value of these items. This decision reflects the<br />importance of the regulatory approval process to public health, safety, and confidence.<br />Regarding investment schemes, the amendment resolves a circuit conflict regarding whether<br />and how to credit payments made to victims. Compare United States v. Mucciante, 21 F.3d<br />1228 (2nd Cir. 1994) (under the Guidelines, loss includes the value of all property taken,<br />even though all or part of it was returned.); United States v. Deavours, 219 F.3d 400 (5th Cir.<br />2000) (intended loss is not reduced by any sums returned to investors); and United States v.<br />Loayza, 107 F.3d 257 (4th Cir.1997) (declining to follow the approach of net loss and<br />holding defendants responsible for the value of all property taken, even though all or a part<br />is returned), with United States v. Holiusa, 13 F.3d 1043 (7th Cir.1994) (holding that only<br />the net loss should be included in loss, thus allowing a credit for returned interest), and<br />United States v. Orton, 73 F.3d 331 (11th Cir. 1996) (only payments made to losing<br />investors should be credited, not payments to investors who made a profit).<br />This amendment adopts the approach of the Eleventh Circuit that excludes the gain to any<br />individual investor in the scheme from being used to offset the loss to other individual<br />investors because any gain realized by an individual investor is designed to lure others into<br />the fraudulent scheme. See United States v. Orton, supra.<br />The definition retains the rule providing for the use of gain when loss cannot reasonably be<br />determined. It clarifies that there must be a loss for gain to be considered. In doing so, the<br />Commission resolved another circuit conflict. Compare United States v. Robie, 166 F.3d<br />444 (2d Cir. 1999) (holding that use of defendant’s gain for purposes of subsection (b)(1)<br />is improper if there is no economic loss to the victim), with United States v. Haas, 171 F.3d<br />259 (5th Cir. 1999) (stating that "if the loss is either incalculable or zero, the district court<br />must determine the &#167;2F1.1 sentence enhancement by estimating the gain to the defendant as<br />a result of his fraud"). The Commission decided not to expand the use of gain to situations<br />in which loss can be determined but the gain is greater than the loss because such instances<br />should occur infrequently, the efficiency of the criminal operation as reflected in the amount<br />of gain ordinarily should not determine the penalty level, and the traditional use of loss is<br />generally adequate.<br />The amendment revises the special rule on determining loss in cases involving diversion of<br />government program benefits to resolve another circuit conflict. The revision is intended to<br />clarify that loss in such cases only includes amounts that were diverted from intended<br />recipients or uses, not benefits received or used by authorized persons. In other words, even<br />if such benefits flowed through an unauthorized intermediary, as long as they went to<br />intended recipients for intended uses, the amount of those benefits should not be included<br />in loss. Compare United States v. Henry, 164 F.3d 1304 (10th Cir. 1999) (holding that loss<br />includes the value of gross benefits paid, rather than the value of benefits improperly<br />received or diverted in determining the loss), with United States v. Peters, 59 F.3d 732 (8th<br />November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II Amendment 617<br /><br />Cir. 1995) (determining that loss is the value of benefits diverted from intended recipients);<br />and United States v. Barnes, 117 F.3d 328 (7th Cir. 1997) (holding that the sentence is<br />calculated only on the value of the government benefits diverted from intended recipients<br />or users). This net loss approach is more consistent with general rules for determining loss.<br />Referring Guidelines for Theft and Fraud<br />The amendment includes revisions to the guidelines that, prior to this amendment, referred<br />to the loss tables in &#167;2B1.1 or &#167;2F1.1. Pursuant to this amendment, these guidelines will<br />refer to the loss tables in the consolidated guideline. Prior to this amendment, the referring<br />guidelines used the tables in &#167;&#167;2B1.1 and 2F1.1, which provided the first loss increment for<br />losses in excess of $2,000. Because the consolidated loss table provides the first loss<br />increment for losses in excess of $5,000, the referring guidelines are amended to provide a<br />one-level increase in a case in which the loss is more than $2,000, but did not exceed $5,000.<br />This increase is provided to avoid a one-level decrease that would otherwise occur for an<br />offense involving losses of more than $2,000 but not more than $5,000.<br />Two referring guidelines (&#167;&#167;2B2.1 (Burglary of a Residence or a Structure Other than a<br />Residence) and 2B3.1 (Robbery)) that use the definition of loss previously in &#167;2B1.1 will<br />retain that definition of loss rather than the new loss definition in the consolidated guideline.<br />The existing definition has not proven problematic for cases sentenced under these<br />guidelines.<br />Technical and Conforming Amendments<br />The amendment includes a number of technical and conforming amendments, most of which<br />are necessitated by the consolidation and the deletion of the more than minimal planning<br />enhancement.<br />Computing Tax Loss<br />This amendment addresses several issues related to tax loss. It addresses a circuit conflict<br />regarding how tax loss under &#167;2T1.1 (Tax Evasion) is computed for cases that involve a<br />defendant’s under-reporting of income on both individual and corporate tax returns. Such<br />a case often arises when (1) the defendant fails to report, and pay corporate income taxes on,<br />income earned by the corporation; (2) the defendant diverts that unreported corporate income<br />for the defendant’s personal use; and (3) the defendant fails to report, and to pay personal<br />income taxes on, that diverted income. The amendment provides that the amount of the<br />federal tax loss is the sum of the federal income tax due from the corporation and the amount<br />of federal income tax due from the individual.<br />The amendment thereby resolves a circuit conflict as to the methodology used to calculate<br />tax loss in cases involving a corporate diversion. Two circuits use a sequential method to<br />aggregate the tax loss. Under this method, the court determines the corporate federal income<br />tax that would have been due, subtracts that amount from the amount diverted to the<br />defendant personally, then determines the personal federal income tax that would have been<br />due on the reduced diverted amount. See United States v. Harvey, 996 F.2d 919 (7th Cir.<br />1993); and United States v. Martinez-Rios, 143 F.3d 662 (2d Cir. 1998). The Commission<br />adopted the alternative method used in United States v. Cseplo, 42 F.3d 360 (6th Cir. 1994),<br />in which the court determines the corporate federal income tax due on the diverted amount,<br />Amendment 617 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003<br /><br />and adds that amount to the personal federal income tax due on the total amount diverted.<br />This clarifies the prior rule in Application Note 7 of &#167;2T1.1 that "if the offense involves both<br />individual and corporate tax returns, the tax loss is the aggregate tax loss from the offenses<br />taken together" and reflects the Commission’s conclusion that, in cases of corporate<br />diversions, the method for computing total tax loss adopted by the Sixth Circuit in Cseplo<br />more accurately reflects the seriousness of the total harm caused by these offenses than<br />would be reflected by the alternative method.<br />In evasion-of-payment tax cases, the Commission amended the definition of "tax loss" to<br />include interest and penalties because, in contrast to evasion-of-assessment tax cases, such<br />amounts appropriately are included in tax loss for such cases. This amendment limits the<br />inclusion of interest or penalties to willful evasion of payment cases under 26 U.S.C. &#167; 7201<br />and willful failure to pay cases under 26 U.S.C. &#167; 7203. The nature of these cases is such<br />that the interest and penalties often greatly exceed the assessed tax amount constituting the<br />bulk of the harm associated with these offenses.<br />This amendment also revises the sophisticated concealment enhancement in subsection (b)(2)<br />of &#167;&#167;2T1.1 (Tax Evasion) and 2T1.4 (Aiding, Assisting, Procuring, Counseling, or Advising<br />Tax Fraud) to conform to the sophisticated means enhancement in the consolidated<br />guideline, including imposition of a minimum offense level of level 12. This revision is<br />appropriate inasmuch as certain tax offenses can be committed using sophisticated means<br />in addition to being concealed in a sophisticated manner. Indeed, tax offenses committed<br />in a sophisticated manner are more serious offenses, and reflect a greater culpability on the<br />part of the offender (just as a tax offense concealed in a sophisticated manner reflects greater<br />culpability). Consequently, this revision will allow the enhancement to apply to a somewhat<br />greater range of tax offenses than the previously existing sophisticated concealment<br />enhancement.<br />In addition, the amendment revises "offshore bank accounts" by substituting "financial" for<br />"bank", to ensure that the enhancement applies to conduct involving similar kinds of<br />accounts, consistent with language in &#167;2S1.1 (Laundering of Monetary Instruments;<br />Engaging in Monetary Transactions in Property Derived from Unlawful Activity).

This amendment addresses concerns raised by the<br />Department of the Treasury and the United States Secret Service regarding both the<br />operation of, and the penalties provided by, &#167;2B5.1 (Offenses Involving Counterfeit Bearer<br />Obligations of the United States). The amendment increases penalties for counterfeiting<br />Amendment 618 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003<br /><br />activity in two ways.<br />First, the amendment adds a two-level enhancement for manufacturing, in addition to the<br />minimum offense level of level 15 for manufacturing. This change will ensure some degree<br />of additional punishment for all offenders who engage in manufacturing activity.<br />Second, the amendment adds a two-level enhancement (which would apply alternatively to<br />the manufacturing enhancement) if the offense involved possessing or controlling (1) paper<br />that is similar to a distinctive paper used by the United States for its currency, obligations,<br />or securities; or (2) a feature or device that is essentially identical to a distinctive counterfeit<br />deterrent used by the United States for its currency, obligations, or securities. This<br />enhancement is justified because of the higher statutory maximum penalties under 18 U.S.C.<br />&#167; 474A (i.e., a term of imprisonment of up to 25 years compared to 10, 15, and 20 years for<br />other counterfeiting offenses). In addition, use of paper similar to "distinctive paper" and<br />use of features and devices essentially identical to "distinctive counterfeit deterrents" (both<br />of which are defined in &#167;2B5.1 consistently with the statute) make the counterfeit item more<br />passable and the offense more sophisticated.<br />In addition, the amendment deletes the language in the commentary of &#167;2B5.1 that suggests<br />that the manufacturing adjustment does not apply if the defendant "merely photocopies".<br />That commentary was intended to make the manufacturing minimum offense level of level<br />15 inapplicable to notes that are so obviously counterfeit that they are unlikely to be<br />accepted. Particularly with the advent of digital technology, it cannot be said that<br />photocopying necessarily produces a note so obviously counterfeit as to be impassible.</td><td>Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2001.</td></tr><tr><td class="n">620</td><td>Amendment 620</td><td>Section 2C1.3 is amended in the title by adding "; Payment or Receipt of<br />Unauthorized Compensation" after "Interest".<br />Section 2C1.3 is amended by adding after subsection (b) the following:<br />"(c) Cross Reference<br />(1) If the offense involved a bribe or gratuity, apply &#167;2C1.1 (Offering,<br />Giving, Soliciting, or Receiving a Bribe; Extortion Under Color of<br />Official Right) or &#167;2C1.2 (Offering, Giving, Soliciting, or<br />Receiving a Gratuity), as appropriate, if the resulting offense level<br />is greater than the offense level determined above.".<br />The Commentary to &#167;2C1.3 captioned "Statutory Provisions" is amended by inserting ", 209,<br />1909" after "208".<br />The Commentary to &#167;2C1.3 captioned "Application Note" is amended in Note 1 by inserting<br />"Abuse of Position of Trust.—" before "Do not".<br />The Commentary to &#167;2C1.3 is amended by striking the background as follows:<br />"Background: This section applies to financial and non-financial conflicts of<br />interest by present and former federal officers and employees.".<br />November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II Amendment 619<br /><br />Chapter Two, Part C is amended by striking &#167;2C1.4 and its accompanying commentary as<br />follows:<br />"&#167;2C1.4.

L. 106–310 (the "Act"), with an<br />effective date of December 16, 2000. (See Amendment 608.) This amendment<br />repromulgates the emergency amendment, with modifications, as a permanent amendment.<br />The substantial risk directive instructs the Commission to amend the federal sentencing<br />guidelines with respect to any offense relating to the manufacture, attempt to manufacture,<br />or conspiracy to manufacture amphetamine or methamphetamine in (1) the Controlled<br />Substances Act, 21 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 801-90; (2) the Controlled Substances Import and Export Act,<br />21 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 951-71; or (3) the Maritime Drug Law Enforcement Act, 46 U.S.C. App.<br />Amendment 620 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003<br /><br />&#167;&#167; 1901-04.<br />The Act requires the Commission, in carrying out the substantial risk directive, to provide<br />the following enhancements—<br />(A) if the offense created a substantial risk of harm to human life (other than a life<br />described in subparagraph (B)) or the environment, increase the base offense level<br />for the offense—<br />(i) by not less than 3 offense levels above the applicable level in effect on<br />the date of the enactment of this Act; or<br />(ii) if the resulting base offense level after an increase under clause (i)<br />would be less than level 27, to not less than level 27; or<br />(B) if the offense created a substantial risk of harm to the life of a minor or<br />incompetent, increase the base offense level for the offense—<br />(i) by not less than 6 offense levels above the applicable level in effect on<br />the date of the enactment of this Act; or<br />(ii) if the resulting base offense level after an increase under clause (i)<br />would be less than level 30, to not less than level 30.<br />The emergency amendment provided enhancements in &#167;&#167;2D1.1 (Unlawful Manufacturing,<br />Importing, Exporting, or Trafficking (Including Possession with Intent to Commit These<br />Offenses); Attempt or Conspiracy) and 2D1.10 (Endangering Human Life While Illegally<br />Manufacturing a Controlled Substance) that also apply in the case of an attempt or a<br />conspiracy to manufacture amphetamine or methamphetamine. The amendment did not<br />amend &#167;2D1.11 (Unlawfully Distributing, Importing, Exporting or Possessing a Listed<br />Chemical; Attempt or Conspiracy) or &#167;2D1.12 (Unlawful Possession, Manufacture,<br />Distribution, or Importation of Prohibited Flask or Equipment). Although offenses that<br />involve the manufacture of amphetamine or methamphetamine also are referenced in<br />Appendix A (Statutory Index) to &#167;&#167;2D1.11 and 2D1.12, the cross references in these<br />guidelines, which apply if the offense involved the manufacture of a controlled substance,<br />will result in application of &#167;2D1.1 and accordingly, the enhancements.<br />The basic structure of the emergency amendment to &#167;&#167;2D1.1 and 2D1.10 tracked the<br />structure of the substantial risk directive. Accordingly, in &#167;2D1.1, the amendment provided<br />a three-level increase and a minimum offense level of level 27 if the offense (1) involved the<br />manufacture of amphetamine or methamphetamine; and (2) created a substantial risk of harm<br />either to human life or the environment. For offenses that created a substantial risk of harm<br />to the life of a minor or an incompetent, the amendment provided a six-level increase and a<br />minimum offense level of level 30.<br />However, the structure of the emergency amendment to &#167;2D1.10 differed from the structure<br />of the emergency amendment to &#167;2D1.1 with respect to the first prong of the enhancement<br />(regarding substantial risk of harm to human life or to the environment). Specifically, the<br />emergency amendment provided a three-level increase and a minimum offense level of level<br />27 if the offense involved the manufacture of amphetamine or methamphetamine without<br />November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II Amendment 620<br /><br />making application of the enhancement dependent upon whether the offense also involved<br />a substantial risk of either harm to human life or the environment. Consideration of whether<br />the offense involves a substantial risk of harm to human life also is unnecessary because<br />&#167;2D1.10 applies only to convictions under 21 U.S.C. &#167; 858, and the creation of a substantial<br />risk of harm to human life is an element of an offense under 21 U.S.C. &#167; 858. Therefore, the<br />base offense level already takes into account the substantial risk of harm to human life.<br />Consideration of whether the offense involved a substantial risk of harm to the environment<br />was unnecessary because the directive predicated application of the enhancement on<br />substantial risk of harm either to human life or to the environment, and the creation of a<br />substantial risk of harm to human life necessarily is taken into account as an element of the<br />offense.<br />Neither the substantial risk directive nor any statutory provision defines "substantial risk of<br />harm." Based on an analysis of relevant case law that interpreted "substantial risk of harm,"<br />the emergency amendment provided commentary setting forth factors that may be relevant<br />in determining whether a particular offense created a substantial risk of harm. The definition<br />of "incompetent" was modeled after several state statutes.<br />This permanent amendment re-promulgates, with modifications, the emergency amendment<br />regarding the substantial risk directive. This amendment differs from the emergency<br />amendment in several respects:<br />First, in &#167;2D1.1, this amendment treats the existing specific offense characteristic in<br />&#167;2D1.1(b)(5), relating to a two-level enhancement for environmental violations occurring<br />in the course of a drug trafficking offense, as an alternative to the three-level enhancement<br />for substantial risk of harm to human life or the environment. This portion of the amendment<br />is in response to an issue related to the substantial risk directive regarding how to implement<br />it in a manner consistent with the earlier environmental hazard directive in section 303 of the<br />Comprehensive Methamphetamine Control Act, Pub. L. 104–237. The emergency<br />amendment made the enhancements cumulative. However, this permanent amendment<br />makes the new guideline provision alternative with the pre-existing enhancement for<br />environmental hazards in &#167;2D1.1.<br />Second, in &#167;2D1.1, this amendment lists four factors that the court "shall", as opposed to<br />"may", consider to determine whether subsection (b)(6)(A) or (B) applies. Similarly, in<br />&#167;2D1.10, this amendment lists four factors the court "shall" consider to determine whether<br />subsection (b)(1)(B) applies. The list of four factors was identified by the Commission to<br />assist the courts in defining the meaning of "substantial risk of harm" for offenses related to<br />the production and trafficking of precursor chemicals and the manufacture of amphetamine<br />and methamphetamine.<br />Third, in &#167;2D1.1, this amendment provides that the court (1) shall consider any costs of<br />environmental cleanup and harm to individuals and property in cases involving the<br />manufacture of amphetamine or methamphetamine in determining the amount of restitution<br />under &#167;5E1.1 (Restitution) and in fashioning appropriate conditions of probation and<br />supervision under &#167;&#167;5B1.3 (Conditions of Probation) and 5D1.3 (Conditions of Supervised<br />Release), and (2) should consider such costs and harms in cases involving the manufacture<br />of a controlled substance other than amphetamine or methamphetamine.<br />The amendment also makes a minor technical change in the background commentary.<br />Amendment 620 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003</td><td>Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2001.</td></tr><tr><td class="n">622</td><td>Amendment 622</td><td>The subdivision captioned "LSD, PCP, and Other Schedule I and II<br />Hallucinogens (and their immediate precursors)*" of the Drug Equivalency Tables of Note<br />10 of the Commentary to &#167;2D1.1 captioned "Application Notes", effective May 1, 2001 (see<br />Amendment 609), is repromulgated without change.</td><td>Reason for Amendment: This amendment repromulgates (as a permanent amendment)<br />without change the emergency amendment previously promulgated that addressed the<br />directive in section 3664 of the Ecstasy Anti-Proliferation Act of 2000, Pub. L. 106–310 (the<br />"Act"). (See Amendment 609). That directive instructs the Commission to provide<br />increased penalties for the manufacture, importation, exportation, or trafficking of "Ecstasy".<br />The directive specifically requires the Commission to increase the base offense level for 3,4-<br />Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), 3,4-Methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA),<br />3,4-Methylenedioxy-N-ethylamphetamine (MDEA), Paramethoxymethamphetamine (PMA),<br />and any other controlled substance that is marketed as "Ecstasy" and that has either a<br />chemical structure similar to MDMA or an effect on the central nervous system substantially<br />similar to or greater than MDMA.<br />The amendment addresses the directive by amending the Drug Equivalency Tables in<br />&#167;2D1.1, Application Note 10, to increase substantially the marihuana equivalencies for the<br />specified controlled substances, which has the effect of substantially increasing the penalties<br />for offenses involving "Ecstasy". The new penalties for "Ecstasy" trafficking provide<br />penalties which, gram for gram, are more severe than those for powder cocaine. Under the<br />Drug Equivalency Tables, one gram of powder cocaine has a marihuana equivalency of 200<br />grams. This amendment sets the marihuana equivalency for one gram of "Ecstasy" at 500<br />grams.<br />There is a combination of reasons why the Commission has substantially increased the<br />penalties in response to the congressional directive. Much evidence received by the<br />Commission indicated that "Ecstasy" (1) has powerful pharmacological effects; (2) has the<br />capacity to cause lasting physical harms, including brain damage; and (3) is being abused<br />by rapidly increasing numbers of teenagers and young adults. Indeed, the market for<br />"Ecstasy" is overwhelmingly comprised of persons under the age of 25 years.<br />The Commission considered whether the penalty levels for "Ecstasy" should be set at the<br />same levels as for heroin (one gram of heroin has a marihuana equivalency of 1000 grams)<br />and decided that somewhat lesser penalties were appropriate for "Ecstasy" for a number of<br />reasons: (1) the potential for addiction is greater with heroin; (2) heroin distribution often<br />involves violence while, at this time, violence is not reported in "Ecstasy" markets; (3)<br />because heroin it is a narcotic and is often injected, the risk of death from overdose is much<br />greater than for "Ecstasy"; and (4) because heroin is often injected, there are more secondary<br />health consequences, such as infections and the transmission of the human<br />immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis than for "Ecstasy".<br />Finally, based on information regarding "Ecstasy" trafficking patterns, the penalty levels<br />chosen are appropriate and sufficient to target serious and high-level traffickers and to<br />provide appropriate punishment, deterrence, and incentives for cooperation. The penalty<br />levels chosen for "Ecstasy" offenses provide five year sentences for serious traffickers (those<br />whose relevant conduct involved approximately 800 pills) and ten year sentences for high-<br />November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II Amendment 623<br /><br />level traffickers (those whose relevant conduct involved approximately 8,000 pills).</td><td>Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2001.</td></tr><tr><td class="n">623</td><td>Amendment 623</td><td>Section 2D1.1(b)(4) is amended by inserting "amphetamine or" before<br />"methamphetamine" each place it appears.<br />The Commentary to &#167;2D1.1 captioned "Statutory Provisions" is amended by inserting "; 49<br />U.S.C. &#167; 46317(b)" after "960(a), (b)".<br />The Commentary to &#167;2D1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 19 by<br />inserting "amphetamine or" before "methamphetamine".<br />Appendix A (Statutory Index), as amended by amendment 617, is further amended by<br />inserting after the line referenced to 49 U.S.C. &#167; 46317(a) the following new line:<br />"49 U.S.C. &#167; 46317(b) 2D1.1".<br />The sixth entry, relating to Amphetamine and Amphetamine (actual), in each of subdivisions<br />(1) through (14) of section 2D1.1(c), Note (B) of the "*Notes to Drug Quantity Table" in<br />&#167;2D1.1(c), Note 9 of the Commentary to &#167;2D1.1 captioned "Application Notes", and the<br />subdivision captioned "Cocaine and Other Schedule I and II Stimulants (and their immediate<br />precursors)*" of the Drug Equivalency Tables in Note 10 of the Commentary to &#167;2D1.1<br />captioned "Application Notes", effective May 1, 2001 (see Amendment 610), are<br />repromulgated with the following change:<br />The Commentary to &#167;2D1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 10 in the<br />Drug Equivalency Tables in the subdivision captioned "Cocaine and Other Schedule I and<br />II Stimulants (and their immediate precursors)*" by striking "1 gm of Dextroamphetamine<br />= 200 gm of marihuana".</td><td>Reason for Amendment: This amendment repromulgates as a permanent amendment the<br />emergency amendment previously promulgated to implement the directive in section 3611<br />of the Methamphetamine Anti-Proliferation Act of 2000, Pub. L. 106–310 (the "Act"), which<br />directs the Commission to provide increased guideline penalties for amphetamine offenses<br />such that those penalties are comparable to the base offense level for methamphetamine<br />offenses. The directive provided the Commission emergency amendment authority. (See<br />Amendment 610.)<br />This amendment revises &#167;2D1.1 to include amphetamine in the Drug Quantity Table in<br />&#167;2D1.1 (Unlawful Manufacturing, Importing, Exporting, or Trafficking (Including<br />Possession with Intent to Commit These Offenses); Attempt or Conspiracy). This<br />amendment also treats amphetamine and methamphetamine identically, at a 1:1 ratio (i.e.,<br />the same quantities of amphetamine and methamphetamine will result in the same base<br />offense level) because of the similarities of the two substances. Specifically, amphetamine<br />and methamphetamine (1) are chemically similar; (2) are produced by a similar method and<br />are trafficked in a similar manner; (3) share similar methods of use; (4) affect the same parts<br />of the brain; and (5) have similar intoxicating effects. The amendment also distinguishes<br />between pure amphetamine (i.e., amphetamine (actual)) and amphetamine mixture in the<br />same manner, and at the same quantities, as pure methamphetamine (i.e., methamphetamine<br />Amendment 622 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003<br /><br />(actual)) and methamphetamine mixture, respectively. The Commission determined that the<br />1:1 ratio is appropriate given the similarity of these two controlled substances.<br />This amendment differs from the emergency amendment in that it also (1) amends<br />&#167;2D1.1(b)(4) to make the enhancement for the importation of methamphetamine applicable<br />to amphetamine offenses as well, and makes a conforming change in the commentary to<br />&#167;2D1.1 in Application Note 19; (2) deletes as unnecessary the marihuana equivalency for<br />dextroamphetamine in the Drug Equivalency Tables in &#167;2D1.1; and (3) amends Appendix<br />A (Statutory Index) to refer a new offense at 49 U.S.C. &#167;

Therefore,<br />under this provision, a downward departure not to exceed 2 levels (from<br />level 33 to level 31) would be authorized.";<br />and by redesignating Notes 15 through 21 as Notes 14 through 20, respectively.<br />Section 5C1.2 is amended in the first paragraph by striking "In" and inserting "(a) Except<br />as provided in subsection (b), in".<br />Section 5C1.2 is amended by inserting after subsection (a), as so designated by this<br />amendment, the following:<br />"(b) In the case of a defendant (1) who meets the criteria set forth in subsection<br />(a); and (2) for whom the statutorily required minimum sentence is at least<br />five years, the offense level applicable from Chapters Two (Offense<br />Amendment 624 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003<br /><br />Conduct) and Three (Adjustments) shall be not less than level 17.".<br />The Commentary to &#167;5C1.2 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Notes 1 and 2 by<br />striking "subdivision" each place it appears and inserting "subsection (a)".<br />The Commentary to &#167;5C1.2 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 3 by striking<br />"subdivisions" and inserting "subsection (a)"; and striking "subdivision" and inserting<br />"subsection (a)".<br />The Commentary to &#167;5C1.2 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Notes 4 through<br />7 by striking "subdivision" each place it appears and inserting "subsection (a)".</td><td>Reason for Amendment: This amendment expands the eligibility for the two-level<br />reduction in subsection (b)(6) of &#167;2D1.1 (Unlawful Manufacturing, Importing, Exporting,<br />or Trafficking (Including Possession with Intent to Commit These Offenses); Attempt or<br />Conspiracy) for persons who meet the criteria set forth in &#167;5C1.2 (Limitation on<br />Applicability of Statutory Minimum Sentences in Certain Cases) to include defendants with<br />an offense level less than level 26.

L. 106–310 (the<br />"Act"), regarding enhanced punishment for trafficking in List I chemicals. (See Amendment<br /><br />611). That section provided the Commission emergency amendment authority to implement<br />the directive.<br />This amendment provides a new chemical quantity table in &#167;2D1.11 (Unlawfully<br />Distributing, Importing, Exporting or Possessing a Listed Chemical; Attempt or Conspiracy)<br />specifically for ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, and phenylpropanolamine (PPA). The table ties<br />the base offense levels for these chemicals to the base offense levels for methamphetamine<br />(actual) set forth in &#167;2D1.1 (Unlawful Manufacturing, Importing, Exporting, or Trafficking<br />(Including Possession with Intent to Commit These Offenses); Attempt or Conspiracy),<br />assuming a 50 percent actual yield of the controlled substance from the chemicals.<br />(Methamphetamine (actual) is used rather than methamphetamine mixture because ephedrine<br />and pseudoephedrine produce methamphetamine (actual), and PPA produces amphetamine<br />(actual)). This yield is based on information provided by the Drug Enforcement<br />Administration (DEA) that the typical yield of these substances for clandestine laboratories<br />is 50 to 75 percent.<br />This new chemical quantity table has a maximum base offense level of level 38 (as opposed<br />to a maximum base offense level of level 30 for all other precursor chemicals). Providing<br />a maximum base offense level of level 38 complies with the directive to establish penalties<br />for these precursors that "correspond to the quantity of controlled substance that reasonably<br />could have been manufactured using the quantity of ephedrine, phenylpropanolamine, or<br />pseudoephedrine possessed or distributed." Additionally, this eliminates the six-level<br />distinction that currently exists between precursor chemical offenses that involve intent to<br />manufacture amphetamine or methamphetamine and such offenses that also involve an actual<br />attempt to manufacture amphetamine or methamphetamine.<br />This amendment eliminates the Ephedrine Equivalency Table in &#167;2D1.11 and, in its place,<br />provides a general rule for the court to determine the base offense level in cases involving<br />multiple precursors (other than ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, or PPA) by using the quantity<br />of the single chemical resulting in the greatest offense level. An upward departure is<br />provided for cases in which the offense level does not adequately address the seriousness of<br />the offense.<br />However, this amendment provides an exception to that general rule for offenses that involve<br />a combination of ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, or PPA because these chemicals often are<br />used in the same manufacturing process. In a case that involves two or more of these<br />chemicals, the base offense level will be determined using the total quantity of these<br />chemicals involved. The purpose of this exception is twofold: (1) any of the three primary<br />precursors in the same table can be combined without difficulty; and (2) studies conducted<br />by the DEA indicate that because the manufacturing process for amphetamine is essentially<br />identical to the manufacturing process for methamphetamine, there are cases in which the<br />different precursors are included in the same batch of drugs. If the chemical is PPA,<br />amphetamine results; if the chemical is ephedrine or pseudoephedrine, methamphetamine<br />results.<br />The amendment also adds to the Drug Equivalency Tables in &#167;2D1.1 a conversion table for<br />these precursor chemicals, providing for a 50 percent conversion ratio. This is based on data<br />from the DEA that the actual yield from ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, or PPA typically is in<br />the range of 50 to 75 percent. The purpose of this part of the amendment is to achieve the<br />same punishment level (as is achieved by the first part of this amendment) for an offense<br />Amendment 625 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003<br /><br />involving any of these precursor chemicals when such offense involved the manufacture of<br />amphetamine or methamphetamine and, as a result, is sentenced under &#167;2D1.1 pursuant to<br />the cross reference in &#167;2D1.11.<br />This amendment also increases the base offense level for Benzaldehyde, Hydriodic Acid,<br />Methylamine, Nitroethane, and Norpseudoephedrine by re-calibrating these levels to the<br />appropriate quantity of methamphetamine (actual) that could be produced assuming a 50<br />percent yield of chemical to drug and retaining a cap at level 30. Previously, these chemicals<br />had been linked to methamphetamine (mixture) penalty levels. Based on a study conducted<br />by the DEA, ephedrine and pseudoepehdrine are the primary precursors used to make<br />methamphetamine in the United States. Phenylproponolamine is the primary precursor used<br />to make amphetamine. Unlike the five additional List I chemicals, the chemical structures<br />of ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, and PPA are so similar to the resulting drug (i.e.,<br />methamphetamine or amphetamine) that the manufacture of methamphetamine or<br />amphetamine from ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, or PPA is a very simple one-step synthesis<br />which anyone can perform using a variety of chemical reagents. The manufacture of<br />methamphetamine or amphetamine from the five additional List I chemicals is a more<br />complex process which requires a heightened level of expertise.<br />This amendment adds to the emergency amendment in two ways. First, it amends the<br />Chemical Quantity Table in &#167;2D1.11 to include gamma-butyrolactone (GBL), a precursor<br />for gamma hydroxybutyric acid (GHB), as a List I chemical. This change is in response to<br />the Hillory J. Farias and Samantha Reid Date Rape Prohibition Act of 2000, Pub. L.<br />106–172, which added GBL to the list of List 1 chemicals in section 401 (b)(1)(C) of the<br />Controlled Substances Act, 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(b)(1)(C). Offense levels for GBL were<br />established in the same manner as other List I chemicals. The offense level for a specific<br />quantity of GHB that can be produced from a given quantity of GBL, assuming a 50 percent<br />yield, was determined using the Drug Quantity Table in &#167;2D1.1. From this offense level,<br />six levels were subtracted to reflect the fact that an attempt to manufacture is not a required<br />element of these offenses and, therefore, they are less serious offenses than offenses covered<br />by &#167;2D1.1.<br />Second, the amendment adds iodine to the Chemical Quantity Table in &#167;2D1.11(e) in<br />response to a recent classification of iodine as a List II chemical. Iodine is used to produce<br />hydrogen iodide which, in the presence of water, becomes hydriodic acid, a List I chemical<br />that is a reagent used in the production of amphetamine and methamphetamine. The<br />penalties for iodine were established based upon its conversion to hydriodic acid.</td><td>Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2001.</td></tr><tr><td class="n">627</td><td>Amendment 627</td><td>Section 2D1.12 is amended in the title by inserting "Transportation,<br />Exportation," after "Distribution,"; and by striking "or Equipment" and inserting ",<br />Equipment, Chemical, Product, or Material".<br />Section 2D1.12(a)(1), (a)(2), and (b)(1) are amended by inserting "flask," after "prohibited"<br />each place it appears; and by inserting ", chemical, product, or material" after "equipment"<br />each place it appears.<br />The Commentary to &#167;2D1.12 captioned "Statutory Provisions" is amended by inserting "&#167;"<br />before "843"; and by inserting ", 864" after "(7)".<br /><br />The Commentary to &#167;2D1.12 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by striking the text<br />of Note 1 as follows:<br />"If the offense involved the large-scale manufacture, distribution, or importation of<br />prohibited flasks or equipment, an upward departure may be warranted.",<br />and inserting the following:<br />"If the offense involved the large-scale manufacture, distribution, transportation,<br />exportation, or importation of prohibited flasks, equipment, chemicals, products, or<br />material, an upward departure may be warranted.".<br />Appendix A (Statutory Index) is amended by inserting after the line referenced to 21 U.S.C.<br />&#167; 863 the following:<br />"21 U.S.C. &#167; 864 2D1.12".</td><td>Reason for Amendment: This amendment addresses the new offense, in section 423 of the<br />Controlled Substances Act, 21 U.S.C. &#167; 864, of stealing or transporting across state lines<br />anhydrous ammonia knowing, intending, or having reasonable cause to believe that such<br />anhydrous ammonia will be used to manufacture a controlled substance. This new offense,<br />created by section 3653 of the Methamphetamine Anti-Proliferation Act of 2000, Pub. L.<br />106–310, carries the statutory penalties contained in section 403(d) of the Controlled<br />Substances Act, 21 U.S.C. &#167; 843, i.e., not more than four years' imprisonment (or not more<br />than eight years' imprisonment in the case of certain prior convictions), or not more than ten<br />years' imprisonment (or not more than 20 years' imprisonment in the case of certain prior<br />convictions) if the offense involved the manufacture of methamphetamine.<br />The amendment references the new offense to &#167;2D1.12 (Unlawful Possession, Manufacture,<br />Distribution, or Importation of Prohibited Flask or Equipment; Attempt or Conspiracy).<br />Reference to this guideline is appropriate because the new offense is similar to other offenses<br />that already are referenced to the guideline and have the same penalty structure, such as 21<br />U.S.C. &#167; 843(a)(6), which among other things, makes it unlawful to possess any chemical,<br />product, or material that may be used to manufacture a controlled substance. In addition, this<br />amendment expands the coverage of Application Note 1 to also apply to cases involving the<br />transportation and exportation of prohibited chemicals, products, or material. Finally, the<br />amendment makes minor, non-substantive changes to the guideline in order to fully<br />incorporate the new and existing offenses.</td><td>Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2001.</td></tr><tr><td class="n">628</td><td>Amendment 628</td><td>Sections 2G1.1, 2G2.1, 2H4.1, 2H4.2, and 5E1.1, and each line in Appendix<br />A (Statutory Index) referenced to 18 U.S.C. &#167; 241, &#167; 1589, &#167; 1590, &#167;1591, or &#167;1592, or to<br />29 U.S.C. &#167; 1851, effective May 1, 2001 (see Amendment 612), are repromulgated with the<br />following changes:<br />Section 5E1.1(a)(1) is amended by inserting ", or 21 U.S.C. &#167; 853(q)" after "3663A".<br />The Commentary to &#167;5E1.1 captioned "Background" is amended in the first paragraph by<br />inserting ", and 21 U.S.C. &#167; 853(q)" after "3663A".<br />Amendment 626 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003</td><td>Reason for Amendment: This amendment repromulgates as a permanent amendment the<br />previously promulgated emergency amendment on human trafficking. (See Amendment<br />612.) The amendment implements the congressional directive in section 112(b) of the<br />Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000, Pub. L. 106–386 (the "Act").<br />The directive requires the Commission to amend, if appropriate, the guidelines applicable<br />to human trafficking (i.e., peonage, involuntary servitude, and forced labor) offenses. It also<br />requires the Commission to ensure that the guidelines "are sufficiently stringent to deter and<br />adequately reflect the heinous nature of these offenses." In compliance with the directive,<br />the amendment (1) creates a new guideline, &#167;2H4.2 (Willful Violations of the Migrant and<br />Seasonal Agricultural Worker Protection Act); (2) refers violations of four new statutes,<br />18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1589 (Forced Labor), 1590 (Trafficking with Respect to Peonage, Involuntary<br />Servitude or Forced Labor), 1591 (Sex Trafficking of Children by Force, Fraud or Coercion),<br />and 1592 (Unlawful Conduct with Respect to Documents in Furtherance of Peonage,<br />Involuntary Servitude, or Forced Labor) to the appropriate guidelines; and (3) makes<br />changes, consistent with the directive, which both enhance sentences and reflect changes to<br />three existing statutes: 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1581(a) (Peonage), 1583 (Enticement into Slavery) and<br />1584 (Sale into Involuntary Servitude).<br />To address this multi-faceted directive, the amendment makes changes to several existing<br />guidelines and creates a new guideline for criminal violations of the Migrant and Seasonal<br />Agricultural Worker Protection Act. Although the directive instructs the Commission to<br />amend the guidelines applicable to the Fair Labor Standards Act (29 U.S.C. &#167; 201 et. seq.),<br />a criminal violation of the Fair Labor Standards Act is only a Class B misdemeanor. See 29<br />U.S.C. &#167; 216. Thus, the guidelines are not applicable to those offenses.<br />The amendment references the new offense at 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1591 to &#167;2G1.1 (Promoting<br />Prostitution or Prohibited Sexual Conduct). Section 1591 provides criminal penalties for a<br />defendant who participates in the transporting or harboring of a person, or who benefits from<br />participating in such a venture, with the knowledge that force, fraud, or coercion will be used<br />to cause that person to engage in a commercial sex act or with knowledge that the person is<br />not 18 years old and will be forced to engage in a commercial sex act. Despite the statute’s<br />inclusion in a chapter of title 18 devoted mainly to peonage offenses, section 1591 offenses<br />are more analogous to the offenses referenced to the prostitution guideline.<br />Section 1591 cases alternatively have been referred in Appendix A (Statutory Index) to<br />&#167;2G2.1 (Sexually Exploiting a Minor by Production of Sexually Explicit Visual or Printed<br />Material; Custodian Permitting Minor to Engage in Sexually Explicit Conduct;<br />Advertisement for Minors to Engage in Production). This has been done in anticipation that<br />some portion of section 1591 cases will involve forcing or coercing children to engage in<br />commercial sex acts for the purpose of producing pornography. Such offenses, as<br />recognized by the higher base offense level at &#167;2G2.1, are more serious because they both<br />involve specific harm to an individual victim and further an additional criminal purpose,<br />namely, commercial pornography.<br />The amendment maintains the view that &#167;2H4.1 (Peonage, Involuntary Servitude, and Slave<br />Trade) continues to be an appropriate tool for determining sentences for violations of 18<br />U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1581, 1583, and 1584. Section 2H4.1 also is designed to cover offenses under<br />three new statutes: 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1589, 1590, and 1592. Section 1589 provides criminal<br />penalties for a defendant who provides or obtains the labor or services of another by the use<br /><br />of threats of serious harm or physical restraint against a person, or by a scheme or plan<br />intended to make the person believe that physical restraint or serious harm would result from<br />not performing the labor or services. This statute also applies to defendants who provide or<br />obtain labor or services of another by abusing or threatening abuse of the law or the legal<br />process. See 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1589.<br />Section 1590 provides criminal penalties for a defendant who harbors, transports, or is<br />otherwise involved in obtaining, a person for labor or services. Section 1592 provides<br />criminal penalties for a defendant who knowingly possesses, destroys, or removes an actual<br />passport, other immigration document, or government identification document of another<br />person in the course of a violation of &#167; 1581 (peonage), &#167; 1583 (enticement into slavery), &#167;<br />1584 (sale into involuntary servitude), &#167; 1589 (forced labor), &#167; 1590 (trafficking with respect<br />to these offenses), &#167; 1591 (sex trafficking of children by force, fraud, or coercion), or &#167;<br />1594(a) (attempts to violate these offenses). Section 1592 also provides criminal penalties<br />for a defendant who, with intent to violate &#167; 1581, &#167; 1583, &#167; 1584, &#167; 1589, &#167; 1590, or<br />&#167; 1591, knowingly possesses, destroys, or removes an actual passport, other immigration<br />document, or government identification document of another person. These statutes prohibit<br />the types of behaviors that traditionally have been sentenced under &#167;2H4.1.<br />The amendment provides an alternative, less punitive base offense level of level 18 for those<br />who violate 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1592, an offense which limits participation in peonage cases to the<br />destruction or wrongful confiscation of a passport or other immigration document. This<br />alternative, lower base level reflects the lower statutory maximum sentence for section 1592<br />offenses (i.e., 5 years’ imprisonment).<br />Section 2H4.1(b)(2) has been expanded to provide a four-level increase if a dangerous<br />weapon was used and a two-level increase if a dangerous weapon was brandished or its use<br />was threatened. Prior to this amendment, only actual use of a dangerous weapon was<br />covered. This change reflects the directive to consider an enhancement for the use or<br />threatened use of a dangerous weapon. The commentary to &#167;2H4.1 is amended to clarify<br />that the threatened use of a dangerous weapon applies regardless of whether a dangerous<br />weapon was actually present.<br />The amendment also creates a new guideline, &#167;2H4.2 (Willful Violations of the Migrant and<br />Seasonal Agricultural Worker Protection Act), in response to the directive to amend the<br />guidelines applicable to such offenses. These offenses, which have a statutory maximum<br />sentence of one year imprisonment for first offenses and three years’ imprisonment for<br />subsequent offenses, were not, prior to this amendment, referred to any specific guideline.<br />The amendment provides a base offense level of level 6 in recognition of the low statutory<br />maximum sentences set for these cases by Congress. Further, these offenses typically<br />involve violations of regulatory provisions. Setting the base offense level at level 6 provides<br />consistency with guidelines for other regulatory offenses. See, e.g., &#167;&#167;2N2.1 (Violations of<br />Statutes and Regulations Dealing With Any Food, Drug, Biological Product, Device,<br />Cosmetic, or Agricultural Product) and 2N3.1 (Odometer Laws and Regulations).<br />Subsections (b)(1), an enhancement for bodily injury, and (b)(2), an enhancement applicable<br />to defendants who commit the instant offense after previously sustaining a civil penalty for<br />similar misconduct, have been established to respond to the directive that the Commission<br />consider sentencing enhancement for this aggravated conduct. This provision addresses the<br />Department of Justice’s and the Department of Labor’s concern regarding the need for<br />enhanced penalties in cases involving prior administrative and civil adjudications.<br />Amendment 627 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003<br /><br />This amendment also addresses that portion of section 112 of the Act that amends chapter<br />77 of title 18, United States Code, to provide mandatory restitution for peonage and<br />involuntary servitude offenses. The amendment amends &#167;5E1.1 (Restitution) to include a<br />reference to 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1593 in the guideline provision regarding mandatory restitution.<br />By enactment of various sentencing enhancements and encouraged upward departures for<br />areas of concern identified by Congress, the Commission has provided for more severe<br />sentences for perpetrators of human trafficking offenses in keeping with the conclusion that<br />the offenses covered by this amendment are both heinous in nature and being committed<br />with increasing frequency.<br />In addition, to repromulgating the emergency amendment, this amendment responds to<br />section 3613 of the Methamphetamine Anti-Proliferation Act of 2000, Pub. L. 106–310, that<br />amends 21 U.S.C. &#167; 853(q) to provide mandatory restitution for offenses involving the<br />manufacture of methamphetamine. Accordingly, the amendment amends &#167;5E1.1<br />(Restitution) to include a reference to 21 U.S.C. &#167; 853(q) in the guideline provision<br />regarding mandatory restitution.</td><td>Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2001.</td></tr><tr><td class="n">629</td><td>Amendment 629</td><td>Section 2H3.1 is amended in the title by striking "or" and inserting a<br />semicolon; and by inserting "; Disclosure of Tax Return Information" after "Eavesdropping".<br />Section 2H3.1 is amended by striking subsection (a) as follows:<br />"(a) Base Offense Level: 9",<br />and inserting the following:<br />"(a) Base Offense Level (Apply the greater):<br />(1) 9; or<br />(2) 6, if the defendant was convicted of 26 U.S.C. &#167; 7213A or 26<br />U.S.C. &#167; 7216.".<br />Section 2H3.1(b)(1) is amended by striking "conduct" and inserting "offense".<br />Section 2H3.1(c)(1) is amended by striking "conduct" and inserting "offense"; and by<br />striking "that offense" and inserting "that other offense".<br />The Commentary to &#167;2H3.1 captioned "Statutory Provisions" is amended by inserting "26<br />U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 7213(a)(1)-(3), (a)(5), (d), 7213A, 7216;" after "2511;".<br />The Commentary to &#167;2H3.1 captioned "Application Note" is amended by striking "Note"<br />and inserting "Notes"; by redesignating Note 1 as Note 2; and by inserting before Note 2, as<br />redesignated by this amendment, the following:<br />"1.

The Act created<br />new tax offenses pertaining to the unlawful disclosure of tax-related information contained<br />on computer software and to unlawful requests for tax audits. In addition, the Taxpayer<br />Browsing Protection Act of 1997, Public Law 105–35, created another tax offense pertaining<br />to the unlawful inspection of tax information.<br />Specifically, Public Law 105–35 expanded 26 U.S.C. &#167; 7213 to prohibit federal and state<br />employees and certain other persons from disclosing tax-related computer software. Public<br />Law 105–35 also created an offense at 26 U.S.C. &#167; 7213A making it unlawful for federal and<br />state employees and certain other persons to inspect tax return information in any way other<br />than that authorized under the Internal Revenue Code.<br />This is a two-part amendment. First, this amendment updates Appendix A (Statutory Index)<br />by referring most of these offenses to &#167;2H3.1 (Interception of Communications and<br />Eavesdropping). Prior to this amendment, no guideline provision or statutory reference was<br />expressly promulgated to address tax offenses that implicated privacy interests. Under<br />subsection (a) of &#167;1B1.2 (Applicable Guidelines) and under &#167;2X5.1 (Other Offenses), courts<br />are required to use the most analogous offense guideline from Chapter Two (Offense<br />Conduct) in each pending case brought under a statute having no reference in the guidelines’<br />Amendment 628 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003<br /><br />statutory index.<br />In general, the guideline most analogous for these offenses is &#167;2H3.1. Section 2H3.1<br />concerns offenses against privacy and, in large measure, these tax-related offenses are<br />devoted to protecting taxpayer privacy interests. Section 2H3.1 also contains a cross<br />reference to "another offense" if a greater offense level will result.<br />Second, this amendment adds a three-level decrease in the base offense level under &#167;2H3.1<br />for the least serious types of offense behavior, in which there was no intent to harm or obtain<br />pecuniary gain. The base offense level for &#167;2H3.1 is level 9 with a range of 4 to 10 months<br />(in criminal history Category I). The Commission determined that a base offense level of<br />level 9 is too severe for the misdemeanor offenses contained in 26 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 7213A<br />(Unauthorized Inspection) and 7216 (Unauthorized Disclosure), and the three-level decrease<br />addresses this concern.</td><td>Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2001.</td></tr><tr><td class="n">630</td><td>Amendment 630</td><td>Section 2K1.3(a) is amended by striking the text of subdivision (3) as<br />follows:<br />"16, if the defendant is a prohibited person; or knowingly distributed explosive<br />materials to a prohibited person; or",<br />and inserting the following:<br />"16, if the defendant (A) was a prohibited person at the time the defendant<br />committed the instant offense; or (B) knowingly distributed explosive materials to<br />a prohibited person; or".<br />The Commentary to &#167;2K1.3 captioned "Statutory Provisions" is amended by inserting "(l)-<br />(o), (p)(2)," after "(i),".<br />The Commentary to &#167;2K1.3 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by striking the text<br />of Note 3 as follows:<br />"‘Prohibited person,’ as used in subsection (a)(3), means anyone who: (i) is under<br />indictment for, or has been convicted of, a ‘crime punishable by imprisonment for<br />a term exceeding one year,’ as defined at 18 U.S.C. &#167; 841(l); (ii) is a fugitive from<br />justice; (iii) is an unlawful user of, or is addicted to, any controlled substance; or (iv)<br />has been adjudicated as a mental defective or involuntarily committed to a mental<br />institution.",<br />and inserting the following:<br />"For purposes of subsection (a)(3), ‘prohibited person’ means any person described<br />in 18 U.S.C. &#167; 842(i).".<br />Section 2K2.1(a)(4)(B) is amended by striking "is" after "(i)" and inserting "was"; and by<br />inserting "at the time the defendant committed the instant offense" after "prohibited person".<br /><br />Section 2K2.1(a)(6) is amended by striking "is" after "(A)" and inserting "was"; and by<br />inserting "at the time the defendant committed the instant offense" after "prohibited person".<br />The Commentary to &#167;2K2.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by striking the text<br />of Note 6 as follows:<br />‘Prohibited person,’ as used in subsections (a)(4)(B) and (a)(6), means anyone who:<br />(i) is under indictment for, or has been convicted of, a ‘crime punishable by<br />imprisonment for more than one year,’ as defined by 18 U.S.C. &#167; 921(a)(20); (ii) is<br />a fugitive from justice; (iii) is an unlawful user of, or is addicted to, any controlled<br />substance; (iv) has been adjudicated as a mental defective or involuntarily<br />committed to a mental institution; (v) being an alien, is illegally or unlawfully in the<br />United States; (vi) is subject to a court order that restrains such person from<br />harassing, stalking, or threatening an intimate partner of such person or child of such<br />intimate partner or person, or engaging in other conduct that would place an intimate<br />partner in reasonable fear of bodily injury to the partner or child as defined in<br />18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(d)(8); or (vii) has been convicted in any court of a misdemeanor<br />crime of domestic violence as defined in 18 U.S.C. &#167; 921(a)(33).",<br />and inserting the following:<br />"For purposes of subsections (a)(4)(B) and (a)(6), ‘prohibited person’ means any<br />person described in 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(g) or &#167; 922(n).".</td><td>Reason for Amendment: This amendment makes two revisions regarding the definition<br />of "prohibited person" in subsection (a)(3) of &#167;2K1.3 (Unlawful Receipt, Possession, or<br />Transportation of Explosive Materials; Prohibited Transactions Involving Explosive<br />Materials) and subsections (a)(4)(B) and (a)(6) of &#167;2K2.1 (Unlawful Receipt, Possession,<br />or Transportation of Firearms or Ammunition; Prohibited Transactions Involving Firearms<br />or Ammunition). First, the amendment adopts the definitions of prohibited person found in<br />specific statutes for explosive and firearm offenses. (There is no uniform statutory definition<br />of prohibited person.) The relevant statutory provision for &#167;2K1.3 is 18 U.S.C. &#167; 842(i), and<br />the relevant statutory provisions for &#167;2K2.1 are 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(g) and (n).<br />Second, the amendment clarifies that the pertinent alternative base offense level applies only<br />when the offender attains the requisite status prior to committing the instant offense. This<br />clarification is consistent with the amendment on prior felonies, which provides for increased<br />punishment only when the offender sustains certain felony convictions prior to committing<br />the instant offense.</td><td>Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2001.</td></tr><tr><td class="n">631</td><td>Amendment 631</td><td>Section 2K1.3(a)(1) is amended by striking "had at least two prior felony<br />convictions of either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense; or" and inserting<br />"committed any part of the instant offense subsequent to sustaining at least two felony<br />convictions of either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense;";<br />Section 2K1.3(a)(2) is amended by striking "had one prior felony conviction of either a<br />crime of violence or a controlled substance offense; or" and inserting "committed any part<br />of the instant offense subsequent to sustaining one felony conviction of either a crime of<br />Amendment 629 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003<br /><br />violence or a controlled substance offense;".<br />The Commentary to &#167;2K1.3 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by striking the text<br />of Note 2 as follows:<br />‘Crime of violence,’ ‘controlled substance offense,’ and ‘prior felony conviction(s),’<br />as used in subsections (a)(1) and (a)(2), are defined at &#167;4B1.2 (Definitions of Terms<br />Used in Section 4B1.1), subsection (a), subsection (b), and Application Note 1 of<br />the Commentary, respectively.

Pugh, 158 F.3d 1308, 1311 (D.C. Cir. 1998) (finding the guideline<br />language ambiguous but the commentary language clear, thereby counting prior felony<br />conviction that was sentenced prior to sentencing for the instant federal offense, even if the<br />defendant committed the prior felony offense after the instant federal offense); United States<br />v. McCary, 14 F.3d 1502, 1506 (10th Cir. 1994) (the defendant’s base offense level is to be<br />determined on the basis of the defendant’s status as of the date the district court imposed<br />sentence, not the date of the offense for which he had previously been convicted); and United<br />States v. Laihben, 167 F.3d 1364 (11th Cir. 1999) (district court properly considered<br />defendant’s conviction, which occurred after commission of, but before sentencing, on the<br />federal firearms offense, in determining offense level), with United States v. Barton, 100<br />F.3d 43, 46 (6th Cir. 1996) (defendant’s state drug crime, which was committed after federal<br />offense of being a felon in possession of firearm, could not have been counted as prior felony<br />conviction under &#167;2K2.1(a), even though defendant was convicted and sentenced on state<br />offense prior to sentencing on federal charge; only those convictions that occur prior to the<br />commission of the firearm offense may be counted against the defendant in determining the<br />base offense level) ) and United States v. Oetken, 241 F.3d 1057 (8th Cir. 2001) (only<br />convictions that occur prior to the commission of the offense qualify as "prior convictions").<br />The amendment adopts the minority view that an offense committed after the commission<br />of any part of the offense cannot be counted as a prior felony conviction. The amendment<br />clarifies, in &#167;2K1.3(a)(1) and (a)(2) and in &#167;2K2.1(a)(1), (a)(2), (a)(3) and (a)(4)(A), that the<br />instant offense must have been committed subsequent to sustaining the prior felony<br />conviction. In so doing, this amendment adopts a rule that is consistent with the<br />requirements concerning the use of prior convictions under &#167;&#167;4B1.1 (Career Offender) and<br />4B1.2 (Definitions of Terms Used in Section 4B1.1).<br />This amendment also clarifies that in cases in which more than one prior felony conviction<br />is required for application of the base offense level in &#167;2K1.3 or &#167;2K2.1, the prior felony<br />convictions must be counted separately under Chapter Four (Criminal History and Criminal<br />Livelihood).<br />The amendment makes nonsubstantive clarifying changes in the definitions of "controlled<br />November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II Amendment 632<br /><br />substance offense", "crime of violence", and "felony conviction" for purposes of &#167;&#167;2K1.3<br />and 2K2.1.</td><td>Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2001.</td></tr><tr><td class="n">632</td><td>Amendment 632</td><td>Section 2K2.1(b)(1) is amended in the table by striking subdivisions (A)<br />through (F) as follows:<br />"(A) 3-4 add 1<br />(B) 5-7 add 2<br />(C) 8-12 add 3<br />(D) 13-24 add 4<br />(E) 25-49 add 5<br />(F) 50 or more add 6.",<br />and inserting the following:<br />"(A) 3-7 add 2<br />(B) 8-24 add 4<br />(C) 25-99 add 6<br />(D) 100-199 add 8<br />(E) 200 or more add 10.".<br />The Commentary to &#167;2K2.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 16 by<br />striking "significantly" and inserting "substantially"; and by striking "fifty" and inserting<br />"200".</td><td>Reason for Amendment: This amendment responds to a recommendation from the Bureau<br />of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) to increase the penalties in &#167;2K2.1 (Unlawful<br />Receipt, Possession or Transportation of Firearms or Ammunition) for offenses involving<br />more than 100 firearms.<br />The amendment modifies the firearms table at &#167;2K2.1(b)(1), to provide enhancements in<br />two-level increments. Prior to this amendment, the table provided enhancements in one-<br />level increments. This change has the effect of compressing the table by providing a wider<br />range in each subdivision of the table for the number of firearms involved in the offense.<br />Compressing the table in this manner diminishes some of the fact-finding required to<br />determine how many firearms were involved in the offense and provides some increase in<br />penalties. The amendment provides additional two-level increases for offenses that involve<br />either 100-199 firearms, or 200 or more firearms. These increases are provided to ensure<br />adequate and proportionate punishment in cases that involve large numbers of firearms.<br />The amendment also makes a conforming change to Application Note 16 of &#167;2K2.1<br />regarding upward departures.</td><td>Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2001.</td></tr><tr><td class="n">633</td><td>Amendment 633</td><td>Chapter Two, Part L, Subpart 1 is amended by striking &#167;2L1.2 and its<br />Amendment 630 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003<br /><br />accompanying commentary as follows:<br />"&#167;2L1.2.

For purposes of this guideline—<br />‘Deported after a conviction,’ means that the deportation was subsequent<br />to the conviction, whether or not the deportation was in response to such<br />conviction.

This guideline applies only to felonies. A first offense under 8 U.S.C. &#167;<br />1325(a) is a Class B misdemeanor for which no guideline has been<br />promulgated. A prior sentence for such offense, however, is to be<br />considered under the provisions of Chapter Four, Part A (Criminal History).<br />3. In the case of a defendant with repeated prior instances of deportation, an<br />upward departure may be warranted. See &#167;4A1.3 (Adequacy of Criminal<br />History Category).<br />4. An adjustment under subsection (b) for a prior felony conviction applies in<br />addition to any criminal history points added for such conviction in Chapter<br />Four, Part A (Criminal History).<br />5. Aggravated felonies that trigger the adjustment from subsection (b)(1)(A)<br />vary widely. If subsection (b)(1)(A) applies, and (A) the defendant has<br />previously been convicted of only one felony offense; (B) such offense was<br />not a crime of violence or firearms offense; and (C) the term of<br />imprisonment imposed for such offense did not exceed one year, a<br />downward departure may be warranted based on the seriousness of the<br />aggravated felony.".<br />A replacement guideline is inserted as &#167;2L1.2 (Unlawfully Entering or Remaining in the<br />United States).</td><td>Reason for Amendment: This amendment responds to concerns raised by a number of<br />judges, probation officers, and defense attorneys, particularly in districts along the southwest<br />border between the United States and Mexico, that &#167;2L1.2 (Unlawfully Entering or<br />Remaining in the United States) sometimes results in disproportionate penalties because of<br />the 16-level enhancement provided in the guideline for a prior conviction for an aggravated<br />felony. The disproportionate penalties result because the breadth of the definition of<br />"aggravated felony" provided in 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1101(a)(43), which is incorporated into the<br />guideline by reference, means that a defendant who previously was convicted of murder, for<br />example, receives the same 16-level enhancement as a defendant previously convicted of<br />simple assault. The Commission also observed that the criminal justice system has been<br />addressing this inequity on an ad hoc basis in such cases by increased use of departures.<br />This amendment responds to these concerns by providing a more graduated sentencing<br />enhancement of between 8 levels and 16 levels, depending on the seriousness of the prior<br />aggravated felony and the dangerousness of the defendant. In doing so, the Commission<br />determined that the 16-level enhancement is warranted if the defendant previously was<br />deported, or unlawfully remained in the United States, after a conviction for certain serious<br />offenses, specifically, a drug trafficking offense for which the sentence imposed exceeded<br />13 months, a felony that is a crime of violence, a felony that is a firearms offense, a felony<br />that is a national security or terrorism offense, a felony that is a human trafficking offense,<br />Amendment 632 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003<br /><br />and a felony that is an alien smuggling offense committed for profit. Other felony drug<br />trafficking offenses will receive a 12-level enhancement. All other aggravated felony<br />offenses will receive an 8-level enhancement.<br />This amendment also deletes an application note providing that a downward departure may<br />be warranted based on the seriousness of the offense if the 16-level enhancement applied and<br />(1) the defendant has previously been convicted of only one felony offense; (2) such offense<br />was not a crime of violence or firearms offense; and (3) the term of imprisonment for such<br />offenses did not exceed one year. The Commission determined that the graduation of the 16-<br />level enhancement based on the seriousness of the prior conviction negated the need for this<br />departure provision. As a result, this amendment may have the indirect result of reducing<br />the departure rate for cases sentenced under &#167;2L1.2. In addition, this amendment renders<br />moot a circuit conflict regarding whether the three criteria set forth in the application note<br />are the exclusive basis for a downward departure from the 16-level enhancement. Compare<br />United States v. Sanchez-Rodriguez, 161 F.3d 556 (9th Cir. 1998) (holding that Application<br />Note 5 to &#167;2L1.2 does not limit the circumstances under which a downward departure from<br />the 16-level enhancement is warranted); and United States v. Alfaro-Zayas, 196 F.3d 1338<br />(11th Cir. 1999) (same), with United States v. Tappin, 205 F.3d 536 (2d Cir. 2000) (holding<br />that a defendant must satisfy all three criteria set forth in Application Note 5 in &#167;2L1.2 to<br />receive a downward departure from the 16-level enhancement).<br />This amendment also makes a number of other minor changes to &#167;2L1.2, to provide<br />guidance regarding the application of the enhancement for the commission of three or more<br />prior misdemeanors and to provide definitions for terms used in the guideline.</td><td>Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2001.</td></tr><tr><td class="n">634</td><td>Amendment 634</td><td>The heading to Chapter Two, Part M is amended by adding at the end "And<br />Weapons of Mass Destruction".<br />Section 2M5.1 is amended by striking subsection (a) as follows:<br />"(a) Base Offense Level (Apply the greater):<br />(1) 22, if national security or nuclear proliferation controls were<br />evaded; or<br />(2) 14.",<br />and inserting the following:<br />"(a) Base Offense Level (Apply the greater):<br />(1) 26, if national security controls or controls relating to the<br />proliferation of nuclear, biological, or chemical weapons or<br />materials were evaded; or<br />(2) 14, otherwise.".<br />Section 2M5.2(a)(1) is amended by striking "22" and inserting "26".<br />November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II Amendment 633<br /><br />The heading to Chapter Two, Part M, Subpart 6 is amended by striking "Atomic Energy" and<br />inserting "Nuclear, Biological, And Chemical Weapons And Materials, And Other Weapons<br />of Mass Destruction".<br />Chapter Two, Part M is amended by striking &#167;2M6.1 as follows:<br />"&#167;2M6.1.

App. &#167; 1701 2M5.1, 2M5.2".</td><td>Reason for Amendment: This amendment responds to a statutory provision expressing a<br />sense of Congress and addresses two offenses relating to biological and chemical weapons.<br />Specifically, the amendment responds to section 1423(a) of the National Defense<br />Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1997, Public Law 104–201, that expressed a sense of<br />Congress that guideline penalties are inadequate for certain offenses involving the<br />importation and exportation of nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons, materials, or<br />technologies by providing a four-level increase for those offenses in subsection (a)(1) of both<br />&#167;&#167;2M5.1 (Evasion of Export Controls) and 2M5.2 (Exportation of Arms, Munitions, or<br />Military Equipment or Services Without a Required Validated Export License). This<br />increase serves to make the penalty structure for those offenses proportional to other national<br />security guidelines in Chapter Two, Part M. In addition, Appendix A (Statutory Index) is<br />amended to refer one of the offenses, 50 U.S.C. &#167; 1701 (which prior to this amendment was<br />not referenced in the Statutory Index), to both &#167;&#167;2M5.1 and 2M5.2.<br />The amendment also substantially revises &#167;2M6.1 to incorporate offenses at 18 U.S.C. &#167; 175,<br />relating to biological weapons, and 18 U.S.C. &#167; 229, relating to chemical weapons.<br />Specifically, the amendment modifies &#167;2M6.1 as follows:<br />First, the amendment provides three alternative base offense levels. The first alternative base<br />offense level of level 42 applies if the offense was committed with the intent to injure the<br />United States or to aid a foreign government or foreign terrorist organization and<br />incorporates the 12-level enhancement previously at subsection (b)(1). Therefore, this<br />change does not affect the overall offense level for these offenses. "Foreign terrorist<br />organizations" are added because such groups are investing in the acquisition of<br />unconventional weapons such as nuclear, biological, and chemical agents. This first<br />alternative base offense level is expected to apply to cases previously covered by the<br />guideline (i.e., the acquisition of nuclear material from nuclear facilities in order to assist<br />foreign governments, thereby creating a threat to the national security), as well as to cases<br />that implicate the national security and involve biological and chemical weapons and other<br />weapons of mass destruction.<br />The amendment provides that, if the base offense level of level 42 applies, none of the<br />adjustments in subsection (b) shall apply. However, if death results, the cross reference<br />allows for the possibility of a greater offense level through application of the first degree<br />murder guideline.<br />The second alternative base offense level of level 28 applies to those cases that do not<br />threaten the national security of the United States, and is expected to apply in most cases.<br />The third alternative base offense level of level 20 applies to cases which involve a threat to<br />use a nuclear, biological, or chemical weapon or material, or other weapon of mass<br /><br />destruction, but do not involve any conduct evidencing an intent or ability to carry out the<br />threat and, accordingly, are less serious offenses.<br />Second, the amendment provides a two-level enhancement in subsection (b)(1) if the offense<br />or threat involved particularly dangerous types of nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons<br />and materials that are defined in the guideline commentary by reference to the applicable<br />statutory and regulatory provisions. This enhancement reflects the distinctions already made<br />in international treaties, provisions of title 18, United States Code, relevant regulatory<br />schemes, and the fact that certain types of weapons and materials are inherently more lethal<br />and pose a greater threat to the public safety.<br />Third, the amendment provides a four-level enhancement in subsection (b)(2) if any victim<br />died or sustained permanent or life-threatening bodily injury, and a two-level enhancement<br />if any victim sustained serious bodily injury. If the degree of injury is between permanent<br />or life-threatening bodily injury and serious bodily injury, a three-level enhancement is<br />provided. This enhancement is modeled after the enhancement found in &#167;2N1.1 (Tampering<br />or Attempting to Tamper Involving Risk of Death or Bodily Injury).<br />Fourth, the amendment provides a four-level enhancement for cases involving a substantial<br />disruption of public, governmental, or business functions or services, or the substantial<br />expenditure of funds to clean up, decontaminate, or otherwise respond to the offense.<br />Fifth, the amendment provides two cross references, applicable if the resulting offense level<br />is greater and either death resulted (in which case the first or second degree murder guideline<br />would apply), or if the offense was tantamount to attempted murder (in which case the<br />attempted murder guideline would apply). These cross references are also modeled after the<br />cross reference found in &#167;2N1.1.<br />Sixth, the amendment provides a special instruction that if the defendant is convicted of one<br />count involving the death of, serious bodily injury to, or attempted murder of, more than one<br />victim, the grouping rules will be applied as if the defendant had been convicted of separate<br />counts for each such victim.<br />Seventh, the amendment amends Appendix A to refer violations of 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 175 and<br />229 to &#167;2M6.1 and to delete a number of guideline references for violations of 18 U.S.C. &#167;<br />2332a and instead provide a reference for that offense to &#167;&#167;2K1.4 (Arson; Property Damage<br />by Use of Explosives) and 2M6.1 (in the case of other weapons of mass destruction).<br />Finally, the amendment amends the title of &#167;2M6.1 to include attempts and conspiracies, and<br />adds &#167;2M6.1 under the sections addressing attempts and conspiracies in Application<br />Note 1 of &#167;2X1.1 (Attempt, Solicitation, or Conspiracy) to indicate that attempts and<br />conspiracies are covered expressly by the &#167;2M6.1 offense guideline.</td><td>Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2001.</td></tr><tr><td class="n">635</td><td>Amendment 635</td><td>Chapter Two, Part S is amended by striking &#167;2S1.1 as follows:<br />"&#167;2S1.1.

The<br />amendment responds in several ways to concerns that the penalty structure existing prior to<br />this amendment for such offenses did not reflect adequately the culpability of the defendant<br />or the seriousness of the money laundering conduct because the offense level for money<br />laundering was determined without sufficient consideration of the defendant’s involvement<br />in, or the relative seriousness of, the underlying offense. This amendment is designed to<br />promote proportionality by providing increased penalties for defendants who launder funds<br />derived from more serious underlying criminal conduct, such as drug trafficking, crimes of<br />violence, and fraud offenses that generate relatively high loss amounts, and decreased<br />penalties for defendants who launder funds derived from less serious underlying criminal<br />conduct, such as basic fraud offenses that generate relatively low loss amounts.<br />First, this amendment ties offense levels for money laundering more closely to the<br />underlying conduct that was the source of the criminally derived funds by separating money<br />laundering offenders into two categories for purposes of determining the base offense level.<br />For direct money launderers (offenders who commit or would be accountable under<br />&#167;1B1.3(a)(1)(A) (Relevant Conduct) for the underlying offense which generated the criminal<br />proceeds), subsection (a)(1) sets the base offense level at the offense level in Chapter Two<br />(Offense Conduct) for the underlying offense (i.e., the base offense level, specific offense<br />characteristics, cross references, and special instructions for the underlying offense). For<br />third party money launderers (offenders who launder the proceeds generated from underlying<br />offenses that the defendant did not commit or would not be accountable for under<br />&#167;1B1.3(a)(1)(A)), subsection (a)(2) sets the base offense level at level 8, plus an increase<br />based on the value of the laundered funds from the table in subsection (b)(1) of &#167;2B1.1<br />(Theft, Fraud, Property Destruction).<br />November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II Amendment 634<br /><br />Second, in addition to the base offense level calculation, this amendment provides an<br />enhancement designed to reflect the differing seriousness of the underlying conduct that was<br />the source of the criminally derived funds. Subsection (b)(1) provides a six-level<br />enhancement for third party money launderers who knew or believed that any of the<br />laundered funds were the proceeds of, or were intended to promote, certain types of more<br />serious underlying criminal conduct; specifically, drug trafficking, crimes of violence,<br />offenses involving firearms, explosives, national security, terrorism, and the sexual<br />exploitation of a minor. The Commission determined that defendants who knowingly<br />launder the proceeds of these more serious underlying offenses are substantially more<br />culpable than third party launderers of criminally derived proceeds of less serious underlying<br />offenses.<br />Third, this amendment provides three alternative enhancements, with the greatest applicable<br />enhancement to be applied. These enhancements are designed to (1) ensure that all direct<br />money launderers receive additional punishment for committing both the money laundering<br />offense and the underlying offense, and (2) reflect the differing seriousness of money<br />laundering conduct depending on the nature and sophistication of the offense. Specifically,<br />subsection (b)(2)(A) provides a one-level increase if the defendant was convicted under 18<br />U.S.C. &#167; 1957, and subsection (b)(2)(B) provides a two-level increase if the defendant was<br />convicted under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1956. The one-level difference between these two<br />enhancements reflects the fact that 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1956 has a statutory maximum penalty (20<br />years’ imprisonment) that is twice as long as the statutory maximum penalty for violations<br />of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1957 (10 years’ imprisonment). In addition, subsection (b)(3) provides an<br />additional two-level increase if subsection (b)(2)(B) applies and the offense involved<br />sophisticated laundering such as the use of fictitious entities, shell corporations, two or more<br />levels of transactions, or offshore financial accounts. The Commission determined that,<br />similar to fraud and tax offenses that involve sophisticated means, see subsection (b)(8) of<br />&#167;2B1.1 (Theft, Property Destruction, and Fraud), subsection (b)(2) of &#167;2T1.1 (Tax Evasion;<br />Willful Failure to File Return, Supply Information, or Pay Tax; Fraudulent or False Returns,<br />Statements, or Other Documents), violations of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1956 that involve sophisticated<br />laundering warrant additional punishment because such offenses are more difficult and time<br />consuming for law enforcement to detect than less sophisticated laundering. As a result of<br />the enhancements provided by subsections (b)(2)(A), (b)(2)(B), and (b)(3), all direct money<br />launderers will receive an offense level that is one to four levels greater than the Chapter<br />Two offense level for the underlying offense, depending on the statute of conviction and<br />sophistication of the money laundering offense conduct.<br />With respect to third party money launderers, subsection (b)(2)(C) provides a four-level<br />enhancement if the defendant is "in the business" of laundering funds. The Commission<br />determined that, similar to a professional "fence", see &#167;2B1.1(b)(4)(B), defendants who<br />routinely engage in laundering funds on behalf of others, and who gain financially from<br />engaging in such transactions, warrant substantial additional punishment because they<br />encourage the commission of additional criminal conduct.<br />Fourth, this amendment contains an application note expressly providing instructions<br />regarding the grouping of money laundering counts with a count of conviction for the<br />underlying offense. In a case in which the defendant is to be sentenced on a count of<br />conviction for money laundering and a count of conviction for the underlying offense that<br />generated the laundered funds, this application note instructs that such counts shall be<br />grouped pursuant to subsection (c) of &#167;3D1.2 (Groups of Closely-Related Counts), thereby<br />Amendment 634 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003<br /><br />resolving a circuit conflict on this issue.

Leonard, 61 F.3d 1181 (5th<br />Cir. 1995) (affirming decision to group fraud and money laundering offenses under<br />&#167;3D1.2(d) because defendant’s money laundering activity and fraudulent telemarketing<br />scheme constituted the same common plan and had the same victims); and United States v.<br />Wilson, 98 F.3d 281 (7th Cir. 1996) (district court erred in not grouping money laundering<br />and mail fraud convictions under &#167;3D1.2(d)), with United States v. Kneeland, 148 F.3d 6<br />(1st Cir. 1998) (affirming district court decision not to group fraud and money laundering<br />counts under &#167;3D1.2(d) because the offense level for fraud, unlike money laundering, is<br />determined "largely on the basis of total amount of harm or loss"); United States v. Napoli,<br />179 F.3d 1 (2d Cir. 1999), cert. denied, 528 U.S. 1162 (2000) (affirming decision not to<br />group wire fraud and money laundering counts under &#167;3D1.2(b) or (d) because the offenses<br />have different victims and the offense level for money laundering, unlike fraud, is not based<br />primarily on the amount of money involved); United States v. Hildebrand, 152 F.3d 756 (8th<br />Cir.), cert. denied, 525 U.S. 1033 (1998) (finding that money laundering and fraud counts<br />should not be grouped because the fraud and money laundering guidelines do not measure<br />the same types of harm); United States v.

Subsection (a) applies to a defendant who plays a minimal role in concerted<br />activity. It is intended to cover defendants who are plainly among the least<br />culpable of those involved in the conduct of a group. Under this provision,<br />the defendant’s lack of knowledge or understanding of the scope and<br />structure of the enterprise and of the activities of others is indicative of a<br />role as minimal participant.<br />2. It is intended that the downward adjustment for a minimal participant will<br />be used infrequently. It would be appropriate, for example, for someone<br />November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II Amendment 635<br /><br />who played no other role in a very large drug smuggling operation than to<br />offload part of a single marihuana shipment, or in a case where an<br />individual was recruited as a courier for a single smuggling transaction<br />involving a small amount of drugs.<br />3. For purposes of &#167;3B1.2(b), a minor participant means any participant who<br />is less culpable than most other participants, but whose role could not be<br />described as minimal.<br />4. If a defendant has received a lower offense level by virtue of being<br />convicted of an offense significantly less serious than warranted by his<br />actual criminal conduct, a reduction for a mitigating role under this section<br />ordinarily is not warranted because such defendant is not substantially less<br />culpable than a defendant whose only conduct involved the less serious<br />offense. For example, if a defendant whose actual conduct involved a<br />minimal role in the distribution of 25 grams of cocaine (an offense having<br />a Chapter Two offense level of 14 under &#167;2D1.1) is convicted of simple<br />possession of cocaine (an offense having a Chapter Two offense level of 6<br />under &#167;2D2.1), no reduction for a mitigating role is warranted because the<br />defendant is not substantially less culpable than a defendant whose only<br />conduct involved the simple possession of cocaine.<br />Background: This section provides a range of adjustments for a defendant who<br />plays a part in committing the offense that makes him substantially less culpable<br />than the average participant. The determination whether to apply subsection (a) or<br />subsection (b), or an intermediate adjustment, involves a determination that is<br />heavily dependent upon the facts of the particular case.",<br />and inserting the following:<br />"1. Definition.—For purposes of this guideline, ‘participant’ has the meaning<br />given that term in Application Note 1 of &#167;3B1.1 (Aggravating Role).<br />2. Requirement of Multiple Participants.—This guideline is not applicable<br />unless more than one participant was involved in the offense. See the<br />Introductory Commentary to this Part (Role in the Offense). Accordingly,<br />an adjustment under this guideline may not apply to a defendant who is the<br />only defendant convicted of an offense unless that offense involved other<br />participants in addition to the defendant and the defendant otherwise<br />qualifies for such an adjustment.<br />3. Applicability of Adjustment.—<br />(A) Substantially Less Culpable than Average Participant.—This<br />section provides a range of adjustments for a defendant who plays<br />a part in committing the offense that makes him substantially less<br />culpable than the average participant.<br />A defendant who is accountable under &#167;1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct)<br />only for the conduct in which the defendant personally was<br />Amendment 635 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003<br /><br />involved and who performs a limited function in concerted criminal<br />activity is not precluded from consideration for an adjustment<br />under this guideline. For example, a defendant who is convicted of<br />a drug trafficking offense, whose role in that offense was limited to<br />transporting or storing drugs and who is accountable under &#167;1B1.3<br />only for the quantity of drugs the defendant personally transported<br />or stored is not precluded from consideration for an adjustment<br />under this guideline.<br />(B) Conviction of Significantly Less Serious Offense.—If a defendant<br />has received a lower offense level by virtue of being convicted of<br />an offense significantly less serious than warranted by his actual<br />criminal conduct, a reduction for a mitigating role under this<br />section ordinarily is not warranted because such defendant is not<br />substantially less culpable than a defendant whose only conduct<br />involved the less serious offense. For example, if a defendant<br />whose actual conduct involved a minimal role in the distribution of<br />25 grams of cocaine (an offense having a Chapter Two offense<br />level of level 14 under &#167;2D1.1 (Unlawful Manufacturing,<br />Importing, Exporting, or Trafficking (Including Possession with<br />Intent to Commit These Offenses); Attempt or Conspiracy)) is<br />convicted of simple possession of cocaine (an offense having a<br />Chapter Two offense level of level 6 under &#167;2D2.1 (Unlawful<br />Possession; Attempt or Conspiracy)), no reduction for a mitigating<br />role is warranted because the defendant is not substantially less<br />culpable than a defendant whose only conduct involved the simple<br />possession of cocaine.<br />(C) Fact-Based Determination.—The determination whether to apply<br />subsection (a) or subsection (b), or an intermediate adjustment,<br />involves a determination that is heavily dependent upon the facts<br />of the particular case. As with any other factual issue, the court, in<br />weighing the totality of the circumstances, is not required to find,<br />based solely on the defendant’s bare assertion, that such a role<br />adjustment is warranted.<br />4. Minimal Participant.—Subsection (a) applies to a defendant described in<br />Application Note 3(A) who plays a minimal role in concerted activity. It<br />is intended to cover defendants who are plainly among the least culpable of<br />those involved in the conduct of a group. Under this provision, the<br />defendant’s lack of knowledge or understanding of the scope and structure<br />of the enterprise and of the activities of others is indicative of a role as<br />minimal participant. It is intended that the downward adjustment for a<br />minimal participant will be used infrequently.<br />5. Minor Participant.— Subsection (b) applies to a defendant described in<br />Application Note 3(A) who is less culpable than most other participants, but<br />whose role could not be described as minimal.".</td><td>Reason for Amendment: This amendment resolves a circuit conflict regarding whether a<br />November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II Amendment 637<br /><br />defendant who is accountable under &#167;1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct) only for conduct in which<br />the defendant personally was involved, and who performs a limited function in concerted<br />criminal activity, is precluded from consideration for an adjustment under &#167;3B1.2<br />(Mitigating Role). Compare United States v. Burnett, 66 F.3d 137 (7th Cir. 1995) ("where<br />a defendant is sentenced only for the amount of drugs he handled, he is not entitled to a<br />&#167;3B1.2 reduction"), with United States v. Rodriguez De Varon, 175 F.3d 930 (11th Cir.<br />1999) (a defendant is not automatically precluded from consideration for a mitigating role<br />adjustment in a case in which the defendant is held accountable solely for the amount of<br />drugs he personally handled). Although this circuit conflict arose in the context of a drug<br />offense, the amendment resolves it in a manner that makes the rule applicable to all types of<br />offenses.<br />The amendment adopts the approach articulated by the Eleventh Circuit in United States v.<br />Rodriguez De Varon, supra, that &#167;3B1.2 does not automatically preclude a defendant from<br />being considered for a mitigating role adjustment in a case in which the defendant is held<br />accountable under &#167;1B1.3 solely for the amount of drugs the defendant personally handled.<br />In considering a &#167;3B1.2 adjustment, a court must measure the defendant’s role against the<br />relevant conduct for which the defendant is held accountable at sentencing, whether or not<br />other defendants are charged.<br />In contrast to the holding in United States v. Burnett, supra, this amendment allows the court<br />to apply traditional analysis on the applicability of a reduction pursuant to &#167;3B1.2, even in<br />a case in which a defendant is held liable under &#167;1B1.3 only for conduct (such as drug<br />quantities) in which the defendant was involved personally.<br />The substantive impact of this amendment in resolving the circuit conflict is to provide, in<br />the context of a drug courier, for example, that the court is not precluded from considering<br />a &#167;3B1.2 adjustment simply because the defendant’s role in the offense was limited to<br />transporting or storing drugs, and the defendant was accountable under &#167;1B1.3 only for the<br />quantity of drugs the defendant personally transported or stored. The amendment does not<br />require that such a defendant receive a reduction under &#167;3B1.2, or suggest that such a<br />defendant can receive a reduction based only on those facts; rather, the amendment provides<br />only that such a defendant is not precluded from consideration for such a reduction if the<br />defendant otherwise qualifies for the reduction pursuant to the terms of &#167;3B1.2.<br />In addition to resolving the circuit conflict, the amendment makes the following non-<br />substantive revisions to &#167;3B1.2 to clarify guideline application: (1) incorporating<br />commentary from the Introduction to Chapter Three, Part B (Role in the Offense) that there<br />must be more than one participant before application of a mitigating role adjustment may be<br />considered; (2) incorporating into this guideline the definition of "participant" from &#167;3B1.1<br />(Aggravating Role); (3) moving into an application note significant background commentary<br />that has been cited frequently in appellate decisions; (4) adding a section on fact-based<br />determinations to Application Note 3 that emphasizes the significant judicial role in<br />decision-making on the applicability of &#167;3B1.2; (5) maintaining commentary language that<br />the minimal role adjustment is intended to be used infrequently; and (6) making technical<br />amendments to the Commentary to clarify applicable rules (such as the addition of headings<br />for, and the reordering of, application notes in the commentary) that are intended to have no<br />substantive impact.<br />The language regarding "average participant" is moved from the Background into<br />Amendment 637 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003<br /><br />Application Note 3(A) to provide guidance as to the applicability of &#167;3B1.2. For a reduction<br />to apply, the court, at a minimum, must make a factual determination that the defendant’s<br />role was significantly less culpable than the average participant.</td><td>Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2001.</td></tr><tr><td class="n">637</td><td>Amendment 637</td><td>The Commentary to &#167;2J1.6 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in<br />Note 3 in the first sentence of the second paragraph by striking "In" and inserting "However,<br />in"; and by inserting "other than a case of failure to appear for service of sentence," after<br />"offense and the failure to appear,".<br />The Commentary to &#167;2M3.9 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by inserting after<br />Note 2 the following:<br />"3.

L. 107–56 (the "Act").<br />Among its many provisions are appropriately severe penalties for offenses against mass<br />transportation systems and interstate gas or hazardous liquid pipelines. The amendment also<br />increases sentences for threats that substantially disrupt governmental or business operations<br />or result in costly cleanup measures. It expands the guideline coverage of offenses involving<br />bioterrorism, and it creates a new guideline for providing material support to foreign terrorist<br />organizations. It punishes attempts and conspiracies to commit terrorism as if the offense<br />had been carried out and adds an invited upward departure to the guidelines’ terrorism<br />enhancement for appropriate cases. Finally, it authorizes a term of supervised release up to<br />life for a defendant convicted of a federal crime of terrorism that resulted in substantial risk<br />of death or serious bodily injury to another person.<br />First, this amendment makes a number of changes to Appendix A (Statutory Index) and<br />several guidelines in Chapter Two (Offense Conduct) in order to incorporate several new<br />predicate offenses to federal crimes of terrorism. This amendment addresses section 801 of<br />the Act, which added 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1993, generally pertaining to offenses against mass<br />transportation systems and facilities. The amendment also addresses 49 U.S.C. &#167; 46507<br />pertaining to false information and threats, that heretofore was not listed in the Statutory<br />Index, as well as the new offense at 49 U.S.C. &#167; 46503, pertaining to interference with<br />security screening personnel.<br />Specifically, the amendment makes a number of changes to &#167;2A5.2 (Interference with Flight<br />Crew Member or Flight Attendant) and the guidelines in Chapter Two, Part A, Subpart 2<br />(Assault). First, this amendment references violations of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1993(a)(4), (a)(5),<br />(a)(6), and (b) and 49 U.S.C. &#167; 46503 to &#167;2A5.2 because that guideline presently covers<br />other similar offenses and because the guideline’s alternative base offense levels cover<br />offenses that involve reckless or intentional endangerment, conduct which is an element of<br />some of these new offenses.<br />In order to take into account aggravating conduct which may occur in such offenses, the<br />amendment adds a specific offense characteristic for use of a weapon, borrowing language<br />from &#167;2A2.2 (Aggravated Assault). The specific offense characteristic provides a graduated<br />enhancement with a minimum offense level of level 24 at &#167;2A5.2(b)(1) for the involvement<br />of a dangerous weapon in the offense. This enhancement addresses concerns that the current<br />base offense level of level 18 (in &#167;2A5.2(a)(2)) for reckless endangerment may be<br />inadequate in situations involving a dangerous weapon and reckless disregard for the safety<br />of human life. The minimum offense level of level 24 mirrors the offense level that applies<br />for conduct amounting to reckless endangerment under subsection (b)(1) of &#167;2K1.5<br />Amendment 637 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003<br /><br />(Possessing Dangerous Weapons or Materials While Boarding or Aboard an Aircraft). A<br />cross reference to the appropriate homicide guideline also is provided for offenses in which<br />death results; death as an aggravating circumstance is included in 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1993(b).<br />The amendment also amends &#167;2A6.1 (Threatening or Harassing Communications) to<br />incorporate offenses against mass transportation systems under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1993(a)(7) and<br />(a)(8) and 49 U.S.C. &#167; 46507 and provides corresponding references in the Statutory Index.<br />These three provisions require the same type of threatening conduct or conveyance of false<br />information as two other offenses referenced to &#167;2A6.1, specifically 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 32(c) and<br />35(b), which cover aircraft, railroads, and shipping, rather than mass transportation systems.<br />Additionally, a specific offense characteristic is added if the offense resulted in a substantial<br />disruption of public, governmental, or business functions or services, or a substantial<br />expenditure of funds to clean up, decontaminate, or otherwise respond to the offense. This<br />enhancement recognizes that a terrorist threat usually will be directed at a large number of<br />individuals, governmental buildings or operations, or infrastructure. Unless such a terrorist<br />threat is immediately dismissed as not credible, the conduct may result in significant<br />disruption and response costs. This specific offense characteristic is the same as that<br />contained in subsection (b)(3) of &#167;2M6.1 (Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical Weapons, and<br />Other Weapons of Mass Destruction). An invited upward departure provision is added for<br />situations in which the offense involved multiple victims, a circumstance which might occur<br />in the context of these new offenses.<br />This amendment also amends &#167;2K1.4 (Arson; Property Damage by Use of Explosives) and<br />&#167;2B1.1 (Theft, Property Destruction, and Fraud) to cover violations of 18 U.S.C.<br />&#167; 1993(a)(1) and (b). Offenses under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1993(a)(1) are similar to another offense<br />referenced to these guidelines, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 32(a)(1), with respect to the intent standard<br />required to commit the offense, offense conduct, and resulting harm. The amendment<br />references violations of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1993(a)(2), (a)(3), and (b) to &#167;&#167;2K1.4 and 2M6.1.<br />These offenses encompass a wide range of conduct. For example, a violation of 18 U.S.C.<br />&#167; 1993(a)(3) may occur if the defendant sets fire to a garage or places a biological agent or<br />toxin for use as a destructive substance near an aircraft and this likely endangered the safety<br />of that aircraft.<br />The amendment expands &#167;2M6.1 to cover 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 175(b) and 175b, two new offenses<br />created by section 817 of the Act, involving possession of biological agents, toxins, and<br />delivery systems. Section 2M6.1 is the most appropriate guideline for these offenses<br />because they involve the knowing possession of certain biological substances. A base<br />offense level of level 20 is provided for 18 U.S.C. &#167; 175(b) offenses, the same base offense<br />level as is currently provided for threat cases under that guideline. The current two level<br />increase for particularly dangerous biological agents would be available for the most serious<br />substances.<br />A base offense level of level 22 is provided for offenses under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 175b, which<br />forbids certain restricted persons (defined in the statute) to ship or transport in interstate or<br />foreign commerce, or possess in or affecting commerce, any biological agent or toxin, or to<br />receive any biological agent or toxin that has been shipped or transported in interstate or<br />foreign commerce, if the biological agent or toxin is listed as a select agent (e.g., ebola,<br />anthrax). Because this offense already takes into account the serious nature of a select agent,<br />the amendment treats these offenses separately from offenses under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 175(b), with<br />a higher base offense level and an instruction that the enhancement for select biological<br />November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II Amendment 637<br /><br />agents does not apply.<br />The amendment also amends the Statutory Index to reference 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2339 to &#167;&#167;2X2.1<br />(Aiding and Abetting) and 2X3.1 (Accessory After the Fact). This offense prohibits<br />harboring or concealing any person who the defendant knows, or has reasonable grounds to<br />believe, has committed or is about to commit, one of several enumerated offenses.<br />Second, this amendment provides Statutory Index references, as well as modifications to<br />various Chapter Two guidelines, for a number of offenses that, prior to enactment of the Act,<br />were enumerated in 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2332b(g)(5) as predicate offenses for federal crimes of<br />terrorism but were not explicitly incorporated in the guidelines.<br />Specifically, the amendment references 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2332b(a)(1) offenses to &#167;&#167;2A1.1 (First<br />Degree Murder), 2A1.2 (Second Degree Murder), 2A1.3 (Voluntary Manslaughter), 2A1.4<br />(Involuntary Manslaughter), 2A2.1 (Assault with Intent to Commit Murder; Attempted<br />Murder), 2A2.2 (Aggravated Assault), and 2A4.1 (Kidnapping, Abduction, Unlawful<br />Restraint), inasmuch as 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2332b offenses are analogous to offenses currently<br />referenced to those guidelines.<br />The amendment also provides a Statutory Index reference to &#167;2A6.1 (Threatening or<br />Harassing Communications) for cases under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2332b(a)(2), which prohibits<br />threats, attempts and conspiracies to commit an offense under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2332b(a)(1).<br />This amendment also creates a new guideline, at &#167;2M5.3 (Providing Material Support or<br />Resources to Designated Foreign Terrorist Organizations), for offenses under 18 U.S.C.<br />&#167; 2339B, which prohibits the provision of material support or resources to a foreign terrorist<br />organization. The amendment references offenses under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2339A to &#167;&#167;2X2.1 and<br />2X3.1. Section 2339A offenses concern providing material support to terrorists that the<br />defendant knows or intends will be used in preparation for, or in carrying out, certain<br />specified predicate offenses. Thus, the essence of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2339A offenses is akin to<br />aiding and abetting or accessory after the fact offenses, which warrants reference to &#167;&#167;2X2.1<br />and 2X3.1. In contrast, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2339B offenses are referenced to a new guideline,<br />&#167;2M5.3, primarily because they are not statutorily linked to the commission of any specified<br />predicate offenses. To account for the variety of ways in which such offenses may be<br />committed, the new guideline provides two specific offense characteristics that enhance the<br />sentence for cases in which the material support involved dangerous weapons and in which<br />the material support involved nuclear, biological, or chemical weapons.<br />The amendment references torture offenses under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2340A to &#167;&#167;2A1.1, 2A1.2,<br />2A2.1, 2A2.2, and 2A4.1. The amendment also references 49 U.S.C. &#167; 60123(b), pertaining<br />to damaging or destroying an interstate gas or hazardous liquid pipeline facility, to &#167;&#167;2B1.1,<br />2K1.4, 2M2.1 (Destruction of, or Production of Defective, War Material, Premises, or<br />Utilities), and 2M2.3 (Destruction of, or Production of Defective, National Defense Material,<br />Premises, or Utilities).<br />Third, the amendment responds to section 811 of the Act, which amended a number of<br />offenses to ensure that attempts and conspiracies to commit any of those offenses subject the<br />offender to the same penalties prescribed for the object offense. This amendment provides<br />a special instruction in &#167;2X1.1 (Attempt, Solicitation, or Conspiracy) that the three level<br />reduction in &#167;2X1.1(b) does not apply to these offenses when committed for a terrorist<br />Amendment 637 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003<br /><br />objective.<br />Fourth, the amendment adds an encouraged, structured upward departure in &#167;3A1.4<br />(Terrorism) for offenses that involve terrorism but do not otherwise qualify as offenses that<br />involved or were intended to promote "federal crimes of terrorism" for purposes of the<br />terrorism adjustment in &#167;3A1.4. The amendment provides an upward departure, rather than<br />a specified guideline adjustment, because of the expected infrequency of these terrorism<br />offenses and to provide the court with a viable tool to account for the harm involved during<br />the commission of these offenses on a case-by-case basis. In addition, the structured upward<br />departure provision makes it possible to impose punishment equal in severity to that which<br />would be imposed if the &#167;3A1.4 adjustment actually applied.<br />The amendment adds an application note to &#167;3A1.4 regarding harboring and concealing<br />offenses to clarify that &#167;3A1.4 may apply in the case of offenses that occurred after the<br />commission of the federal crime of terrorism (e.g., a case in which the defendant, in violation<br />of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2339A, concealed an individual who had committed a federal crime of<br />terrorism).<br />Fifth, the amendment amends &#167;2S1.3 (Structuring Transactions to Evade Reporting<br />Requirements; Failure to Report Cash or Monetary Transactions; Failure to File Currency<br />and Monetary Instrument Report; Knowingly Filing False Reports) to incorporate new<br />money laundering provisions created by the Act.<br />Specifically, the amendment provides an alternative base offense level of level 8 in &#167;2S1.3(a)<br />in order to incorporate offenses under 31 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 5318 and 5318A. The base offense level<br />of level 8 recognizes the heightened due diligence requirements placed on financial<br />institutions with respect to payable-through accounts, correspondent accounts, and shell<br />banks.<br />The amendment also amends &#167;2S1.3(b)(1), relating to the promotion of unlawful activity,<br />to provide an alternative prong if the offense involved bulk cash smuggling. This<br />amendment addresses 31 U.S.C. &#167; 5332, added by section 371 of the Act, which prohibits<br />concealing, with intent to evade a currency reporting requirement under 31 U.S.C. &#167; 5316,<br />more than $10,000 in currency or other monetary instruments and transporting or<br />transferring such currency or monetary instruments into or outside of the United States.<br />Findings set forth in that section of the Act indicate that bulk cash smuggling typically<br />involves the promotion of unlawful activity.<br />The amendment also provides an enhancement in &#167;2S1.3(b) to give effect to the enhanced<br />penalty provisions under 31 U.S.C. &#167; 5322(b) for offenses under subchapter II of chapter 53<br />of title 31, United Stated Code, if such offenses were committed as part of a pattern of<br />unlawful activity involving more than $100,000 in a 12-month period.<br />Sixth, the amendment addresses a number of miscellaneous issues related to terrorism.<br />Specifically, it provides a definition of terrorism for purposes of the prior conviction<br />enhancement in &#167;2L1.2 (Unlawfully Entering or Remaining in the United States). For<br />consistency, the definition is the same as that found in the current Chapter Three terrorism<br />adjustment.<br />It also amends &#167;3C1.1 (Obstructing or Impeding the Administration of Justice), in response<br /><br />to section 319(d) of the Act, which amends the Controlled Substances Act at 21 U.S.C. &#167;<br />853(e) to require a defendant to repatriate any property that may be seized and forfeited and<br />to deposit that property in the registry of the court or with the United States Marshals Service<br />or the Secretary of the Treasury. Section 319(d) of the Act also states that the failure to<br />comply with a protective order and an order to repatriate property "may also result in an<br />enhancement of the sentence of the defendant under the obstruction of justice provision of<br />the Federal Sentencing Guidelines." Accordingly, the amendment adds Application Note<br />4(j) to &#167;3C1.1 to provide that failure to comply with an order issued pursuant to 21 U.S.C.<br />&#167; 835(e) is an example of the types of conduct to which the adjustment applies.<br />It also amends &#167;5D1.2 (Term of Supervised Release), in response to section 812 of the Act,<br />which authorizes a term of supervised release of any term of years or life for a defendant<br />convicted of a federal crime of terrorism the commission of which resulted in, or created a<br />foreseeable risk of, death or serious bodily injury to another person.<br />It also amends &#167;2B1.1 to delete the special instruction pertaining to the imposition of not less<br />than six months’ imprisonment for a defendant convicted under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1030(a)(4) or<br />(5). This amendment is in response to section 814(f) of the Act, which directed the<br />Commission to amend the guidelines "to ensure that any individual convicted of a violation<br />of section 1030 of title 18, United States Code, can be subjected to appropriate penalties,<br />without regard to any mandatory minimum term of imprisonment."<br />It also adds a reference in the Statutory Index to &#167;2C1.1 (Offering, Giving, Soliciting, or<br />Receiving a Bribe; Extortion Under Color of Official Right), for the new offense created by<br />section 329 of the Act, which prohibits a federal official or employee, in connection with<br />administration of the money laundering provisions of the Act, to corruptly demand, seek,<br />receive, accept, or agree to receive or accept anything of value in return for being influenced<br />in the performance of an official act, being influenced to commit or aid in committing any<br />fraud on the United States, or being induced to do or omit to do any act in violation of<br />official duties.<br />It also amends &#167;2M5.1 (Evasion of Export Controls) to incorporate 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2332d,<br />which prohibits a United States person, knowing or having reasonable cause to know that<br />a country is designated under the Export Administration Act as a country supporting<br />international terrorism, to engage in a financial transaction with the government of that<br />country. The amendment provides a base offense level of level 26 for these offenses.<br />Finally, it amends &#167;2B2.3 (Trespass) to incorporate the offense under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1036.<br />That offense, added by section 2 of the Enhanced Federal Security Act of 2000, Pub. L.<br />106–547, prohibits, by fraud or pretense, the entering or attempting to enter any real<br />property, vessel, or aircraft of the United States, or secure area of an airport. The<br />amendment amends the existing two level enhancement in &#167;2B2.3(b)(1) to provide an<br />additional ground for application of the enhancement if the trespass involved a vessel,<br />aircraft of the United States, or secure area of an airport. It also adds a cross reference to<br />&#167;2X1.1 if the offense involved the intent to commit another felony.</td><td>Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2002.</td></tr><tr><td class="n">639</td><td>Amendment 639</td><td>Section 2B1.1(c) is amended by adding at the end the following:<br />Amendment 638 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003<br /><br />"(4) If the offense involved a cultural heritage resource, apply &#167;2B1.5 (Theft of,<br />Damage to, or Destruction of, Cultural Heritage Resources; Unlawful Sale,<br />Purchase, Exchange, Transportation, or Receipt of Cultural Heritage<br />Resources), if the resulting offense level is greater than that determined<br />above.".<br />The Commentary to &#167;2B1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 1 by<br />inserting after "For purposes of this guideline:" the following paragraph:<br />"‘Cultural heritage resource’ has the meaning given that term in Application Note<br />1 of the Commentary to &#167;2B1.5 (Theft of, Damage to, or Destruction of, Cultural<br />Heritage Resources; Unlawful Sale, Purchase, Exchange, Transportation, or Receipt<br />of Cultural Heritage Resources).".<br />The Commentary to &#167;2B1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in subdivision (F)<br />of Note 2 by adding at the end the following:<br />"(vii) Value of Cultural Heritage Resources.—In a case involving a cultural<br />heritage resource, loss attributable to that cultural heritage resource shall be<br />determined in accordance with the rules for determining the ‘value of the<br />cultural heritage resource’ set forth in Application Note 2 of the<br />Commentary to &#167;2B1.5.".<br />Chapter Two, Part B, Subpart 1 is amended by adding at the end the following new<br />guideline and accompanying commentary:<br />"&#167;2B1.5.

Pecuniary Gain and Commercial Purpose Enhancement Under Subsection<br />(b)(4).—<br />(A) ‘For Pecuniary Gain’.—For purposes of subsection (b)(4), ‘for<br />pecuniary gain’ means for receipt of, or in anticipation of receipt<br />of, anything of value, whether monetary or in goods or services.<br />Therefore, offenses committed for pecuniary gain include both<br />monetary and barter transactions, as well as activities designed to<br />increase gross revenue.<br />(B) Commercial Purpose.—The acquisition of cultural heritage<br />resources for display to the public, whether for a fee or donation<br />and whether by an individual or an organization, including a<br />governmental entity, a private non-profit organization, or a private<br />for-profit organization, shall be considered to involve a<br />‘commercial purpose’ for purposes of subsection (b)(4).<br />6. Pattern of Misconduct Enhancement Under Subsection (b)(5).—<br />November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II Amendment 638<br /><br />(A) Definition.—For purposes of subsection (b)(5), ‘pattern of<br />misconduct involving cultural heritage resources’ means two or<br />more separate instances of offense conduct involving a cultural<br />heritage resource that did not occur during the course of the offense<br />(i.e., that did not occur during the course of the instant offense of<br />conviction and all relevant conduct under &#167;1B1.3 (Relevant<br />Conduct)). Offense conduct involving a cultural heritage resource<br />may be considered for purposes of subsection (b)(5) regardless of<br />whether the defendant was convicted of that conduct.<br />(B) Computation of Criminal History Points.—A conviction taken into<br />account under subsection (b)(5) is not excluded from consideration<br />of whether that conviction receives criminal history points pursuant<br />to Chapter Four, Part A (Criminal History).<br />7. Dangerous Weapons Enhancement Under Subsection (b)(6).—For purposes<br />of subsection (b)(6), ‘brandished’ and ‘dangerous weapon’ have the<br />meaning given those terms in Application Note 1 of the Commentary to<br />&#167;1B1.1 (Application Instructions).<br />8. Multiple Counts.—For purposes of Chapter Three, Part D (Multiple<br />Counts), multiple counts involving cultural heritage offenses covered by<br />this guideline are grouped together under subsection (d) of &#167;3D1.2 (Groups<br />of Closely Related Counts). Multiple counts involving cultural heritage<br />offenses covered by this guideline and offenses covered by other guidelines<br />are not to be grouped under &#167;3D1.2(d).<br />9. Upward Departure Provision.—There may be cases in which the offense<br />level determined under this guideline substantially understates the<br />seriousness of the offense. In such cases, an upward departure may be<br />warranted. For example, an upward departure may be warranted if (A) in<br />addition to cultural heritage resources, the offense involved theft of, damage<br />to, or destruction of, items that are not cultural heritage resources (such as<br />an offense involving the theft from a national cemetery of lawnmowers and<br />other administrative property in addition to historic gravemarkers or other<br />cultural heritage resources); or (B) the offense involved a cultural heritage<br />resource that has profound significance to cultural identity (e.g., the Statue<br />of Liberty or the Liberty Bell).".<br />Section 2Q2.1 is amended by adding after subsection (b) the following:<br />"(c) Cross Reference<br />(1) If the offense involved a cultural heritage resource, apply &#167;2B1.5<br />(Theft of, Damage to, or Destruction of, Cultural Heritage<br />Resources; Unlawful Sale, Purchase, Exchange, Transportation, or<br />Receipt of Cultural Heritage Resources), if the resulting offense<br />level is greater than that determined above.".<br />The Commentary to &#167;2Q2.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by adding at the end<br />the following:<br />Amendment 638 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003<br /><br />"6.

This amendment reflects the Commission’s conclusion that the<br />existing sentencing guidelines for economic and property destruction crimes are inadequate<br />to punish in an appropriate and proportional way the variety of federal crimes involving the<br />theft of, damage to, destruction of, or illicit trafficking in, cultural heritage resources. The<br />Commission has determined that a separate guideline, which specifically recognizes both the<br />federal government’s long-standing obligation and role in preserving such resources, and the<br />harm caused to both the nation and its inhabitants when its history is degraded through the<br />destruction of cultural heritage resources, is needed.<br />Cultural heritage resources include national memorials, landmarks, parks, archaeological and<br />other historic and cultural resources, specifically designated by Congress and the President<br />for the preservation of the cultural heritage of this nation and its ancestors. The federal<br />government acts either as a trustee for the public generally, or as a fiduciary on behalf of<br />American Indians, Alaska Natives and Native Hawaiian Organizations, to protect these<br />cultural heritage resources. Because individuals, communities, and nations identify<br />themselves through intellectual, emotional, and spiritual connections to places and objects,<br />the effects of cultural heritage resource crimes transcend mere monetary considerations.<br />Accordingly, this new guideline takes into account the transcendent and irreplaceable value<br />of cultural heritage resources and punishes in a proportionate way the aggravating conduct<br />associated with cultural heritage resource crimes.<br />This guideline incorporates into the definition of "cultural heritage resource" a broad range<br />of existing federal statutory definitions for various historical, cultural, and archaeological<br />items. If a defendant is convicted of an offense that charges illegal conduct involving a<br />cultural heritage resource, this guideline will apply, irrespective of whether the conviction<br />is obtained under general property theft or damage statutes, such as laws concerning the theft<br />and destruction of government property, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 641, interstate sale or receipt of stolen<br />property, 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2314-15, and smuggling, 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 541 et seq., or under specific<br />cultural heritage statutes, such as the Archaeological Resources Protection Act of 1979, 16<br />U.S.C. &#167; 470ee (ARPA), the criminal provisions of the Native American Graves Protection<br />and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA) at 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1170, and 18 U.S.C. &#167; 668, which concerns<br />theft from museums. In addition, if a more general offense is charged that is referenced in<br />Appendix A to &#167;2B1.1 (Theft, Property Destruction, and Fraud), this guideline will apply<br />by cross reference if the offense conduct involves a cultural heritage resource and results in<br />a higher offense level.<br />Amendment 638 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003<br /><br />This new guideline has a base offense level of level 8, which is two levels higher than the<br />base offense level for general economic and property destruction crimes. The higher base<br />offense level represents the Commission’s determination that offenses involving cultural<br />heritage resources are more serious because they involve essentially irreplaceable resources<br />and cause intangible harm to society.<br />The new guideline also provides that the monetary value of the cultural heritage resource is<br />an important, although not the sole, factor in determining the appropriate punishment. The<br />Commission has elected not to use the concept of "loss," which is an integral part of the<br />theft, fraud, and property destruction guideline at &#167;2B1.1, because cultural heritage offenses<br />do not involve the same fungible and compensatory values embodied in "loss." Instead,<br />under this new guideline, value is to be based on commercial value, archaeological value,<br />and the cost of restoration and repair. These methods of valuation are derived from existing<br />federal law. See 16 U.S.C. &#167; 470ee(d); 43 C.F.R. &#167; 7.14.<br />The Commission has recognized that archaeological value shall be used in calculating the<br />value of archaeological resources but has provided flexibility for the sentencing court to<br />determine whether either commercial value or the cost of restoration and repair, or both,<br />should be added to archaeological value in determining the appropriate value of<br />archaeological resources. For all other types of cultural heritage resources covered by this<br />guideline, the Commission has provided flexibility for the sentencing court regarding<br />whether and when to use all or some of the methods of valuation, as appropriate, for<br />calculating the total value associated with the harm to the particular resource caused by the<br />defendant’s offense conduct. The value of the cultural heritage resource is then referenced<br />to the monetary table provided at &#167;2B1.1(b)(1) in order to determine appropriate and<br />proportionate offense levels in a manner consistent with the overall guidelines structure.<br />The new guideline provides five additional specific offense characteristics to provide<br />proportionate enhancements for aggravating conduct that may occur in connection with<br />cultural heritage resource offenses. In providing enhancements for these non-pecuniary<br />aggravating factors, the Commission seeks to ensure that the nonquantifiable harm caused<br />by the offense to affected cultural groups, and society as a whole, is adequately reflected in<br />the penalty structure.<br />The first two of these enhancements, at subsections (b)(2) and (b)(3), relate to whether the<br />offense involves a place or resource that Congress has designated for special protection. A<br />two level enhancement attaches if the offense involves a resource from one of eight locations<br />specifically designated by Congress for historic commemoration, resource preservation, or<br />public education. These are the national park system, national historic landmarks, national<br />monuments, national memorials, national marine sanctuaries, national cemeteries, sites<br />contained on the World Heritage List, and museums.<br />Consistent with the definition in 18 U.S.C. &#167; 668(a)(1), museums are defined broadly to<br />include all organized and permanent institutions, with an essentially educational or aesthetic<br />purpose, which exhibit tangible objects to the public on a regular schedule. Adoption of this<br />definition reflects the Commission’s recognition that cultural heritage resource crimes<br />affecting institutions dedicated to the preservation of resources and associated knowledge,<br />irrespective of the institution’s size, ownership, or funding, deprive the public and future<br />generations of the opportunity to learn and appreciate the richness of the nation’s heritage.<br />Similarly, this enhancement reflects the Commission’s assessment that damage to the other<br />November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II Amendment 638<br /><br />listed places degrades not only the resource itself but also the historical and cultural aspects<br />which the resource commemorates.<br />An additional two level enhancement attaches to offense conduct that involves any of a<br />number of specified resources, including human remains and other resources that have been<br />designated by Congress for special treatment and heightened protection under federal law.<br />Funerary objects, items of cultural patrimony, and sacred objects are included because they<br />are domestic cultural heritage resources protected under NAGPRA. See 25 U.S.C. &#167; 3001.<br />Cultural property, designated archaeological and ethnological material, and pre-Columbian<br />monumental and architectural sculpture and murals are included in the enhancement because<br />these are cultural heritage resources of foreign provenance for which Congress has chosen,<br />in the implementation of international treaties and bilateral agreements, to impose import<br />restrictions. See 19 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2092, 2606, and 2607.<br />This guideline also provides a two level enhancement at subsection (b)(4) if the offense was<br />committed for pecuniary gain or otherwise involved a commercial purpose. This increase<br />is based on a determination that offenders who are motivated by financial gain or other<br />commercial incentive are more culpable than offenders who are motivated solely by their<br />personal interest in possessing cultural heritage resources. Those motivated by financial gain<br />contribute to illicit trafficking and support dealers and brokers who earn a livelihood from<br />illegal activities. Mindful of INTERPOL’s findings, as reported by the Department of<br />Justice, that the annual dollar value of art and cultural property theft is exceeded only by<br />trafficking in illicit narcotics, money laundering, and arms trafficking, the Commission seeks<br />to ensure that the penalty structure adequately accounts for these increased harms.<br />This guideline also provides a two level enhancement at subsection (b)(5) if the offense<br />involves a pattern of misconduct, and provides a definition of "pattern of misconduct" that<br />is designed to interact with other requirements of the guidelines regarding relevant conduct<br />and criminal history. "Pattern of misconduct" is defined as "two or more separate instances<br />of offense conduct involving cultural heritage resources that did not occur during the course<br />of the instant offense (i.e., that did not occur during the offense of conviction and all relevant<br />conduct under &#167;1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct))". Accordingly, under this guideline, separate<br />instances of offense conduct need not result in a criminal conviction or legal adjudication in<br />order for this enhancement to apply. Separate instances of offense conduct involving<br />cultural heritage resources that are included in the defendant’s criminal history may also<br />form the factual basis for the application of this enhancement. The Commission considers<br />such increased punishment to be appropriate for offenders who repeatedly disregard cultural<br />heritage resource laws and regulations and the social values underlying them. These repeat<br />offenders cause serious harm, not only to the resources themselves, but to the nation and the<br />individuals who treasure them.<br />This guideline also provides at subsection (b)(6) a two level enhancement and a minimum<br />offense level of level 14 if a dangerous weapon, including a firearm, is brandished or its use<br />threatened. This enhancement reflects the increased culpability of offenders who pose a<br />threat to law enforcement officers and innocent passersby. Recognizing that there are<br />legitimate uses in remote expanses of tribal and federal land for certain tools and firearms<br />that may otherwise qualify as "dangerous weapons" under the guideline definitions, the<br />Commission has limited the scope of this enhancement by requiring that the dangerous<br />weapon or firearm be brandished or its use threatened, in order for increased punishment to<br />attach under this provision.<br />Amendment 638 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003<br /><br />In light of the increased potential for the symbols of our nation’s heritage and culture to be<br />targets of violent individuals, including terrorists, the Commission also has provided for<br />increased punishment through a cross reference to &#167;2K1.4 (Arson; Property Damage by Use<br />of Explosives), if the offense involved arson or property damage by the use of any explosive,<br />explosive material, or destructive devices, when the resulting offense level is greater under<br />&#167;2K1.4 than the offense level under this guideline.<br />This guideline also includes a special rule in the Commentary to address multiple counts of<br />cultural heritage resource offenses, as well as multiple counts of conviction involving<br />offenses under this and other guidelines. Consistent with the principles underlying the rules<br />for grouping multiple counts of conviction in &#167;3D1.2 (Groups of Closely Related Counts)<br />and the unique concerns sought to be addressed by this amendment, the new guideline<br />provides that multiple counts of cultural heritage resource offenses are to be grouped under<br />&#167;3D1.2(d). However, because the monetary harm is measured differently, a count of<br />conviction for an offense sentenced under &#167;2B1.5 may not be grouped under this provision<br />with a conviction for an offense sentenced under a different guideline.<br />This guideline also invites an upward departure if the determined offense level substantially<br />understates the seriousness of the cultural heritage resource offense. Two illustrations of<br />such situations are given. Finally, this amendment provides a cross reference within &#167;2B1.1.<br />Theft, fraud, and property destruction offenses which also involve cultural heritage resources<br />are cross referenced to the new guideline at &#167;2B1.5 if the resulting offense level under it<br />would be greater than under &#167;2B1.1. When a case involving a cultural heritage resource is<br />sentenced under &#167;2B1.1, loss attributable to that cultural heritage resource is to be<br />determined using the definition of "value of the cultural heritage resource" from &#167;2B1.5.<br />The Commission recognizes that the full implementation of this new guideline for the most<br />serious offenders often will be limited in its application because of the extremely low<br />statutory maxima of some of the potentially applicable statutes, such as the criminal<br />provisions of ARPA, NAGPRA, and 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1163 (covering the theft of tribal property).<br />Currently ARPA has either a one year or two year statutory maximum term of imprisonment<br />for the first offense, depending on whether the value exceeds $500, and NAGPRA has a<br />statutory maximum term of imprisonment of one year for the first offense irrespective of<br />value. These statutes all have five year statutory maximum terms of imprisonment for<br />second and subsequent offenses. Consequently, the statutory ceiling may limit the full range<br />of proportionate guideline sentencing, but the Commission has promulgated this new<br />guideline to cover the wide variety of potential offense conduct that can occur in connection<br />with cultural heritage resources. The Commission has recommended to Congress that the<br />statutory maximum terms of imprisonment for these offenses be raised appropriately.</td><td>Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2002.</td></tr><tr><td class="n">640</td><td>Amendment 640</td><td>The Commentary to &#167;2B4.1 captioned "Statutory Provisions" is amended by<br />striking "15 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 78dd-1, 78dd-2;".<br />The Commentary to &#167;2B4.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 1 by<br />inserting ", foreign governments, or public international organizations" after "local<br />government"; and by striking "governmental" and inserting "any such".<br />The Commentary to &#167;2B4.1 captioned "Background" is amended in the sixth paragraph by<br />striking "to violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, 15 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 78dd-1 and 78dd-2,<br />and".<br />November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II Amendment 639<br /><br />The Commentary to &#167;2C1.1 captioned "Statutory Provisions" is amended by inserting "15<br />U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 78dd-1, 78dd-2, 78dd-3;" before "18 U.S.C.".<br />The Commentary to &#167;2C1.1 captioned "Background" is amended by inserting after the ninth<br />paragraph the following:<br />" Section 2C1.1 also applies to offenses under 15 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 78dd-1, 78dd-<br />2, and 78dd-3. Such offenses generally involve a payment to a foreign public<br />official, candidate for public office, or agent or intermediary, with the intent to<br />influence an official act or decision of a foreign government or political party.<br />Typically, a case prosecuted under these provisions will involve an intent to<br />influence governmental action.".<br />Appendix A (Statutory Index) is amended in the line referenced to 15 U.S.C. &#167; 78dd-1 by<br />striking "2B4.1" and inserting "2C1.1";<br />in the line referenced to 15 U.S.C. &#167; 78dd-2 by striking "2B4.1" and inserting "2C1.1";<br />by inserting after the line referenced to 15 U.S.C. &#167; 78dd-2 following new line:<br />"15 U.S.C. &#167; 78dd-3 2C1.1";<br />and n the line referenced to 15 U.S.C. &#167; 78ff by striking "2B4.1" and inserting "2C1.1".</td><td>Reason for Amendment: This amendment changes the Statutory Index reference for<br />violations of section 30A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. &#167; 78dd-1) and<br />sections 104 and 104A of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 (15 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 78dd-2<br />and 78dd-3), from &#167;2B4.1 (Bribery in Procurement of Bank Loan and Other Commercial<br />Bribery) to &#167;2C1.1 (Offering, Giving, Soliciting, or Receiving a Bribe; Extortion Under<br />Color of Official Right).<br />This change is made because violations of 15 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 78dd-1 through 78dd-3 involve<br />public corruption of foreign officials and are, therefore, more akin to public corruption cases<br />than commercial bribery cases. Violations of the 15 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 78dd-1 through 78dd-3<br />typically involve payments to foreign officials for the purposes of influencing their official<br />acts or decisions, inducing them to do or omit an act in violation of their lawful duty,<br />inducing them to influence a foreign government, or securing any improper advantage.<br />These cases also involve payments to foreign political parties or officials, candidates for<br />foreign political office, or persons who act as conduits to these individuals. Most cases<br />prosecuted under 15 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 78dd-1 through 78dd-3 involve an intent to influence<br />governmental action.<br />Conversely, commercial bribery cases sentenced under &#167;2B4.1 often involve kickback and<br />gratuity payments made to bank officials or others who accept payments in return for<br />influence or some type of exchange from the other person. These cases typically do not<br />involve bribery of public or governmental officials and indeed, the Commentary to the<br />guideline makes this clear in Application Note 1.<br />This change also is made to comply with the mandate of a mulitlateral treaty entered into by<br />the United States, the Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in<br />Amendment 639 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003<br /><br />International Business Transactions. In part, this Convention requires signatory countries<br />to impose comparable sentences in both domestic and foreign bribery cases. Domestic<br />public bribery cases are referenced to &#167;2C1.1. To comply with the treaty, offenses<br />committed in violation of 15 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 78dd-1 through 78dd-3 are now similarly referenced<br />to &#167;2C1.1.</td><td>Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2002.</td></tr><tr><td class="n">641</td><td>Amendment 641</td><td>Section 2D1.1(a)(3) is amended by striking "below." and inserting ", except<br />that if the defendant receives an adjustment under &#167;3B1.2 (Mitigating Role), the base offense<br />level under this subsection shall be not more than level 30.".<br />The Commentary to &#167;2D1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 11 in the<br />"TYPICAL WEIGHT PER UNIT (DOSE, PILL, OR CAPSULE) TABLE" by striking<br />"MDA* 100 mg" and inserting the following:<br />"MDA 250 mg<br />MDMA 250 mg".<br />The Commentary to &#167;2D1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by adding at the end<br />the following:<br />"21. Applicability of Subsection (b)(6).—The applicability of subsection (b)(6)<br />shall be determined without regard to whether the defendant was convicted<br />of an offense that subjects the defendant to a mandatory minimum term of<br />imprisonment. Section &#167;5C1.2(b), which provides a minimum offense level<br />of level 17, is not pertinent to the determination of whether subsection<br />(b)(6) applies.".<br />Section 2D1.8(a)(2) is amended by striking "16" and inserting "26".<br />The Commentary to &#167;3B1.2 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by adding at the end<br />the following:<br />"6. Application of Role Adjustment in Certain Drug Cases.—In a case in which<br />the court applied &#167;2D1.1 and the defendant’s base offense level under that<br />guideline was reduced by operation of the maximum base offense level in<br />&#167;2D1.1(a)(3), the court also shall apply the appropriate adjustment under<br />this guideline.".</td><td>Reason for Amendment: This amendment responds to concerns that the guidelines<br />pertaining to drug offenses do not satisfactorily reflect the culpability of certain offenders.<br />The amendment also clarifies the operation of certain provisions in &#167;2D1.1 (Unlawful<br />Manufacturing, Importing, Exporting, or Trafficking (Including Possession with Intent to<br />Commit These Offenses); Attempt or Conspiracy).<br />First, the amendment increases the maximum base offense level under subsection (a)(2) of<br />&#167;2D1.8 (Renting or Managing a Drug Establishment; Attempt or Conspiracy) from level 16<br />to level 26. This part of the amendment responds to concerns that &#167;2D1.8 did not adequately<br />punish defendants convicted under 21 U.S.C. &#167; 856, pertaining to the establishment of<br /><br />manufacturing operations. That statute originally was enacted to target defendants who<br />maintain, manage, or control so-called "crack houses" and more recently has been applied<br />to defendants who facilitate drug use at commercial dance clubs, frequently called "raves".<br />Prior to this amendment, &#167;2D1.8(a)(2) provided a maximum base offense level of level 16<br />for defendants convicted under 21 U.S.C. &#167; 856 who had no participation in the underlying<br />controlled substance offense other than allowing use of their premises. The Commission<br />determined that the maximum base offense level of level 16 did not adequately reflect the<br />culpability of offenders who permit distribution of drugs in quantities that under &#167;2D1.1<br />result in offense levels higher than level 16. Such offenders knowingly and intentionally<br />facilitate and profit, at least indirectly, from the trafficking of illegal drugs, even though they<br />may not participate directly in the underlying controlled substance offense.<br />Second, the amendment modifies &#167;2D1.1(a)(3) to provide a maximum base offense level of<br />level 30 if the defendant receives an adjustment under &#167;3B1.2 (Mitigating Role). The<br />maximum base offense level somewhat limits the sentencing impact of drug quantity for<br />offenders who perform relatively low level trafficking functions, have little authority in the<br />drug trafficking organization, and have a lower degree of individual culpability (e.g.,<br />"mules" or "couriers" whose most serious trafficking function is transporting drugs and who<br />qualify for a mitigating role adjustment).<br />This part of the amendment responds to concerns that base offense levels derived from the<br />Drug Quantity Table in &#167;2D1.1 overstate the culpability of certain drug offenders who meet<br />the criteria for a mitigating role adjustment under &#167;3B1.2. The Commission determined that,<br />ordinarily, a maximum base offense level of level 30 adequately reflects the culpability of<br />a defendant who qualifies for a mitigating role adjustment. Other aggravating adjustments<br />in the trafficking guideline (e.g., the weapon enhancement at &#167;2D1.1(b)(1)), or other general,<br />aggravating adjustments in Chapter Three (Adjustments), may increase the offense level<br />above level 30. The maximum base offense level is expected to apply narrowly, affecting<br />approximately six percent of all drug trafficking offenders.<br />The amendment also adds an application note in &#167;3B1.2 that instructs the court to apply the<br />appropriate adjustment under that guideline in a case in which the maximum base offense<br />level in &#167;2D1.1(a)(3) operates to reduce the defendant’s base offense level under &#167;2D1.1.<br />Third, the amendment modifies the Typical Weight Per Unit (Dose, Pill, or Capsule) Table<br />in the commentary to &#167;2D1.1 to reflect more accurately the type and weight of ecstasy pills<br />typically trafficked and consumed. Specifically, the amendment adds a reference for<br />MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine) in the Typical Weight Per Unit Table and<br />lists the typical weight as 250 milligrams per pill. The amendment also revises the typical<br />weight for MDA to 250 milligrams of the mixture or substance containing the controlled<br />substance. Prior to this amendment, the Table listed the typical weight of MDA as 100<br />milligrams of the actual controlled substance.<br />Information provided by the Drug Enforcement Administration indicates that ecstasy usually<br />is trafficked and used as MDMA in pills weighing approximately 250 to 350 milligrams.<br />The absence of MDMA from the Typical Weight Per Unit (Dose, Pill, or Capsule) Table and<br />the listing for MDA of an estimate of the actual weight of the controlled substance created<br />Amendment 640 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003<br /><br />the potential for misapplying the MDA estimate in a case in which MDMA is involved,<br />which could result in underpunishment in some ecstasy cases. This part of the amendment<br />thus promotes uniform application of &#167;2D1.1 for offenses involving ecstasy by adding a<br />reference for MDMA and revising the estimated weight for MDA.<br />Fourth, the amendment addresses two application concerns regarding the two level reduction<br />under &#167;2D1.1(b)(6) for defendants who meet the criteria set forth in &#167;5C1.2 (Limitation on<br />Applicability of Statutory Minimum Sentences in Certain Cases). The amendment provides<br />an application note that clarifies that the two level reduction under &#167;2D1.1(b)(6) does not<br />depend on whether the defendant is convicted under a statute that carries a mandatory<br />minimum term of imprisonment. The application note also clarifies that &#167;5C1.2(b), which<br />provides a minimum offense level of level 17 for certain offenders, is not applicable to<br />&#167;2D1.1(b)(6).</td><td>Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2002.</td></tr><tr><td class="n">642</td><td>Amendment 642</td><td>Chapter Two is amended in the heading of Part G by striking<br />"PROSTITUTION" and inserting "COMMERCIAL SEX ACTS".<br />Chapter Two, Part G is amended in the heading of Subpart 1 by striking "PROSTITUTION"<br />and inserting "A COMMERCIAL SEX ACT".<br />Section 2G1.1 is amended in the heading by striking "Prostitution" and inserting "A<br />Commercial Sex Act".<br />Section 2G1.1(b)(1) is amended by striking "prostitution" and inserting "a commercial sex<br />act"; by inserting "fraud," after "force,"; and by striking "by threats or drugs or in any<br />manner".<br />Section 2G1.1(b)(4) is amended by striking "prostitution" each place it appears and inserting<br />"a commercial sex act".<br />Section 2G1.1(b)(5) is amended by striking "prostitution" and inserting "a commercial sex<br />act".<br />Section 2G1.1(c)(3) is amended by striking "prostitution" and inserting "a commercial sex<br />act".<br />Section 2G1.1(d)(1) is amended by striking "prostitution" and inserting "a commercial sex<br />act".<br />The Commentary to &#167;2G1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 1 by<br />inserting after "For purposes of this guideline—" the following paragraph:<br />"‘Commercial sex act’ has the meaning given that term in 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1591(c)(1).";<br />and by striking the last two paragraphs as follows:<br />"‘Promoting prostitution’ means persuading, inducing, enticing, or coercing a person<br />to engage in prostitution, or to travel to engage in, prostitution.<br /><br />‘Victim’ means a person transported, persuaded, induced, enticed, or coerced to<br />engage in, or travel for the purpose of engaging in, prostitution or prohibited sexual<br />conduct, whether or not the person consented to the prostitution or prohibited sexual<br />conduct.

Upward Departure Provision.—An upward departure may be warranted if<br />the offense involved more than 10 victims.".</td><td>Reason for Amendment: This amendment ensures that appropriately severe sentences for<br />sex trafficking crimes apply to commercial sex acts such as production of child pornography,<br />in addition to prostitution, and also targets offenders who use fraud to entrap victims. It<br />makes several changes to &#167;2G1.1 (Promoting Prostitution or Prohibited Sexual Conduct) to<br />address more adequately the portion of section 112(b) of the Victims of Trafficking and<br />Violence Protection Act of 2000 (the "Act"), Pub. L. 106–386, pertaining to the new offense<br />Amendment 641 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003<br /><br />at 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1591, which prohibits knowingly transporting or harboring any person, or<br />benefitting from such transporting or harboring, knowing either that force, fraud, or coercion<br />will be used to cause that person to engage in a commercial sex act, or that the person has<br />not attained the age of 18 years and will be forced to engage in a commercial sex act.<br />In response to the Act, the Commission in 2001 promulgated an amendment that referenced<br />18 U.S.C. &#167; 1591 to &#167;&#167;2G1.1 and 2G2.1 (Sexually Exploiting a Minor by Production of<br />Sexually Explicit Visual or Printed Material) and provided an encouraged upward departure<br />in those guidelines to address cases in which (1) the defendant was convicted under 18<br />U.S.C. &#167; 1591 and the offense involved a victim who had not attained the age of 14 years;<br />or (2) the offense involved more than 10 victims. (See Supplement to Appendix C,<br />Amendment 612, effective May 1, 2001, and Amendment 627, effective November 1, 2001).<br />This amendment makes three substantive changes to &#167;2G1.1. First, this amendment<br />broadens the conduct covered by the guideline beyond prostitution to encompass all<br />commercial sex acts, consistent with the scope of the Act. Second, this amendment expands<br />the "force or coercion" prong of &#167;2G1.1(b)(1) to also cover offenses involving fraud. This<br />change addresses the increased punishment provided by 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1591 for offenses<br />effected by force, fraud, or coercion. Third, the amendment deletes the portion of the<br />encouraged upward departure provision in &#167;2G1.1 pertaining to the age of the victim because<br />such conduct already is taken into account by that guideline.</td><td>Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2002.</td></tr><tr><td class="n">643</td><td>Amendment 643</td><td>Section 2K2.4 is amended by redesignating subsection (b) as subsection (d);<br />and by striking subsection (a) as follows:<br />"(a) If the defendant, whether or not convicted of another crime, was convicted<br />of violating:<br />(1) Section 844(h) of title 18, United States Code, the guideline<br />sentence is the term of imprisonment required by statute.<br />(2) Section 924(c) or section 929(a) of title 18, United States Code, the<br />guideline sentence is the minimum term of imprisonment required<br />by statute.",<br />and inserting the following:<br />"(a) If the defendant, whether or not convicted of another crime, was convicted<br />of violating section 844(h) of title 18, United States Code, the guideline<br />sentence is the term of imprisonment required by statute.

Application of Subsection (c).—<br />(A) In General.—Subsection (c) applies in any case in which the<br />defendant (i) was convicted of violating 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c) or<br />&#167; 929(a); and (ii) as a result of that conviction (alone or in addition<br />to another offense of conviction), is determined to be a career<br />offender under &#167;4B1.1(a).<br />(B) Subsection (c)(2).—To determine the greater guideline range under<br />subsection (c)(2), the court shall use the guideline range with the<br />highest minimum term of imprisonment.<br />(C) ‘Otherwise Applicable Guideline Range’.—For purposes of<br />subsection (c)(2)(A), ‘otherwise applicable guideline range’ for the<br />count(s) of conviction other than the 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c) or 18<br />U.S.C. &#167; 929(a) count(s) is determined as follows:<br />(i) If the count(s) of conviction other than the 18 U.S.C.<br />&#167; 924(c) or 18 U.S.C. &#167; 929(a) count(s) does not qualify<br />the defendant as a career offender, the otherwise applicable<br />guideline range for that count(s) is the guideline range<br />determined using: (I) the Chapter Two and Three offense<br />level for that count(s); and (II) the appropriate criminal<br />history category determined under &#167;&#167;4A1.1 (Criminal<br />History Category) and 4A1.2 (Definitions and Instructions<br />for Computing Criminal History).<br />November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II Amendment 642<br /><br />(ii) If the count(s) of conviction other than the 18 U.S.C.<br />&#167; 924(c) or 18 U.S.C. &#167; 929(a) count(s) qualifies the<br />defendant as a career offender, the otherwise applicable<br />guideline range for that count(s) is the guideline range<br />determined for that count(s) under &#167;4B1.1(a) and (b).<br />(D) Imposition of Consecutive Term of Imprisonment.—In a case<br />involving multiple counts, the sentence shall be imposed according<br />to the rules in subsection (e) of &#167;5G1.2 (Sentencing on Multiple<br />Counts of Conviction).<br />(E) Example.—The following example illustrates the application of<br />subsection (c)(2) in a multiple count situation:<br />The defendant is convicted of one count of violating 18 U.S.C.<br />&#167; 924(c) for possessing a firearm in furtherance of a drug<br />trafficking offense (5 year mandatory minimum), and one count of<br />violating 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(b)(1)(B) (5 year mandatory minimum, 40<br />year statutory maximum). Applying subsection (c)(2)(A), the court<br />determines that the drug count (without regard to the 18 U.S.C.<br />&#167; 924(c) count) qualifies the defendant as a career offender under<br />&#167;4B1.1(a). Under &#167;4B1.1(a), the otherwise applicable guideline<br />range for the drug count is 188-235 months (using offense level 34<br />(because the statutory maximum for the drug count is 40 years),<br />minus 3 levels for acceptance of responsibility, and criminal history<br />category VI). The court adds 60 months (the minimum required by<br />18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c)) to the minimum and the maximum of that<br />range, resulting in a guideline range of 248-295 months. Applying<br />subsection (c)(2)(B), the court then determines the career offender<br />guideline range from the table in subsection (c)(3) is 262-327<br />months. The range with the greatest minimum, 262-327 months,<br />is used to impose the sentence in accordance with &#167;5G1.2(e).".<br />The Commentary to &#167;4B1.1 captioned "Background" is amended by adding at the end the<br />following:<br />" Subsection (c) provides rules for determining the sentence for career<br />offenders who have been convicted of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c) or &#167; 929(a). The Career<br />Offender Table in subsection (c)(3) provides a sentence at or near the statutory<br />maximum for these offenders by using guideline ranges that correspond to criminal<br />history category VI and offense level 37 (assuming &#167;3E.1.1 (Acceptance of<br />Responsibility) does not apply), offense level 35 (assuming a 2-level reduction<br />under &#167;3E.1.1 applies), and offense level 34 (assuming a 3-level reduction under<br />&#167;3E1.1 applies).".<br />The Commentary to &#167;4B1.2 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 1 by striking<br />the following:<br />"A prior conviction for violating 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c) or &#167; 929(a) is a ‘prior felony<br />conviction’ for purposes of applying &#167;4B1.1 (Career Offender) if the prior offense<br />Amendment 642 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003<br /><br />of conviction established that the underlying offense was a ‘crime of violence’ or<br />‘controlled substance offense.’ (Note that if the defendant also was convicted of the<br />underlying offense, the two convictions will be treated as related cases under &#167;4A1.2<br />(Definitions and Instruction for Computing Criminal History)).",<br />and inserting the following:<br />"A violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c) or &#167; 929(a) is a ‘crime of violence’ or a<br />‘controlled substance offense’ if the offense of conviction established that the<br />underlying offense was a ‘crime of violence’ or a ‘controlled substance offense’.<br />(Note that in the case of a prior 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c) or &#167; 929(a) conviction, if the<br />defendant also was convicted of the underlying offense, the two prior convictions<br />will be treated as related cases under &#167;4A1.2 (Definitions and Instructions for<br />Computing Criminal History).)".<br />The Commentary to &#167;4B1.2 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by striking Note 2<br />as follows:<br />"2. The guideline sentence for a conviction under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c) or &#167;<br />929(a) is determined only by the statute and is imposed independently of<br />any other sentence.

See, e.g., 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c)<br />(requiring mandatory minimum terms of imprisonment, based on the conduct<br />involved, to run consecutively to any other term of imprisonment). The term of<br />years to be imposed consecutively is determined by the statute of conviction, and<br />is independent of a guideline sentence on any other count. See, e.g., Commentary<br />to &#167;&#167;2K2.4 (Use of Firearm, Armor-Piercing Ammunition, or Explosive During or<br />in Relation to Certain Crimes) and 3D1.1 (Procedure for Determining Offense Level<br />on Multiple Counts) regarding determination of the offense levels for related counts<br />when a conviction under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c) is involved. Note, however, that even<br />in the case of a consecutive term of imprisonment imposed under subsection (a), any<br />term of supervised release imposed is to run concurrently with any other term of<br />supervised release imposed. See 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3624(e). Subsection (a) also applies<br />in certain other instances in which an independently determined and consecutive<br />sentence is required. See, e.g., Application Note 3 of the Commentary to &#167;2J1.6<br />(Failure to Appear by Defendant), relating to failure to appear for service of<br />sentence.",<br />and inserting the following:<br />"2. Mandatory Minimum and Mandatory Consecutive Terms of Imprisonment<br />(Not Covered by Subsection (e)).—Subsection (a) applies if a statute (A)<br />specifies a term of imprisonment to be imposed; and (B) requires that such<br />term of imprisonment be imposed to run consecutively to any other term of<br />imprisonment. See, e.g., 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c) (requiring mandatory<br />minimum terms of imprisonment, based on the conduct involved, and also<br />requiring the sentence imposed to run consecutively to any other term of<br />imprisonment). Except for certain career offender situations in which<br />subsection (c) of &#167;4B1.1 (Career Offender) applies, the term of years to be<br />Amendment 642 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003<br /><br />imposed consecutively is the minimum required by the statute of conviction<br />and is independent of the guideline sentence on any other count. See, e.g.,<br />the Commentary to &#167;&#167;2K2.4 (Use of Firearm, Armor-Piercing Ammunition,<br />or Explosive During or in Relation to Certain Crimes) and 3D1.1<br />(Procedure for Determining Offense Level on Multiple Counts) regarding<br />the determination of the offense levels for related counts when a conviction<br />under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c) is involved. Note, however, that even in the case<br />of a consecutive term of imprisonment imposed under subsection (a), any<br />term of supervised release imposed is to run concurrently with any other<br />term of supervised release imposed. See 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3624(e). Subsection<br />(a) also applies in certain other instances in which an independently<br />determined and consecutive sentence is required. See, e.g., Application<br />Note 3 of the Commentary to &#167;2J1.6 (Failure to Appear by Defendant),<br />relating to failure to appear for service of sentence.<br />3. Career Offenders Covered under Subsection (e).—<br />(A) Imposing Sentence.—The sentence imposed for a conviction under<br />18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c) or &#167; 929(a) shall, under that statute, consist of<br />a minimum term of imprisonment imposed to run consecutively to<br />the sentence on any other count. Subsection (e) requires that the<br />total punishment determined under &#167;4B1.1(c) be apportioned<br />among all the counts of conviction. In most cases this can be<br />achieved by imposing the statutory minimum term of imprisonment<br />on the 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c) or &#167; 929(a) count, subtracting that<br />minimum term of imprisonment from the total punishment<br />determined under &#167;4B1.1(c), and then imposing the balance of the<br />total punishment on the other counts of conviction. In some cases<br />covered by subsection (e), a consecutive term of imprisonment<br />longer than the minimum required by 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c) or<br />&#167; 929(a) will be necessary in order both to achieve the total<br />punishment determined by the court and to comply with the<br />applicable statutory requirements.<br />(B) Examples.—The following examples illustrate the application of<br />subsection (e) in a multiple count situation:<br />(i) The defendant is convicted of one count of violating 18<br />U.S.C. &#167; 924(c) for possessing a firearm in furtherance of<br />a drug trafficking offense (5 year mandatory minimum),<br />and one count of violating 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(b)(1)(C) (20<br />year statutory maximum). Applying &#167;4B1.1(c), the court<br />determines that a sentence of 300 months is appropriate<br />(applicable guideline range of 262-327). The court then<br />imposes a sentence of 60 months on the 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c)<br />count, subtracts that 60 months from the total punishment<br />of 300 months and imposes the remainder of 240 months<br />on the 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841 count. As required by statute, the<br />sentence on the 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c) count is imposed to run<br />consecutively.<br />November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II Amendment 642<br /><br />(ii) The defendant is convicted of one count of 18 U.S.C.<br />&#167; 924(c) (5 year mandatory minimum), and one count of<br />violating 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(b)(1)(C) (20 year statutory<br />maximum). Applying &#167;4B1.1(c), the court determines that<br />a sentence of 327 months is appropriate (applicable<br />guideline range of 262-327). The court then imposes a<br />sentence of 240 months on the 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841 count and<br />a sentence of 87 months on the 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c) count<br />to run consecutively to the sentence on the 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841<br />count.<br />(iii) The defendant is convicted of two counts of 18 U.S.C.<br />&#167; 924(c) (5 year mandatory minimum on first count, 25<br />year mandatory minimum on second count) and one count<br />of violating 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2113(a) (20 year statutory<br />maximum). Applying &#167;4B1.1(c), the court determines that<br />a sentence of 400 months is appropriate (applicable<br />guideline range of 360-life). The court then imposes (I) a<br />sentence of 60 months on the first 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c)<br />count; (II) a sentence of 300 months on the second 18<br />U.S.C. &#167; 924(c) count; and (III) a sentence of 40 months<br />on the 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2113(a) count. The sentence on each<br />count is imposed to run consecutively to the other counts.".</td><td>Reason for Amendment: This amendment is intended to comply with the statutory<br />directive in 28 U.S.C. &#167; 994(h) by providing a guideline sentence at or near the statutory<br />maximum of life imprisonment for cases in which certain serious firearm offenses establish<br />the defendant as a career offender.<br />This amendment provides special rules in &#167;&#167;4B1.1 (Career Offender) and 5G1.2 (Sentencing<br />on Multiple Counts of Conviction) for determining and imposing a guideline sentence in a<br />case in which the defendant is convicted of an offense under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c) or &#167; 929(a)<br />and, as a result of that conviction, is determined to be a career offender under &#167;&#167;4B1.1 and<br />4B1.2 (Definitions of Terms Used in Section 4B1.1). The amendment supplements<br />Amendment 600 (effective November 1, 2000) in which the Commission first addressed<br />implementation of the statutory changes in penalties for 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 924(c) and 929(a)<br />offenses made by the Act to Throttle the Criminal Use of Guns, Pub. L. 105–386. At that<br />time, the Commission deferred addressing the more complicated issues of whether<br />convictions under 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 924(c) and 929(a) can qualify as instant offenses for<br />purposes of &#167;4B1.1, and if they do so qualify, how the sentence would be imposed.<br />Promulgation of this amendment reflects the Commission’s decision that the amendment,<br />while somewhat complex, is necessary to comply appropriately with 28 U.S.C. &#167; 994(h).<br />Operationally, this amendment achieves two goals. First, it permits 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c) or<br />&#167; 929(a) offenses, whether as the instant or prior offense of conviction, to qualify for career<br />offender purposes. Second, it ensures that, in a case in which such an instant offense<br />establishes the defendant as a career offender, the resulting guideline sentence is determined<br />under &#167;4B1.1 using a count of conviction that has a statutory maximum of life imprisonment.<br />The special rule necessarily is somewhat more complex because of the need to address<br />certain anomalies that infrequently would occur in the absence of such a rule, i.e., that a very<br />Amendment 642 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003<br /><br />serious offender could receive a lower sentence by virtue of the application of &#167;4B1.1 than<br />that which would otherwise be received by imposing the statutorily required minimum<br />sentence consecutively to the otherwise applicable guideline range.<br />This amendment does not change the current guideline rules precluding application of<br />guideline weapon enhancements in a case in which the defendant is convicted of a 18 U.S.C.<br />&#167; 924(c) or &#167; 929(a) offense. Furthermore, under this amendment, in a case in which the<br />defendant is convicted of a 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c) or &#167; 929(a) offense but that offense, together<br />with any prior convictions, does not establish the defendant as a career offender, the current<br />guideline rules for sentencing on that 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c) or &#167; 929(a) count continue to apply.<br />Accordingly, under &#167;2K2.4 (Use of Firearm, Armor-Piercing Ammunition, or Explosive<br />During or in Relation to Certain Crimes), the guideline sentence on that count is the statutory<br />minimum, and that sentence is imposed independently and consecutively to the sentence on<br />other counts. No adjustments in Chapter Three (Adjustments) or Chapter Four (Criminal<br />History and Criminal Livelihood) apply to adjust the guideline sentence for that 18 U.S.C.<br />&#167; 924(c) or &#167; 929(a) count.<br />However, under this amendment, in a case in which the 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c) or &#167; 929(a) count<br />establishes the defendant as a career offender, which the court will determine under &#167;&#167;4B1.1<br />and 4B1.2, new special rules and instructions will apply. To determine the guideline<br />sentence on the 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c) or &#167; 929(a) count, the court moves directly from &#167;2K2.4<br />to &#167;4B1.1 and applies the new special instruction therein. New special instructions for<br />imposing sentence in these cases also have been added to &#167;5G1.2.</td><td>Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2002.</td></tr><tr><td class="n">644</td><td>Amendment 644</td><td>Chapter Three, Part A, is amended by striking &#167;3A1.2 as follows:<br />"&#167;3A1.2.

While subsection (b) may apply in connection<br />with a variety of offenses that are not by nature targeted against<br />official victims, its applicability is limited to assaultive conduct<br />against such official victims that is sufficiently serious to create at<br />least a ‘substantial risk of serious bodily injury’.<br />(B) Definitions.—For purposes of subsection (b):<br />‘Custody and control’ includes ‘non-secure custody’, i.e., custody<br />with no significant physical restraint. For example, a defendant is<br />in the custody and control of a prison or other correctional facility<br />if the defendant (i) is on a work detail outside the security<br />perimeter of the prison or correctional facility; (ii) is physically<br />away from the prison or correctional facility while on a pass or<br />furlough; or (iii) is in custody at a community corrections center,<br />community treatment center, ‘halfway house’, or similar facility.<br />The defendant also shall be deemed to be in the custody and control<br />of a prison or other correctional facility while the defendant is in<br />the status of having escaped from that prison or correctional<br />facility.<br />‘Prison official’ means any individual (including a director, officer,<br />employee, independent contractor, or volunteer, but not including<br />an inmate) authorized to act on behalf of a prison or correctional<br />facility. For example, this enhancement would be applicable to any<br />of the following: (i) an individual employed by a prison as a<br />corrections officer; (ii) an individual employed by a prison as a<br />work detail supervisor; and (iii) a nurse who, under contract,<br />provides medical services to prisoners in a prison health facility.<br />‘Substantial risk of serious bodily injury’ includes any more serious<br />November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II Amendment 643<br /><br />injury that was risked, as well as actual serious bodily injury (or<br />more serious injury) if it occurs.".<br />The Commentary to &#167;3A1.2 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by striking Note 5,<br />as redesignated by this amendment, as follows:<br />"5. The phrase ‘substantial risk of serious bodily injury’ in subdivision (b) is<br />a threshold level of harm that includes any more serious injury that was<br />risked, as well as actual serious bodily injury (or more serious harm) if it<br />occurs.",<br />and inserting the following:<br />"5. Upward Departure Provision.—Certain high level officials, e.g., the<br />President and Vice President, although covered by this section, do not<br />represent the heartland of the conduct covered. An upward departure to<br />reflect the potential disruption of the governmental function in such cases<br />typically would be warranted.".</td><td>Reason for Amendment: This amendment expands the category of persons who may be<br />considered official victims for purposes of triggering the two level enhancement at &#167;3A1.2<br />(Official Victim). This amendment is promulgated in response to concerns expressed by the<br />Bureau of Prisons regarding United States v. Walker, 202 F.3d 181 (3d Cir. 2000). Walker<br />held that an individual employed by the prison to supervise food service functions who was<br />attacked by an inmate subordinate was not a "corrections officer" within the scope of<br />&#167;3A1.2. The Bureau of Prisons advised the Commission that the Bureau uses a variety of<br />employees, contractors, and volunteers to supervise inmates and that maintenance of a safe<br />and stable institutional environment is fostered by knowledge on the part of inmates that<br />anyone in prison employment or performing an authorized role within a prison is afforded<br />the protection of &#167;3A1.2. In accord with the Bureau’s recommendation, the amendment<br />includes a broad definition of "prison official" to include prison employees, as well as<br />independent contractors and volunteers on prison premises with official authorization, but<br />does not include inmates.</td><td>Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2002.</td></tr><tr><td class="n">645</td><td>Amendment 645</td><td>Section 5B1.3(a) is amended by striking the period at the end of subdivision<br />(9) and inserting a semicolon; and by adding after subdivision (9) the following:<br />"(10) the defendant shall submit to the collection of a DNA sample from the<br />defendant at the direction of the United States Probation Office if the<br />collection of such a sample is authorized pursuant to section 3 of the DNA<br />Analysis Backlog Elimination Act of 2000 (42 U.S.C. &#167; 14135a).".<br />Section 5D1.3(a) is amended by striking the period at the end of subdivision (7) and<br />inserting a semicolon; and by adding after subdivision (7) the following:<br />"(8) the defendant shall submit to the collection of a DNA sample from the<br />defendant at the direction of the United States Probation Office if the<br />collection of such a sample is authorized pursuant to section 3 of the DNA<br />Amendment 643 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003<br /><br />Analysis Backlog Elimination Act of 2000 (42 U.S.C. &#167; 14135a).".</td><td>Reason for Amendment: This amendment adds a mandatory condition to &#167;&#167;5B1.3<br />(Conditions of Probation) and 5D1.3 (Conditions of Supervised Release) that the defendant<br />provide a DNA sample if the defendant is required to do so by the DNA Analysis Backlog<br />Elimination Act of 2000, Pub. L. 106–546. Pursuant to section 3 of the Act, a defendant is<br />required to provide a DNA sample if the defendant is convicted of certain offenses (e.g.,<br />murder, kidnapping).</td><td>Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2002.</td></tr><tr><td class="n">646</td><td>Amendment 646</td><td>The Commentary to &#167;5G1.3 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by<br />adding at the end the following:<br />"7. Downward Departure Provision.—In the case of a discharged term of<br />imprisonment, a downward departure is not prohibited if subsection (b)<br />would have applied to that term of imprisonment had the term been<br />undischarged. Any such departure should be fashioned to achieve a<br />reasonable punishment for the instant offense.".</td><td>Reason for Amendment: This amendment modifies &#167;5G1.3 (Imposition of a Sentence on<br />a Defendant Subject to an Undischarged Term of Imprisonment) to include certain<br />discharged terms of imprisonment. Specifically, the amendment adds commentary to &#167;5G1.3<br />to provide that courts are not prohibited from considering a downward departure in a case<br />in which &#167;5G1.3(b) would have applied if the term of imprisonment had not been<br />discharged. In the case of undischarged terms of imprisonment, &#167;5G1.3(b) currently<br />authorizes a court to adjust the sentence if the conduct underlying the undischarged term of<br />imprisonment has been fully taken into account in the offense level for the instant federal<br />offense. See Application Note 2 of the Commentary to &#167;5G1.3. By adding the new<br />commentary, the Commission makes clear that discharged terms of imprisonment may merit<br />a downward departure for a similar reason. The amendment thereby addresses a circuit<br />conflict regarding the propriety of a downward departure under such circumstances.<br />Compare, e.g., United States v. O’Hagan, 139 F.3d 641, 657 (8th Cir. 1998) (holding that<br />a sentencing court could downwardly depart to adjust for time served on a discharged state<br />sentence); United States v. Blackwell, 49 F.3d 1232, 1241-42 (7th Cir. 1995) (same) with<br />United States v. McHan, 101 F.3d 1027, 1040 (4th Cir. 1996) (holding that downward<br />departure to allow an adjustment for a discharged term was based on an error of law and<br />therefore an abuse of discretion), cert. denied, 520 U.S. 1281 (1997).</td><td>Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2002.</td></tr><tr><td class="n">647</td><td>Amendment 647</td><td>The Commentary to &#167;2B1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in<br />subdivision (A) of Note 7 by striking "18 U.S.C. 1028(d)(3)" and inserting "18 U.S.C.<br />1028(d)(4)".<br />Section 2B4.1 is amended by striking subsection (b)(2) as follows:<br />"(2) If the offense --<br />(A) substantially jeopardized the safety and soundness of a<br />November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II Amendment 646<br /><br />financial institution; or<br />(B) affected a financial institution and the defendant derived<br />more than $1,000,000 in gross receipts from the offense,<br />increase by 4 levels.

It<br />would appear that intermittent confinement now is authorized as a condition of<br />supervised release and that community confinement now is not authorized as a<br />condition of supervised release.<br />However, there is some question as to whether Congress intended this result.<br />Although the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 redesignated<br />the remaining paragraphs of section 3563(b), it failed to make the corresponding<br />redesignations in 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3583(d), regarding discretionary conditions of<br />supervised release.".<br />Appendix A (Statutory Index) is amended by inserting after the line referenced to 16 U.S.C.<br />&#167; 1417(a)(5),(6),(b)(2) the following new line:<br />"16 U.S.C. &#167; 1437(c) 2A2.4";<br />by inserting after the line referenced to 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2244 the following new line:<br />"18 U.S.C. &#167; 2245 2A1.1";<br />in the line referenced to 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(d)(1),(2) by striking "(d)" and inserting "(c)";<br />in the line referenced to 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(d)(3) by striking "(d)" and inserting "(c)";<br />in the line referenced to 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(e) by striking "(e)" and inserting "(d)";<br />in the line referenced to 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(g)(1) by striking "(g)" and inserting "(f)";<br />November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II Amendment 646<br /><br />by inserting after the line referenced to 42 U.S.C. &#167; 5157(a) the following new line:<br />"42 U.S.C. &#167; 5409 2N2.1"; and<br />by inserting after the line referenced to 42 U.S.C. &#167; 9603(d) the following new line:<br />"42 U.S.C. &#167; 14905 2B1.1".</td><td>Reason for Amendment: This thirteen-part amendment makes several technical and<br />conforming changes to various guideline provisions.<br />First, the amendment conforms the language concerning offenses that "affected a financial<br />institution" in subsection (b)(2) of &#167;2B4.1 (Bribery in Procurement of Bank Loan and Other<br />Commercial Bribery) with subsection (b)(12) of &#167;2B1.1 (Theft, Property Destruction, and<br />Fraud).<br />Second, the amendment: (1) updates statutory references in &#167;&#167;2D1.9 (Placing or Maintaining<br />Dangerous Devices on Federal Property to Protect the Unlawful Production of Controlled<br />Substances; Attempt or Conspiracy), 2D1.11 (Unlawfully Distributing, Importing, Exporting<br />or Possessing a Listed Chemical; Attempt or Conspiracy), and 2D1.13 (Structuring Chemical<br />Transactions or Creating a Chemical Mixture to Evade Reporting or Recordkeeping<br />Requirements; Presenting False or Fraudulent Identification to Obtain a Listed Chemical;<br />Attempt or Conspiracy) and Appendix A (Statutory Index) to correspond to statutory<br />redesignations made by the Hillory J. Farias and Samantha Reid Date-Rape Drug Prohibition<br />Act of 2000, Pub. L. 106–172; and (2) corrects references to the new chemical quantity<br />tables in &#167;2D1.11.<br />Third, the amendment corrects a change to the commentary of &#167;2N2.1 (Violations of Statutes<br />and Regulations Dealing With Any Food, Drug, Biological Product, Device, Cosmetic, or<br />Agricultural Product) that was inadvertently made as part of the conforming package of<br />amendments in the Economic Crime Package (see Supplement to Appendix C, Amendment<br />617, effective November 1, 2001).<br />Fourth, the amendment inserts a missing "or" in subsection (a)(3) of &#167;2Q1.6 (Hazardous or<br />Injurious Devices on Federal Lands).<br />Fifth, the amendment corrects a grammatical error in Note (D) of subsection (c)(1) of &#167;2T1.1<br />(Tax Evasion; Willful Failure to File Return, Supply Information, or Pay Tax; Fraudulent<br />or False Returns, Statements, or Other Documents) by replacing "subdivisions (A), (B), or<br />(C)" with "subdivision (A), (B), or (C)".<br />Sixth, the amendment repromulgates amendment 568, effective November 1, 1997, to correct<br />an inadvertent omission of a conforming amendment to &#167;4B1.4 (Armed Career Criminal)<br />from amendment 568.<br />Seventh, the amendment conforms &#167;&#167;5C1.1 (Imposition of a Term of Imprisonment), 5D1.3<br />(Conditions of Supervised Release), and 5F1.1 (Community Confinement), Part A of<br />Chapter Seven (Violations of Probation and Supervised Release), and &#167;7B1.3 (Revocation<br />of Probation or Supervised Release) to current statutory provisions at 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 3563 and<br />3583 and provides an explanatory note concerning the status of intermittent confinement and<br />Amendment 646 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003<br /><br />community confinement as conditions of supervised release.<br />Eighth, the amendment clarifies that language in subsection (c) of &#167;5D1.2 (Term of<br />Supervised Release) is a policy statement (because it recommends the maximum term of<br />supervised release for sex offenders rather than requires it).<br />Ninth, the amendment deletes from Application Note 5 of &#167;5E1.2 (Fines for Individual<br />Defendants) an incorrect statement concerning the Clean Air Act.<br />Tenth, the amendment updates statutory references in &#167;5F1.5 (Occupational Restrictions).<br />Eleventh, the amendment inserts a missing "Background" heading in &#167;5F1.7 (Shock<br />Incarceration Program).<br />Twelfth, the amendment references 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2245, which covers sexual abuse resulting<br />in death, to &#167;2A1.1 (First Degree Murder) in Appendix A (Statutory Index) because the<br />offense requires the death of a person.<br />Finally, the amendment responds to new legislation as follows:<br />(1) It updates, in &#167;2B1.1, a statutory reference in the definition of "means of<br />identification" to correspond to a redesignation made by the Internet False<br />Identification Prevention Act of 2000, Pub. L. 106–578.<br />(2) It provides guideline references in Appendix A for two new offenses<br />created by the American Homeownership and Economic Opportunity Act<br />of 2000, Pub. L. 106–569 ("the Act"). First, section 608 of the Act amends<br />section 610(a) of the National Manufactured Housing Construction and<br />Safety Standards Act of 1974 (42 U.S.C. &#167; 5409(a)) which makes it<br />unlawful to fail to comply with a state’s installation program. Under<br />section 611 of the National Housing Construction and Safety Standard Act<br />of 1974 (42 U.S.C.&#167; 5410(b)), knowing and willful violations of subsection<br />610(a) are punishable by imprisonment of not more than one year. The<br />amendment references this provision to &#167;2N2.1. Second, section 708 of the<br />Act created section 543 in Title V of the Housing Act of 1949 (42 U.S.C.<br />&#167; 1490(s)(a)), which provides a criminal penalty of not more than five<br />years’ imprisonment for equity skimming. The amendment references this<br />provision to &#167;2B1.1.<br />(3) It references offenses under section 307(c) of the National Marine<br />Sanctuaries Act (16 U.S.C. &#167; 1437(c)) to &#167;2A2.4 (Obstructing or Impeding<br />Officers). Section 307(c) of the National Marine Sanctuaries Act, as<br />amended by the National Marine Sanctuaries Amendments Act of 2000,<br />Pub. L. 106–513, prohibits the interference with the enforcement of<br />conservation activities authorized in title 16, United States Code, including<br />refusing to permit any officer authorized to enforce such title to board a<br />vessel for purposes of conducting a search or inspection in connection with<br />the enforcement of such title.</td><td>Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2002.</td></tr><tr><td class="n">648</td><td>Amendment 648</td><td>Section 2B1.1(b)(1) is amended by striking the period;

L.<br />107–204 (the "Act"), by making several modifications to &#167;2B1.1 (Larceny, Embezzlement,<br />and Other Forms of Theft; Offenses Involving Stolen Property; Property Damage or<br />Destruction; Fraud and Deceit; Forgery; Offenses Involving Altered or Counterfeit<br />Instruments Other than Counterfeit Bearer Obligations of the United States) and &#167;2J1.2<br />(Obstruction of Justice). The directives pertain to serious fraud and related offenses and<br />obstruction of justice offenses. The directives require the Commission under emergency<br />amendment authority to promulgate amendments addressing, among other things, officers<br />and directors of publicly traded companies who commit fraud and related offenses, fraud<br />offenses that endanger the solvency or financial security of a substantial number of victims,<br />fraud offenses that involve significantly greater than 50 victims, and obstruction of justice<br />November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II Amendment 647<br /><br />offenses that involve the destruction of evidence.<br />First, the amendment addresses the directive contained in section 1104(b)(5) of the Act to<br />"ensure that the guideline offense levels and enhancements under United States Sentencing<br />Guideline &#167;2B1.1 (as in effect on the date of enactment of this Act) are sufficient for a fraud<br />offense when the number of victims adversely involved is significantly greater than 50." The<br />amendment implements this directive by expanding the existing enhancement at<br />&#167;2B1.1(b)(2) based on the number of victims involved in the offense. Prior to the<br />amendment, subsection (b)(2) provided a two level enhancement if the offense involved<br />more than 10, but less than 50, victims (or was committed through mass-marketing), and a<br />four level enhancement if the offense involved 50 or more victims. The amendment provides<br />an additional two level increase, for a total of six levels, if the offense involved 250 or more<br />victims. The Commission determined that an enhancement of this magnitude appropriately<br />responds to the pertinent directive and reflects the extensive nature of, and the large scale<br />victimization caused by, such offenses.<br />Second, the amendment addresses directives contained in sections 805 and 1104 of the Act<br />pertaining to securities and accounting fraud offenses and fraud offenses that endanger the<br />solvency or financial security of a substantial number of victims. Specifically, section<br />805(a)(4) directs the Commission to ensure that "a specific offense characteristic enhancing<br />sentencing is provided under United States Sentencing Guideline 2B1.1 (as in effect on the<br />date of enactment of this Act) for a fraud offense that endangers the solvency or financial<br />security of a substantial number of victims." In addition, section 1104(b)(1) directs the<br />Commission to "ensure that the sentencing guidelines and policy statements reflect the<br />serious nature of securities, pension, and accounting fraud and the need for aggressive and<br />appropriate law enforcement action to prevent such offenses." The amendment implements<br />these directives by expanding the scope of the existing enhancement at &#167;2B1.1(b)(12)(B).<br />Prior to the amendment, &#167;2B1.1(b)(12)(B) provided a four level enhancement and a<br />minimum offense level of 24 if the offense substantially jeopardized the safety and<br />soundness of a financial institution. The amendment expands the scope of this enhancement<br />by providing two additional prongs. The first prong applies to offenses that substantially<br />endanger the solvency or financial security of an organization that, at any time during the<br />offense, was a publicly traded company or had 1,000 or more employees. The addition of<br />this prong reflects the Commission’s determination that such an offense undermines the<br />public’s confidence in the securities and investment market much in the same manner as an<br />offense that jeopardizes the safety and soundness of a financial institution undermines the<br />public’s confidence in the banking system. This prong also reflects the likelihood that an<br />offense that endangers the solvency or financial security of an employer of this size will<br />similarly affect a substantial number of individual victims, without requiring the court to<br />determine whether the solvency or financial security of each individual victim was<br />substantially endangered.<br />A corresponding application note for &#167;2B1.1(b)(12)(B) sets forth a non-exhaustive list of<br />factors that the court shall consider in determining whether the offense endangered the<br />solvency or financial security of a publicly traded company or an organization with 1,000<br />or more employees. The list of factors includes references to insolvency, filing for<br />bankruptcy, substantially reducing the value of the company’s stock, and substantially<br />reducing the company’s workforce among the list of factors that the court shall consider<br />when applying the new enhancement, and other factors not enumerated in the application<br />Amendment 647 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003<br /><br />note could be considered by the court as appropriate.<br />The amendment also modifies the application note of the previously existing prong of<br />&#167;2B1.1(b)(12)(B), the financial institutions enhancement, to be consistent structurally with<br />the new prongs of the enhancement. Prior to the amendment, the presence of any one of the<br />factors enumerated in the application note would trigger the financial institutions<br />enhancement under &#167;2B1.1(b)(12)(B). Under the amendment, the application note to the<br />financial institutions enhancement sets forth a non-exhaustive list of factors that the court<br />shall consider in determining whether the offense substantially jeopardized the safety and<br />soundness of a financial institution. The list of factors that the court shall consider when<br />applying this enhancement includes references to insolvency, substantially reducing benefits<br />to pensioners and insureds, and an inability to refund fully any deposit, payment, or<br />investment on demand.<br />The second prong added to &#167;2B1.1(b)(12)(B) by the amendment applies to offenses that<br />substantially endangered the solvency or financial security of 100 or more victims,<br />regardless of whether a publicly traded company or other organization was affected by the<br />offense. The Commission concluded that the specificity of the directive in section 805(a)(4)<br />required an enhancement focused specifically on conduct that endangers the financial<br />security of individual victims. Thus, use of this prong of the enhancement will be<br />appropriate in cases in which there is sufficient evidence for the court to determine that the<br />amount of loss suffered by individual victims of the offense substantially endangered the<br />solvency or financial security of those victims. The Commission also determined that the<br />enhancement provided in &#167;2B1.1(b)(12)(B) shall apply cumulatively with the enhancement<br />at &#167;2B1.1(b)(2), which is based solely on the number of victims involved in the offense, to<br />reflect the particularly acute harm suffered by victims of offenses for which the new prongs<br />of subsection (b)(12)(B) apply.<br />Third, the amendment addresses the directive contained at section 1104(a)(2) of the Act to<br />"consider the promulgation of new sentencing guidelines or amendments to existing<br />sentencing guidelines to provide an enhancement for officers or directors of publicly traded<br />corporations who commit fraud and related offenses." The amendment implements this<br />directive by providing a new, four level enhancement at &#167;2B1.1(b)(13) that applies if the<br />offense involved a violation of securities law and, at the time of the offense, the defendant<br />was an officer or director of a publicly traded company. The Commission concluded that<br />a four level enhancement appropriately reflects that an officer or director of a publicly traded<br />company who commits such an offense violates certain heightened fiduciary duties imposed<br />by securities law upon such individuals. Accordingly, the court is not required to determine<br />specifically whether the defendant abused a position of trust in order for the enhancement<br />to apply, and a corresponding application note provides that, in cases in which the new, four<br />level enhancement applies, the existing two level enhancement for abuse of position of trust<br />at &#167;3B1.3 (Abuse of Position of Trust or Use of Special Skill) shall not apply.<br />The corresponding application note also expressly provides that the enhancement would<br />apply regardless of whether the defendant was convicted under a specific securities fraud<br />statute (e.g., 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1348, a new offense created by the Act specifically prohibiting<br />securities fraud) or under a general fraud statute (e.g., 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1341, prohibiting mail<br />fraud), provided that the offense involved a violation of "securities law" as defined in the<br />application note.<br />November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II Amendment 647<br /><br />Fourth, the amendment expands the loss table at &#167;2B1.1(b)(1) to punish adequately offenses<br />that cause catastrophic losses of magnitudes previously unforeseen, such as the serious<br />corporate scandals that gave rise to several portions of the Act. Prior to the amendment, the<br />loss table at &#167;2B1.1(b)(1) provided sentencing enhancements in two level increments up to<br />a maximum of 26 levels for offenses in which the loss exceeded $100,000,000. The<br />amendment adds two additional loss amount categories to the table; an increase of 28 levels<br />for offenses in which the loss exceeded $200,000,000, and an increase of 30 levels for<br />offenses in which the loss exceeded $400,000,000. These additions to the loss table address<br />congressional concern regarding particularly extensive and serious fraud offenses, and more<br />fully effectuate increases in statutory maximum penalties provided by the Act (e.g., the<br />increase in the statutory maximum penalties for wire fraud and mail fraud offenses from five<br />to 20 years set forth in section 903 of the Act). The amendment also modifies the tax table<br />in &#167;2T4.1 in a similar manner to maintain the longstanding proportional relationship between<br />the loss table in &#167;2B1.1 and the tax table.<br />The amendment also adds a new factor to the general, enumerated factors that the court may<br />consider in determining the amount of loss under &#167;2B1.1(b)(1). Specifically, the amendment<br />adds the reduction in the value of equity securities or other corporate assets that resulted<br />from the offense to the list of general factors set forth in Application Note 2(C) of &#167;2B1.1.<br />This factor was added to provide courts additional guidance in determining loss in certain<br />cases, particularly in complex white collar cases.<br />Fifth, the amendment modifies &#167;2J1.2 to address the directives pertaining to obstruction of<br />justice offenses contained in sections 805 and 1104 of the Act. Specifically, section 805(a)<br />of the Act directs the Commission to ensure that the base offense level and existing<br />enhancements in &#167;2J1.2 are sufficient to deter and punish obstruction of justice offenses<br />generally, and specifically are adequate in cases involving the destruction, alteration, or<br />fabrication of a large amount of evidence, a large number of participants, the selection of<br />evidence that is particularly probative or essential to the investigation, more than minimal<br />planning, or abuse of a special skill or a position of trust. Section 1104(b) of the Act further<br />directs the Commission to ensure that the "guideline offense levels and enhancements for an<br />obstruction of justice offense are adequate in cases where documents or other physical<br />evidence are actually destroyed or fabricated."<br />The amendment implements these directives by making two modifications to &#167;2J1.2. First,<br />the amendment increases the base offense level in &#167;2J1.2 from level 12 to level 14. Second,<br />the amendment adds a new two level enhancement to &#167;2J1.2. This enhancement applies if<br />the offense (i) involved the destruction, alteration, or fabrication of a substantial number of<br />records, documents or tangible objects; (ii) involved the selection of any essential or<br />especially probative record, document, or tangible object to destroy or alter; or (iii) was<br />otherwise extensive in scope, planning, or preparation. The Commission determined that<br />existing adjustments in Chapter Three for aggravating role, &#167;3B1.1, and abuse of position<br />of trust or use of special skill, &#167;3B1.3, adequately account for those particular factors<br />described in section 805(a) of the Act.<br />Sixth, the amendment addresses new offenses created by the Act. Section 1520 of title 18,<br />United States Code, relating to destruction of corporate audit records, is referenced to &#167;2E5.3<br />(False Statements and Concealment of Facts in Relation to Documents Required by the<br />Employee Retirement Income Security Act; Failure to Maintain and Falsification of Records<br />Required by the Labor Management Reporting and Disclosure Act; Destruction and Failure<br />Amendment 648 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003<br /><br />to Maintain Corporate Audit Records). Section 1520 provides a statutory maximum penalty<br />of ten years’ imprisonment for knowing and willful violations of document maintenance<br />requirements as set forth in that section or in rules or regulations to be promulgated by the<br />Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to that section. The amendment also expands<br />the existing cross reference in &#167;2E5.3(a)(2) specifically to cover fraud and obstruction of<br />justice offenses. Accordingly, if a defendant who is convicted under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1520<br />committed the offense in order to obstruct justice, the amendment to the cross reference<br />provision requires the court to apply &#167;2J1.2 instead of &#167;2E5.3. Other new offenses are listed<br />in Appendix A (Statutory Index), as well as in the statutory provisions of the relevant<br />guidelines.</td><td>Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is January 25, 2003.</td></tr><tr><td class="n">649</td><td>Amendment 649</td><td>Chapter Two, Part C is amended in the heading by adding at the end "AND<br />VIOLATIONS OF FEDERAL ELECTION CAMPAIGN LAWS".<br />Chapter Two, Part C is amended by striking the introductory commentary as follows:<br />" Introductory Commentary<br />The Commission believes that pre-guidelines sentencing practice did not<br />adequately reflect the seriousness of public corruption offenses.

Application of Subsection (b)(3)(B).—Subsection (b)(3)(B) provides an<br />enhancement for a defendant who commits the offense for the purpose of achieving<br />a specific, identifiable non-monetary Federal benefit that does not rise to the level<br />of a bribe or a gratuity. Subsection (b)(3)(B) is not intended to apply to offenses<br />under this guideline in which the defendant’s only motivation for commission of the<br />offense is generally to achieve increased visibility with, or heightened access to,<br />public officials. Rather, subsection (b)(3)(B) is intended to apply to defendants who<br />commit the offense to obtain a specific, identifiable non-monetary Federal benefit,<br />such as a Presidential pardon or information proprietary to the government.<br />3. Application of Subsection (b)(4).—Subsection (b)(4) shall apply if the defendant<br />engaged in any combination of 30 or more illegal transactions during the course of<br />the offense, whether or not the illegal transactions resulted in a conviction for such<br />conduct.<br />4.

The existence of a conciliation agreement between the defendant and<br />Federal Election Commission, and the extent of compliance with that conciliation<br />agreement, may be appropriate factors in determining at what point within the<br />November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II Amendment 648<br /><br />applicable fine guideline range to sentence the defendant, unless the defendant<br />began negotiations toward a conciliation agreement after becoming aware of a<br />criminal investigation".<br />Appendix A (Statutory Index) is amended by inserting before the line referenced to 7 U.S.C.<br />&#167; 6 the following new lines:<br />"2 U.S.C. &#167; 437g(d) 2C1.8<br />2 U.S.C. &#167; 439a 2C1.8<br />2 U.S.C. &#167; 441a 2C1.8<br />2 U.S.C. &#167; 441a-1 2C1.8<br />2 U.S.C. &#167; 441b 2C1.8<br />2 U.S.C. &#167; 441c 2C1.8<br />2 U.S.C. &#167; 441d 2C1.8<br />2 U.S.C. &#167; 441e 2C1.8<br />2 U.S.C. &#167; 441f 2C1.8<br />2 U.S.C. &#167; 441g 2C1.8<br />2 U.S.C. &#167; 441h(a) 2C1.8<br />2 U.S.C. &#167; 441i 2C1.8<br />2 U.S.C. &#167; 441k 2C1.8".<br />Appendix A (Statutory Index) is amended by inserting after the line referenced to 18 U.S.C.<br />&#167; 597 the following new line:<br />"18 U.S.C. &#167; 607 2C1.8".</td><td>Reason for Amendment: This amendment implements the directive from Congress<br />contained in the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002, Pub. L. 107–155, (the "BCRA")<br />to the effect that the Commission "promulgate a guideline, or amend an existing guideline<br />..., for penalties for violations of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 (the "FECA")<br />and related election laws ... .". The BCRA significantly increased statutory penalties for<br />campaign finance crimes, formerly misdemeanors under the FECA. The new statutory<br />maximum term of imprisonment for even the least serious of these offenses is now two years<br />and for more serious offenses, the maximum term of imprisonment is five years.<br />To effectively punish these offenses, the Commission chose to create a new guideline at<br />&#167;2C1.8 (Making, Receiving, or Failing to Report a Contribution, Donation, or Expenditure<br />in Violation of the Federal Election Campaign Act; Fraudulently Misrepresenting Campaign<br />Authority; Soliciting or Receiving a Donation in Connection with an Election While on<br />Certain Federal Property). The Commission opted against simply amending an existing<br />guideline because it determined after review that the characteristics of election-violation<br />cases did not bear sufficient similarity to cases sentenced under any existing guideline. The<br />offenses which will be sentenced under &#167;2C1.8 include: violations of the statutory<br />prohibitions against "soft money" (2 U.S.C. &#167; 441i); restrictions on "hard money"<br />contributions (2 U.S.C. &#167; 441a); contributions by foreign nationals (2 U.S.C. &#167; 441e);<br />restrictions on "electioneering communications" as defined at 2 U.S.C. &#167; 434(f)(3)(C));<br />certain fraudulent misrepresentations (2 U.S.C. &#167; 441h); and "conduit contributions" (2<br />U.S.C. &#167; 441f).<br />The new guideline has a base offense level of level 8, which reflects the fact that these<br />Amendment 648 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003<br /><br />offenses, while they are somewhat similar to fraud offenses (sentenced under &#167;2B1.1 (Theft,<br />Property Destruction, and Fraud) at a base offense level of level 6), generally are more<br />serious due to the additional harm, or the potential harm, of corrupting the elective process.<br />The new guideline provides five specific offense characteristics to ensure appropriate penalty<br />enhancements for aggravating conduct which may occur during the commission of certain<br />campaign finance offenses. First, the new guideline provides a specific offense<br />characteristic, at &#167;2C1.8(b)(1), that uses the fraud loss table in &#167;2B1.1 to incrementally<br />increase the offense level in proportion to the monetary amounts involved in the illegal<br />transactions. This both assures proportionality with penalties for fraud offenses and<br />responds to Congress’ directive to provide an enhancement for "a large aggregate amount<br />of illegal contributions."<br />Second, the new guideline provides alternative enhancements, at &#167;2C1.8(b)(2), if the offense<br />involved a foreign national (two levels) or a foreign government (four levels). These<br />enhancements respond to another specific directive in the BCRA and reflect the seriousness<br />of foreign entities attempting to tamper with the United States’ election processes.<br />Third, the new guideline provides alternative two level enhancements, at &#167;2C1.8(b)(3), when<br />the offense involves either "governmental funds," defined broadly to include Federal, State,<br />or local funds, or an intent to derive "a specific, identifiable non-monetary Federal benefit"<br />(e.g., a presidential pardon). Each of these enhancements responds to specific directives of<br />the BCRA.<br />Fourth, the new guideline provides a two level enhancement, at subsection (b)(4), when the<br />offender engages in "30 or more illegal transactions." After a review of all campaign finance<br />cases in the Commission’s datafile, the Commission chose 30 transactions as the number best<br />illustrative of a "large number" in that context. This enhancement also responds to a specific<br />directive in the BCRA to the effect that the Commission provide enhanced sentencing for<br />cases involving "a large number of illegal transactions."<br />Fifth, the new guideline provides a 4 level enhancement, at &#167;2C1.8(b)(5), if the offense<br />involves the use of "intimidation, threat of pecuniary or other harm, or coercion." This<br />enhancement responds to information received from the Federal Election Commission and<br />the Public Integrity Section of the Department of Justice which characterizes offenses of this<br />type as some of the most aggravated offenses committed under the FECA.<br />The new guideline also provides a cross reference, at subsection (c), which directs the<br />sentencing court to apply either &#167;2C1.1 or &#167;2C1.2, as appropriate, if the offense involved a<br />bribe or a gratuity and the resulting offense level would be greater than that determined<br />under &#167;2C1.8.<br />Section 3D1.2 (Groups of Closely Related Counts) has been amended, consistent with the<br />principles underlying the rules for grouping multiple counts of conviction, to include &#167;2C1.8<br />offenses among those in which the offense level is determined largely on the basis of the<br />total amount of harm or loss or some other measure of aggregate harm. (See &#167;3D1.2(d)).<br />Finally, &#167;5E1.2 (Fines for Individual Defendants) has been amended to specifically reflect<br />fine provisions unique to the FECA. This part of the amendment also provides that the<br />defendant’s participation in a conciliation agreement with the Federal Election Commission<br />November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II Amendment 648<br /><br />may be an appropriate factor for use in determining the specific fine within the applicable<br />fine guideline range unless the defendant began negotiations with the Federal Election<br />Commission after the defendant became aware that he or it was the subject of a criminal<br />investigation.</td><td>Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is January 25, 2003.</td></tr><tr><td class="n">650</td><td>Amendment 650</td><td>Section 2G2.2(b) is amended by adding at the end the following:<br />"(6) If the offense involved—<br />(A) at least 10 images, but fewer than 150, increase by 2 levels;<br />(B) at least 150 images, but fewer than 300, increase by 3 levels;<br />(C) at least 300 images, but fewer than 600, increase by 4 levels; and<br />(D) 600 or more images, increase by 5 levels.".<br />The Commentary to &#167;2G2.2 is amended by adding at the end the following:<br />"Background: Section 401(i)(1)(C) of Public Law 108–21 directly amended<br />subsection (b) to add subdivision (6), effective April 30, 2003.".<br />Section 2G2.4(b) is amended by adding at the end the following:<br />"(4) If the offense involved material that portrays sadistic or masochistic conduct<br />or other depictions of violence, increase by 4 levels.<br />(5) If the offense involved—<br />(A) at least 10 images, but fewer than 150, increase by 2 levels;<br />(B) at least 150 images, but fewer than 300, increase by 3 levels;<br />(C) at least 300 images, but fewer than 600, increase by 4 levels; and<br />(D) 600 or more images, increase by 5 levels.".<br />The Commentary to &#167;2G2.4 is amended by adding at the end the following:<br />"Background: Section 401(i)(1)(B) of Public Law 108–21 directly amended<br />subsection (b) to add subdivisions (4) and (5), effective April 30, 2003.".<br />Section 3E1.1(b) is amended by inserting "upon motion of the government stating that"<br />before "the defendant has assisted authorities"; and by striking the following:<br />"taking one or more of the following steps:<br />(1) timely providing complete information to the government<br />Amendment 649 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003<br /><br />concerning his own involvement in the offense; or<br />(2) timely notifying authorities of his intention to enter a plea of guilty,<br />thereby permitting the government to avoid preparing for trial and<br />permitting the court to allocate its resources efficiently,<br />decrease the offense level by 1 additional level",<br />and inserting "timely notifying authorities of his intention to enter a plea of guilty, thereby<br />permitting the government to avoid preparing for trial and permitting the government and<br />the court to allocate their resources efficiently, decrease the offense level by 1 additional<br />level".<br />The Commentary to &#167;3E1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 6 by striking<br />"one or both of"; by striking "(1) or (2)"; by striking "(b)(2)" and inserting "(b)"; and by<br />adding at the end the following new paragraph:<br />"Because the Government is in the best position to determine whether the defendant<br />has assisted authorities in a manner that avoids preparing for trial, an adjustment<br />under subsection (b) may only be granted upon a formal motion by the Government<br />at the time of sentencing.

Authority<br />The United States Sentencing Commission (‘Commission’) is an<br />independent agency in the judicial branch composed of seven voting and two non-<br />voting, ex officio members. Its principal purpose is to establish sentencing policies<br />and practices for the federal criminal justice system that will assure the ends of<br />justice by promulgating detailed guidelines prescribing the appropriate sentences for<br />offenders convicted of federal crimes.<br />The guidelines and policy statements promulgated by the Commission are<br />issued pursuant to Section 994(a) of Title 28, United States Code.<br />November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II Amendment 651<br /><br />2. The Statutory Mission<br />The Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 (Title II of the Comprehensive Crime<br />Control Act of 1984) provides for the development of guidelines that will further<br />the basic purposes of criminal punishment: deterrence, incapacitation, just<br />punishment, and rehabilitation. The Act delegates broad authority to the<br />Commission to review and rationalize the federal sentencing process.<br />The Act contains detailed instructions as to how this determination should<br />be made, the most important of which directs the Commission to create categories<br />of offense behavior and offender characteristics. An offense behavior category<br />might consist, for example, of ‘bank robbery/committed with a gun/$2500 taken.’<br />An offender characteristic category might be ‘offender with one prior conviction not<br />resulting in imprisonment.’ The Commission is required to prescribe guideline<br />ranges that specify an appropriate sentence for each class of convicted persons<br />determined by coordinating the offense behavior categories with the offender<br />characteristic categories. Where the guidelines call for imprisonment, the range<br />must be narrow: the maximum of the range cannot exceed the minimum by more<br />than the greater of 25 percent or six months. 28 U.S.C. &#167; 994(b)(2).<br />Pursuant to the Act, the sentencing court must select a sentence from within<br />the guideline range. If, however, a particular case presents atypical features, the Act<br />allows the court to depart from the guidelines and sentence outside the prescribed<br />range. In that case, the court must specify reasons for departure. 18 U.S.C. &#167;<br />3553(b). If the court sentences within the guideline range, an appellate court may<br />review the sentence to determine whether the guidelines were correctly applied. If<br />the court departs from the guideline range, an appellate court may review the<br />reasonableness of the departure. 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3742. The Act also abolishes parole,<br />and substantially reduces and restructures good behavior adjustments.<br />The Commission’s initial guidelines were submitted to Congress on April<br />13, 1987. After the prescribed period of Congressional review, the guidelines took<br />effect on November 1, 1987, and apply to all offenses committed on or after that<br />date. The Commission has the authority to submit guideline amendments each year<br />to Congress between the beginning of a regular Congressional session and May 1.<br />Such amendments automatically take effect 180 days after submission unless a law<br />is enacted to the contrary. 28 U.S.C. &#167; 994(p).<br />The initial sentencing guidelines and policy statements were developed after<br />extensive hearings, deliberation, and consideration of substantial public comment.<br />The Commission emphasizes, however, that it views the guideline-writing process<br />as evolutionary. It expects, and the governing statute anticipates, that continuing<br />research, experience, and analysis will result in modifications and revisions to the<br />guidelines through submission of amendments to Congress. To this end, the<br />Commission is established as a permanent agency to monitor sentencing practices<br />in the federal courts.<br />3. The Basic Approach (Policy Statement)<br />To understand the guidelines and their underlying rationale, it is important<br />Amendment 651 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003<br /><br />to focus on the three objectives that Congress sought to achieve in enacting the<br />Sentencing Reform Act of 1984. The Act’s basic objective was to enhance the<br />ability of the criminal justice system to combat crime through an effective, fair<br />sentencing system. To achieve this end, Congress first sought honesty in<br />sentencing. It sought to avoid the confusion and implicit deception that arose out<br />of the pre-guidelines sentencing system which required the court to impose an<br />indeterminate sentence of imprisonment and empowered the parole commission to<br />determine how much of the sentence an offender actually would serve in prison.<br />This practice usually resulted in a substantial reduction in the effective length of the<br />sentence imposed, with defendants often serving only about one-third of the<br />sentence imposed by the court.<br />Second, Congress sought reasonable uniformity in sentencing by narrowing<br />the wide disparity in sentences imposed for similar criminal offenses committed by<br />similar offenders. Third, Congress sought proportionality in sentencing through a<br />system that imposes appropriately different sentences for criminal conduct of<br />differing severity.<br />Honesty is easy to achieve: the abolition of parole makes the sentence<br />imposed by the court the sentence the offender will serve, less approximately fifteen<br />percent for good behavior. There is a tension, however, between the mandate of<br />uniformity and the mandate of proportionality. Simple uniformity -- sentencing<br />every offender to five years -- destroys proportionality. Having only a few simple<br />categories of crimes would make the guidelines uniform and easy to administer, but<br />might lump together offenses that are different in important respects. For example,<br />a single category for robbery that included armed and unarmed robberies, robberies<br />with and without injuries, robberies of a few dollars and robberies of millions,<br />would be far too broad.<br />A sentencing system tailored to fit every conceivable wrinkle of each case<br />would quickly become unworkable and seriously compromise the certainty of<br />punishment and its deterrent effect. For example: a bank robber with (or without)<br />a gun, which the robber kept hidden (or brandished), might have frightened (or<br />merely warned), injured seriously (or less seriously), tied up (or simply pushed) a<br />guard, teller, or customer, at night (or at noon), in an effort to obtain money for<br />other crimes (or for other purposes), in the company of a few (or many) other<br />robbers, for the first (or fourth) time.<br />The list of potentially relevant features of criminal behavior is long; the fact<br />that they can occur in multiple combinations means that the list of possible<br />permutations of factors is virtually endless. The appropriate relationships among<br />these different factors are exceedingly difficult to establish, for they are often<br />context specific. Sentencing courts do not treat the occurrence of a simple bruise<br />identically in all cases, irrespective of whether that bruise occurred in the context of<br />a bank robbery or in the context of a breach of peace. This is so, in part, because the<br />risk that such a harm will occur differs depending on the underlying offense with<br />which it is connected; and also because, in part, the relationship between punishment<br />and multiple harms is not simply additive. The relation varies depending on how<br />much other harm has occurred. Thus, it would not be proper to assign points for<br />each kind of harm and simply add them up, irrespective of context and total<br />November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II Amendment 651<br /><br />amounts.<br />The larger the number of subcategories of offense and offender<br />characteristics included in the guidelines, the greater the complexity and the less<br />workable the system. Moreover, complex combinations of offense and offender<br />characteristics would apply and interact in unforeseen ways to unforeseen situations,<br />thus failing to cure the unfairness of a simple, broad category system. Finally, and<br />perhaps most importantly, probation officers and courts, in applying a complex<br />system having numerous subcategories, would be required to make a host of<br />decisions regarding whether the underlying facts were sufficient to bring the case<br />within a particular subcategory. The greater the number of decisions required and<br />the greater their complexity, the greater the risk that different courts would apply the<br />guidelines differently to situations that, in fact, are similar, thereby reintroducing the<br />very disparity that the guidelines were designed to reduce.<br />In view of the arguments, it would have been tempting to retreat to the<br />simple, broad category approach and to grant courts the discretion to select the<br />proper point along a broad sentencing range. Granting such broad discretion,<br />however, would have risked correspondingly broad disparity in sentencing, for<br />different courts may exercise their discretionary powers in different ways. Such an<br />approach would have risked a return to the wide disparity that Congress established<br />the Commission to reduce and would have been contrary to the Commission’s<br />mandate set forth in the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984.<br />In the end, there was no completely satisfying solution to this problem. The<br />Commission had to balance the comparative virtues and vices of broad, simple<br />categorization and detailed, complex subcategorization, and within the constraints<br />established by that balance, minimize the discretionary powers of the sentencing<br />court. Any system will, to a degree, enjoy the benefits and suffer from the<br />drawbacks of each approach.<br />A philosophical problem arose when the Commission attempted to reconcile<br />the differing perceptions of the purposes of criminal punishment. Most observers<br />of the criminal law agree that the ultimate aim of the law itself, and of punishment<br />in particular, is the control of crime. Beyond this point, however, the consensus<br />seems to break down. Some argue that appropriate punishment should be defined<br />primarily on the basis of the principle of ‘just deserts.’ Under this principle,<br />punishment should be scaled to the offender’s culpability and the resulting harms.<br />Others argue that punishment should be imposed primarily on the basis of practical<br />‘crime control’ considerations. This theory calls for sentences that most effectively<br />lessen the likelihood of future crime, either by deterring others or incapacitating the<br />defendant.<br />Adherents of each of these points of view urged the Commission to choose<br />between them and accord one primacy over the other. As a practical matter,<br />however, this choice was unnecessary because in most sentencing decisions the<br />application of either philosophy will produce the same or similar results.<br />In its initial set of guidelines, the Commission sought to solve both the<br />practical and philosophical problems of developing a coherent sentencing system by<br />Amendment 651 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003<br /><br />taking an empirical approach that used as a starting point data estimating pre-<br />guidelines sentencing practice. It analyzed data drawn from 10,000 presentence<br />investigations, the differing elements of various crimes as distinguished in<br />substantive criminal statutes, the United States Parole Commission’s guidelines and<br />statistics, and data from other relevant sources in order to determine which<br />distinctions were important in pre-guidelines practice. After consideration, the<br />Commission accepted, modified, or rationalized these distinctions.<br />This empirical approach helped the Commission resolve its practical<br />problem by defining a list of relevant distinctions that, although of considerable<br />length, was short enough to create a manageable set of guidelines. Existing<br />categories are relatively broad and omit distinctions that some may believe<br />important, yet they include most of the major distinctions that statutes and data<br />suggest made a significant difference in sentencing decisions. Relevant distinctions<br />not reflected in the guidelines probably will occur rarely and sentencing courts may<br />take such unusual cases into account by departing from the guidelines.<br />The Commission’s empirical approach also helped resolve its philosophical<br />dilemma. Those who adhere to a just deserts philosophy may concede that the lack<br />of consensus might make it difficult to say exactly what punishment is deserved for<br />a particular crime. Likewise, those who subscribe to a philosophy of crime control<br />may acknowledge that the lack of sufficient data might make it difficult to determine<br />exactly the punishment that will best prevent that crime. Both groups might<br />therefore recognize the wisdom of looking to those distinctions that judges and<br />legislators have, in fact, made over the course of time. These established<br />distinctions are ones that the community believes, or has found over time, to be<br />important from either a just deserts or crime control perspective.<br />The Commission did not simply copy estimates of pre-guidelines practice<br />as revealed by the data, even though establishing offense values on this basis would<br />help eliminate disparity because the data represent averages. Rather, it departed<br />from the data at different points for various important reasons. Congressional<br />statutes, for example, suggested or required departure, as in the case of the Anti-<br />Drug Abuse Act of 1986 that imposed increased and mandatory minimum sentences.<br />In addition, the data revealed inconsistencies in treatment, such as punishing<br />economic crime less severely than other apparently equivalent behavior.<br />Despite these policy-oriented departures from pre-guidelines practice, the<br />guidelines represent an approach that begins with, and builds upon, empirical data.<br />The guidelines will not please those who wish the Commission to adopt a single<br />philosophical theory and then work deductively to establish a simple and perfect set<br />of categorizations and distinctions. The guidelines may prove acceptable, however,<br />to those who seek more modest, incremental improvements in the status quo, who<br />believe the best is often the enemy of the good, and who recognize that these<br />guidelines are, as the Act contemplates, but the first step in an evolutionary process.<br />After spending considerable time and resources exploring alternative approaches,<br />the Commission developed these guidelines as a practical effort toward the<br />achievement of a more honest, uniform, equitable, proportional, and therefore<br />effective sentencing system.<br />November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II Amendment 651<br /><br />4. The Guidelines’ Resolution of Major Issues (Policy Statement)<br />The guideline-drafting process required the Commission to resolve a host<br />of important policy questions typically involving rather evenly balanced sets of<br />competing considerations. As an aid to understanding the guidelines, this<br />introduction briefly discusses several of those issues; commentary in the guidelines<br />explains others.<br />(a) Real Offense vs. Charge Offense Sentencing.<br />One of the most important questions for the Commission to decide was<br />whether to base sentences upon the actual conduct in which the defendant engaged<br />regardless of the charges for which he was indicted or convicted (‘real offense’<br />sentencing), or upon the conduct that constitutes the elements of the offense for<br />which the defendant was charged and of which he was convicted (‘charge offense’<br />sentencing). A bank robber, for example, might have used a gun, frightened<br />bystanders, taken $50,000, injured a teller, refused to stop when ordered, and raced<br />away damaging property during his escape. A pure real offense system would<br />sentence on the basis of all identifiable conduct. A pure charge offense system<br />would overlook some of the harms that did not constitute statutory elements of the<br />offenses of which the defendant was convicted.<br />The Commission initially sought to develop a pure real offense system.<br />After all, the pre-guidelines sentencing system was, in a sense, this type of system.<br />The sentencing court and the parole commission took account of the conduct in<br />which the defendant actually engaged, as determined in a presentence report, at the<br />sentencing hearing, or before a parole commission hearing officer. The<br />Commission’s initial efforts in this direction, carried out in the spring and early<br />summer of 1986, proved unproductive, mostly for practical reasons. To make such<br />a system work, even to formalize and rationalize the status quo, would have required<br />the Commission to decide precisely which harms to take into account, how to add<br />them up, and what kinds of procedures the courts should use to determine the<br />presence or absence of disputed factual elements. The Commission found no<br />practical way to combine and account for the large number of diverse harms arising<br />in different circumstances; nor did it find a practical way to reconcile the need for<br />a fair adjudicatory procedure with the need for a speedy sentencing process given<br />the potential existence of hosts of adjudicated ‘real harm’ facts in many typical<br />cases. The effort proposed as a solution to these problems required the use of, for<br />example, quadratic roots and other mathematical operations that the Commission<br />considered too complex to be workable. In the Commission’s view, such a system<br />risked return to wide disparity in sentencing practice.<br />In its initial set of guidelines submitted to Congress in April 1987, the<br />Commission moved closer to a charge offense system. This system, however, does<br />contain a significant number of real offense elements. For one thing, the hundreds<br />of overlapping and duplicative statutory provisions that make up the federal criminal<br />law forced the Commission to write guidelines that are descriptive of generic<br />conduct rather than guidelines that track purely statutory language. For another, the<br />guidelines take account of a number of important, commonly occurring real offense<br />elements such as role in the offense, the presence of a gun, or the amount of money<br />Amendment 651 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003<br /><br />actually taken, through alternative base offense levels, specific offense<br />characteristics, cross references, and adjustments.<br />The Commission recognized that a charge offense system has drawbacks of<br />its own. One of the most important is the potential it affords prosecutors to<br />influence sentences by increasing or decreasing the number of counts in an<br />indictment. Of course, the defendant’s actual conduct (that which the prosecutor can<br />prove in court) imposes a natural limit upon the prosecutor’s ability to increase a<br />defendant’s sentence. Moreover, the Commission has written its rules for the<br />treatment of multicount convictions with an eye toward eliminating unfair treatment<br />that might flow from count manipulation. For example, the guidelines treat a three-<br />count indictment, each count of which charges sale of 100 grams of heroin or theft<br />of $10,000, the same as a single-count indictment charging sale of 300 grams of<br />heroin or theft of $30,000. Furthermore, a sentencing court may control any<br />inappropriate manipulation of the indictment through use of its departure power.<br />Finally, the Commission will closely monitor charging and plea agreement practices<br />and will make appropriate adjustments should they become necessary.<br />(b) Departures.<br />The sentencing statute permits a court to depart from a guideline-specified<br />sentence only when it finds ‘an aggravating or mitigating circumstance of a kind, or<br />to a degree, not adequately taken into consideration by the Sentencing Commission<br />in formulating the guidelines that should result in a sentence different from that<br />described.’ 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(b). The Commission intends the sentencing courts<br />to treat each guideline as carving out a ‘heartland,’ a set of typical cases embodying<br />the conduct that each guideline describes. When a court finds an atypical case, one<br />to which a particular guideline linguistically applies but where conduct significantly<br />differs from the norm, the court may consider whether a departure is warranted.<br />Section 5H1.10 (Race, Sex, National Origin, Creed, Religion, and Socio-Economic<br />Status), &#167;5H1.12 (Lack of Guidance as a Youth and Similar Circumstances), the<br />third sentence of &#167;5H1.4 (Physical Condition, Including Drug or Alcohol<br />Dependence or Abuse), the last sentence of &#167;5K2.12 (Coercion and Duress), and<br />&#167;5K2.19 (Post-Sentencing Rehabilitative Efforts) list several factors that the court<br />cannot take into account as grounds for departure. With those specific exceptions,<br />however, the Commission does not intend to limit the kinds of factors, whether or<br />not mentioned anywhere else in the guidelines, that could constitute grounds for<br />departure in an unusual case.<br />The Commission has adopted this departure policy for two reasons. First,<br />it is difficult to prescribe a single set of guidelines that encompasses the vast range<br />of human conduct potentially relevant to a sentencing decision. The Commission<br />also recognizes that the initial set of guidelines need not do so. The Commission is<br />a permanent body, empowered by law to write and rewrite guidelines, with<br />progressive changes, over many years. By monitoring when courts depart from the<br />guidelines and by analyzing their stated reasons for doing so and court decisions<br />with references thereto, the Commission, over time, will be able to refine the<br />guidelines to specify more precisely when departures should and should not be<br />permitted.<br />November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II Amendment 651<br /><br />Second, the Commission believes that despite the courts’ legal freedom to<br />depart from the guidelines, they will not do so very often. This is because the<br />guidelines, offense by offense, seek to take account of those factors that the<br />Commission’s data indicate made a significant difference in pre-guidelines<br />sentencing practice. Thus, for example, where the presence of physical injury made<br />an important difference in pre-guidelines sentencing practice (as in the case of<br />robbery or assault), the guidelines specifically include this factor to enhance the<br />sentence. Where the guidelines do not specify an augmentation or diminution, this<br />is generally because the sentencing data did not permit the Commission to conclude<br />that the factor was empirically important in relation to the particular offense. Of<br />course, an important factor (e.g., physical injury) may infrequently occur in<br />connection with a particular crime (e.g., fraud). Such rare occurrences are precisely<br />the type of events that the courts’ departure powers were designed to cover --<br />unusual cases outside the range of the more typical offenses for which the guidelines<br />were designed.<br />It is important to note that the guidelines refer to two different kinds of<br />departure. The first involves instances in which the guidelines provide specific<br />guidance for departure by analogy or by other numerical or non-numerical<br />suggestions. The Commission intends such suggestions as policy guidance for the<br />courts. The Commission expects that most departures will reflect the suggestions<br />and that the courts of appeals may prove more likely to find departures<br />‘unreasonable’ where they fall outside suggested levels.<br />A second type of departure will remain unguided. It may rest upon grounds<br />referred to in Chapter Five, Part K (Departures) or on grounds not mentioned in the<br />guidelines. While Chapter Five, Part K lists factors that the Commission believes<br />may constitute grounds for departure, the list is not exhaustive. The Commission<br />recognizes that there may be other grounds for departure that are not mentioned; it<br />also believes there may be cases in which a departure outside suggested levels is<br />warranted. In its view, however, such cases will be highly infrequent.<br />(c) Plea Agreements.<br />Nearly ninety percent of all federal criminal cases involve guilty pleas and<br />many of these cases involve some form of plea agreement. Some commentators on<br />early Commission guideline drafts urged the Commission not to attempt any major<br />reforms of the plea agreement process on the grounds that any set of guidelines that<br />threatened to change pre-guidelines practice radically also threatened to make the<br />federal system unmanageable. Others argued that guidelines that failed to control<br />and limit plea agreements would leave untouched a ‘loophole’ large enough to undo<br />the good that sentencing guidelines would bring.<br />The Commission decided not to make major changes in plea agreement<br />practices in the initial guidelines, but rather to provide guidance by issuing general<br />policy statements concerning the acceptance of plea agreements in Chapter Six, Part<br />B (Plea Agreements). The rules set forth in Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(e) govern the<br />acceptance or rejection of such agreements. The Commission will collect data on<br />the courts’ plea practices and will analyze this information to determine when and<br />why the courts accept or reject plea agreements and whether plea agreement<br />Amendment 651 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003<br /><br />practices are undermining the intent of the Sentencing Reform Act. In light of this<br />information and analysis, the Commission will seek to further regulate the plea<br />agreement process as appropriate. Importantly, if the policy statements relating to<br />plea agreements are followed, circumvention of the Sentencing Reform Act and the<br />guidelines should not occur.<br />The Commission expects the guidelines to have a positive, rationalizing<br />impact upon plea agreements for two reasons. First, the guidelines create a clear,<br />definite expectation in respect to the sentence that a court will impose if a trial takes<br />place. In the event a prosecutor and defense attorney explore the possibility of a<br />negotiated plea, they will no longer work in the dark. This fact alone should help<br />to reduce irrationality in respect to actual sentencing outcomes. Second, the<br />guidelines create a norm to which courts will likely refer when they decide whether,<br />under Rule 11(e), to accept or to reject a plea agreement or recommendation.<br />(d) Probation and Split Sentences.<br />The statute provides that the guidelines are to ‘reflect the general<br />appropriateness of imposing a sentence other than imprisonment in cases in which<br />the defendant is a first offender who has not been convicted of a crime of violence<br />or an otherwise serious offense . . . .’ 28 U.S.C. &#167; 994(j). Under pre-guidelines<br />sentencing practice, courts sentenced to probation an inappropriately high<br />percentage of offenders guilty of certain economic crimes, such as theft, tax evasion,<br />antitrust offenses, insider trading, fraud, and embezzlement, that in the<br />Commission’s view are ‘serious.’<br />The Commission’s solution to this problem has been to write guidelines that<br />classify as serious many offenses for which probation previously was frequently<br />given and provide for at least a short period of imprisonment in such cases. The<br />Commission concluded that the definite prospect of prison, even though the term<br />may be short, will serve as a significant deterrent, particularly when compared with<br />pre-guidelines practice where probation, not prison, was the norm.<br />More specifically, the guidelines work as follows in respect to a first<br />offender. For offense levels one through eight, the sentencing court may elect to<br />sentence the offender to probation (with or without confinement conditions) or to<br />a prison term. For offense levels nine and ten, the court may substitute probation<br />for a prison term, but the probation must include confinement conditions<br />(community confinement, intermittent confinement, or home detention). For offense<br />levels eleven and twelve, the court must impose at least one-half the minimum<br />confinement sentence in the form of prison confinement, the remainder to be served<br />on supervised release with a condition of community confinement or home<br />detention. The Commission, of course, has not dealt with the single acts of aberrant<br />behavior that still may justify probation at higher offense levels through departures.*<br />*Note: Although the Commission had not addressed ‘single acts of aberrant<br />behavior’ at the time the Introduction to the Guidelines Manual originally was<br />written, it subsequently addressed the issue in Amendment 603, effective<br />November 1, 2000. (See Supplement to Appendix C, amendment 603.)<br />November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II Amendment 651<br /><br />(e) Multi-Count Convictions.<br />The Commission, like several state sentencing commissions, has found it<br />particularly difficult to develop guidelines for sentencing defendants convicted of<br />multiple violations of law, each of which makes up a separate count in an<br />indictment. The difficulty is that when a defendant engages in conduct that causes<br />several harms, each additional harm, even if it increases the extent to which<br />punishment is warranted, does not necessarily warrant a proportionate increase in<br />punishment. A defendant who assaults others during a fight, for example, may<br />warrant more punishment if he injures ten people than if he injures one, but his<br />conduct does not necessarily warrant ten times the punishment. If it did, many of<br />the simplest offenses, for reasons that are often fortuitous, would lead to sentences<br />of life imprisonment -- sentences that neither just deserts nor crime control theories<br />of punishment would justify.<br />Several individual guidelines provide special instructions for increasing<br />punishment when the conduct that is the subject of that count involves multiple<br />occurrences or has caused several harms. The guidelines also provide general rules<br />for aggravating punishment in light of multiple harms charged separately in separate<br />counts. These rules may produce occasional anomalies, but normally they will<br />permit an appropriate degree of aggravation of punishment for multiple offenses that<br />are the subjects of separate counts.<br />These rules are set out in Chapter Three, Part D (Multiple Counts). They<br />essentially provide: (1) when the conduct involves fungible items (e.g., separate<br />drug transactions or thefts of money), the amounts are added and the guidelines<br />apply to the total amount; (2) when nonfungible harms are involved, the offense<br />level for the most serious count is increased (according to a diminishing scale) to<br />reflect the existence of other counts of conviction. The guidelines have been written<br />in order to minimize the possibility that an arbitrary casting of a single transaction<br />into several counts will produce a longer sentence. In addition, the sentencing court<br />will have adequate power to prevent such a result through departures.<br />(f) Regulatory Offenses.<br />Regulatory statutes, though primarily civil in nature, sometimes contain<br />criminal provisions in respect to particularly harmful activity. Such criminal<br />provisions often describe not only substantive offenses, but also more technical,<br />administratively-related offenses such as failure to keep accurate records or to<br />provide requested information. These statutes pose two problems: first, which<br />criminal regulatory provisions should the Commission initially consider, and<br />second, how should it treat technical or administratively-related criminal violations?<br />In respect to the first problem, the Commission found that it could not<br />comprehensively treat all regulatory violations in the initial set of guidelines. There<br />are hundreds of such provisions scattered throughout the United States Code. To<br />find all potential violations would involve examination of each individual federal<br />regulation. Because of this practical difficulty, the Commission sought to<br />determine, with the assistance of the Department of Justice and several regulatory<br />agencies, which criminal regulatory offenses were particularly important in light of<br />Amendment 651 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003<br /><br />the need for enforcement of the general regulatory scheme. The Commission<br />addressed these offenses in the initial guidelines.<br />In respect to the second problem, the Commission has developed a system<br />for treating technical recordkeeping and reporting offenses that divides them into<br />four categories. First, in the simplest of cases, the offender may have failed to fill<br />out a form intentionally, but without knowledge or intent that substantive harm<br />would likely follow. He might fail, for example, to keep an accurate record of toxic<br />substance transport, but that failure may not lead, nor be likely to lead, to the release<br />or improper handling of any toxic substance. Second, the same failure may be<br />accompanied by a significant likelihood that substantive harm will occur; it may<br />make a release of a toxic substance more likely. Third, the same failure may have<br />led to substantive harm. Fourth, the failure may represent an effort to conceal a<br />substantive harm that has occurred.<br />The structure of a typical guideline for a regulatory offense provides a low<br />base offense level (e.g., 6) aimed at the first type of recordkeeping or reporting<br />offense. Specific offense characteristics designed to reflect substantive harms that<br />do occur in respect to some regulatory offenses, or that are likely to occur, increase<br />the offense level. A specific offense characteristic also provides that a<br />recordkeeping or reporting offense that conceals a substantive offense will have the<br />same offense level as the substantive offense.<br />(g) Sentencing Ranges.<br />In determining the appropriate sentencing ranges for each offense, the<br />Commission estimated the average sentences served within each category under the<br />pre-guidelines sentencing system. It also examined the sentences specified in<br />federal statutes, in the parole guidelines, and in other relevant, analogous sources.<br />The Commission’s Supplementary Report on the Initial Sentencing Guidelines<br />(1987) contains a comparison between estimates of pre-guidelines sentencing<br />practice and sentences under the guidelines.<br />While the Commission has not considered itself bound by pre-guidelines<br />sentencing practice, it has not attempted to develop an entirely new system of<br />sentencing on the basis of theory alone. Guideline sentences, in many instances,<br />will approximate average pre-guidelines practice and adherence to the guidelines<br />will help to eliminate wide disparity. For example, where a high percentage of<br />persons received probation under pre-guidelines practice, a guideline may include<br />one or more specific offense characteristics in an effort to distinguish those types of<br />defendants who received probation from those who received more severe sentences.<br />In some instances, short sentences of incarceration for all offenders in a category<br />have been substituted for a pre-guidelines sentencing practice of very wide<br />variability in which some defendants received probation while others received<br />several years in prison for the same offense. Moreover, inasmuch as those who<br />pleaded guilty under pre-guidelines practice often received lesser sentences, the<br />guidelines permit the court to impose lesser sentences on those defendants who<br />accept responsibility for their misconduct. For defendants who provide substantial<br />assistance to the government in the investigation or prosecution of others, a<br />downward departure may be warranted.<br />November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II Amendment 651<br /><br />The Commission has also examined its sentencing ranges in light of their<br />likely impact upon prison population. Specific legislation, such as the Anti-Drug<br />Abuse Act of 1986 and the career offender provisions of the Sentencing Reform Act<br />of 1984 (28 U.S.C. &#167; 994(h)), required the Commission to promulgate guidelines<br />that will lead to substantial prison population increases. These increases will occur<br />irrespective of the guidelines. The guidelines themselves, insofar as they reflect<br />policy decisions made by the Commission (rather than legislated mandatory<br />minimum or career offender sentences), are projected to lead to an increase in prison<br />population that computer models, produced by the Commission and the Bureau<br />o f<br />Prisons<br />in 1987,<br />estimat<br />ed a t<br />approxi<br />mately<br />10 perc<br />ent over<br />a period<br />of ten<br />years.<br />(h) The Sentencing Table.<br />The Commission has established a sentencing table that for technical and<br />practical reasons contains 43 levels. Each level in the table prescribes ranges that<br />overlap with the ranges in the preceding and succeeding levels. By overlapping the<br />ranges, the table should discourage unnecessary litigation. Both prosecution and<br />defense will realize that the difference between one level and another will not<br />necessarily make a difference in the sentence that the court imposes. Thus, little<br />purpose will be served in protracted litigation trying to determine, for example,<br />whether $10,000 or $11,000 was obtained as a result of a fraud. At the same time,<br />the levels work to increase a sentence proportionately. A change of six levels<br />roughly doubles the sentence irrespective of the level at which one starts. The<br />guidelines, in keeping with the statutory requirement that the maximum of any range<br />cannot exceed the minimum by more than the greater of 25 percent or six months<br />(28 U.S.C. &#167; 994(b)(2)), permit courts to exercise the greatest permissible range of<br />sentencing discretion. The table overlaps offense levels meaningfully, works<br />proportionately, and at the same time preserves the maximum degree of allowable<br />discretion for the court within each level.<br />Similarly, many of the individual guidelines refer to tables that correlate<br />amounts of money with offense levels. These tables often have many rather than a<br />few levels. Again, the reason is to minimize the likelihood of unnecessary litigation.<br />If a money table were to make only a few distinctions, each distinction would<br />become more important and litigation over which category an offender fell within<br />would become more likely. Where a table has many small monetary distinctions,<br />it minimizes the likelihood of litigation because the precise amount of money<br />involved is of considerably less importance.<br />Amendment 651 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003<br /><br />5. A Concluding Note<br />The Commission emphasizes that it drafted the initial guidelines with<br />considerable caution. It examined the many hundreds of criminal statutes in the<br />United States Code. It began with those that were the basis for a significant number<br />of prosecutions and sought to place them in a rational order. It developed additional<br />distinctions relevant to the application of these provisions and it applied sentencing<br />ranges to each resulting category. In doing so, it relied upon pre-guidelines<br />sentencing practice as revealed by its own statistical analyses based on summary<br />reports of some 40,000 convictions, a sample of 10,000 augmented presentence<br />reports, the parole guidelines, and policy judgments.<br />The Commission recognizes that some will criticize this approach as overly<br />cautious, as representing too little a departure from pre-guidelines sentencing<br />practice. Yet, it will cure wide disparity. The Commission is a permanent body that<br />can amend the guidelines each year. Although the data available to it, like all data,<br />are imperfect, experience with the guidelines will lead to additional information and<br />provide a firm empirical basis for consideration of revisions.<br />Finally, the guidelines will apply to more than 90 percent of all felony and<br />Class A misdemeanor cases in the federal courts. Because of time constraints and<br />the nonexistence of statistical information, some offenses that occur infrequently are<br />not considered in the guidelines. Their exclusion does not reflect any judgment<br />regarding their seriousness and they will be addressed as the Commission refines the<br />guidelines over time.";<br />and inserting:<br />" PART A - AUTHORITY<br />&#167;1A1.1. Authority<br />The guidelines, policy statements, and commentary set forth in this<br />Guidelines Manual, including amendments thereto, are<br />promulgated by the United States Sentencing Commission pursuant<br />to: (1) section 994(a) of title 28, United States Code; and (2) with<br />respect to guidelines, policy statements, and commentary<br />promulgated or amended pursuant to specific congressional<br />directive, pursuant to the authority contained in that directive in<br />addition to the authority under section 994(a) of title 28, United<br />States Code.<br />Commentary<br />Application Note:<br />1. Historical Review of Original Introduction.—Part A of Chapter One<br />originally was an introduction to the Guidelines Manual that explained a<br />number of policy decisions made by the Commission when it promulgated<br />November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II Amendment 651<br /><br />the initial set of guidelines. This introduction was amended occasionally<br />between 1987 and 2003. In 2003, as part of the Commission’s<br />implementation of the Prosecutorial Remedies and Other Tools to end the<br />Exploitation of Children Today Act of 2003 (the ‘PROTECT Act’, Public<br />Law 108–21), the original introduction was transferred to the Editorial Note<br />at the end of this guideline. The Commission encourages the review of this<br />material for context and historical purposes.<br />Background: The Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 changed the course of federal<br />sentencing. Among other things, the Act created the United States Sentencing<br />Commission as an independent agency in the Judicial Branch, and directed it to<br />develop guidelines and policy statements for sentencing courts to use when<br />sentencing offenders convicted of federal crimes. Moreover, it empowered the<br />Commission with ongoing responsibilities to monitor the guidelines, submit to<br />Congress appropriate modifications of the guidelines and recommended changes in<br />criminal statutes, and establish education and research programs. The mandate<br />rested on Congressional awareness that sentencing was a dynamic field that requires<br />continuing review by an expert body to revise sentencing policies, in light of<br />application experience, as new criminal statutes are enacted, and as more is learned<br />about what motivates and controls criminal behavior.";<br />and adding an editorial note following the guideline.<br />The Commentary to &#167;1B1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by striking Note 1<br />as follows:<br />"1.

The term ‘instant’<br />is used in connection with ‘offense,’ ‘federal offense,’ or ‘offense<br />of conviction,’ as the case may be, to distinguish the violation for<br />which the defendant is being sentenced from a prior or subsequent<br />November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II Amendment 651<br /><br />offense, or from an offense before another court (e.g., an offense<br />before a state court involving the same underlying conduct).",<br />and inserting the following:<br />"1.

Adequacy of Criminal History Category (Policy Statement)<br />If reliable information indicates that the criminal history category<br />does not adequately reflect the seriousness of the defendant’s past<br />criminal conduct or the likelihood that the defendant will commit<br />other crimes, the court may consider imposing a sentence departing<br />from the otherwise applicable guideline range. Such information<br />may include, but is not limited to, information concerning:<br />(a) prior sentence(s) not used in computing the criminal<br />history category (e.g., sentences for foreign and tribal<br />offenses);<br />(b) prior sentence(s) of substantially more than one year<br />imposed as a result of independent crimes committed on<br />different occasions;<br />(c) prior similar misconduct established by a civil adjudication<br />or by a failure to comply with an administrative order;<br />(d) whether the defendant was pending trial or sentencing on<br />another charge at the time of the instant offense;<br />(e) prior similar adult criminal conduct not resulting in a<br />criminal conviction.<br />A departure under this provision is warranted when the criminal<br />history category significantly under-represents the seriousness of<br />the defendant’s criminal history or the likelihood that the defendant<br />will commit further crimes. Examples might include the case of a<br />defendant who (1) had several previous foreign sentences for<br />serious offenses, (2) had received a prior consolidated sentence of<br />ten years for a series of serious assaults, (3) had a similar instance<br />of large scale fraudulent misconduct established by an adjudication<br />in a Securities and Exchange Commission enforcement proceeding,<br />(4) committed the instant offense while on bail or pretrial release<br />for another serious offense, or (5) for appropriate reasons, such as<br />cooperation in the prosecution of other defendants, had previously<br />received an extremely lenient sentence for a serious offense. The<br />court may, after a review of all the relevant information, conclude<br />that the defendant’s criminal history was significantly more serious<br />than that of most defendants in the same criminal history category,<br />and therefore consider an upward departure from the guidelines.<br />However, a prior arrest record itself shall not be considered under<br />&#167;4A1.3.<br />There may be cases where the court concludes that a defendant’s<br />criminal history category significantly over-represents the<br />seriousness of a defendant’s criminal history or the likelihood that<br />the defendant will commit further crimes. An example might<br />November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II Amendment 651<br /><br />include the case of a defendant with two minor misdemeanor<br />convictions close to ten years prior to the instant offense and no<br />other evidence of prior criminal behavior in the intervening period.<br />The court may conclude that the defendant’s criminal history was<br />significantly less serious than that of most defendants in the same<br />criminal history category (Category II), and therefore consider a<br />downward departure from the guidelines.<br />In considering a departure under this provision, the Commission<br />intends that the court use, as a reference, the guideline range for a<br />defendant with a higher or lower criminal history category, as<br />applicable. For example, if the court concludes that the defendant’s<br />criminal history category of III significantly under-represents the<br />seriousness of the defendant’s criminal history, and that the<br />seriousness of the defendant’s criminal history most closely<br />resembles that of most defendants with Criminal History Category<br />IV, the court should look to the guideline range specified for a<br />defendant with Criminal History Category IV to guide its<br />departure. The Commission contemplates that there may, on<br />occasion, be a case of an egregious, serious criminal record in<br />which even the guideline range for Criminal History Category VI<br />is not adequate to reflect the seriousness of the defendant’s criminal<br />history. In such a case, a departure above the guideline range for<br />a defendant with Criminal History Category VI may be warranted.<br />In determining whether an upward departure from Criminal History<br />Category VI is warranted, the court should consider that the nature<br />of the prior offenses rather than simply their number is often more<br />indicative of the seriousness of the defendant’s criminal record.<br />For example, a defendant with five prior sentences for very large-<br />scale fraud offenses may have 15 criminal history points, within the<br />range of points typical for Criminal History Category VI, yet have<br />a substantially more serious criminal history overall because of the<br />nature of the prior offenses. On the other hand, a defendant with<br />nine prior 60-day jail sentences for offenses such as petty larceny,<br />prostitution, or possession of gambling slips has a higher number<br />of criminal history points (18 points) than the typical Criminal<br />History Category VI defendant, but not necessarily a more serious<br />criminal history overall. Where the court determines that the extent<br />and nature of the defendant’s criminal history, taken together, are<br />sufficient to warrant an upward departure from Criminal History<br />Category VI, the court should structure the departure by moving<br />incrementally down the sentencing table to the next higher offense<br />level in Criminal History Category VI until it finds a guideline<br />range appropriate to the case.<br />However, this provision is not symmetrical. The lower limit of the<br />range for Criminal History Category I is set for a first offender with<br />the lowest risk of recidivism. Therefore, a departure below the<br />lower limit of the guideline range for Criminal History Category I<br />on the basis of the adequacy of criminal history cannot be<br />Amendment 651 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003<br /><br />appropriate.<br />Commentary<br />Background: This policy statement recognizes that the criminal history score is<br />unlikely to take into account all the variations in the seriousness of criminal history<br />that may occur. For example, a defendant with an extensive record of serious,<br />assaultive conduct who had received what might now be considered extremely<br />lenient treatment in the past might have the same criminal history category as a<br />defendant who had a record of less serious conduct. Yet, the first defendant’s<br />criminal history clearly may be more serious. This may be particularly true in the<br />case of younger defendants (e.g., defendants in their early twenties or younger) who<br />are more likely to have received repeated lenient treatment, yet who may actually<br />pose a greater risk of serious recidivism than older defendants. This policy<br />statement authorizes the consideration of a departure from the guidelines in the<br />limited circumstances where reliable information indicates that the criminal history<br />category does not adequately reflect the seriousness of the defendant’s criminal<br />history or likelihood of recidivism, and provides guidance for the consideration of<br />such departures.",<br />and inserting:<br />"&#167;4A1.3.

Upward Departures.—<br />(A) Examples.—An upward departure from the defendant’s criminal<br />history category may be warranted based on any of the following<br />circumstances:<br />(i) A previous foreign sentence for a serious offense.<br />(ii) Receipt of a prior consolidated sentence of ten years for a<br />series of serious assaults.<br />(iii) A similar instance of large scale fraudulent misconduct<br />established by an adjudication in a Securities and<br />Exchange Commission enforcement proceeding.<br />(iv) Commission of the instant offense while on bail or pretrial<br />release for another serious offense.<br />(B) Upward Departures from Criminal History Category VI.—In the<br />case of an egregious, serious criminal record in which even the<br />guideline range for Criminal History Category VI is not adequate<br />to reflect the seriousness of the defendant’s criminal history, a<br />departure above the guideline range for a defendant with Criminal<br />History Category VI may be warranted. In determining whether an<br />upward departure from Criminal History Category VI is warranted,<br />the court should consider that the nature of the prior offenses rather<br />than simply their number is often more indicative of the seriousness<br />of the defendant’s criminal record. For example, a defendant with<br />five prior sentences for very large-scale fraud offenses may have 15<br />criminal history points, within the range of points typical for<br />Criminal History Category VI, yet have a substantially more<br />serious criminal history overall because of the nature of the prior<br />offenses.<br />3. Downward Departures.—A downward departure from the defendant’s<br />criminal history category may be warranted if, for example, the defendant<br />had two minor misdemeanor convictions close to ten years prior to the<br />instant offense and no other evidence of prior criminal behavior in the<br />intervening period. A departure below the lower limit of the applicable<br />guideline range for Criminal History Category I is prohibited under<br />subsection (b)(2)(B), due to the fact that the lower limit of the guideline<br />Amendment 651 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003<br /><br />range for Criminal History Category I is set for a first offender with the<br />lowest risk of recidivism.<br />Background: This policy statement recognizes that the criminal history score is<br />unlikely to take into account all the variations in the seriousness of criminal history<br />that may occur.

Grounds for Departure (Policy Statement)<br />(a) DOWNWARD DEPARTURES IN CRIMINAL CASES<br />OTHER THAN CHILD CRIMES AND SEXUAL<br />OFFENSES.—Under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(b), the sentencing<br />court may impose a sentence outside the range established<br />by the applicable guidelines, if the court finds ‘that there<br />exists an aggravating or mitigating circumstance of a kind,<br />or to a degree, not adequately taken into consideration by<br />the Sentencing Commission in formulating the guidelines<br />that should result in a sentence different from that<br />described.’ Circumstances that may warrant departure<br />from the guideline range pursuant to this provision cannot,<br />by their very nature, be comprehensively listed and<br />analyzed in advance. The decision as to whether and to<br />what extent departure is warranted rests with the<br />sentencing court on a case-specific basis. Nonetheless, this<br />subpart seeks to aid the court by identifying some of the<br />factors that the Commission has not been able to take into<br />account fully in formulating the guidelines. Any case may<br />involve factors in addition to those identified that have not<br />been given adequate consideration by the Commission.<br />Presence of any such factor may warrant departure from<br />the guidelines, under some circumstances, in the discretion<br />of the sentencing court. Similarly, the court may depart<br />from the guidelines, even though the reason for departure<br />is taken into consideration in determining the guideline<br />range (e.g., as a specific offense characteristic or other<br />adjustment), if the court determines that, in light of unusual<br />Amendment 651 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003<br /><br />circumstances, the weight attached to that factor under the<br />guidelines is inadequate or excessive.<br />Where, for example, the applicable offense guideline and<br />adjustments do take into consideration a factor listed in this<br />subpart, departure from the applicable guideline range is<br />warranted only if the factor is present to a degree<br />substantially in excess of that which ordinarily is involved<br />in the offense. Thus, disruption of a governmental<br />function, &#167;5K2.7, would have to be quite serious to<br />warrant departure from the guidelines when the applicable<br />offense guideline is bribery or obstruction of justice.<br />When the theft offense guideline is applicable, however,<br />and the theft caused disruption of a governmental function,<br />departure from the applicable guideline range more readily<br />would be appropriate. Similarly, physical injury would not<br />warrant departure from the guidelines when the robbery<br />offense guideline is applicable because the robbery<br />guideline includes a specific adjustment based on the<br />extent of any injury. However, because the robbery<br />guideline does not deal with injury to more than one<br />victim, departure would be warranted if several persons<br />were injured.<br />Also, a factor may be listed as a specific offense<br />characteristic under one guideline but not under all<br />guidelines. Simply because it was not listed does not mean<br />that there may not be circumstances when that factor<br />would be relevant to sentencing. For example, the use of<br />a weapon has been listed as a specific offense<br />characteristic under many guidelines, but not under other<br />guidelines. Therefore, if a weapon is a relevant factor to<br />sentencing under one of these other guidelines, the court<br />may depart for this reason.<br />Finally, an offender characteristic or other circumstance<br />that is, in the Commission’s view, ‘not ordinarily relevant’<br />in determining whether a sentence should be outside the<br />applicable guideline range may be relevant to this<br />determination if such characteristic or circumstance is<br />present to an unusual degree and distinguishes the case<br />from the ‘heartland’ cases covered by the guidelines.<br />(b) DOWNWARD DEPARTURES IN CHILD CRIMES<br />AND SEXUAL OFFENSES.—Under 18 U.S.C. &#167;<br />3553(b)(2), the sentencing court may impose a sentence<br />below the range established by the applicable guidelines<br />only if the court finds that there exists a mitigating<br />circumstance of a kind, or to a degree, that—<br />November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II Amendment 651<br /><br />(1) has been affirmatively and specifically identified<br />as a permissible ground of downward departure in<br />the sentencing guidelines or policy statements<br />issued under section 994(a) of title 28, United<br />States Code, taking account of any amendments to<br />such sentencing guidelines or policy statements by<br />act of Congress;<br />(2) has not adequately been taken into consideration<br />by the Sentencing Commission in formulating the<br />guidelines; and<br />(3) should result in a sentence different from that<br />described.<br />The grounds enumerated in this Part K of Chapter Five are<br />the sole grounds that have been affirmatively and<br />specifically identified as a permissible ground of<br />downward departure in these sentencing guidelines and<br />policy statements.

That directive has not been implemented yet in the following<br />commentary.]<br />The United States Supreme Court has determined that, in reviewing a<br />district court’s decision to depart from the guidelines, appellate courts are to apply<br />an abuse of discretion standard, because the decision to depart embodies the<br />traditional exercise of discretion by the sentencing court.

Furthermore,‘[b]efore a departure is permitted, certain aspects of<br />the case must be found unusual enough for it to fall outside the heartland of cases<br />in the Guideline. To resolve this question, the district court must make a refined<br />assessment of the many facts bearing on the outcome, informed by its vantage point<br />and day-to-day experience in criminal sentencing. Whether a given factor is present<br />to a degree not adequately considered by the Commission, or whether a discouraged<br />factor nonetheless justifies departure because it is present in some unusual or<br />exceptional way, are matters determined in large part by comparison with the facts<br />of other Guidelines cases. District Courts have an institutional advantage over<br />Amendment 651 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003<br /><br />appellate courts in making these sorts of determinations, especially as they see so<br />many more Guidelines cases than appellate courts do.’ Id. at 98.<br />The last paragraph of subsection (a) sets forth the conditions under which<br />an offender characteristic or other circumstance that is not ordinarily relevant to a<br />departure from the applicable guideline range may be relevant to this determination.<br />The Commission does not foreclose the possibility of an extraordinary case that,<br />because of a combination of such characteristics or circumstances, differs<br />significantly from the "heartland" cases covered by the guidelines in a way that is<br />important to the statutory purposes of sentencing, even though none of the<br />characteristics or circumstances individually distinguishes the case. However, the<br />Commission believes that such cases will be extremely rare.<br />In the absence of a characteristic or circumstance that distinguishes a case<br />as sufficiently atypical to warrant a sentence different from that called for under the<br />guidelines, a sentence outside the guideline range is not authorized. See 18 U.S.C.<br />&#167; 3553(b).

Scope of this Policy Statement.—<br />(A) Departures Covered by this Policy Statement.—This policy<br />statement covers departures from the applicable guideline range<br />based on offense characteristics or offender characteristics of a<br />kind, or to a degree, not adequately taken into consideration in<br />determining that range. See 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(b).<br />Subsection (a) of this policy statement applies to upward departures<br />in all cases covered by the guidelines and to downward departures<br />in all such cases except for downward departures in child crimes<br />and sexual offenses.<br />Subsection (b) of this policy statement applies only to downward<br />departures in child crimes and sexual offenses.<br />(B) Departures Covered by Other Guidelines.—This policy statement<br />November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II Amendment 651<br /><br />does not cover the following departures, which are addressed<br />elsewhere in the guidelines: (i) departures based on the defendant’s<br />criminal history (see Chapter Four (Criminal History and Criminal<br />Livelihood), particularly &#167;4A1.3 (Departures Based on Inadequacy<br />of Criminal History Category)); (ii) departures based on the<br />defendant’s substantial assistance to the authorities (see &#167;5K1.1<br />(Substantial Assistance to Authorities)); and (iii) departures based<br />on early disposition programs (see &#167;5K3.1 (Early Disposition<br />Programs)).<br />3. Kinds and Expected Frequency of Departures under Subsection (a).—As set<br />forth in subsection (a), there generally are two kinds of departures from the<br />guidelines based on offense characteristics and/or offender characteristics:<br />(A) departures based on circumstances of a kind not adequately taken into<br />consideration in the guidelines; and (B) departures based on circumstances<br />that are present to a degree not adequately taken into consideration in the<br />guidelines.<br />(A) Departures Based on Circumstances of a Kind Not Adequately<br />Taken into Account in Guidelines.—Subsection (a)(2) authorizes<br />the court to depart if there exists an aggravating or a mitigating<br />circumstance in a case under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(b)(1), or an<br />aggravating circumstance in a case under 18 U.S.C. &#167;<br />3553(b)(2)(A)(i), of a kind not adequately taken into consideration<br />in the guidelines.<br />(i) Identified Circumstances.—This subpart (Chapter Five,<br />Part K, Subpart 2) identifies several circumstances that the<br />Commission may have not adequately taken into<br />consideration in setting the offense level for certain cases.<br />Offense guidelines in Chapter Two (Offense Conduct) and<br />adjustments in Chapter Three (Adjustments) sometimes<br />identify circumstances the Commission may have not<br />adequately taken into consideration in setting the offense<br />level for offenses covered by those guidelines. If the<br />offense guideline in Chapter Two or an adjustment in<br />Chapter Three does not adequately take that circumstance<br />into consideration in setting the offense level for the<br />offense, and only to the extent not adequately taken into<br />consideration, a departure based on that circumstance may<br />be warranted.<br />(ii) Unidentified Circumstances.—A case may involve<br />circumstances, in addition to those identified by the<br />guidelines, that have not adequately been taken into<br />consideration by the Commission, and the presence of any<br />such circumstance may warrant departure from the<br />guidelines in that case. However, inasmuch as the<br />Commission has continued to monitor and refine the<br />guidelines since their inception to take into consideration<br />Amendment 651 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003<br /><br />relevant circumstances in sentencing, it is expected that<br />departures based on such unidentified circumstances will<br />occur rarely and only in exceptional cases.<br />(B) Departures Based on Circumstances Present to a Degree Not<br />Adequately Taken into Consideration in Guidelines.—<br />(i) In General.—Subsection (a)(3) authorizes the court to<br />depart if there exists an aggravating or a mitigating<br />circumstance in a case under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(b)(1), or an<br />aggravating circumstance in a case under 18 U.S.C. &#167;<br />3553(b)(2)(A)(i), to a degree not adequately taken into<br />consideration in the guidelines. However, inasmuch as the<br />Commission has continued to monitor and refine the<br />guidelines since their inception to determine the most<br />appropriate weight to be accorded the mitigating and<br />aggravating circumstances specified in the guidelines, it is<br />expected that departures based on the weight accorded to<br />any such circumstance will occur rarely and only in<br />exceptional cases.<br />(ii) Examples.—As set forth in subsection (a)(3), if the<br />applicable offense guideline and adjustments take into<br />consideration a circumstance identified in this subpart,<br />departure is warranted only if the circumstance is present<br />to a degree substantially in excess of that which ordinarily<br />is involved in the offense. Accordingly, a departure<br />pursuant to &#167;5K2.7 for the disruption of a governmental<br />function would have to be substantial to warrant departure<br />from the guidelines when the applicable offense guideline<br />is bribery or obstruction of justice. When the guideline<br />covering the mailing of injurious articles is applicable,<br />however, and the offense caused disruption of a<br />governmental function, departure from the applicable<br />guideline range more readily would be appropriate.<br />Similarly, physical injury would not warrant departure<br />from the guidelines when the robbery offense guideline is<br />applicable because the robbery guideline includes a<br />specific adjustment based on the extent of any injury.<br />However, because the robbery guideline does not deal with<br />injury to more than one victim, departure may be<br />warranted if several persons were injured.<br />(C) Departures Based on Circumstances Identified as Not Ordinarily<br />Relevant.—Because certain circumstances are specified in the<br />guidelines as not ordinarily relevant to sentencing (see, e.g.,<br />Chapter Five, Part H (Specific Offender Characteristics)), a<br />departure based on any one of such circumstances should occur<br />only in exceptional cases, and only if the circumstance is present in<br />the case to an exceptional degree. If two or more of such<br />November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II Amendment 651<br /><br />circumstances each is present in the case to a substantial degree,<br />however, and taken together make the case an exceptional one, the<br />court may consider whether a departure would be warranted<br />pursuant to subsection (c). Departures based on a combination of<br />not ordinarily relevant circumstances that are present to a<br />substantial degree should occur extremely rarely and only in<br />exceptional cases.<br />In addition, as required by subsection (e), each circumstance<br />forming the basis for a departure described in this subdivision shall<br />be stated with specificity in the written judgment and commitment<br />order.<br />4. Downward Departures in Child Crimes and Sexual Offenses.—<br />(A) Definition.—For purposes of this policy statement, the term ‘child<br />crimes and sexual offenses’ means offenses under any of the<br />following: 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1201 (involving a minor victim), 18 U.S.C.<br />&#167; 1591, or chapter 71, 109A, 110, or 117 of title 18, United States<br />Code.<br />(B) Standard for Departure.—<br />(i) Requirement of Affirmative and Specific Identification of<br />Departure Ground.—The standard for a downward<br />departure in child crimes and sexual offenses differs from<br />the standard for other departures under this policy<br />statement in that it includes a requirement, set forth in 18<br />U.S.C. &#167; 3553(b)(2)(A)(ii)(I) and subsection (b)(1) of this<br />guideline, that any mitigating circumstance that forms the<br />basis for such a downward departure be affirmatively and<br />specifically identified as a ground for downward departure<br />in this part (i.e., Chapter Five, Part K).<br />(ii) Application of Subsection (b)(2).—The commentary in<br />Application Note 3 of this policy statement, except for the<br />commentary in Application Note 3(A)(ii) relating to<br />unidentified circumstances, shall apply to the court’s<br />determination of whether a case meets the requirement, set<br />forth in subsection 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(b)(2)(A)(ii)(II) and<br />subsection (b)(2) of this policy statement, that the<br />mitigating circumstance forming the basis for a downward<br />departure in child crimes and sexual offenses be of kind, or<br />to a degree, not adequately taken into consideration by the<br />Commission.<br />5. Departures Based on Plea Agreements.—Subsection (d)(4) prohibits a<br />downward departure based only on the defendant’s decision, in and of<br />itself, to plead guilty to the offense or to enter a plea agreement with respect<br />to the offense. Even though a departure may not be based merely on the<br />Amendment 651 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003<br /><br />fact that the defendant agreed to plead guilty or enter a plea agreement, a<br />departure may be based on justifiable, non-prohibited reasons for departure<br />as part of a sentence that is recommended, or agreed to, in the plea<br />agreement and accepted by the court. See &#167;6B1.2 (Standards for<br />Acceptance of Plea Agreements). In cases in which the court departs based<br />on such reasons as set forth in the plea agreement, the court must state the<br />reasons for departure with specificity in the written judgment and<br />commitment order, as required by subsection (e).<br />Background: This policy statement sets forth the standards for departing from the<br />applicable guideline range based on offense and offender characteristics of a kind,<br />or to a degree, not adequately considered by the Commission. Circumstances the<br />Commission has determined are not ordinarily relevant to determining whether a<br />departure is warranted or are prohibited as bases for departure are addressed in<br />Chapter Five, Part H (Offender Characteristics) and in this policy statement. Other<br />departures, such as those based on the defendant’s criminal history, the defendant’s<br />substantial assistance to authorities, and early disposition programs, are addressed<br />elsewhere in the guidelines.<br />As acknowledged by Congress in the Sentencing Reform Act and by the<br />Commission when the first set of guidelines was promulgated, ‘it is difficult to<br />prescribe a single set of guidelines that encompasses the vast range of human<br />conduct potentially relevant to a sentencing decision.’ (See Historical Note to<br />&#167;1A1.1 (Authority)). Departures, therefore, perform an integral function in the<br />sentencing guideline system. Departures permit courts to impose an appropriate<br />sentence in the exceptional case in which mechanical application of the guidelines<br />would fail to achieve the statutory purposes and goals of sentencing. Departures<br />also help maintain ‘sufficient flexibility to permit individualized sentences when<br />warranted by mitigating or aggravating factors not taken into account in the<br />establishment of general sentencing practices.’ 28 U.S.C. &#167; 991(b)(1)(B). By<br />monitoring when courts depart from the guidelines and by analyzing their stated<br />reasons for doing so, along with appellate cases reviewing these departures, the<br />Commission can further refine the guidelines to specify more precisely when<br />departures should and should not be permitted.<br />As reaffirmed in the Prosecutorial Remedies and Other Tools to end the<br />Exploitation of Children Today Act of 2003 (the ‘PROTECT Act’, Public Law<br />108–21), circumstances warranting departure should be rare. Departures were never<br />intended to permit sentencing courts to substitute their policy judgments for those<br />of Congress and the Sentencing Commission. Departure in such circumstances<br />would produce unwarranted sentencing disparity, which the Sentencing Reform Act<br />was designed to avoid.<br />In order for appellate courts to fulfill their statutory duties under 18 U.S.C.<br />&#167; 3742 and for the Commission to fulfill its ongoing responsibility to refine the<br />guidelines in light of information it receives on departures, it is essential that<br />sentencing courts state with specificity the reasons for departure, as required by the<br />PROTECT Act.<br />This policy statement, including its commentary, was substantially revised,<br />November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II Amendment 651<br /><br />effective October 27, 2003, in response to directives contained in the PROTECT<br />Act, particularly the directive in section 401(m) of that Act to—<br />‘(1) review the grounds of downward departure that are authorized by the<br />sentencing guidelines, policy statements, and official commentary of the Sentencing<br />Commission; and<br />(2) promulgate, pursuant to section 994 of title 28, United States Code—<br />(A) appropriate amendments to the sentencing guidelines, policy<br />statements, and official commentary to ensure that the incidence of<br />downward departures is substantially reduced;<br />(B) a policy statement authorizing a departure pursuant to an early<br />disposition program; and<br />(C) any other conforming amendments to the sentencing guidelines,<br />policy statements, and official commentary of the Sentencing<br />Commission necessitated by the Act, including a revision of<br />...section 5K2.0’.<br />The substantial revision of this policy statement in response to the<br />PROTECT Act was intended to refine the standards applicable to departures while<br />giving due regard for concepts, such as the ‘heartland’, that have evolved in<br />departure jurisprudence over time.<br />Section 401(b)(1) of the PROTECT Act directly amended this policy<br />statement to add subsection (b), effective April 30, 2003.";<br />by striking:<br />"&#167;5K2.10. Victim’s Conduct (Policy Statement)<br />If the victim’s wrongful conduct contributed significantly to<br />provoking the offense behavior, the court may reduce the sentence<br />below the guideline range to reflect the nature and circumstances<br />of the offense. In deciding the extent of a sentence reduction, the<br />court should consider:<br />(a) the size and strength of the victim, or other relevant<br />physical characteristics, in comparison with those of the<br />defendant;<br />(b) the persistence of the victim’s conduct and any efforts by<br />the defendant to prevent confrontation;<br />(c) the danger reasonably perceived by the defendant,<br />including the victim’s reputation for violence;<br />(d) the danger actually presented to the defendant by the<br />victim; and<br />(e) any other relevant conduct by the victim that substantially<br />contributed to the danger presented.<br />Amendment 651 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003<br /><br />Victim misconduct ordinarily would not be sufficient to warrant<br />application of this provision in the context of offenses under<br />Chapter Two, Part A.3 (Criminal Sexual Abuse).

There may, however, be unusual circumstances<br />in which substantial victim misconduct would warrant a reduced<br />penalty in the case of a non-violent offense.

Coercion and Duress (Policy Statement)<br />If the defendant committed the offense because of serious coercion,<br />blackmail or duress, under circumstances not amounting to a<br />complete defense, the court may decrease the sentence below the<br />applicable guideline range.

EARLY DISPOSITION PROGRAMS<br />&#167;5K3.1. Early Disposition Programs (Policy Statement)<br />Upon motion of the Government, the court may depart downward<br />not more than 4 levels pursuant to an early disposition program<br />authorized by the Attorney General of the United States and the<br />Amendment 651 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003<br /><br />United States Attorney for the district in which the court resides.<br />Commentary<br />Background: This policy statement implements the directive to the Commission in<br />section 401(m)(2)(B) of the Prosecutorial Remedies and Other Tools to end the<br />Exploitation of Children Today Act of 2003 (the ‘PROTECT Act’, Public Law<br />108–21).".<br />Section 6B1.2 is amended in subsection (a) by striking "[Rule 11(e)(1)(A)]" and inserting<br />"(Rule 11(c)(1)(A))".<br />Section 6B1.2 is amended in subsection (b) by striking "[Rule 11(e)(1)(B)]" and inserting<br />"(Rule 11(c)(1)(B))"; and by striking subdivision (2) as follows:<br />"(2) the recommended sentence departs from the applicable guideline range for<br />justifiable reasons.",<br />and inserting the following:<br />"(2) (A) the recommended sentence departs from the applicable guideline range<br />for justifiable reasons; and (B) those reasons are specifically set forth in<br />writing in the statement of reasons or judgment and commitment order.".<br />Section 6B1.2 is amended in subsection (c) by striking "[Rule 11(e)(1)(C)]" and inserting<br />"(Rule 11(c)(1)(C))"; and by striking subdivision (2) as follows:<br />"(2) the agreed sentence departs from the applicable guideline range for<br />justifiable reasons.",<br />and inserting the following:<br />"(2) (A) the agreed sentence departs from the applicable guideline range for<br />justifiable reasons; and (B) those reasons are specifically set forth in writing<br />in the statement of reasons or judgment and commitment order.".<br />The Commentary to &#167;6B1.2 is amended in the second paragraph by striking ". See generally<br />Chapter 1, Part A, Subpart 4(b)(Departures)." and inserting "and those reasons are<br />specifically set forth in writing in the statement of reasons or the judgment and commitment<br />order. As set forth in subsection (d) of &#167;5K2.0 (Grounds for Departure), however, the court<br />may not depart below the applicable guideline range merely because of the defendant’s<br />decision to plead guilty to the offense or to enter a plea agreement with respect to the<br />offense.".</td><td>Reason for Amendment: This emergency amendment continues the Commission’s work<br />in the area of departures and implements the directive in section 401(m) of the "Prosecutorial<br />Remedies and Other Tools to end the Exploitation of Children Today Act of 2003" or<br />"PROTECT Act," Pub. L. 108–21. The PROTECT Act was enacted on April 30, 2003, and<br />directs the Commission, not later than 180 days after the enactment of the Act, to<br />promulgate: (1) appropriate amendments to the sentencing guidelines, policy statements, and<br />November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II Amendment 651<br /><br />official commentary to ensure that the incidence of downward departures is substantially<br />reduced; (2) a policy statement authorizing a downward departure of not more than 4 levels<br />if the Government files a motion for such departure pursuant to an early disposition program<br />authorized by the Attorney General and the United States Attorney for the district in which<br />the court resides; (3) any other necessary conforming amendments, including a revision of<br />paragraph 4(b) of Part A of Chapter One and a revision of &#167;5K2.0 (Grounds for Departure).<br />The analysis underlying this amendment will be set forth more fully in a forthcoming report<br />to Congress.<br />The Commission anticipates that this amendment will substantially reduce the incidence of<br />downward departures by prohibiting several factors as grounds for departure, restricting the<br />availability of certain departures, clarifying when certain departures are appropriate, and<br />limiting the extent of departure permissible for certain offenders. The amendment also<br />reduces the incidence of downward departures generally by restructuring departure<br />provisions throughout the Guidelines Manual to track more closely both the statutory criteria<br />for imposing a sentence outside the guideline sentencing range and the newly enacted<br />statutory requirement that reasons for departure be stated with specificity in the written order<br />of judgment and commitment. See 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 3553 (Imposition of a sentence), 3742(e)<br />(Review of a sentence). The Commission determined that requiring sentencing courts to<br />document reasons for departure with greater specificity complements the findings required<br />of sentencing courts by the PROTECT Act, increases the accountability of sentencing courts<br />for departures by facilitating appellate review, and improves the Commission’s ability to<br />monitor departure decisions and refine the guidelines as necessary.<br />The eight-part amendment makes modifications to &#167;&#167;5K2.0 (Grounds for Departure), 5H1.4<br />(Physical Condition, Including Drug or Alcohol Dependence or Abuse; Gambling<br />Addiction), 5H1.6 (Family Ties and Responsibilities), 5H1.7 (Role in the Offense), 5H1.8<br />(Criminal History), 5K2.10 (Victim’s Conduct), 5K2.12 (Coercion and Duress), 5K2.13<br />(Diminished Capacity), 5K2.20 (Aberrant Behavior), 4A1.3 (Departures Based on<br />Inadequacy of Criminal History Category), and 6B1.2 (Standards for Acceptance of Plea<br />Agreements). The amendment also creates one new policy statement, &#167;5K3.1 (Early<br />Disposition Programs), and one new guideline, &#167;1A1.1 (Authority), among other changes.<br />First, this amendment makes several significant modifications to &#167;5K2.0 (Grounds for<br />Departure) to limit, and in certain circumstances, to prohibit downward departures. The<br />amendment generally restructures &#167;5K2.0 to set forth more clearly the standards governing<br />departures in order to facilitate and emphasize the analysis required of the court. The<br />amendment does so by: (1) integrating throughout the policy statement the statutory<br />language of 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 3553(b) and 3742(e), as amended by the PROTECT Act, which<br />provide the statutory criteria for sentencing outside the guideline range; (2) adopting, when<br />provided in the policy statement, a uniform qualitative description of the type of case in<br />which a departure may be warranted, the “exceptional case”; (3) restating in the application<br />notes and background commentary to &#167;5K2.0 longstanding commentary in the Guidelines<br />Manual, which was reaffirmed by the PROTECT Act, that the frequency of departures under<br />&#167;5K2.0 generally should be rare, and that certain types of departures under &#167;5K2.0 should<br />be extremely rare; and (4) deleting certain language in the commentary taken from Koon v.<br />United States, 518 U.S. 81 (1996) that effectively was overruled by the PROTECT Act.<br />Accordingly, &#167;5K2.0(a) sets forth the general governing principle that, in cases other than<br />child crimes and sexual offenses, the sentencing court may depart if the court finds pursuant<br />Amendment 651 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003<br /><br />to 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(b)(1) that there exists an aggravating or mitigating circumstance of a<br />kind, or to a degree, not adequately taken into consideration by the Sentencing Commission<br />that, in order to advance the objectives set forth in 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(a)(2), should result in<br />a sentence different from a sentence within the applicable guideline range.<br />The amendment also prohibits several grounds for departure, in addition to the departure<br />prohibitions in &#167;5K2.0 for child crimes and sexual offenses enacted by the PROTECT Act,<br />and other prohibitions elsewhere in the Guidelines Manual. The amendment creates a new<br />subsection, &#167;5K2.0(d), that clearly lists the forbidden departure grounds. These include<br />several longstanding prohibitions, as well as a number of new prohibitions added by the<br />amendment, specifically: (1) the defendant’s acceptance of responsibility; (2) the<br />defendant’s aggravating or mitigating role in the offense; (3) the defendant’s decision, in<br />itself, to plead guilty to the offense or to enter into a plea agreement with respect to the<br />offense; and (4) the defendant’s fulfillment of restitution only to the extent required by law,<br />including the guidelines. The Commission determined that these circumstances are never<br />appropriate grounds for departure.<br />The amendment also revises &#167;5K2.0 to restrict the availability of departures based on<br />multiple circumstances, often referred to as a “combination of factors.” The Commission<br />determined that heightened criteria are appropriate for cases in which no single offender<br />characteristic or other circumstance independently is sufficient to provide a basis for<br />departure. Under &#167;5K2.0(c) a departure based on multiple circumstances can be based only<br />on offender characteristics or other circumstances that are identified in the guidelines as<br />permissible grounds for departure. Circumstances unmentioned in the guidelines, therefore,<br />can no longer be used for a departure based on multiple circumstances pursuant to<br />&#167;5K2.0(c). In addition, in order to support a departure based on a combination of<br />circumstances, each offender characteristic or other circumstance must be present<br />individually to a substantial degree and must make the case exceptional when considered<br />together. Emphasizing the Commission’s expectation as to the infrequency of such<br />departures, the accompanying application note retains previously existing guidance and<br />states that departures under &#167;5K2.0(c) based on a combination of not ordinarily relevant<br />circumstances should occur extremely rarely.<br />In addition, the amendment clarifies when a departure may be based on a circumstance<br />present to a degree not adequately taken into consideration. Section 5K2.0(a)(3) provides<br />that a departure may be warranted in an exceptional case, even though the circumstance that<br />forms the basis for the departure is taken into consideration, only if the court determines that<br />such circumstance is present to a degree substantially different from that ordinarily involved<br />in that kind of offense.<br />The amendment also modifies &#167;5K2.0 in two additional ways to underscore the need for<br />courts to state with specificity their reasons for departure. First, &#167;5K2.0(e) provides that if<br />the court departs, it shall state, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(c), as amended by the<br />PROTECT Act, its specific reasons for departure in open court at the time of sentencing and,<br />with limited exception in the case of statements received in camera, shall state those factors<br />with specificity in the written judgment and commitment order. Second, Application Note<br />5 provides that in cases in which the court departs based on reasons set forth in a plea<br />agreement, the court must state the reasons for departure with specificity in the written<br />judgment and commitment order.<br />November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II Amendment 651<br /><br />Second, the amendment limits several departure provisions in Chapter Five, Part H (Specific<br />Offender Characteristics). First, the amendment adds a prohibition to &#167;5H1.4 (Physical<br />Condition, Including Drug or Alcohol Dependence or Abuse; Gambling Addiction) against<br />departures based on addiction to gambling and renames the policy statement accordingly.<br />The Commission determined that addiction to gambling is never a relevant ground for<br />departure.<br />The amendment limits the availability of departures pursuant to &#167;5H1.6 (Family Ties and<br />Responsibilities) by requiring the court to conduct certain more rigorous analyses. In<br />determining whether a departure is warranted under this policy statement, a new application<br />note instructs the court to consider the seriousness of the offense; the involvement in the<br />offense, if any, of members of the defendant’s family; and the danger, if any to members of<br />the defendant’s immediate family as a result of the offense.<br />In addition to considering those factors, the amendment further restricts family ties<br />departures by adding an application note that establishes heightened criteria for departures<br />based on loss of caretaking or financial support. In such cases, the court must find all of the<br />following four circumstances: (1) that a sentence within the applicable guideline range will<br />cause a substantial, direct, and specific loss of essential caretaking or essential financial<br />support to the defendant’s family; (2) that such loss exceeds the harm ordinarily incident to<br />incarceration; (3) that there are no effective remedial or ameliorative programs reasonably<br />available, making the defendant’s caretaking or financial support irreplaceable to the<br />defendant’s family; and (4) that the departure effectively will address the loss of caretaking<br />or financial support. The Commission determined that these heightened criteria are<br />appropriate and necessary in order to distinguish hardship or suffering that is ordinarily<br />incident to incarceration from that which is exceptional.<br />The amendment also eliminates community ties as a separate ground for departure and<br />renames &#167;5H1.6 accordingly.<br />The amendment makes conforming modifications to &#167;5H1.7 (Role in the Offense),<br />reiterating that a defendant’s role in the offense is not a basis for departure, and to &#167;5H1.8<br />(Criminal History), providing that the only grounds for departure based on the defendant’s<br />criminal history are set forth in &#167;4A1.3 (Departures Based on Inadequacy of Criminal<br />History Category).<br />Third, the amendment limits several departure provisions in Chapter Five, Part K<br />(Departures). The amendment adds a factor to &#167;5K2.10 (Victim’s Conduct) that the court<br />should consider when determining whether a departure is warranted based on victim’s<br />conduct. The amendment provides that, in addition to five previously existing factors, the<br />court should consider the proportionality and reasonableness of the defendant’s response to<br />the victim’s provocation.<br />The amendment adds a similar factor to &#167;5K2.12 (Coercion and Duress). The amendment<br />provides that the extent of a departure based on coercion and duress ordinarily should<br />depend on several considerations, including the proportionality of the defendant’s actions<br />to the seriousness of the coercion, blackmail, or duress involved.<br />The amendment limits the availability of departures pursuant to &#167;5K2.13 (Diminished<br />Capacity) by adding a causation element. The amendment provides that in order to receive<br />Amendment 651 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003<br /><br />a departure for diminished capacity, the significantly reduced mental capacity must have<br />contributed substantially to the commission of the offense. The amendment similarly limits<br />the extent of departure by stating that the extent of the departure should reflect the extent to<br />which the reduced mental capacity contributed to the commission of the offense.<br />The amendment significantly restructures &#167;5K2.20 (Aberrant Behavior) and further restricts<br />the availability of departures based on aberrant behavior. The Commission promulgated<br />&#167;5K2.20 effective November 1, 2000, in order to resolve a longstanding circuit conflict and<br />more properly define when a departure based on aberrant behavior may be warranted. See<br />Appendix C, amendment 603. A departure based on aberrant behavior may be warranted<br />only if the defendant committed a single criminal occurrence or single criminal transaction<br />that (1) was without significant planning; (2) was of limited duration; and (3) represents a<br />marked deviation by the defendant from an otherwise law-abiding life.<br />The amendment provides greater emphasis to these strict requirements by moving them from<br />an application note to the body of the policy statement. The amendment also gives the court<br />greater guidance in applying these requirements with a new application note that clarifies<br />that repetitious or significant, planned behavior does not meet the requirements for receiving<br />a departure under &#167;5K2.20. A fraud scheme, for example, generally would be prohibited<br />from receiving a departure pursuant to &#167;5K2.20 because such a scheme usually involves<br />repetitive acts, rather than a single occurrence or single criminal transaction, as well as<br />significant planning.<br />The amendment also further restricts the availability of departures based on aberrant<br />behavior by adding several strict prohibitions to the list that has existed in &#167;5K2.20 since its<br />initial promulgation. Prior to this amendment, &#167;5K2.20 prohibited the court from departing<br />based on aberrant behavior if (1) the offense involved serious bodily injury or death; (2) the<br />defendant discharged a firearm or otherwise used a firearm or a dangerous weapon; (3) the<br />instant offense of conviction is a serious drug trafficking offense; (4) the defendant has more<br />than one criminal history point, as determined under Chapter Four (Criminal History and<br />Criminal Livelihood); or (5) the defendant has a prior federal, or state, felony conviction,<br />regardless of whether the conviction is countable under Chapter Four.<br />The amendment gives greater prominence to those previously existing prohibitions and<br />expands them in significant ways. The amendment eliminates defendants who have any<br />significant prior criminal behavior from consideration for a departure pursuant to &#167;5K2.20,<br />regardless of whether such behavior is countable under Chapter Four, and even if such<br />behavior is not a state or federal felony. In addition, the amendment expands the class of<br />drug trafficking defendants prohibited from consideration for a departure pursuant to<br />&#167;5K2.20 by expanding the definition of "serious drug trafficking offense." Specifically, the<br />amendment expands the definition of "serious drug trafficking offense" in the accompanying<br />application note to include any controlled substance offense under title 21, United States<br />Code, other than simple possession under 21 U.S.C. &#167; 844, that provides a mandatory<br />minimum term of imprisonment of five years or greater, regardless of whether the defendant<br />meets the criteria of &#167;5C1.2 (Limitation on Applicability of Statutory Mandatory Minimum<br />Sentences in Certain Cases). Prior to this amendment, only drug trafficking defendants who<br />were subject to such mandatory minimum penalties and who did not meet the criteria set<br />forth in &#167;5C1.2 were precluded categorically from consideration for a departure under<br />&#167;5K2.20.<br />November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II Amendment 651<br /><br />Fourth, the amendment substantially restructures &#167;4A1.3 (Departures Based on Inadequacy<br />of Criminal History Category) to set forth more clearly the standards governing departures<br />based on criminal history, to prohibit and limit the extent of departures based on criminal<br />history for certain offenders with significant criminal history, and to require written<br />specification of the basis for a criminal history departure.<br />Section 4A1.3(a) provides that an upward departure may be warranted if reliable information<br />indicates that the defendant’s criminal history category substantially under-represents the<br />seriousness of the defendant’s criminal history or the likelihood that the defendant will<br />commit other crimes. Section 4A1.3(a) also more clearly sets forth previously existing<br />guidance regarding determination of the extent of an upward departure based on criminal<br />history. Similarly, &#167;4A1.3(b) provides that a downward departure may be warranted if<br />reliable information indicates that the defendant’s criminal history category substantially<br />over-represents the seriousness of the defendant’s criminal history or the likelihood that the<br />defendant will commit other crimes.<br />The amendment, however, adds several prohibitions and limitations to the availability of<br />downward departures based on criminal history. It prohibits a downward departure based<br />on &#167;4A1.3(b) if the defendant is an armed career criminal within the meaning of &#167;4B1.3<br />(Armed Career Criminal) or a repeat and dangerous sex offender against minors within the<br />meaning of &#167;4B1.5 (Repeat and Dangerous Sex Offender Against Minors). The Commission<br />determined that such offenders should never receive a criminal history-based downward<br />departure.<br />Section 4A1.3(b) reiterates the longstanding prohibition against a departure below the lower<br />limit of the applicable guideline range for Criminal History Category I.<br />Section 4A1.3(b) also contains certain limitations on the extent of departure available under<br />this provision. Specifically, a downward departure pursuant to this section for a career<br />offender within the meaning of &#167;4B1.1 (Career Offender) may not exceed one criminal<br />history category.<br />In addition, the amendment provides that a defendant whose criminal history category is<br />Category I after receipt of a downward departure under &#167;4A1.3(b) does not meet the<br />criterion of subsection (a)(1) of &#167;5C1.2 if, before receipt of the departure, the defendant had<br />more than one criminal history point under &#167;4A1.1 (Criminal History Category). Thus, a<br />departure to Category I cannot qualify an otherwise ineligible defendant for relief from an<br />applicable mandatory minimum sentence under &#167;5C1.2, which is consistent with case law.<br />The amendment adds a new subsection, &#167;4A1.3(c), that requires the court, in departing based<br />on criminal history, to set forth in writing the specific reasons why the applicable criminal<br />history category under-represents or over-represents the seriousness of the defendant’s<br />criminal history or the likelihood that the defendant will commit other crimes. This<br />specificity requirement is consistent with the PROTECT Act and is intended to facilitate<br />both the necessary statutory and guideline departure analysis, as well as to improve the<br />Commission’s ability to refine the criminal history guidelines in light of criminal history<br />departure decisions.<br />The amendment also makes conforming modifications to &#167;4A1.1 and &#167;5C1.2.<br />Amendment 651 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003<br /><br />The amendment implements the directive at section 401(m)(2)(B) of the PROTECT Act by<br />adding a new policy statement at &#167;5K3.1 entitled Early Disposition Programs. The provision<br />restates the language contained in the directive and provides that, upon motion of the<br />Government, the court may depart downward not more than 4 levels pursuant to an early<br />disposition program authorized by the Attorney General of the United States and the United<br />States Attorney for the district in which the court resides. The Commission determined that<br />implementing the directive in this manner is appropriate at this time, pending further study<br />and monitoring of the implementation of early disposition programs.<br />The amendment revises subsections (b) and (c) of &#167;6B1.2 (Standards for Acceptance of Plea<br />Agreements) to require greater specificity in the sentencing documentation in a case<br />involving a departure either recommended or agreed to in a Rule 11(c)(1)(B) or Rule<br />11(c)(1)(C) plea agreement. Specifically, if the court accepts such a plea agreement, and the<br />recommended or agreed to sentence departs from the applicable guideline range for<br />justifiable reasons, the amendment requires the court to set forth specifically those reasons<br />in writing in the statement of reasons or judgment and commitment order. This specificity<br />requirement is consistent with the PROTECT Act and is intended to facilitate the necessary<br />statutory and guideline departure analysis, as well as to improve the Commission’s ability<br />to understand the underlying reasons for departures in cases involving plea agreements.<br />The amendment creates a new guideline, &#167;1A1.1 (Authority), that clearly sets forth the<br />Commission’s authority to promulgate guidelines, policy statements, and commentary and<br />implements the Protect Act directive requiring conforming amendments to paragraph 4(b)<br />of Part A of Chapter One. In addition, the amendment moves in toto Part A of Chapter One,<br />as in effect on November 1, 1987, to the commentary as a historical note. Part A of Chapter<br />One was an introduction to the Guidelines Manual that explained a number of policy<br />decisions made by the Commission when it promulgated the initial set of guidelines. This<br />introduction was amended occasionally between 1987 and 2003. The Commission<br />determined that in order to preserve its historical significance and context, the introduction<br />should be returned to its original form and placed in a historical note. The Commission<br />encourages review of this material. The amendment also incorporates relevant portions of<br />paragraph 4(b) of Part A of the former introduction regarding departures in the background<br />commentary to &#167;5K2.0.<br />The amendment amends &#167;1B1.1 (Application Instructions) to provide uniform definitions<br />of departure, upward departure, and downward departure.<br />The amendment also makes technical amendments to &#167;2A4.1 (Kidnapping, Abduction,<br />Unlawful Restraint).<br />This amendment complements other significant policy initiatives affecting sentencing,<br />including the statutory changes in sentencing law and guideline changes directly made by<br />the PROTECT Act, and recent policies implemented by the Department of Justice. The<br />Commission believes that these general policy changes, working together, will substantially<br />reduce the incidence of downward departures. In addition to the significant modifications<br />made by this amendment, the Commission has identified several aspects of the guidelines<br />affecting departures that it intends to continue studying during the current amendment cycle<br />and beyond, including aberrant behavior, criminal history, immigration, early disposition,<br />or "fast track," programs, and collateral consequences, among others.<br />November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II Amendment 653</td><td>Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is October 27, 2003.</td></tr><tr><td class="n">653</td><td>Amendment 653</td><td>Section 2A1.4(a)(1) is amended by striking "10" and inserting "12".<br />Section 2A1.4(a)(2) is amended by striking "14" and inserting "18".</td><td>Reason for Amendment: This amendment responds to a concern that the federal sentencing<br />guidelines do not adequately reflect the seriousness of involuntary manslaughter offenses.<br />Specifically, the Department of Justice, some members of Congress, and an ad hoc advisory<br />group formed by the Commission to address Native American sentencing guideline issues<br />expressed concern that most federal involuntary manslaughter cases involve vehicular<br />homicides, which analysis of Commission data confirmed. These commentators also<br />indicated that these offenses appear to be underpunished, particularly when compared to<br />comparable cases arising under state law. This disparity with state punishments has been<br />confirmed by studies undertaken by the Commission. In addition, Congress increased the<br />maximum statutory penalty for involuntary manslaughter from three to six years’<br />imprisonment in 1994.<br />In response to these concerns and the Commission’s analysis, this amendment increases the<br />base offense level in &#167;2A1.4(a)(2) for reckless involuntary manslaughter offenses from level<br />14 to level 18. This four level increase corresponds to an approximate 50 percent increase<br />in sentence length for these offenses. This amendment also increases the base offense level<br />in &#167;2A4.1(a)(1) for criminally negligent involuntary manslaughter offenses from level 10<br />to level 12. The two level increase represents an approximate 25 percent increase in the<br />sentence length for these offenses.</td><td>Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2003.</td></tr><tr><td class="n">654</td><td>Amendment 654</td><td>Sections 2B1.1, 2E5.3, 2J1.2, and 2T4.1, effective January 25, 2003 (see<br />USSC Guidelines Manual Appendix C (Volume II), Amendment 647), are repromulgated<br />with the following changes:<br />Section 2B1.1 is amended by striking subsection (a) as follows:<br />"(a) Base Offense Level: 6",<br />and inserting the following:<br />"(a) Base Offense Level:<br />(1) 7, if (A) the defendant was convicted of an offense referenced to<br />this guideline; and (B) that offense of conviction has a statutory<br />maximum term of imprisonment of 20 years or more; or<br />(2) 6, otherwise.".<br />Section 2B1.1(b)(12) is amended by striking "If the resulting offense level determined under<br />subdivision (A) or (B) is less than level 24, increase to level 24.";<br />and inserting after subdivision (B) the following:<br />Amendment 653 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003<br /><br />"(C) The cumulative adjustments from application of both subsections (b)(2) and<br />(b)(12)(B) shall not exceed 8 levels, except as provided in subdivision (D).<br />(D) If the resulting offense level determined under subdivision (A) or (B) is less<br />than level 24, increase to level 24.".<br />Section 2B1.1(b) is amended by striking the following:<br />"(13) If the offense involved a violation of securities law and, at the time of the<br />offense, the defendant was an officer or a director of a publicly traded<br />company, increase by 4 levels.",<br />and inserting the following:<br />"(14) If the offense involved—<br />(A) a violation of securities law and, at the time of the offense, the<br />defendant was (i) an officer or a director of a publicly traded<br />company; (ii) a registered broker or dealer, or a person associated<br />with a broker or dealer; or (iii) an investment adviser, or a person<br />associated with an investment adviser; or<br />(B) a violation of commodities law and, at the time of the offense, the<br />defendant was (i) an officer or a director of a futures commission<br />merchant or an introducing broker; (ii) a commodities trading<br />advisor; or (iii) a commodity pool operator,<br />increase by 4 levels.".<br />The Commentary to &#167;2B1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by redesignating<br />Notes 2 through 9 as Notes 3 through 10, respectively; by redesignating Notes 11 through<br />16 as Notes 13 through 18, respectively; by inserting after Note 1 the following:<br />"2.

This 2003<br />amendment also implements directives in sections 805, 905, and 1104 of the Sarbanes-Oxley<br />Act of 2002, Pub. L. 107–204 (the "Act"), by making several modifications to &#167;&#167;2B1.1<br />(Larceny, Embezzlement, and Other Forms of Theft; Offenses Involving Stolen Property;<br />Property Damage or Destruction; Fraud and Deceit; Forgery; Offenses Involving Altered or<br />Counterfeit Instruments Other than Counterfeit Bearer Obligations of the United States),<br />2J1.2 (Obstruction of Justice), and 2E5.3 (False Statements and Concealment of Facts in<br />Relation to Documents Required by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act; Failure<br />to Maintain and Falsification of Records Required by the Labor Management Reporting and<br />Disclosure Act; Destruction and Failure to Maintain Corporate Audit Records), as well as<br />conforming changes to &#167;&#167;2J1.1 (Contempt), 2J1.3 (Perjury or Subornation of Perjury;<br />Bribery of Witness), and 2T4.1 (Tax Table). The amendment also responds to increased<br />statutory penalties for existing crimes and several severely punished new crimes created by<br />the Act.<br />The directives in the Act generally pertain to serious fraud and related offenses and<br />obstruction of justice offenses. Congress gave the Commission emergency amendment<br />authority to promulgate amendments addressing, among other things, officers and directors<br />of publicly traded companies who commit fraud and related offenses, fraud offenses that<br />endanger the solvency or financial security of a substantial number of victims, fraud offenses<br />that involve significantly greater than 50 victims, and obstruction of justice offenses that<br />involve the destruction of evidence. This amendment expands upon the temporary<br />emergency amendment effective January 25, 2003, and repromulgates it as a permanent<br />amendment.<br />First, the amendment modifies the base offense level in &#167;2B1.1 to implement more fully the<br />directive contained in section 905(b)(2) of the Act to consider whether the guidelines "for<br />violations of the sections amended by this Act are sufficient to deter and punish such<br />offenses, and specifically, are adequate in view of the statutory increases in penalties<br />contained in this Act." Section 903 of the Act, for example, quadrupled the statutory<br />maximum penalties for wire fraud and mail fraud from five to 20 years’ imprisonment, while<br />section 902 made attempts and conspiracies subject to these same heightened penalties.<br />Specifically, the amendment provides a new higher alternative base offense level of level 7<br />if the defendant was convicted of an offense referenced to &#167;2B1.1 and the offense carries a<br />statutory maximum term of imprisonment of 20 years or more. The alternative base offense<br />levels are intended to calibrate better the base guideline penalty to the seriousness of the<br />wide variety of offenses referenced to that guideline, as reflected by statutory maximum<br />penalties established by Congress.<br />For those offenses to which the higher alternative base offense will apply (including wire<br />fraud and mail fraud), the effect of the amendment is to limit the availability of a probation<br />only sentence in Zone A of the sentencing table to offenses involving loss amounts of<br />$10,000 or less, assuming a two level reduction for acceptance of responsibility. Prior to the<br />amendment, a Zone A sentence was available for all offenses sentenced under &#167;2B1.1<br />involving loss amounts of $30,000 or less. Similarly, for those offenses for which the higher<br />November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II Amendment 653<br /><br />alternative base offense level will apply, the effect of the amendment is to require an<br />imprisonment sentence in Zone D for offenses involving loss amounts of more than $70,000.<br />Prior to the amendment, a Zone D sentence was required for all offenses sentenced under<br />&#167;2B1.1 involving loss amounts of more than $120,000.<br />Second, the amendment expands the loss table at &#167;2B1.1(b)(1) to punish adequately offenses<br />that cause catastrophic losses of magnitudes previously unforeseen, such as the serious<br />corporate scandals that gave rise to several portions of the Act. Prior to the emergency<br />amendment, the loss table at &#167;2B1.1(b)(1) provided sentencing enhancements in two level<br />increments up to a maximum of 26 levels for offenses in which the loss exceeded<br />$100,000,000. The amendment adds two additional loss amount categories to the table; an<br />increase of 28 levels for offenses in which the loss exceeded $200,000,000, and an increase<br />of 30 levels for offenses in which the loss exceeded $400,000,000. These additions to the<br />loss table address congressional concern regarding particularly extensive and serious fraud<br />offenses and also more fully effectuate increases in statutory maximum penalties provided<br />by the Act. The amendment also modifies the tax table in &#167;2T4.1 in a similar manner to<br />maintain the longstanding proportional relationship between the loss table in &#167;2B1.1 and the<br />tax table.<br />The amendment also adds a new factor to the general, enumerated factors that the court may<br />consider in determining the amount of loss under &#167;2B1.1(b)(1). Specifically, the amendment<br />adds the reduction in the value of equity securities or other corporate assets that resulted<br />from the offense to the list of general factors set forth in Application Note 3(C) of &#167;2B1.1.<br />This factor was added to provide courts additional guidance in determining loss in certain<br />cases, particularly in complex white collar cases.<br />Third, the amendment addresses the directive contained in section 1104(b)(5) of the Act to<br />"ensure that the guideline offense levels and enhancements under United States Sentencing<br />Guideline 2B1.1 (as in effect on the date of enactment of this Act) are sufficient for a fraud<br />offense when the number of victims adversely involved is significantly greater than 50." The<br />amendment implements this directive by expanding the existing enhancement at<br />&#167;2B1.1(b)(2) based on the number of victims involved in the offense. Prior to the<br />emergency amendment, subsection (b)(2) provided a two level enhancement if the offense<br />involved more than 10, but less than 50, victims (or was committed through mass-<br />marketing), and a four level enhancement if the offense involved 50 or more victims. The<br />amendment provides an additional two level increase, for a total of six levels, if the offense<br />involved 250 or more victims. The Commission determined that an enhancement of this<br />magnitude appropriately responds to the pertinent directive and accounts for the extensive<br />nature of, and the large scale victimization caused by, such offenses.<br />Fourth, the amendment addresses directives contained in sections 805 and 1104 of the Act<br />pertaining to securities and accounting fraud offenses and fraud offenses that endanger the<br />solvency or financial security of a substantial number of victims. Specifically, section<br />805(a)(4) directs the Commission to ensure that "a specific offense characteristic enhancing<br />sentencing is provided under United States Sentencing Guideline 2B1.1 (as in effect on the<br />date of enactment of this Act) for a fraud offense that endangers the solvency or financial<br />security of a substantial number of victims." In addition, section 1104(b)(1) directs the<br />Commission to "ensure that the sentencing guidelines and policy statements reflect the<br />serious nature of securities, pension, and accounting fraud and the need for aggressive and<br />appropriate law enforcement action to prevent such offenses." The amendment implements<br />Amendment 653 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003<br /><br />these directives by expanding the scope of the existing enhancement at &#167;2B1.1(b)(12)(B).<br />Prior to the emergency amendment, &#167;2B1.1(b)(12)(B) provided a four level enhancement<br />and a minimum offense level of level 24 if the offense substantially jeopardized the safety<br />and soundness of a financial institution. The amendment expands the scope of this<br />enhancement by providing two additional parts. The first part applies to offenses that<br />substantially endanger the solvency or financial security of an organization that, at any time<br />during the offense, was a publicly traded company or had 1,000 or more employees. The<br />addition of this part reflects the Commission’s determination that such an offense<br />undermines the public’s confidence in the securities and investment market much in the same<br />manner as an offense that jeopardizes the safety and soundness of a financial institution<br />undermines the public’s confidence in the banking system. This part also reflects the<br />likelihood that an offense that endangers the solvency or financial security of an employer<br />of this size will similarly affect a substantial number of individual victims, without requiring<br />the court to determine whether the solvency or financial security of each individual victim<br />was substantially endangered.<br />A corresponding application note for &#167;2B1.1(b)(12)(B) sets forth a non-exhaustive list of<br />factors that the court shall consider in determining whether the offense endangered the<br />solvency or financial security of a publicly traded company or an organization with 1,000<br />or more employees. The list of factors that the court shall consider when applying the new<br />enhancement includes references to insolvency, filing for bankruptcy, substantially reducing<br />the value of the company’s stock, and substantially reducing the company’s workforce. As<br />appropriate, the court may consider other factors not enumerated in the application note.<br />The amendment also modifies the application note to previously existing &#167;2B1.1(b)(12)(B),<br />the financial institutions enhancement, to be consistent structurally with the new part of the<br />enhancement. Prior to the emergency amendment, the presence of any one of the factors<br />enumerated in the application note would trigger the financial institutions enhancement<br />under &#167;2B1.1(b)(12)(B). Under the amendment, the application note to the financial<br />institutions enhancement sets forth a non-exhaustive list of factors that the court shall<br />consider in determining whether the offense substantially jeopardized the safety and<br />soundness of a financial institution. The list of factors that the court shall consider when<br />applying this enhancement includes references to insolvency, substantially reducing benefits<br />to pensioners and insureds, and an inability to refund fully any deposit, payment, or<br />investment on demand.<br />The second part added to &#167;2B1.1(b)(12)(B) by the amendment applies to offenses that<br />substantially endangered the solvency or financial security of 100 or more victims,<br />regardless of whether a publicly traded company or other organization was affected by the<br />offense. The Commission concluded that the specificity of the directive in section 805(a)(4)<br />required an enhancement focused specifically on conduct that endangers the financial<br />security of individual victims. Thus, use of this part of the enhancement will be appropriate<br />in cases in which there is sufficient evidence for the court to determine that the amount of<br />loss suffered by individual victims of the offense substantially endangered the solvency or<br />financial security of those victims. The Commission also determined that the enhancement<br />provided in &#167;2B1.1(b)(12)(B) shall apply cumulatively with the enhancement at<br />&#167;2B1.1(b)(2), which is based solely on the number of victims involved in the offense, to<br />reflect the particularly acute harm suffered by victims of offenses to which the new parts of<br />subsection (b)(12)(B) apply. To account for the overlapping nature of such conduct in some<br /><br />cases, however, the Commission added a provision at subsection (b)(12)(C) that limits the<br />cumulative impact of subsections (b)(2) and (b)(12)(B) to eight levels, except for application<br />of the minimum offense level of level 24.<br />Fifth, the amendment addresses the directive contained at section 1104(a)(2) of the Act to<br />"consider the promulgation of new sentencing guidelines or amendments to existing<br />sentencing guidelines to provide an enhancement for officers or directors of publicly traded<br />corporations who commit fraud and related offenses." The emergency amendment<br />implemented this directive by providing a new, four level enhancement that applies if the<br />offense involved a violation of securities law and, at the time of the offense, the defendant<br />was an officer or director of a publicly traded company.<br />The amendment expands the scope of this enhancement to cover registered brokers and<br />dealers, associated persons of a broker or dealer, investment advisers, and associated persons<br />of an investment adviser. The amendment also expands the scope of this enhancement to<br />apply if the offense involves a violation of commodities law and, at the time of the offense,<br />the defendant was an officer or director of a futures commission merchant or introducing<br />broker, a commodities trading advisor, or a commodity pool operator. The Commission<br />concluded that a four level enhancement appropriately reflects the culpability of offenders<br />who occupy such positions and who are subject to heightened fiduciary duties imposed by<br />securities law or commodities law similar to duties imposed on officers and directors of<br />publicly traded corporations. Accordingly, the court is not required to determine specifically<br />whether the defendant abused a position of trust in order for the enhancement to apply, and<br />a corresponding application note provides that, in cases in which the new, four level<br />enhancement applies, the existing two level enhancement for abuse of position of trust at<br />&#167;3B1.3 (Abuse of Position of Trust or Use of Special Skill) shall not apply.<br />The corresponding application note also expressly provides that the enhancement would<br />apply regardless of whether the defendant was convicted under a specific securities fraud or<br />commodities fraud statute (e.g., 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1348, a new offense created by the Act<br />specifically prohibiting securities fraud) or under a general fraud statute (e.g., 18 U.S.C.<br />&#167; 1341, prohibiting mail fraud), provided that the offense involved a violation of "securities<br />law" or "commodities law" as defined in the application note.<br />Sixth, the amendment modifies &#167;2J1.2 to address the directives pertaining to obstruction of<br />justice offenses contained in sections 805 and 1104 of the Act. Specifically, section 805(a)<br />of the Act directs the Commission to ensure that the base offense level and existing<br />enhancements in &#167;2J1.2 are sufficient to deter and punish obstruction of justice offenses<br />generally, and specifically are adequate in cases involving the destruction, alteration, or<br />fabrication of a large amount of evidence, a large number of participants, the selection of<br />evidence that is particularly probative or essential to the investigation, more than minimal<br />planning, or abuse of a special skill or a position of trust. Section 1104(b) of the Act further<br />directs the Commission to ensure that the "guideline offense levels and enhancements for an<br />obstruction of justice offense are adequate in cases where documents or other physical<br />evidence are actually destroyed or fabricated."<br />The amendment implements these directives by making two modifications to &#167;2J1.2. First,<br />the amendment increases the base offense level in &#167;2J1.2 from level 12 to level 14. Second,<br />the amendment adds a new two level enhancement to &#167;2J1.2. This enhancement applies if<br />the offense (1) involved the destruction, alteration, or fabrication of a substantial number of<br />Amendment 653 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003<br /><br />records, documents or tangible objects; (2) involved the selection of any essential or<br />especially probative record, document, or tangible object to destroy or alter; or (3) was<br />otherwise extensive in scope, planning, or preparation. The amendment also adds an upward<br />departure provision for offenses sentenced under &#167;2J1.2 that involve extreme acts of<br />violence, for example, retaliating against a government witness by throwing acid in the<br />witness’s face. The Commission determined that existing adjustments in Chapter Three for<br />aggravating role, &#167;3B1.1, and abuse of position of trust or use of special skill, &#167;3B1.3,<br />adequately account for those particular factors described in section 805(a) of the Act.<br />Seventh, the amendment also increases the base offense level in the perjury guideline,<br />&#167;2J1.3, from level 12 to level 14 in order to maintain the longstanding proportional<br />relationship between the offense levels provided in the guidelines for perjury and obstruction<br />of justice.<br />Eighth, the amendment addresses new offenses created by the Act. Section 1520 of title 18,<br />United States Code, relating to destruction of corporate audit records, is referenced to<br />&#167;2E5.3. Section 1520 provides a statutory maximum penalty of ten years’ imprisonment for<br />knowing and willful violations of document maintenance requirements as set forth in that<br />section or in rules or regulations to be promulgated by the Securities and Exchange<br />Commission pursuant to that section. The amendment also expands the existing cross<br />reference in &#167;2E5.3(a)(2) specifically to cover fraud and obstruction of justice offenses.<br />Accordingly, if a defendant violated 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1520 in order to obstruct justice, the cross<br />reference provision in &#167;2E5.3 requires the court to apply &#167;2J1.2 instead of &#167;2E5.3. Other<br />new offenses are listed in Appendix A (Statutory Index), as well as in the statutory<br />provisions of the relevant guidelines.<br />Finally, the amendment amends the contempt guideline, &#167;2J1.1, by adding an application<br />note clarifying that (1) &#167;2B1.1 is the most analogous guideline in a case involving a violation<br />of a judicial order enjoining fraudulent behavior; and (2) the enhancement at<br />&#167;2B1.1(b)(7)(C) (pertaining to a violation of a prior, specific judicial order) ordinarily would<br />apply in such a case.</td><td>Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2003.</td></tr><tr><td class="n">655</td><td>Amendment 655</td><td>Section 2B1.1(b) is amended by inserting after subsection (b)(12) the<br />following:<br />"(13) (A) (Apply the greatest) If the defendant was convicted of an offense<br />under:<br />(i) 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1030, and the offense involved (I) a computer<br />system used to maintain or operate a critical infrastructure,<br />or used by or for a government entity in furtherance of the<br />administration of justice, national defense, or national<br />security; or (II) an intent to obtain personal information,<br />increase by 2 levels.<br />(ii) 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1030(a)(5)(A)(i), increase by 4 levels.<br />(iii) 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1030, and the offense caused a substantial<br />November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II Amendment 654<br /><br />disruption of a critical infrastructure, increase by 6 levels.<br />(B) If subdivision (A)(iii) applies, and the offense level is less than<br />level 24, increase to level 24.".<br />The Commentary to &#167;2B1.1 captioned "Statutory Provisions" is amended by inserting<br />", 2701" after "2332b(a)(1)".<br />The Commentary to &#167;2B1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 3(A)(v), as<br />redesignated by Amendment 653, by striking subdivision (III) as follows:<br />"(III) Protected Computer Cases.—In the case of an offense involving unlawfully<br />accessing, or exceeding authorized access to, a "protected computer" as<br />defined in 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1030(e)(2), actual loss includes the following<br />pecuniary harm, regardless of whether such pecuniary harm was reasonably<br />foreseeable: reasonable costs to the victim of conducting a damage<br />assessment, and restoring the system and data to their condition prior to the<br />offense, and any lost revenue due to interruption of service.",<br />and inserting the following:<br />"(III) Offenses Under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1030.—In the case of an offense under 18<br />U.S.C. &#167; 1030, actual loss includes the following pecuniary harm,<br />regardless of whether such pecuniary harm was reasonably foreseeable: any<br />reasonable cost to any victim, including the cost of responding to an<br />offense, conducting a damage assessment, and restoring the data, program,<br />system, or information to its condition prior to the offense, and any revenue<br />lost, cost incurred, or other damages incurred because of interruption of<br />service.".<br />The Commentary to &#167;2B1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by inserting before<br />Note 13, as redesignated by Amendment 653, the following:<br />"12.

It<br />implements the directive in section 225(b) of the Homeland Security Act of 2002, Pub. L.<br />107–296, which required the Commission to review, and if appropriate amend, the<br />guidelines and policy statements applicable to persons convicted of offenses under 18 U.S.C.<br />&#167; 1030 (fraud and related activity in connection with computers) to ensure that the guidelines<br />and policy statements reflect the serious nature and growing incidence of such offenses and<br />the need for an effective deterrent and appropriate punishment. The directive further<br />requires the Commission to consider the extent to which eight specific factors were or were<br />not accounted for by the guidelines. The amendment responds to the directive by making<br />several changes to &#167;&#167;2B1.1 (Larceny, Embezzlement, and Other Forms of Theft; Offenses<br />Involving Stolen Property; Property Damage or Destruction; Fraud and Deceit; Forgery;<br />Offenses Involving Altered or Counterfeit Instruments Other than Counterfeit Bearer<br />Obligations of the United States), 2B2.3 (Trespass), and 2B3.2 (Extortion by Force or Threat<br />of Injury or Serious Damage). These changes are designed to supplement existing guidelines<br />and policy statements and thereby ensure that offenses under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1030 are<br />adequately addressed and punished.<br />First, the amendment adds a new specific offense characteristic at &#167;2B1.1(b)(13) with three<br />alternative enhancements of two, four, and six levels. The first enhancement provides a two<br />level increase for convictions under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1030 that involve either (1) a computer<br />system used to maintain or operate a critical infrastructure or used in furtherance of the<br />administration of justice, national defense, or national security; or (2) an intent to obtain<br />private personal information. The second enhancement provides a four level increase for a<br />conviction under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1030(a)(5)(A)(i), which requires a heightened showing of<br />intent to cause damage. The third enhancement provides a six level increase, with a<br />minimum offense level of level 24, for a conviction under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1030 that resulted in<br />a substantial disruption of a critical infrastructure. The graduated levels ensure incremental<br />November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II Amendment 654<br /><br />punishment for increasingly serious conduct, and were chosen in recognition of the fact that<br />conduct supporting application of a more serious enhancement frequently will encompass<br />behavior relevant to a lesser enhancement as well. Accordingly, the most serious applicable<br />enhancement will apply in any particular case.<br />The minimum offense level of level 24 applicable to the third such enhancement was chosen<br />to maintain parity with the minimum offense level that applies to an offense that<br />substantially jeopardized the safety and soundness of a financial institution, substantially<br />endangered the solvency or financial security of a publicly traded company or an<br />organization of at least 1,000 employees, or substantially endangered the solvency or<br />financial security of 100 or more victims. See &#167;2B1.1(b)(12)(B). Because of the potential<br />overlap in certain cases, the commentary provides that the enhancement at &#167;2B1.1(b)(12)(B)<br />will not apply in a case in which the conduct supporting the six level critical infrastructure<br />enhancement is the only conduct that forms the basis for the &#167;2B1.1(b)(12)(B) enhancement.<br />The minimum offense level of level 24 applicable to the third enhancement also reflects the<br />fact that some offenders to whom the enhancement may apply will be subject to a statutory<br />maximum penalty of five years’ imprisonment, i.e., those convicted of an offense under 18<br />U.S.C. &#167; 1030(a)(5)(A)(ii). To ensure that the most egregious cases involving critical<br />infrastructure are adequately addressed, the amendment also provides an encouraged upward<br />departure for cases in which the disruption of the critical infrastructure has a debilitating<br />impact on national security, national economic security, national public health or safety, or<br />any combination of these matters.<br />A definition of critical infrastructure is provided in the commentary. This definition is<br />derived in part from the definition of critical infrastructure in the USA PATRIOT Act (see<br />Pub. L. 107–56, section 1016; 42 U.S.C. &#167; 5195c(e)) but was modified to ensure that the<br />enhancement will apply to substantial disruptions of critical infrastructure that are regional,<br />rather than national, in scope. Examples of critical infrastructures are provided.<br />Second, the amendment modifies the rule of construction relating to the calculation of loss<br />in protected computer cases. This change was made to incorporate more fully the statutory<br />definition of loss at 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1030(e)(11), added as part of the USA PATRIOT Act, and<br />to clarify its application to all 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1030 offenses sentenced under &#167;2B1.1.<br />Third, the amendment expands the upward departure note in &#167;2B1.1. That note provides that<br />an upward departure may be warranted if an offense caused or risked substantial non-<br />monetary harm, including physical harm. The amendment adds a provision that expressly<br />states that an upward departure would be warranted for an offense under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1030<br />involving damage to a protected computer that results in death.<br />Fourth, the amendment modifies &#167;2B2.3, to which 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1030(a)(3) (misdemeanor<br />trespass on a government computer) offenses are referenced, and &#167;2B3.2, to which 18 U.S.C.<br />&#167; 1030(a)(7) (extortionate demand to damage protected computer) offenses are referenced,<br />to provide enhancements relating to computer systems used to maintain or operate a critical<br />infrastructure, or by or for a government entity in furtherance of the administration of justice,<br />national defense, or national security. The amendment expands the scope of existing<br />enhancements to ensure that trespasses and extortions involving these types of important<br />computer systems are addressed.<br />Amendment 654 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003<br /><br />Finally, the amendment references offenses under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2701 (unlawful access to<br />stored communications) to &#167;2B1.1. Prior to the Act, a first offense under section 2701 was<br />classified as a misdemeanor offense, and the guidelines did not reference the statute in<br />Appendix A (Statutory Index). Given that the Act increased the penalties available for 18<br />U.S.C. &#167; 2701 offenses, the amendment references the statute in Appendix A. Section 2701<br />offenses are referenced to &#167;2B1.1 because such offenses involve the obtaining, altering, or<br />denial of authorized access to stored wire or electronic communications, conduct that is<br />related to fraud, theft, and property damage, which are covered by &#167;2B1.1.</td><td>Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2003.</td></tr><tr><td class="n">656</td><td>Amendment 656</td><td>The Commentary to &#167;2B1.1 captioned "Application Notes", as amended by<br />Amendment 654, is further amended in subdivision (A)(ii) of Note 18, as redesignated by<br />Amendment 653, by adding at the end the following:<br />"An upward departure also would be warranted, for example, in a case involving<br />animal enterprise terrorism under 18 U.S.C. &#167;

L.<br />107–56; (2) responds to the Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and<br />Response Act of 2002, Pub. L. 107–188; and (3) responds to the Terrorist Bombings<br />Preparedness and Response Act of 2002, Pub. L. 107–197.<br />First, this amendment makes changes to the money laundering and transactions structuring<br />guidelines to complete work begun in 2002 to address the provisions of the USA PATRIOT<br />Act. The amendment eliminates the six level enhancement for terrorism in &#167;2S1.1<br />(Laundering of Monetary Instruments; Engaging in Monetary Transactions in Property<br />Derived from Unlawful Activity) because such conduct is adequately accounted for by the<br />terrorism adjustment at &#167;3A1.4 (Terrorism). The terrorism adjustment at &#167;3A1.4 applies if<br />the offense is a felony that involved, or was intended to promote, a federal crime of<br />terrorism as defined in 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2332b(g)(5). Therefore, if the defendant knew or<br />believed that any of the laundered funds were the proceeds of, or were intended to promote,<br />an offense involving terrorism, as defined in &#167;3A1.4, that adjustment will apply. This<br />amendment also provides for the treatment of certain offenses under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1960. The<br />Amendment 655 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003<br /><br />amendment changes Appendix A (Statutory Index) to refer violations of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1960<br />to both &#167;&#167;2S1.1 and 2S1.3 (Structuring Transactions to Evade Reporting Requirements;<br />Failure to Report Case or Monetary Transactions; Failure to File Currency and Monetary<br />Instrument Report; Knowingly Filing False Reports; Bulk Cash Smuggling; Establishing or<br />Maintaining Prohibited Accounts). Referring violations of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1960(b)(1)(C) to<br />&#167;2S1.1 is appropriate because the essence of this offense is money laundering, rather than<br />structuring transactions to evade reporting requirements.<br />The amendment also raises the maximum offense level in &#167;2X3.1 (Accessory After the Fact)<br />from level 20 to level 30 for offenses in which the conduct involves harboring or concealing<br />a fugitive involved in a terrorism offense. The Commission determined that the heightened<br />maximum offense level of level 30 is appropriate for offenses involving the harboring of<br />terrorists because of the relative seriousness of those offenses. Specifically, the heightened<br />maximum offense level applies in any case in which the defendant is convicted under 18<br />U.S.C. &#167; 2339 or &#167; 2339A or in which the conduct involved harboring a person who<br />committed any offense listed under those statutes, or who committed any offense involving<br />or intending to promote a federal crime of terrorism as defined in 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2332b(g)(5).<br />Second, the amendment responds to the Public Health Security and Bioterrorism<br />Preparedness and Response Act of 2002. The amendment refers certain new offenses<br />involving biological agents and toxins to the guideline covering nuclear, biological, and<br />chemical weapons and materials, &#167;2M6.1 (Unlawful Production, Development, Acquisition,<br />Stockpiling, Alteration, Use, Transfer, or Possession of Nuclear Material, Weapons, or<br />Facilities, Biological Agents, Toxins, or Delivery Systems, Chemical Weapons, or Other<br />Weapons of Mass Destruction; Attempt or Conspiracy).<br />The amendment also responds to amendments made to the Safe Drinking Water Act (42<br />U.S.C. &#167; 300i-1(a)) made by section 403 of the Public Health Security and Bioterrorism<br />Preparedness and Response Act of 2002. Section 1432(a) of the Safe Drinking Water Act<br />prohibits any person from tampering with a public water system. The statutory maximum<br />penalty was increased from five years’ imprisonment to 20 years’ imprisonment. Section<br />1432(b) of the Act prohibits anyone from attempting or threatening to tamper with a public<br />water system. The statutory maximum penalty was increased from three years’<br />imprisonment to ten years’ imprisonment.<br />The amendment consolidates &#167;&#167;2Q1.5 (Threatened Tampering with Public Water System)<br />and 2Q1.4 (Tampering or Attempted Tampering with Public Water System). This<br />consolidation reflects the similar manner in which threats to carry out a nuclear, biological,<br />or chemical weapons offense are treated under &#167;2M6.1. Three alternative base offense levels<br />are provided for the substantive offense and for a threat to carry out the substantive offense,<br />either accompanied or unaccompanied by other conduct evidencing an intent to carry out the<br />threat.<br />The amendment also increases the base offense level for offenses involving tampering and<br />threatened tampering with a public water system. The amendment increases the base offense<br />level for tampering with a public water system from level 18 to level 26. The six level<br />enhancement for the risk of death or serious bodily injury (in the predecessor guideline) is<br />incorporated into the base offense level, as are two levels for bodily injury (similar to the<br />treatment of this aggravated conduct in the consumer product tampering guideline). A<br />graduated enhancement for serious or life-threatening bodily injury, modeled after the<br />November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II Amendment 655<br /><br />nuclear, biological, and chemical guideline and the consumer product tampering guideline,<br />is added. Likewise, the base offense level for threatening to tamper with a public water<br />system, without conduct evidencing an intent to carry out the threat, is increased from level<br />10 to level 16. A base offense level of level 22 is provided if there is conduct evidencing an<br />intent to carry out the threat. For point of comparison, the existing base offense levels for<br />threatening communications under &#167;2A6.1 (Threatening or Harassing Communications) is<br />level 12, and for threatened use of nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons under &#167;2M6.1<br />is level 20. These substantial increases in the base offense levels for threatened tampering<br />of a public water system are provided to ensure proportionality with similar offenses and to<br />respond to the increased statutory maximum penalties made by section 403 of the Public<br />Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002. Additionally, the<br />enhancement in subsection (b)(2) regarding the disruption of the public water system has<br />been expanded slightly to make it consistent with similar enhancements in other related<br />guidelines, such as the nuclear, biological, and chemical guideline, &#167;2M6.1.<br />This amendment adds an invited upward departure provision in &#167;2B1.1 (Larceny,<br />Embezzlement, and Other Forms of Theft; Offenses Involving Stolen Property; Property<br />Damage or Destruction; Fraud and Deceit; Forgery; Offenses Involving Altered or<br />Counterfeit Instruments Other than Counterfeit Bearer Obligations of the United States), to<br />account for aggravating conduct that may occur in connection with an animal enterprise<br />offense under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 43. While reference only to that guideline generally continues to<br />be appropriate for violations under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 43, that guideline fails to account for<br />aggravated situations in which serious bodily injury or death results. Although the property<br />damage guideline contains an enhancement for the risk of serious bodily injury or death,<br />there is no enhancement or cross reference in that guideline that would provide a higher<br />offense level if actual serious bodily injury or death resulted. Given the highly unusual<br />occurrence of death or serious bodily injury in property damage cases generally and the<br />infrequency of these specific offenses, the amendment adds an invited upward departure<br />provision in the commentary of &#167;2B1.1 if death or serious bodily injury occurs in an offense<br />under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 43, or if substantial or significant scientific information or research is lost<br />as part of such an offense.<br />Third, the amendment amends Appendix A (and the Statutory Provisions of the pertinent<br />Chapter Two guidelines) to add three new offenses created by the Terrorist Bombings<br />Convention Implementation Act of 2002, and provides conforming amendments within a<br />number of Chapter Two guidelines to incorporate more fully the new offenses into the<br />offense guidelines. Section 102 of the Act created a new offense at 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2332f,<br />which provides in subsection (a) that "whoever unlawfully delivers, places, discharges, or<br />detonates an explosive or other lethal device in, into, or against a place of public use, a state<br />or government facility, a public transportation system, or an infrastructure facility (1) with<br />the intent to cause death or serious bodily injury, or (2) with the intent to cause extensive<br />destruction of such a place, facility, or system, where such destruction results in or is likely<br />to result in major economic loss" and in subsection (b) that "whoever attempts or conspires<br />to commit [such] an offense" shall be punished as provided under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2332a(a).<br />Section 2332a offenses currently are referenced to &#167;&#167;2K1.4 (Arson; Property Damage by<br />Use of Explosives) and 2M6.1. The amendment refers this new offense to those guidelines<br />as well. In addition, the amendment amends the alternative base offense levels in<br />&#167;2K1.4(a)(1) so that the base offense level of level 24 applies to targets of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2332f<br />offenses, namely, state or government facilities, infrastructure facilities, public transportation<br />systems and "places of public use".<br />Amendment 655 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003<br /><br />Section 202 of the Act created a new offense at 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2339C. The amendment refers<br />the new offense at 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2339C(1)(A) to &#167;2X2.1 (Aiding and Abetting). The new<br />offense involves providing or collecting funds knowing or intending that the funds would<br />be used to carry out any of a number of specified offenses. Accordingly, the amendment<br />treats these offenses in the same manner as 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2339A offenses, which aid and abet<br />a predicate offense listed in the statute. An amendment is also made in &#167;2X2.1 to provide<br />a definition for the "underlying offense" that is aided and abetted.<br />The amendment also refers the new offense at 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2339C(a)(1)(B) to &#167;2M5.3<br />(Providing Material Support or Resources to Designated Foreign Terrorist Organizations).<br />Reference to &#167;2M5.3 is appropriate because this offense involves generally providing or<br />collecting funds knowing or intending that the funds would be used to carry out an act which<br />by its nature is a terrorist act (because it is meant to intimidate a civilian population or to<br />compel a government or international organization to do something or to refrain from doing<br />something). Therefore, the essence of the offense is the provision of material support to<br />terrorists, which appropriately is referenced to &#167;2M5.3. The amendment expands &#167;2M5.3<br />to include not only designated foreign terrorist organizations but other terrorists as well.<br />Additionally, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2339C(c)(2) makes it unlawful in the United States, or outside the<br />United States by a national of the United States or an entity organized under the laws of the<br />United States, to knowingly conceal or disguise the nature, location, source, ownership, or<br />control of any material support, resources, or funds knowing or intending that they were (1)<br />provided in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2339B, or (2) provided or collected in violation of 18<br />U.S.C. &#167; 2339C(a)(1) or (2). The maximum term of imprisonment for a violation of<br />subsection 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2339C(c) is 10 years. The amendment references offenses under 18<br />U.S.C. &#167; 2339C(c)(2)(A) to &#167;2X3.1 (Accessory After the Fact), because the essence of such<br />an offense is the concealment of resources that were known or intended to have been<br />provided in violation of another substantive offense, namely, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2339B. An<br />amendment is made in &#167;2X3.1 to provide a definition of the "underlying offense" to which<br />the defendant is an accessory.<br />The amendment references offenses under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2339C(c)(2)(B) to &#167;&#167;2M5.3 and<br />2X3.1. To the extent the offense involved knowingly concealing or disguising the nature,<br />location, source, ownership, or control of any funds knowing or intending that they were<br />provided or collected in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2339C(a)(1)(A), the offense should be<br />sentenced under &#167;2X3.1. This is because the concealment occurs with respect to funds the<br />defendant knows are to be used, in full or in part, in order to carry out an act which<br />constitutes any number of specified offenses. To the extent the offense involved knowingly<br />concealing or disguising the nature, location, source, ownership, or control of any funds<br />knowing or intending that they were provided or collected in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167;<br />2339C(a)(1)(B), the offense should be sentenced under &#167;2M5.3. This is because the<br />concealment occurs with respect to material support the defendant knows is to be used, in<br />full or in part, in order to carry out an act which by its nature is a terrorist act (because it is<br />meant to intimidate a civilian population or to compel a government or international<br />organization to do something or to refrain from doing something). A conforming<br />amendment is added to the Statutory Provisions of &#167;&#167;2M5.3 and 2X3.1.<br />Finally, an amendment is made to &#167;2K1.3 (Unlawful Receipt, Possession, or Transportation<br />of Explosive Materials; Prohibited Transaction Involving Explosive Materials) to add an<br />additional base offense level of level 18 for certain offenses committed under 18 U.S.C. &#167;<br />November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II Amendment 655<br /><br />842(p)(2) involving explosives, destructive devices, or weapons of mass destruction. The<br />statute is referenced in Appendix A to &#167;&#167;2K1.3 and 2M6.1. The applicable offense levels<br />at &#167;2M6.1 are levels 42 and 28. The applicable base offense level at &#167;2K1.3 is level 12. The<br />base offense level of level 12 appears to be disproportionately low compared with other 20<br />year offenses and compared with the treatment of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 842(p)(2) offenses under<br />&#167;2M6.1. This is especially true in light of the definition of destructive device, defined at 18<br />U.S.C. &#167; 921(a)(4) to include any explosive, incendiary, or poison gas (1) bomb; (2) grenade;<br />(3) rocket having a propellant charge of more than four ounces; (4) missile having an<br />explosive or incendiary charge of more than one-quarter ounce; (5) mine; or (6) device<br />similar to any of the devices described in the preceding clauses.<br />The amendment makes the enhancement at &#167;2K1.3(b)(3) and the cross reference at<br />&#167;2K1.3(c)(1) applicable to 18 U.S.C. &#167; 842(p)(2) offenses. In cases in which the defendant<br />used or possessed any explosive material in connection with another felony offense or<br />possessed or transferred any explosive material with knowledge, intent, or reason to believe<br />that it would be used or possessed in connection with another felony offense, subsection<br />(b)(3) provides a four level enhancement and a minimum offense level of level 18.<br />Alternatively, the cross reference at subsection (c)(1) references such cases either to &#167;2X1.1<br />(Attempt, Solicitation, or Conspiracy (Not Covered by a Specific Guideline)), or to the most<br />analogous homicide guideline if death resulted, if the resulting offense level is greater.<br />Application of both subsection (b)(3) and subsection (c)(1) to 18 U.S.C. &#167; 842(p)(2) offenses<br />is appropriate because of the defendant’s knowledge and/or intent that the defendant’s<br />teaching would be used to carry out another felony.</td><td>Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2003.</td></tr><tr><td class="n">657</td><td>Amendment 657</td><td>The heading of Part C of Chapter Two, amendments to the Introductory<br />Commentary of Part C of Chapter Two, &#167;&#167;2C1.8, 3D1.2 and 5E1.2, effective January 25,<br />2003 (see USSC Guidelines Manual Appendix C (Volume II), Amendment 648), are<br />repromulgated without change. Appendix A, effective January 25, 2003 (see USSC<br />Guidelines Manual Appendix C (Volume II), Amendments 647 and 648; see also this<br />document, Amendment 653), is repromulgated without change.</td><td>Reason for Amendment: The Commission promulgated an emergency amendment<br />addressing the directive from Congress contained in the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act<br />of 2002, Pub. L. 107–155, (the "BCRA"), with an effective date of January 25, 2003. (See<br />Amendment 648.) This amendment repromulgates without change the emergency<br />amendment as a permanent amendment.<br />This amendment implements the directive from Congress contained in the BCRA to the<br />effect that the Commission "promulgate a guideline, or amend an existing guideline ... , for<br />penalties for violations of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 [the "FECA"] and<br />related election laws ... ." The BCRA significantly increased statutory penalties for<br />campaign finance crimes, formerly misdemeanors under the FECA. The new statutory<br />maximum term of imprisonment for even the least serious of these offenses is now two years,<br />and for more serious offenses, the maximum term of imprisonment is five years.<br />To punish these offenses effectively, the Commission chose to create a new guideline at<br />&#167;2C1.8 (Making, Receiving, or Failing to Report a Contribution, Donation, or Expenditure<br />in Violation of the Federal Election Campaign Act; Fraudulently Misrepresenting Campaign<br />Amendment 655 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003<br /><br />Authority; Soliciting or Receiving a Donation in Connection with an Election While on<br />Certain Federal Property). The Commission opted against simply amending an existing<br />guideline because it determined after review that the characteristics of election violation<br />cases did not bear sufficient similarity to cases sentenced under any existing guideline. The<br />offenses that will be sentenced under &#167;2C1.8 include: violations of the statutory prohibitions<br />against "soft money" (2 U.S.C. &#167; 441i); restrictions on "hard money" contributions (2 U.S.C.<br />&#167; 441a); contributions by foreign nationals (2 U.S.C. &#167; 441e); restrictions on "electioneering<br />communications" (as defined in 2 U.S.C. &#167; 434(f)(3)(C)); certain fraudulent<br />misrepresentations (2 U.S.C. &#167; 441h); and "conduit contributions" (2 U.S.C. &#167; 441f).<br />The new guideline has a base offense level of level 8, which reflects the fact that these<br />offenses, while they are somewhat similar to fraud offenses (sentenced under &#167;2B1.1<br />(Larceny, Embezzlement, and Other Forms of Theft; Offenses Involving Stolen Property;<br />Property Damage or Destruction; Fraud and Deceit; Forgery; Offenses Involving Altered or<br />Counterfeit Instruments Other than Counterfeit Bearer Obligations of the United States) at<br />a base offense level of level 6), nevertheless are more serious due to the additional harm, or<br />the potential harm, of corrupting the elective process.<br />The new guideline provides five specific offense characteristics to ensure appropriate penalty<br />enhancements for aggravating conduct that may occur during the commission of certain<br />campaign finance offenses. First, the new guideline provides a specific offense<br />characteristic, at &#167;2C1.8(b)(1), that uses the fraud loss table in &#167;2B1.1 incrementally to<br />increase the offense level in proportion to the monetary amounts involved in the illegal<br />transactions. This both assures proportionality with penalties for fraud offenses and<br />responds to Congress’ directive to provide an enhancement for "a large aggregate amount<br />of illegal contributions."<br />Second, the new guideline provides alternative enhancements, at &#167;2C1.8(b)(2), if the offense<br />involved a foreign national (two levels) or a foreign government (four levels). These<br />enhancements respond to another specific directive in the BCRA and reflect the seriousness<br />of attempts by foreign entities to tamper with the United States’ election processes.<br />Third, the new guideline provides alternative enhancements of two levels each, at<br />&#167;2C1.8(b)(3), when the offense involves either "governmental funds," defined broadly to<br />include federal, state, or local funds, or an intent to derive "a specific, identifiable non-<br />monetary Federal benefit" (e.g., a presidential pardon). Each of these enhancements<br />responds to specific directives of the BCRA.<br />Fourth, the new guideline provides a two level enhancement, at subsection (b)(4), when the<br />offender engages in "30 or more illegal transactions." After a review of all campaign finance<br />cases in the Commission’s datafile, the Commission chose 30 transactions as the number best<br />illustrative of a "large number" in that context. This enhancement also responds to a specific<br />directive in the BCRA to the effect that the Commission provide enhanced sentencing for<br />cases involving "a large number of illegal transactions."<br />Fifth, the new guideline provides a four level enhancement, at &#167;2C1.8(b)(5), if the offense<br />involves the use of "intimidation, threat of pecuniary or other harm, or coercion." This<br />enhancement responds to information, received from the Federal Election Commission and<br />the Public Integrity Section of the Department of Justice, which characterizes offenses of this<br />type as some of the most aggravated offenses committed under the FECA.<br />November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II Amendment 658<br /><br />The new guideline also provides a cross reference, at subsection (c), which directs the<br />sentencing court to apply either &#167;2C1.1 (Offering, Giving, Soliciting, or Receiving a Bribe;<br />Extortion Under Color of Official Right) or &#167;2C1.2 (Offering, Giving, Soliciting, or<br />Receiving a Gratuity), as appropriate, if the offense involved a bribe or a gratuity and the<br />resulting offense level would be greater than that determined under &#167;2C1.8.<br />Section 3D1.2 (Groups of Closely Related Counts) has been amended, consistent with the<br />principles underlying the rules for grouping multiple counts of conviction, to include &#167;2C1.8<br />offenses among those in which the offense level is determined largely on the basis of the<br />total amount of harm or loss or some other measure of aggregate harm. (See &#167;3D1.2(d)).<br />Finally, &#167;5E1.2 (Fines for Individual Defendants) has been amended specifically to reflect<br />fine provisions unique to the FECA. This part of the amendment also provides that the<br />defendant’s participation in a conciliation agreement with the Federal Election Commission<br />may be an appropriate factor for use in determining the specific fine within the applicable<br />fine guideline range unless the defendant began negotiations with the Federal Election<br />Commission only after the defendant became aware that the defendant was the subject of a<br />criminal investigation.</td><td>Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2003.</td></tr><tr><td class="n">658</td><td>Amendment 658</td><td>Section 2D1.1(c) is amended in Note (B) of the "*Notes to Drug Quantity<br />Table" by adding at the end the following new paragraph:<br />"The term ‘Oxycodone (actual)’ refers to the weight of the controlled substance, itself,<br />contained in the pill, capsule, or mixture.".<br />The Commentary to &#167;2D1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 9 by striking<br />"or " after "amphetamine,"; and by inserting ", or oxycodone" after "methamphetamine".<br />The Commentary to &#167;2D1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 10, in the<br />Drug Equivalency Tables, in the subdivision captioned "Schedule I or II Opiates*" by<br />striking "1 gm of Oxycodone = 500 gm of marihuana" and inserting "1 gm of Oxycodone<br />(actual) = 6700 gm of marihuana".</td><td>Reason for Amendment: This amendment responds to proportionality issues in the<br />sentencing of oxycodone trafficking offenses. Oxycodone is an opium alkaloid found in<br />certain prescription pain relievers such as Percocet and OxyContin. This prescription drug<br />generally is sold in pill form and, prior to this amendment, the sentencing guidelines<br />established penalties for oxycodone trafficking based on the entire weight of the pill. The<br />proportionality issues arise (1) because of the formulations of the different medicines; and<br />(2) because different amounts of oxycodone are found in pills of identical weight.<br />As an example of the first issue, the drug Percocet contains, in addition to oxycodone, the<br />non-prescription pain reliever acetaminophen. The weight of the oxycodone component<br />accounts for a very small proportion of the total weight of the pill. In contrast, the weight<br />of the oxycodone accounts for a substantially greater proportion of the weight of an<br />OxyContin pill. To illustrate this difference, a Percocet pill containing five milligrams (mg)<br />of oxycodone weighs approximately 550 mg with oxycodone accounting for 0.9 percent of<br />the total weight of the pill. By comparison, the weight of an OxyContin pill containing 10<br />Amendment 656 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003<br /><br />mg of oxycodone is approximately 135 mg with oxycodone accounting for 7.4 percent of<br />the total weight. Consequently, prior to this amendment, trafficking 364 Percocet pills or<br />1,481 OxyContin pills resulted in the same five year sentence of imprisonment.<br />Additionally, the total amount of the narcotic oxycodone involved in this example is vastly<br />different depending on the drug. The 364 Percocets produce 1.8 grams of actual oxycodone<br />while the 1,481 OxyContin pills produce 14.8 grams of oxycodone.<br />The second issue results from differences in the formulation of OxyContin. Three different<br />amounts of oxycodone (10, 20, and 40 mg) are contained in pills of identical weight (135<br />mg). As a result, prior to this amendment, an individual trafficking in a particular number<br />of OxyContin pills would receive the same sentence regardless of the amount of oxycodone<br />contained in the pills.<br />To remedy these proportionality issues, the amendment changes the Drug Equivalency<br />Tables in &#167;2D1.1 (Unlawful Manufacturing, Importing, Exporting, or Trafficking (Including<br />Possession with Intent to Commit These Offenses); Attempt or Conspiracy) to provide<br />sentences for oxycodone offenses using the weight of the actual oxycodone instead of<br />calculating the weight of the entire pill. The amendment equates 1 gram of actual oxycodone<br />to 6,700 grams of marihuana. This equivalency keeps penalties for offenses involving 10<br />mg OxyContin pills identical to levels that existed prior to the amendment, substantially<br />increases penalties for all other doses of OxyContin, and decreases somewhat the penalties<br />for offenses involving Percocet.</td><td>Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2003.</td></tr><tr><td class="n">659</td><td>Amendment 659</td><td>Section 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(vii) is amended by striking "committed for profit".<br />The Commentary to &#167;2L1.2 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 1 by striking<br />subdivision (A)(iv) as follows:<br />"(iv) If all or any part of a sentence of imprisonment was probated, suspended,<br />deferred, or stayed, "sentence imposed" refers only to the portion that was<br />not probated, suspended, deferred, or stayed.",<br />and inserting the following:<br />"(iv) Subsection (b)(1) does not apply to a conviction for an offense committed<br />before the defendant was eighteen years of age unless such conviction is<br />classified as an adult conviction under the laws of the jurisdiction in which<br />the defendant was convicted.".<br />The Commentary to &#167;2L1.2 captioned "Application Notes" is amended in Note 1 by striking<br />subdivision (B) as follows:<br />"(B) Definitions.—For purposes of subsection (b)(1):<br />(i) ‘Committed for profit’ means committed for payment or<br />expectation of payment.<br />(ii) ‘Crime of violence’—<br />November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II Amendment 658<br /><br />(I) means an offense under federal, state, or local law that has<br />as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of<br />physical force against the person of another;

In response to application issues raised by a number of judges, probation<br />officers, defense attorneys, and prosecutors, particularly along the southwest border between<br />the United States and Mexico, this amendment builds upon the 2001 amendment by<br />clarifying the meaning of some of the terms used in &#167;2L1.2(b)(1).<br />First, the amendment adds commentary to define the following offenses: "alien smuggling",<br />"child pornography", and "human trafficking." Prior to the amendment, these offenses<br />received a 16 level increase but were not defined. The lack of definitions led to litigation<br />regarding the meaning and scope of some of these terms. The Commission has determined<br />that these offenses warrant application of the 16 level enhancement even though some of<br />these offenses, as defined by the amendment, may not meet the statutory definition of an<br />aggravated felony in 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1101(a)(43).<br />The amendment provides a definition of "alien smuggling offense" in a manner consistent<br />with the "aggravated felony" definition in 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1101(a)(43)(N). This statutory<br />definition excludes "a first offense for which the alien has affirmatively shown that the alien<br />committed the offense for the purpose of assisting, abetting, or aiding only the alien’s<br />spouse, child, or parent (and no other person)". This definition generally is consistent with<br />the guideline’s previous terminology of "alien smuggling offense committed for profit," and<br />results in a 16 level increase only for the most serious of such offenses. The new definition<br />also responds to concerns about whether an alien smuggling offense includes the offenses<br />of harboring or transporting aliens. By explicitly incorporating the statutory definition of<br />alien smuggling within the guideline definition, the amendment, in effect, adopts the Fifth<br />Circuit’s interpretation of "alien smuggling". See United States v. Solis-Campozano, 312<br />F.3d 164 (5th Cir. 2002) (holding that "alien smuggling offense" was not limited to the<br />"offense of alien smuggling" but includes transporting aliens brought into the country as<br />well).<br />Second, the amendment adds commentary that clarifies the meaning of the term "crime of<br />violence" by providing that the term "means any of the following: murder, manslaughter,<br />kidnapping, aggravated assault, forcible sex offenses, statutory rape, sexual abuse of a minor,<br /><br />robbery, arson, extortion, extortionate extension of credit, burglary of a dwelling, or any<br />offense under federal, state, or local law that has as an element the use, attempted use, or<br />threatened use of physical force against the person of another." The previous definition often<br />led to confusion over whether the specified offenses listed in that definition, particularly<br />sexual abuse of a minor and residential burglary, also had to include as an element of the<br />offense "the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of<br />another." The amended definition makes clear that the enumerated offenses are always<br />classified as "crimes of violence," regardless of whether the prior offense expressly has as<br />an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of<br />another.<br />Third, the amendment adds commentary at Application Note 1(B)(vii) explaining that the<br />term "sentence imposed" has the meaning given the term "sentence of imprisonment" in<br />Application Note 2 and subsection (b) of &#167;4A1.2 (Definitions and Instructions for<br />Computing Criminal History), without regard to the date of the conviction. The length of<br />the sentence of imprisonment includes any term of imprisonment given upon revocation of<br />probation, parole, or supervised release. The Commission’s approach in clarifying this<br />definition is consistent with the case law interpreting the term and the use of the term in<br />Chapter Four of the guidelines. See, e.g., United States v. Moreno-Cisneros, 319 F.3d 456<br />(9th Cir. 2003) (holding that the length of the sentence of imprisonment includes any term<br />of imprisonment given upon revocation of probation, parole, or supervised release);<br />United States v. Compian-Torres, 320 F.3d 514 (5th Cir. 2003) (same). Compare United<br />States v. Hidalgo-Macias, 300 F.3d 281 (2d Cir. 2002) (holding that the imposition of a<br />sentence of imprisonment following revocation of probation is a modification of the original<br />sentence and must be considered part of the sentence imposed for the original offense), with<br />United States v. Rodriguez-Arreola, 313 F.3d 1064 (8th Cir. 2002) (holding that the term<br />"sentence imposed" when applied to an indeterminate sentence is the maximum term that a<br />defendant may serve).<br />Fourth, the amendment adds commentary providing that the enhancements in subsection<br />(b)(1) do not apply to a conviction for an offense committed before the defendant was<br />eighteen years of age, unless such conviction is classified as an adult conviction under the<br />laws of the jurisdiction in which the defendant was convicted. This provision is consistent<br />with the approach in Chapter Four of the guidelines.<br />The amendment also makes other minor technical and clarifying changes.</td><td>Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2003.</td></tr><tr><td class="n">660</td><td>Amendment 660</td><td>Chapter Three, Part B, is amended by adding at the end the following new<br />guideline:<br />"&#167;3B1.5. Use of Body Armor in Drug Trafficking Crimes and Crimes of<br />Violence<br />If—<br />(1) the defendant was convicted of a drug trafficking crime or<br />a crime of violence; and<br />Amendment 658 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003<br /><br />(2) (apply the greater)—<br />(A) the offense involved the use of body armor,<br />increase by 2 levels; or<br />(B) the defendant used body armor during the<br />commission of the offense, in preparation for the<br />offense, or in an attempt to avoid apprehension for<br />the offense, increase by 4 levels.<br />Commentary<br />Application Notes:<br />1. Definitions.—For purposes of this guideline:<br />‘Body armor’ means any product sold or offered for sale, in interstate or<br />foreign commerce, as personal protective body covering intended to protect<br />against gunfire, regardless of whether the product is to be worn alone or is<br />sold as a complement to another product or garment. See 18 U.S.C. &#167;<br />921(a)(35).<br />‘Crime of violence’ has the meaning given that term in 18 U.S.C. &#167; 16.<br />‘Drug trafficking crime’ has the meaning given that term in 18 U.S.C. &#167;<br />924(c)(2).<br />‘Offense’ has the meaning given that term in Application Note 1 of the<br />Commentary to &#167;1B1.1 (Application Instructions).<br />‘Use’ means (A) active employment in a manner to protect the person from<br />gunfire; or (B) use as a means of bartering. ‘Use’ does not mean mere<br />possession (e.g., ‘use’ does not mean that the body armor was found in the<br />trunk of the car but not used actively as protection). ‘Used’ means put into<br />‘use’ as defined in this paragraph.<br />2. Application of Subdivision (2)(B).—Consistent with &#167;1B1.3 (Relevant<br />Conduct), the term ‘defendant’, for purposes of subdivision (2)(B), limits<br />the accountability of the defendant to the defendant’s own conduct and<br />conduct that the defendant aided or abetted, counseled, commanded,<br />induced, procured, or willfully caused.<br />Background: This guideline implements the directive in the James Guelff and Chris<br />McCurley Body Armor Act of 2002 (section 11009(d) of the 21st Century<br />Department of Justice Appropriations Authorization Act, Pub. L. 107–273).".</td><td>Reason for Amendment: This amendment responds to the directive in section 11009 of the<br />21st Century Department of Justice Appropriations Authorization Act (the "Act"), Pub. L.<br />107–273. The directive requires the Sentencing Commission to review and amend the<br />guidelines, as appropriate, to provide an appropriate sentencing enhancement for any crime<br /><br />of violence (as defined in 18 U.S.C. &#167; 16) or drug trafficking crime (as defined in 18 U.S.C.<br />&#167; 924(c)) (including a crime of violence or drug trafficking crime that provides for an<br />enhanced punishment if committed by the use of a deadly or dangerous weapon or device)<br />in which the defendant used body armor. The Act included a sense of Congress that any<br />such enhancement should be at least two levels.<br />In response to the directive, the amendment creates a new Chapter Three adjustment at<br />&#167;3B1.5 (Use of Body Armor in Drug Trafficking Crimes and Crimes of Violence). The new<br />adjustment provides for the greater of a two level adjustment if the defendant was convicted<br />of a crime of violence or a drug trafficking crime and the offense involved the use of body<br />armor, or a four level adjustment if the defendant used body armor in preparation for, during<br />the commission of, or in an attempt to avoid apprehension for, the offense.<br />An application note defines "drug trafficking crime" (as defined in 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(e)(2)).<br />This definition includes any felony punishable under the Controlled Substances Act. The<br />application note also defines "crime of violence" (as defined in 18 U.S.C. &#167; 16). This<br />definition includes offenses that involve the use or attempted use of physical force against<br />property as well as persons. Both of these definitions are somewhat broader than the<br />definitions of "crime of violence" and "drug trafficking offense" used in a number of other<br />guidelines. The definition of "body armor" is the same as the statutory definition provided<br />in 18 U.S.C. &#167; 921(a)(35).<br />An application note makes clear that in order for &#167;3B1.5 to apply, the body armor must be<br />used, i.e., actively employed either in a manner to protect the person from gunfire or as a<br />means of bartering. Mere possession is insufficient to trigger the adjustment.<br />Another application note explains that in order for the heightened, four level adjustment to<br />apply, the defendant must have used the body armor or aided, abetted, counseled,<br />commanded, induced, procured, or willfully caused someone else to use the body armor.</td><td>Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2003.</td></tr><tr><td class="n">661</td><td>Amendment 661</td><td>Section 5G1.3 is amended by striking subsection (b) as follows:<br />"(b) If subsection (a) does not apply, and the undischarged term of imprisonment<br />resulted from offense(s) that have been fully taken into account in the<br />determination of the offense level for the instant offense, the sentence for<br />the instant offense shall be imposed to run concurrently to the undischarged<br />term of imprisonment.",<br />and inserting the following:<br />"(b) If subsection (a) does not apply, and a term of imprisonment resulted from<br />another offense that is relevant conduct to the instant offense of conviction<br />under the provisions of subsections (a)(1), (a)(2), or (a)(3) of &#167;1B1.3<br />(Relevant Conduct) and that was the basis for an increase in the offense<br />level for the instant offense under Chapter Two (Offense Conduct) or<br />Chapter Three (Adjustments), the sentence for the instant offense shall be<br />imposed as follows:<br />Amendment 659 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003<br /><br />(1) the court shall adjust the sentence for any period of imprisonment<br />already served on the undischarged term of imprisonment if the<br />court determines that such period of imprisonment will not be<br />credited to the federal sentence by the Bureau of Prisons; and<br />(2) the sentence for the instant offense shall be imposed to run<br />concurrently to the remainder of the undischarged term of<br />imprisonment.".<br />Section 5G1.3(c) is amended by inserting "involving an undischarged term of imprisonment"<br />after "case".<br />The Commentary to &#167;5G1.3 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by striking Notes 2<br />through 7 as follows:<br />"2. Adjusted concurrent sentence - subsection (b) cases. When a sentence is<br />imposed pursuant to subsection (b), the court should adjust the sentence for<br />any period of imprisonment already served as a result of the conduct taken<br />into account in determining the guideline range for the instant offense if the<br />court determines that period of imprisonment will not be credited to the<br />federal sentence by the Bureau of Prisons. Example: The defendant is<br />convicted of a federal offense charging the sale of 30 grams of cocaine.<br />Under &#167;1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct), the defendant is held accountable for the<br />sale of an additional 15 grams of cocaine, an offense for which the<br />defendant has been convicted and sentenced in state court. The defendant<br />received a nine-month sentence of imprisonment for the state offense and<br />has served six months on that sentence at the time of sentencing on the<br />instant federal offense. The guideline range applicable to the defendant is<br />10-16 months (Chapter Two offense level of 14 for sale of 45 grams of<br />cocaine; 2-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility; final offense<br />level of 12; Criminal History Category I). The court determines that a<br />sentence of 13 months provides the appropriate total punishment. Because<br />the defendant has already served six months on the related state charge as<br />of the date of sentencing on the instant federal offense, a sentence of seven<br />months, imposed to run concurrently with the three months remaining on<br />the defendant’s state sentence, achieves this result. For clarity, the court<br />should note on the Judgment in a Criminal Case Order that the sentence<br />imposed is not a departure from the guideline range because the defendant<br />has been credited for guideline purposes under &#167;5G1.3(b) with six months<br />served in state custody that will not be credited to the federal sentence under<br />18 U.S.C. &#167; 3585(b).<br />3. Concurrent or consecutive sentence - subsection (c) cases. In circumstances<br />not covered under subsection (a) or (b), subsection (c) applies. Under this<br />subsection, the court may impose a sentence concurrently, partially<br />concurrently, or consecutively. To achieve a reasonable punishment and<br />avoid unwarranted disparity, the court should consider the factors set forth<br />in 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3584 (referencing 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(a)) and be cognizant of:<br />(a) the type (e.g., determinate, indeterminate/parolable) and length of<br />November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II Amendment 660<br /><br />the prior undischarged sentence;<br />(b) the time served on the undischarged sentence and the time likely to<br />be served before release;<br />(c) the fact that the prior undischarged sentence may have been<br />imposed in state court<br />rather than federal court, or at a different time before the same or<br />different federal court; and<br />(d) any other circumstance relevant to the determination of an<br />appropriate sentence for the instant offense.<br />4. Partially concurrent sentence. In some cases under subsection (c), a<br />partially concurrent sentence may achieve most appropriately the desired<br />result. To impose a partially concurrent sentence, the court may provide in<br />the Judgment in a Criminal Case Order that the sentence for the instant<br />offense shall commence (A) when the defendant is released from the prior<br />undischarged sentence, or (B) on a specified date, whichever is earlier. This<br />order provides for a fully consecutive sentence if the defendant is released<br />on the undischarged term of imprisonment on or before the date specified<br />in the order, and a partially concurrent sentence if the defendant is not<br />released on the undischarged term of imprisonment by that date.<br />5. Complex situations. Occasionally, the court may be faced with a complex<br />case in which a defendant may be subject to multiple undischarged terms<br />of imprisonment that seemingly call for the application of different rules.<br />In such a case, the court may exercise its discretion in accordance with<br />subsection (c) to fashion a sentence of appropriate length and structure it to<br />run in any appropriate manner to achieve a reasonable punishment for the<br />instant offense.<br />6. Revocations. If the defendant was on federal or state probation, parole, or<br />supervised release at the time of the instant offense, and has had such<br />probation, parole, or supervised release revoked, the sentence for the instant<br />offense should be imposed to run consecutively to the term imposed for the<br />violation of probation, parole, or supervised release in order to provide an<br />incremental penalty for the violation of probation, parole, or supervised<br />release. See &#167;7B1.3 (Revocation of Probation or Supervised Release)<br />(setting forth a policy that any imprisonment penalty imposed for violating<br />probation or supervised release should be consecutive to any sentence of<br />imprisonment being served or subsequently imposed).<br />7. Downward Departure Provision.—In the case of a discharged term of<br />imprisonment, a downward departure is not prohibited if subsection (b)<br />would have applied to that term of imprisonment had the term been<br />undischarged. Any such departure should be fashioned to achieve a<br />reasonable punishment for the instant offense.",<br />and inserting the following:<br />Amendment 660 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003<br /><br />"2. Application of Subsection (b).—<br />(A) In General.—Subsection (b) applies in cases in which all of the<br />prior offense (i) is relevant conduct to the instant offense under the<br />provisions of subsection (a)(1), (a)(2), or (a)(3) of &#167;1B1.3<br />(Relevant Conduct); and (ii) has resulted in an increase in the<br />Chapter Two or Three offense level for the instant offense. Cases<br />in which only part of the prior offense is relevant conduct to the<br />instant offense are covered under subsection (c).<br />(B) Inapplicability of Subsection (b).—Subsection (b) does not apply<br />in cases in which the prior offense increased the Chapter Two or<br />Three offense level for the instant offense but was not relevant<br />conduct to the instant offense under &#167;1B1.3(a)(1), (a)(2), or (a)(3)<br />(e.g., the prior offense is an aggravated felony for which the<br />defendant received an increase under &#167;2L1.2 (Unlawfully Entering<br />or Remaining in the United States), or the prior offense was a crime<br />of violence for which the defendant received an increased base<br />offense level under &#167;2K2.1 (Unlawful Receipt, Possession, or<br />Transportation of Firearms or Ammunition; Prohibited<br />Transactions Involving Firearms or Ammunition)).<br />(C) Imposition of Sentence.—If subsection (b) applies, and the court<br />adjusts the sentence for a period of time already served, the court<br />should note on the Judgement in a Criminal Case Order (i) the<br />applicable subsection (e.g., &#167;5G1.3(b)); (ii) the amount of time by<br />which the sentence is being adjusted; (iii) the undischarged term of<br />imprisonment for which the adjustment is being given; and (iv) that<br />the sentence imposed is a sentence reduction pursuant to &#167;5G1.3(b)<br />for a period of imprisonment that will not be credited by the Bureau<br />of Prisons.<br />(D) Example.—The following is an example in which subsection (b)<br />applies and an adjustment to the sentence is appropriate:<br />The defendant is convicted of a federal offense charging the sale of<br />40 grams of cocaine. Under &#167;1B1.3, the defendant is held<br />accountable for the sale of an additional 15 grams of cocaine, an<br />offense for which the defendant has been convicted and sentenced<br />in state court. The defendant received a nine-month sentence of<br />imprisonment for the state offense and has served six months on<br />that sentence at the time of sentencing on the instant federal<br />offense. The guideline range applicable to the defendant is 12-18<br />months (Chapter Two offense level of level 16 for sale of 55 grams<br />of cocaine; 3 level reduction for acceptance of responsibility; final<br />offense level of level 13; Criminal History Category I). The court<br />determines that a sentence of 13 months provides the appropriate<br />total punishment. Because the defendant has already served six<br />months on the related state charge as of the date of sentencing on<br />the instant federal offense, a sentence of seven months, imposed to<br />November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II Amendment 660<br /><br />run concurrently with the three months remaining on the<br />defendant’s state sentence, achieves this result.<br />3. Application of Subsection (c).—<br />(A) In General.—Under subsection (c), the court may impose a<br />sentence concurrently, partially concurrently, or consecutively to<br />the undischarged term of imprisonment. In order to achieve a<br />reasonable incremental punishment for the instant offense and<br />avoid unwarranted disparity, the court should consider the<br />following:<br />(i) the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3584 (referencing<br />18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(a));<br />(ii) the type (e.g., determinate, indeterminate/parolable) and<br />length of the prior undischarged sentence;<br />(iii) the time served on the undischarged sentence and the time<br />likely to be served before release;<br />(iv) the fact that the prior undischarged sentence may have<br />been imposed in state court rather than federal court, or at<br />a different time before the same or different federal court;<br />and<br />(v) any other circumstance relevant to the determination of an<br />appropriate sentence for the instant offense.<br />(B) Partially Concurrent Sentence.—In some cases under subsection<br />(c), a partially concurrent sentence may achieve most appropriately<br />the desired result. To impose a partially concurrent sentence, the<br />court may provide in the Judgment in a Criminal Case Order that<br />the sentence for the instant offense shall commence on the earlier<br />of (i) when the defendant is released from the prior undischarged<br />sentence; or (ii) on a specified date. This order provides for a fully<br />consecutive sentence if the defendant is released on the<br />undischarged term of imprisonment on or before the date specified<br />in the order, and a partially concurrent sentence if the defendant is<br />not released on the undischarged term of imprisonment by that<br />date.<br />(C) Undischarged Terms of Imprisonment Resulting from Revocations<br />of Probation, Parole or Supervised Release.—Subsection (c)<br />applies in cases in which the defendant was on federal or state<br />probation, parole, or supervised release at the time of the instant<br />offense and has had such probation, parole, or supervised release<br />revoked. Consistent with the policy set forth in Application Note<br />4 and subsection (f) of &#167;7B1.3 (Revocation of Probation or<br />Supervised Release), the Commission recommends that the<br />Amendment 660 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003<br /><br />sentence for the instant offense be imposed consecutively to the<br />sentence imposed for the revocation.<br />(D) Complex Situations.—Occasionally, the court may be faced with<br />a complex case in which a defendant may be subject to multiple<br />undischarged terms of imprisonment that seemingly call for the<br />application of different rules. In such a case, the court may<br />exercise its discretion in accordance with subsection (c) to fashion<br />a sentence of appropriate length and structure it to run in any<br />appropriate manner to achieve a reasonable punishment for the<br />instant offense.<br />(E) Downward Departure.—Unlike subsection (b), subsection (c) does<br />not authorize an adjustment of the sentence for the instant offense<br />for a period of imprisonment already served on the undischarged<br />term of imprisonment. However, in an extraordinary case<br />involving an undischarged term of imprisonment under subsection<br />(c), it may be appropriate for the court to downwardly depart. This<br />may occur, for example, in a case in which the defendant has<br />served a very substantial period of imprisonment on an<br />undischarged term of imprisonment that resulted from conduct only<br />partially within the relevant conduct for the instant offense. In such<br />a case, a downward departure may be warranted to ensure that the<br />combined punishment is not increased unduly by the fortuity and<br />timing of separate prosecutions and sentencings. Nevertheless, it<br />is intended that a departure pursuant to this application note result<br />in a sentence that ensures a reasonable incremental punishment for<br />the instant offense of conviction.<br />To avoid confusion with the Bureau of Prisons’ exclusive authority<br />provided under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3585(b) to grant credit for time served<br />under certain circumstances, the Commission recommends that any<br />downward departure under this application note be clearly stated on<br />the Judgment in a Criminal Case Order as a downward departure<br />pursuant to &#167;5G1.3(c), rather than as a credit for time served.<br />4. Downward Departure Provision.—In the case of a discharged term of<br />imprisonment, a downward departure is not prohibited if the defendant (A)<br />has completed serving a term of imprisonment; and (B) subsection (b)<br />would have provided an adjustment had that completed term of<br />imprisonment been undischarged at the time of sentencing for the instant<br />offense. See &#167;5K2.23 (Discharged Terms of Imprisonment).".<br />Chapter Five, Part K, is amended by adding at the end the following new policy statement:<br />"&#167;5K2.23. Discharged Terms of Imprisonment (Policy Statement)<br />A sentence below the applicable guideline range may be<br />appropriate if the defendant (1) has completed serving a term of<br />imprisonment; and (2) subsection (b) of &#167;5G1.3 (Imposition of a<br /><br />Sentence on a Defendant Subject to Undischarged Term of<br />Imprisonment) would have provided an adjustment had that<br />completed term of imprisonment been undischarged at the time of<br />sentencing for the instant offense. Any such departure should be<br />fashioned to achieve a reasonable punishment for the instant<br />offense.".</td><td>Reason for Amendment: This amendment addresses a number of issues in &#167;5G1.3<br />(Imposition of a Sentence on a Defendant Subject to an Undischarged Term of<br />Imprisonment).<br />First, this amendment clarifies the rule for application of subsection (b) (mandating a<br />concurrent term of imprisonment) with respect to a prior term of imprisonment by stating<br />that subsection (b) shall apply only to prior offenses that are relevant conduct to the instant<br />offense of conviction and that resulted in an increase in the offense level for the instant<br />offense. By clarifying the application of subsection (b), this amendment addresses<br />conflicting litigation regarding the meaning of "fully taken into account." Compare, e.g.,<br />United States v. Garcia-Hernandez, 237 F.3d 105, 109 (2d Cir. 2000) (determining that a<br />prior offense is "fully taken into account" if and only if the guidelines provide for sentencing<br />as if both the offense of conviction and the separate offense had been prosecuted in a single<br />proceeding), with United States v. Fuentes, 107 F.3d 1515, 1524 (11th Cir. 1997) (finding<br />that a prior offense has been "fully taken into account" when the prior offense is part of the<br />same course of conduct, common scheme, or plan).<br />Second, this amendment addresses how this guideline applies in cases in which an instant<br />offense is committed while the defendant is on federal or state probation, parole, or<br />supervised release, and has had such probation, parole, or supervised release revoked. Under<br />this amendment, the sentence for the instant offense may be imposed concurrently, partially<br />concurrently, or consecutively to the undischarged term of imprisonment; however, the<br />Commission recommends a consecutive sentence in this situation. This amendment also<br />resolves a circuit conflict concerning whether the imposition of such sentence is required to<br />be consecutive. The amendment follows holdings of the Second, Third, and Tenth Circuits<br />stating that imposition of sentence for the instant offense is not required to be consecutive<br />to the sentence imposed upon revocation of probation, parole, or supervised release. See<br />United States v. Maria, 186 F.3d 65, 70-73 (2d Cir. 1999); United States v. Swan, 275 F.3d<br />272, 279-83 (3d Cir. 2002); United States v. Tisdale, 248 F.3d 964, 977-79 (10th Cir. 2001).<br />Third, this amendment provides a new downward departure provision in &#167;5K2.23<br />(Discharged Terms of Imprisonment) regarding the effect of discharged terms of<br />imprisonment. This provision replaces the departure provision previously set forth in<br />Application Note 7 of &#167;5G1.3. By placing the departure provision in Chapter Five, Part K,<br />this amendment brings structural clarity to &#167;5G1.3 because the guideline applies to<br />undischarged, rather than discharged, terms of imprisonment. For ease of application, the<br />new commentary in &#167;5G1.3 provides a reference to &#167;5K2.23.<br />Finally, this amendment addresses a circuit conflict regarding whether the sentencing court<br />may grant "credit" or adjust the instant sentence for time served on a prior undischarged term<br />covered under subsection (c). Compare Ruggiano v. Reish, 307 F.3d 121 (3d Cir. 2002)<br />(federal sentencing court may grant such credit), with United States v. Fermin, 252 F.3d 102<br />Amendment 660 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II November 1, 2003<br /><br />(2d Cir. 2001) (court may not grant such credit). The amendment makes clear that the court<br />may not adjust or give "credit" for time served on an undischarged term of imprisonment<br />covered under subsection (c). However, the amendment adds commentary to &#167;5G1.3 to<br />provide that courts may consider a downward departure in an extraordinary case, in order<br />to achieve a reasonable punishment for the instant offense.</td><td>Effective Date: The effective date of this amendment is November 1, 2003.</td></tr><tr><td class="n">662</td><td>Amendment 662</td><td>Section 1B1.1 is amended by inserting before subsection (a) the following<br />new paragraph:<br />"Except as specifically directed, the provisions of this manual are to be applied in<br />the following order:".<br />The Commentary to &#167;1B1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by striking Note 4<br />as follows:<br />"4. The offense level adjustments from more than one specific offense<br />characteristic within an offense guideline are cumulative (added together)<br />unless the guideline specifies that only the greater (or greatest) is to be used.<br />Within each specific offense characteristic subsection, however, the offense<br />level adjustments are alternative; only the one that best describes the<br />conduct is to be used. E.g., in &#167;2A2.2(b)(3), pertaining to degree of bodily<br />injury, the subdivision that best describes the level of bodily injury is used;<br />the adjustments for different degrees of bodily injury (subdivisions (A)-(E))<br />are not added together.<br />Absent an instruction to the contrary, the adjustments from different<br />guideline sections are applied cumulatively (added together).",<br />and inserting the following:<br />"4. (A) Cumulative Application of Multiple Adjustments within One<br />Guideline.—The offense level adjustments from more than one<br />specific offense characteristic within an offense guideline are<br />applied cumulatively (added together) unless the guideline specifies<br />that only the greater (or greatest) is to be used.

For example, shooting a<br />November 1, 2003 APPENDIX C - VOLUME II Amendment 661<br /><br />police officer during the commission of a robbery may warrant an<br />injury enhancement under &#167;2B3.1(b)(3) and an official victim<br />adjustment under &#167;3A1.2, even though the enhancement and the<br />adjustment both are triggered by the shooting of the officer.".<br />The Commentary to &#167;1B1.1 captioned "Application Notes" is amended by adding at the end<br />the following:<br />"(7) Use of Abbreviated Guideline Titles.—Whenever a guideline makes<br />reference to another guideline, a parenthetical restatement of that other<br />guideline’s heading accompanies the initial reference to that other<br />guideline.
