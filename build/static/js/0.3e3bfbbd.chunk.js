An offense behavior category might consist, for example, of \u201cbank robbery/committed with a gun/$2500 taken.\u201d An offender characteristic category might be \u201coffender with one prior conviction not resulting in imprisonment.\u201d The Commission is required to prescribe guideline ranges that specify an appropriate sentence for each class of convicted persons determined by coordinating the offense behavior categories with the offender characteristic categories. Where the guidelines call for imprisonment, the range must be narrow: the maximum of the range cannot exceed the minimum by more than the greater of 25 percent or six months. 28 U.S.C. \xa7\xa0994(b)(2).</p><p>Pursuant to the Act, the sentencing court must select a sentence from within the guideline range. If, however, a particular case presents atypical features, the Act allows the court to depart from the guidelines and sentence outside the prescribed range. In that case, the court must specify reasons for departure. 18\xa0U.S.C. \xa7\xa03553(b). If the court sentences within the guideline range, an appellate court may review the sentence to determine whether the guidelines were correctly applied. If the court departs from the guideline range, an appellate court may review the reasonableness of the departure. 18 U.S.C. \xa7\xa03742. The Act also abolishes parole, and substantially reduces and restructures good behavior adjustments.</p><p>The Commission\u2019s initial guidelines were submitted to Congress on April\xa013, 1987. After the prescribed period of Congressional review, the guidelines took effect on November 1, 1987, and apply to all offenses committed on or after that date. The Commission has the authority to submit guideline amendments each year to Congress between the beginning of a regular Congressional session and May\xa01. Such amendments automatically take effect 180 days after submission unless a law is enacted to the contrary. 28 U.S.C. \xa7\xa0994(p).</p><p>The initial sentencing guidelines and policy statements were developed after extensive hearings, deliberation, and consideration of substantial public comment. The Commission emphasizes, however, that it views the guideline-writing process as evolutionary. It expects, and the governing statute anticipates, that continuing research, experience, and analysis will result in modifications and revisions to the guidelines through submission of amendments to Congress. To this end, the Commission is established as a permanent agency to monitor sentencing practices in the federal courts.</p><p><strong>3. The Basic Approach (Policy Statement)</strong></p><p>To understand the guidelines and their underlying rationale, it is important to focus on the three objectives that Congress sought to achieve in enacting the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984. The Act\u2019s basic objective was to enhance the ability of the criminal justice system to combat crime through an effective, fair sentencing system. To achieve this end, Congress first sought honesty in sentencing. It sought to avoid the confusion and implicit deception that arose out of the pre-guidelines sentencing system which required the court to impose an indeterminate sentence of imprisonment and empowered the parole commission to determine how much of the sentence an offender actually would serve in prison. This practice usually resulted in a substantial reduction in the effective length of the sentence imposed, with defendants often serving only about one-third of the sentence imposed by the court.</p><p>Second, Congress sought reasonable uniformity in sentencing by narrowing the wide disparity in sentences imposed for similar criminal offenses committed by similar offenders. Third, Congress sought proportionality in sentencing through a system that imposes appropriately different sentences for criminal conduct of differing severity.</p><p>Honesty is easy to achieve: the abolition of parole makes the sentence imposed by the court the sentence the offender will serve, less approximately fifteen percent for good behavior. There is a tension, however, between the mandate of uniformity and the mandate of proportionality. Simple uniformity \u2014 sentencing every offender to five years \u2014 destroys proportionality. Having only a few simple categories of crimes would make the guidelines uniform and easy to administer, but might lump together offenses that are different in important respects. For example, a single category for robbery that included armed and unarmed robberies, robberies with and without injuries, robberies of a few dollars and robberies of millions, would be far too broad.</p><p>A sentencing system tailored to fit every conceivable wrinkle of each case would quickly become unworkable and seriously compromise the certainty of punishment and its deterrent effect. For example: a bank robber with (or without) a gun, which the robber kept hidden (or brandished), might have frightened (or merely warned), injured seriously (or less seriously), tied up (or simply pushed) a guard, teller, or customer, at night (or at noon), in an effort to obtain money for other crimes (or for other purposes), in the company of a few (or many) other robbers, for the first (or fourth) time.</p><p>The list of potentially relevant features of criminal behavior is long; the fact that they can occur in multiple combinations means that the list of possible permutations of factors is virtually endless. The appropriate relationships among these different factors are exceedingly difficult to establish, for they are often context specific. Sentencing courts do not treat the occurrence of a simple bruise identically in all cases, irrespective of whether that bruise occurred in the context of a bank robbery or in the context of a breach of peace. This is so, in part, because the risk that such a harm will occur differs depending on the underlying offense with which it is connected; and also because, in part, the relationship between punishment and multiple harms is not simply additive. The relation varies depending on how much other harm has occurred. Thus, it would not be proper to assign points for each kind of harm and simply add them up, irrespective of context and total amounts.</p><p>The larger the number of subcategories of offense and offender characteristics included in the guidelines, the greater the complexity and the less workable the system. Moreover, complex combinations of offense and offender characteristics would apply and interact in unforeseen ways to unforeseen situations, thus failing to cure the unfairness of a simple, broad category system. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, probation officers and courts, in applying a complex system having numerous subcategories, would be required to make a host of decisions regarding whether the underlying facts were sufficient to bring the case within a particular subcategory. The greater the number of decisions required and the greater their complexity, the greater the risk that different courts would apply the guidelines differently to situations that, in fact, are similar, thereby reintroducing the very disparity that the guidelines were designed to reduce.</p><p>In view of the arguments, it would have been tempting to retreat to the simple, broad category approach and to grant courts the discretion to select the proper point along a broad sentencing range. Granting such broad discretion, however, would have risked correspondingly broad disparity in sentencing, for different courts may exercise their discretionary powers in different ways. Such an approach would have risked a return to the wide disparity that Congress established the Commission to reduce and would have been contrary to the Commission\u2019s mandate set forth in the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984.</p><p>In the end, there was no completely satisfying solution to this problem. The Commission had to balance the comparative virtues and vices of broad, simple categorization and detailed, complex subcategorization, and within the constraints established by that balance, minimize the discretionary powers of the sentencing court. Any system will, to a degree, enjoy the benefits and suffer from the drawbacks of each approach.</p><p>A philosophical problem arose when the Commission attempted to reconcile the differing perceptions of the purposes of criminal punishment. Most observers of the criminal law agree that the ultimate aim of the law itself, and of punishment in particular, is the control of crime. Beyond this point, however, the consensus seems to break down. Some argue that appropriate punishment should be defined primarily on the basis of the principle of \u201cjust deserts.\u201d Under this principle, punishment should be scaled to the offender\u2019s culpability and the resulting harms. Others argue that punishment should be imposed primarily on the basis of practical \u201ccrime control\u201d considerations. This theory calls for sentences that most effectively lessen the likelihood of future crime, either by deterring others or incapacitating the defendant.</p><p>Adherents of each of these points of view urged the Commission to choose between them and accord one primacy over the other. As a practical matter, however, this choice was unnecessary because in most sentencing decisions the application of either philosophy will produce the same or similar results.</p><p>In its initial set of guidelines, the Commission sought to solve both the practical and philosophical problems of developing a coherent sentencing system by taking an empirical approach that used as a starting point data estimating pre-guidelines sentencing practice. It analyzed data drawn from 10,000 presentence investigations, the differing elements of various crimes as distinguished in substantive criminal statutes, the United States Parole Commission\u2019s guidelines and statistics, and data from other relevant sources in order to determine which distinctions were important in pre-guidelines practice. After consideration, the Commission accepted, modified, or rationalized these distinctions.</p><p>This empirical approach helped the Commission resolve its practical problem by defining a list of relevant distinctions that, although of considerable length, was short enough to create a manageable set of guidelines. Existing categories are relatively broad and omit distinctions that some may believe important, yet they include most of the major distinctions that statutes and data suggest made a significant difference in sentencing decisions. Relevant distinctions not reflected in the guidelines probably will occur rarely and sentencing courts may take such unusual cases into account by departing from the guidelines.</p><p>The Commission\u2019s empirical approach also helped resolve its philosophical dilemma. Those who adhere to a just deserts philosophy may concede that the lack of consensus might make it difficult to say exactly what punishment is deserved for a particular crime. Likewise, those who subscribe to a philosophy of crime control may acknowledge that the lack of sufficient data might make it difficult to determine exactly the punishment that will best prevent that crime. Both groups might therefore recognize the wisdom of looking to those distinctions that judges and legislators have, in fact, made over the course of time. These established distinctions are ones that the community believes, or has found over time, to be important from either a just deserts or crime control perspective.</p><p>The Commission did not simply copy estimates of pre-guidelines practice as revealed by the data, even though establishing offense values on this basis would help eliminate disparity because the data represent averages. Rather, it departed from the data at different points for various important reasons. Congressional statutes, for example, suggested or required departure, as in the case of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986 that imposed increased and mandatory minimum sentences. In addition, the data revealed inconsistencies in treatment, such as punishing economic crime less severely than other apparently equivalent behavior.</p><p>Despite these policy-oriented departures from pre-guidelines practice, the guidelines represent an approach that begins with, and builds upon, empirical data. The guidelines will not please those who wish the Commission to adopt a single philosophical theory and then work deductively to establish a simple and perfect set of categorizations and distinctions. The guidelines may prove acceptable, however, to those who seek more modest, incremental improvements in the status quo, who believe the best is often the enemy of the good, and who recognize that these guidelines are, as the Act contemplates, but the first step in an evolutionary process. After spending considerable time and resources exploring alternative approaches, the Commission developed these guidelines as a practical effort toward the achievement of a more honest, uniform, equitable, proportional, and therefore effective sentencing system.</p>"},{id:"\xa71A1.4",content:"<p><strong>\xa71A1.4.</strong><p><strong>4. The Guidelines\u2019 Resolution of Major Issues (Policy Statement)</strong></p><p>The guideline-drafting process required the Commission to resolve a host of important policy questions typically involving rather evenly balanced sets of competing considerations. As an aid to understanding the guidelines, this introduction briefly discusses several of those issues; commentary in the guidelines explains others.</p><p><strong>(a) Real Offense vs. Charge Offense Sentencing.</strong></p><p>One of the most important questions for the Commission to decide was whether to base sentences upon the actual conduct in which the defendant engaged regardless of the charges for which he was indicted or convicted (\u201creal offense\u201d sentencing), or upon the conduct that constitutes the elements of the offense for which the defendant was charged and of which he was convicted (\u201ccharge offense\u201d sentencing). A bank robber, for example, might have used a gun, frightened bystanders, taken $50,000, injured a teller, refused to stop when ordered, and raced away damaging property during his escape. A pure real offense system would sentence on the basis of all identifiable conduct. A pure charge offense system would overlook some of the harms that did not constitute statutory elements of the offenses of which the defendant was convicted.</p><p>The Commission initially sought to develop a pure real offense system. After all, the pre-guidelines sentencing system was, in a sense, this type of system. The sentencing court and the parole commission took account of the conduct in which the defendant actually engaged, as determined in a presentence report, at the sentencing hearing, or before a parole commission hearing officer. The Commission\u2019s initial efforts in this direction, carried out in the spring and early summer of 1986, proved unproductive, mostly for practical reasons. To make such a system work, even to formalize and rationalize the status quo, would have required the Commission to decide precisely which harms to take into account, how to add them up, and what kinds of procedures the courts should use to determine the presence or absence of disputed factual elements. The Commission found no practical way to combine and account for the large number of diverse harms arising in different circumstances; nor did it find a practical way to reconcile the need for a fair adjudicatory procedure with the need for a speedy sentencing process given the potential existence of hosts of adjudicated \u201creal harm\u201d facts in many typical cases. The effort proposed as a solution to these problems required the use of, for example, quadratic roots and other mathematical operations that the Commission considered too complex to be workable. In the Commission\u2019s view, such a system risked return to wide disparity in sentencing practice.</p><p>In its initial set of guidelines submitted to Congress in April 1987, the Commission moved closer to a charge offense system. This system, however, does contain a significant number of real offense elements. For one thing, the hundreds of overlapping and duplicative statutory provisions that make up the federal criminal law forced the Commission to write guidelines that are descriptive of generic conduct rather than guidelines that track purely statutory language. For another, the guidelines take account of a number of important, commonly occurring real offense elements such as role in the offense, the presence of a gun, or the amount of money actually taken, through alternative base offense levels, specific offense characteristics, cross references, and adjustments.</p><p>The Commission recognized that a charge offense system has drawbacks of its own. One of the most important is the potential it affords prosecutors to influence sentences by increasing or decreasing the number of counts in an indictment. Of course, the defendant\u2019s actual conduct (that which the prosecutor can prove in court) imposes a natural limit upon the prosecutor\u2019s ability to increase a defendant\u2019s sentence. Moreover, the Commission has written its rules for the treatment of multicount convictions with an eye toward eliminating unfair treatment that might flow from count manipulation. For example, the guidelines treat a three-count indictment, each count of which charges sale of 100 grams of heroin or theft of $10,000, the same as a single-count indictment charging sale of 300\xa0grams of heroin or theft of $30,000. Furthermore, a sentencing court may control any inappropriate manipulation of the indictment through use of its departure power. Finally, the Commission will closely monitor charging and plea agreement practices and will make appropriate adjustments should they become necessary.</p><p><strong>(b) Departures.</strong></p><p>The sentencing statute permits a court to depart from a guideline-specified sentence only when it finds \u201can aggravating or mitigating circumstance of a kind, or to a degree, not adequately taken into consideration by the Sentencing Commission in formulating the guidelines that should result in a sentence different from that described.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \xa7\xa03553(b). The Commission intends the sentencing courts to treat each guideline as carving out a \u201cheartland,\u201d a set of typical cases embodying the conduct that each guideline describes. When a court finds an atypical case, one to which a particular guideline linguistically applies but where conduct significantly differs from the norm, the court may consider whether a departure is warranted. Section 5H1.10 (Race, Sex, National Origin, Creed, Religion, and Socio-Economic Status), \xa75H1.12 (Lack of Guidance as a Youth and Similar Circumstances), the third sentence of \xa75H1.4 (Physical Condition, Including Drug or Alcohol Dependence or Abuse), the last sentence of \xa75K2.12 (Coercion and Duress), and \xa75K2.19 (Post-Sentencing Rehabilitative Efforts) list several factors that the court cannot take into account as grounds for departure. With those specific exceptions, however, the Commission does not intend to limit the kinds of factors, whether or not mentioned anywhere else in the guidelines, that could constitute grounds for departure in an unusual case.</p><p>The Commission has adopted this departure policy for two reasons. First, it is difficult to prescribe a single set of guidelines that encompasses the vast range of human conduct potentially relevant to a sentencing decision. The Commission also recognizes that the initial set of guidelines need not do so. The Commission is a permanent body, empowered by law to write and rewrite guidelines, with progressive changes, over many years. By monitoring when courts depart from the guidelines and by analyzing their stated reasons for doing so and court decisions with references thereto, the Commission, over time, will be able to refine the guidelines to specify more precisely when departures should and should not be permitted.</p><p>Second, the Commission believes that despite the courts\u2019 legal freedom to depart from the guidelines, they will not do so very often. This is because the guidelines, offense by offense, seek to take account of those factors that the Commission\u2019s data indicate made a significant difference in pre-guidelines sentencing practice. Thus, for example, where the presence of physical injury made an important difference in pre-guidelines sentencing practice (as in the case of robbery or assault), the guidelines specifically include this factor to enhance the sentence. Where the guidelines do not specify an augmentation or diminution, this is generally because the sentencing data did not permit the Commission to conclude that the factor was empirically important in relation to the particular offense. Of course, an important factor (<em>e.g.</em>, physical injury) may infrequently occur in connection with a particular crime (<em>e.g.</em>, fraud). Such rare occurrences are precisely the type of events that the courts\u2019 departure powers were designed to cover \u2014 unusual cases outside the range of the more typical offenses for which the guidelines were designed.</p><p>It is important to note that the guidelines refer to two different kinds of departure. The first involves instances in which the guidelines provide specific guidance for departure by analogy or by other numerical or non-numerical suggestions. The Commission intends such suggestions as policy guidance for the courts. The Commission expects that most departures will reflect the suggestions and that the courts of appeals may prove more likely to find departures \u201cunreasonable\u201d where they fall outside suggested levels.</p><p>A second type of departure will remain unguided. It may rest upon grounds referred to in Chapter Five, Part K (Departures) or on grounds not mentioned in the guidelines. While Chapter Five, Part K lists factors that the Commission believes may constitute grounds for departure, the list is not exhaustive. The Commission recognizes that there may be other grounds for departure that are not mentioned; it also believes there may be cases in which a departure outside suggested levels is warranted. In its view, however, such cases will be highly infrequent.</p><p><strong>(c) Plea Agreements.</strong></p><p>Nearly ninety percent of all federal criminal cases involve guilty pleas and many of these cases involve some form of plea agreement. Some commentators on early Commission guideline drafts urged the Commission not to attempt any major reforms of the plea agreement process on the grounds that any set of guidelines that threatened to change pre-guidelines practice radically also threatened to make the federal system unmanageable. Others argued that guidelines that failed to control and limit plea agreements would leave untouched a \u201cloophole\u201d large enough to undo the good that sentencing guidelines would bring.</p><p>The Commission decided not to make major changes in plea agreement practices in the initial guidelines, but rather to provide guidance by issuing general policy statements concerning the acceptance of plea agreements in Chapter Six, Part B (Plea Agreements). The rules set forth in Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(e) govern the acceptance or rejection of such agreements. The Commission will collect data on the courts\u2019 plea practices and will analyze this information to determine when and why the courts accept or reject plea agreements and whether plea agreement practices are undermining the intent of the Sentencing Reform Act. In light of this information and analysis, the Commission will seek to further regulate the plea agreement process as appropriate. Importantly, if the policy statements relating to plea agreements are followed, circumvention of the Sentencing Reform Act and the guidelines should not occur.</p><p>The Commission expects the guidelines to have a positive, rationalizing impact upon plea agreements for two reasons. First, the guidelines create a clear, definite expectation in respect to the sentence that a court will impose if a trial takes place. In the event a prosecutor and defense attorney explore the possibility of a negotiated plea, they will no longer work in the dark. This fact alone should help to reduce irrationality in respect to actual sentencing outcomes. Second, the guidelines create a norm to which courts will likely refer when they decide whether, under Rule 11(e), to accept or to reject a plea agreement or recommendation.</p><p><strong>(d) Probation and Split Sentences.</strong></p><p>The statute provides that the guidelines are to \u201creflect the general appropriateness of imposing a sentence other than imprisonment in cases in which the defendant is a first offender who has not been convicted of a crime of violence or an otherwise serious offense\xa0.\xa0.\xa0.\xa0.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \xa7\xa0994(j). Under pre-guidelines sentencing practice, courts sentenced to probation an inappropriately high percentage of offenders guilty of certain economic crimes, such as theft, tax evasion, antitrust offenses, insider trading, fraud, and embezzlement, that in the Commission\u2019s view are \u201cserious.\u201d</p><p>The Commission\u2019s solution to this problem has been to write guidelines that classify as serious many offenses for which probation previously was frequently given and provide for at least a short period of imprisonment in such cases. The Commission concluded that the definite prospect of prison, even though the term may be short, will serve as a significant deterrent, particularly when compared with pre-guidelines practice where probation, not prison, was the norm.</p><p>More specifically, the guidelines work as follows in respect to a first offender. For offense levels one through eight, the sentencing court may elect to sentence the offender to probation (with or without confinement conditions) or to a prison term. For offense levels nine and ten, the court may substitute probation for a prison term, but the probation must include confinement conditions (community confinement, intermittent confinement, or home detention). For offense levels eleven and twelve, the court must impose at least one-half the minimum confinement sentence in the form of prison confinement, the remainder to be served on supervised release with a condition of community confinement or home detention. The Commission, of course, has not dealt with the single acts of aberrant behavior that still may justify probation at higher offense levels through departures.*</p><p>*Note: Although the Commission had not addressed \u201csingle acts of aberrant behavior\u201d at the time the Introduction to the Guidelines Manual originally was written, it subsequently addressed the issue in Amendment 603, effective November 1, 2000. (<em>See</em> Supplement to Appendix C, amendment 603.)</p><p><strong>(e) Multi-Count Convictions.</strong></p><p>The Commission, like several state sentencing commissions, has found it particularly difficult to develop guidelines for sentencing defendants convicted of multiple violations of law, each of which makes up a separate count in an indictment. The difficulty is that when a defendant engages in conduct that causes several harms, each additional harm, even if it increases the extent to which punishment is warranted, does not necessarily warrant a proportionate increase in punishment. A defendant who assaults others during a fight, for example, may warrant more punishment if he injures ten people than if he injures one, but his conduct does not necessarily warrant ten times the punishment. If it did, many of the simplest offenses, for reasons that are often fortuitous, would lead to sentences of life imprisonment \u2014 sentences that neither just deserts nor crime control theories of punishment would justify.</p><p>Several individual guidelines provide special instructions for increasing punishment when the conduct that is the subject of that count involves multiple occurrences or has caused several harms. The guidelines also provide general rules for aggravating punishment in light of multiple harms charged separately in separate counts. These rules may produce occasional anomalies, but normally they will permit an appropriate degree of aggravation of punishment for multiple offenses that are the subjects of separate counts.</p><p>These rules are set out in Chapter Three, Part D (Multiple Counts). They essentially provide: (1) when the conduct involves fungible items (<em>e.g.</em>, separate drug transactions or thefts of money), the amounts are added and the guidelines apply to the total amount; (2) when nonfungible harms are involved, the offense level for the most serious count is increased (according to a diminishing scale) to reflect the existence of other counts of conviction. The guidelines have been written in order to minimize the possibility that an arbitrary casting of a single transaction into several counts will produce a longer sentence. In addition, the sentencing court will have adequate power to prevent such a result through departures.</p><p><strong>(f) Regulatory Offenses.</strong></p><p>Regulatory statutes, though primarily civil in nature, sometimes contain criminal provisions in respect to particularly harmful activity. Such criminal provisions often describe not only substantive offenses, but also more technical, administratively-related offenses such as failure to keep accurate records or to provide requested information. These statutes pose two problems: first, which criminal regulatory provisions should the Commission initially consider, and second, how should it treat technical or administratively-related criminal violations?</p><p>In respect to the first problem, the Commission found that it could not comprehensively treat all regulatory violations in the initial set of guidelines. There are hundreds of such provisions scattered throughout the United States Code. To find all potential violations would involve examination of each individual federal regulation. Because of this practical difficulty, the Commission sought to determine, with the assistance of the Department of Justice and several regulatory agencies, which criminal regulatory offenses were particularly important in light of the need for enforcement of the general regulatory scheme. The Commission addressed these offenses in the initial guidelines.</p><p>In respect to the second problem, the Commission has developed a system for treating technical recordkeeping and reporting offenses that divides them into four categories. First, in the simplest of cases, the offender may have failed to fill out a form intentionally, but without knowledge or intent that substantive harm would likely follow. He might fail, for example, to keep an accurate record of toxic substance transport, but that failure may not lead, nor be likely to lead, to the release or improper handling of any toxic substance. Second, the same failure may be accompanied by a significant likelihood that substantive harm will occur; it may make a release of a toxic substance more likely. Third, the same failure may have led to substantive harm. Fourth, the failure may represent an effort to conceal a substantive harm that has occurred.</p><p>The structure of a typical guideline for a regulatory offense provides a low base offense level (<em>e.g.</em>, 6) aimed at the first type of recordkeeping or reporting offense. Specific offense characteristics designed to reflect substantive harms that do occur in respect to some regulatory offenses, or that are likely to occur, increase the offense level. A specific offense characteristic also provides that a recordkeeping or reporting offense that conceals a substantive offense will have the same offense level as the substantive offense.</p><p><strong>(g) Sentencing Ranges.</strong></p><p>In determining the appropriate sentencing ranges for each offense, the Commission estimated the average sentences served within each category under the pre-guidelines sentencing system. It also examined the sentences specified in federal statutes, in the parole guidelines, and in other relevant, analogous sources. The Commission\u2019s Supplementary Report on the Initial Sentencing Guidelines (1987) contains a comparison between estimates of pre-guidelines sentencing practice and sentences under the guidelines.</p><p>While the Commission has not considered itself bound by pre-guidelines sentencing practice, it has not attempted to develop an entirely new system of sentencing on the basis of theory alone. Guideline sentences, in many instances, will approximate average pre-guidelines practice and adherence to the guidelines will help to eliminate wide disparity. For example, where a high percentage of persons received probation under pre-guidelines practice, a guideline may include one or more specific offense characteristics in an effort to distinguish those types of defendants who received probation from those who received more severe sentences. In some instances, short sentences of incarceration for all offenders in a category have been substituted for a pre-guidelines sentencing practice of very wide variability in which some defendants received probation while others received several years in prison for the same offense. Moreover, inasmuch as those who pleaded guilty under pre-guidelines practice often received lesser sentences, the guidelines permit the court to impose lesser sentences on those defendants who accept responsibility for their misconduct. For defendants who provide substantial assistance to the government in the investigation or prosecution of others, a downward departure may be warranted.</p><p>The Commission has also examined its sentencing ranges in light of their likely impact upon prison population. Specific legislation, such as the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986 and the career offender provisions of the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 (28 U.S.C. \xa7\xa0994(h)), required the Commission to promulgate guidelines that will lead to substantial prison population increases. These increases will occur irrespective of the guidelines. The guidelines themselves, insofar as they reflect policy decisions made by the Commission (rather than legislated mandatory minimum or career offender sentences), are projected to lead to an increase in prison population that computer models, produced by the Commission and the Bureau of Prisons in 1987, estimated at approximately 10 percent over a period of ten years.</p><p><strong>(h) The Sentencing Table.</strong></p><p>The Commission has established a sentencing table that for technical and practical reasons contains 43 levels. Each level in the table prescribes ranges that overlap with the ranges in the preceding and succeeding levels. By overlapping the ranges, the table should discourage unnecessary litigation. Both prosecution and defense will realize that the difference between one level and another will not necessarily make a difference in the sentence that the court imposes. Thus, little purpose will be served in protracted litigation trying to determine, for example, whether $10,000 or $11,000 was obtained as a result of a fraud. At the same time, the levels work to increase a sentence proportionately. A change of six levels roughly doubles the sentence irrespective of the level at which one starts. The guidelines, in keeping with the statutory requirement that the maximum of any range cannot exceed the minimum by more than the greater of 25\xa0percent or six months (28 U.S.C. \xa7\xa0994(b)(2)), permit courts to exercise the greatest permissible range of sentencing discretion. The table overlaps offense levels meaningfully, works proportionately, and at the same time preserves the maximum degree of allowable discretion for the court within each level.</p><p>Similarly, many of the individual guidelines refer to tables that correlate amounts of money with offense levels. These tables often have many rather than a few levels. Again, the reason is to minimize the likelihood of unnecessary litigation. If a money table were to make only a few distinctions, each distinction would become more important and litigation over which category an offender fell within would become more likely. Where a table has many small monetary distinctions, it minimizes the likelihood of litigation because the precise amount of money involved is of considerably less importance.</p>"},{id:"\xa71A1.5",content:"<p><strong>\xa71A1.5.</strong><p><strong>5. A Concluding Note</strong></p><p>The Commission emphasizes that it drafted the initial guidelines with considerable caution. It examined the many hundreds of criminal statutes in the United States Code. It began with those that were the basis for a significant number of prosecutions and sought to place them in a rational order. It developed additional distinctions relevant to the application of these provisions and it applied sentencing ranges to each resulting category. In doing so, it relied upon pre-guidelines sentencing practice as revealed by its own statistical analyses based on summary reports of some 40,000 convictions, a sample of 10,000 augmented presentence reports, the parole guidelines, and policy judgments.</p><p>The Commission recognizes that some will criticize this approach as overly cautious, as representing too little a departure from pre-guidelines sentencing practice. Yet, it will cure wide disparity. The Commission is a permanent body that can amend the guidelines each year. Although the data available to it, like all data, are imperfect, experience with the guidelines will lead to additional information and provide a firm empirical basis for consideration of revisions.</p><p>Finally, the guidelines will apply to more than 90 percent of all felony and Class A misdemeanor cases in the federal courts. Because of time constraints and the nonexistence of statistical information, some offenses that occur infrequently are not considered in the guidelines. Their exclusion does not reflect any judgment regarding their seriousness and they will be addressed as the Commission refines the guidelines over time.</p></blockquote>"},{id:"\xa71A2.1",content:"<p><strong>\xa71A2.1.</strong><h3 id='continuing-evolution-and-role-of-the-guidelines'>2. Continuing Evolution and Role of the Guidelines</h3><p>The Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 changed the course of federal sentencing. Among other things, the Act created the United States Sentencing Commission as an independent agency in the Judicial Branch, and directed it to develop guidelines and policy statements for sentencing courts to use when sentencing offenders convicted of federal crimes. Moreover, it empowered the Commission with ongoing responsibilities to monitor the guidelines, submit to Congress appropriate modifications of the guidelines and recommended changes in criminal statutes, and establish education and research programs. The mandate rested on congressional awareness that sentencing is a dynamic field that requires continuing review by an expert body to revise sentencing policies, in light of application experience, as new criminal statutes are enacted, and as more is learned about what motivates and controls criminal behavior.</p><p>This statement finds resonance in a line of Supreme Court cases that, taken together, echo two themes. The first theme is that the guidelines are the product of a deliberative process that seeks to embody the purposes of sentencing set forth in the Sentencing Reform Act, and as such they continue to play an important role in the sentencing court\u2019s determination of an appropriate sentence in a particular case. The Supreme Court alluded to this in <em>Mistretta v. United States</em>, 488 U.S. 361 (1989), which upheld the constitutionality of both the federal sentencing guidelines and the Commission against nondelegation and separation of powers challenges. Therein the Court stated:</p><blockquote><p>Developing proportionate penalties for hundreds of different crimes by a virtually limitless array of offenders is precisely the sort of intricate, labor-intensive task for which delegation to an expert body is especially appropriate. Although Congress has delegated significant discretion to the Commission to draw judgments from its analysis of existing sentencing practice and alternative sentencing models,\xa0.\xa0.\xa0. [w]e have no doubt that in the hands of the Commission \u201cthe criteria which Congress has supplied are wholly adequate for carrying out the general policy and purpose\u201d of the Act.</p></blockquote><p><em>Id.</em> at 379 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).</p><p>The continuing importance of the guidelines in federal sentencing was further acknowledged by the Court in <em>United States v. Booker</em>, 543 U.S. 220 (2005), even as that case rendered the guidelines advisory in nature. In <em>Booker</em>, the Court held that the imposition of an enhanced sentence under the federal sentencing guidelines based on the sentencing judge\u2019s determination of a fact (other than a prior conviction) that was not found by the jury or admitted by the defendant violated the Sixth Amendment. The Court reasoned that an advisory guideline system, while lacking the mandatory features that Congress enacted, retains other features that help to further congressional objectives, including providing certainty and fairness in meeting the purposes of sentencing, avoiding unwarranted sentencing disparities, and maintaining sufficient flexibility to permit individualized sentences when warranted. The Court concluded that an advisory guideline system would \u201ccontinue to move sentencing in Congress\u2019 preferred direction, helping to avoid excessive sentencing disparities while maintaining flexibility sufficient to individualize sentences where necessary.\u201d <em>Id.</em> at 264\u201365. An advisory guideline system continues to assure transparency by requiring that sentences be based on articulated reasons stated in open court that are subject to appellate review. An advisory guideline system also continues to promote certainty and predictability in sentencing, thereby enabling the parties to better anticipate the likely sentence based on the individualized facts of the case.</p><p>The continuing importance of the guidelines in the sentencing determination is predicated in large part on the Sentencing Reform Act\u2019s intent that, in promulgating guidelines, the Commission must take into account the purposes of sentencing as set forth in 18 U.S.C. \xa7\xa03553(a). <em>See</em> 28 U.S.C. \xa7\xa7\xa0994(f), 991(b)(1). The Supreme Court reinforced this view in <em>Rita v. United States</em>, 551 U.S. 338 (2007), which held that a court of appeals may apply a presumption of reasonableness to a sentence imposed by a district court within a properly calculated guideline range without violating the Sixth Amendment. In <em>Rita</em>, the Court relied heavily on the complementary roles of the Commission and the sentencing court in federal sentencing, stating:</p><blockquote><p>[T]he presumption reflects the nature of the Guidelines-writing task that Congress set for the Commission and the manner in which the Commission carried out that task. In instructing both the <em>sentencing judge</em> and the <em>Commission</em> what to do, Congress referred to the basic sentencing objectives that the statute sets forth in 18 U.S.C. \xa7\xa03553(a)\xa0.\xa0.\xa0.\xa0. The provision also tells the sentencing judge to \u201cimpose a sentence sufficient, but not greater than necessary, to comply with\u201d the basic aims of sentencing as set out above. Congressional statutes then tell the <em>Commission</em> to write Guidelines that will carry out these same \xa7\xa03553(a) objectives.</p></blockquote><p><em>Id.</em> at 347\u201348 (emphasis in original). The Court concluded that \u201c[t]he upshot is that the sentencing statutes envision both the sentencing judge and the Commission as carrying out the same basic \xa7\xa03553(a) objectives, the one, at retail, the other at wholesale[,]\u201d <em>id.</em> at 348, and that the Commission\u2019s process for promulgating guidelines results in \u201ca set of Guidelines that seek to embody the \xa7\xa03553(a) considerations, both in principle and in practice.\u201d <em>Id.</em> at 350.</p><p>Consequently, district courts are required to properly calculate and consider the guidelines when sentencing, even in an advisory guideline system. <em>See</em> 18 U.S.C. \xa7\xa03553(a)(4), (a)(5); <em>Booker</em>, 543 U.S. at 264 (\u201cThe district courts, while not bound to apply the Guidelines, must\xa0.\xa0.\xa0. take them into account when sentencing.\u201d); <em>Rita</em>, 551\xa0U.S. at 351 (stating that a district court should begin all sentencing proceedings by correctly calculating the applicable Guidelines range); <em>Gall v. United States</em>, 552\xa0U.S. 38, 49 (2007) (\u201cAs a matter of administration and to secure nationwide consistency, the Guidelines should be the starting point and the initial benchmark.\u201d). The district court, in determining the appropriate sentence in a particular case, therefore, must consider the properly calculated guideline range, the grounds for departure provided in the policy statements, and then the factors under 18 U.S.C. \xa7\xa03553(a). <em>See\xa0Rita</em>, 551 U.S. at 351. The appellate court engages in a two-step process upon review. The appellate court \u201cfirst ensure[s] that the district court committed no significant procedural error, such as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range\xa0.\xa0.\xa0. [and] then consider[s] the substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed under an abuse-of-discretion standard[,]\xa0.\xa0.\xa0. tak[ing] into account the totality of the circumstances, including the extent of any variance from the Guidelines range.\u201d <em>Gall</em>, 552 U.S. at 51.</p><p>The second and related theme resonant in this line of Supreme Court cases is that, as contemplated by the Sentencing Reform Act, the guidelines are evolutionary in nature. They are the product of the Commission\u2019s fulfillment of its statutory duties to monitor federal sentencing law and practices, to seek public input on the operation of the guidelines, and to revise the guidelines accordingly. As the Court acknowledged in <em>Rita</em>:</p><blockquote><p>The Commission\u2019s work is ongoing. The statutes and the Guidelines themselves foresee continuous evolution helped by the sentencing courts and courts of appeals in that process. The sentencing courts, applying the Guidelines in individual cases may depart (either pursuant to the Guidelines or, since <em>Booker</em>, by imposing a non-Guidelines sentence). The judges will set forth their reasons. The Courts of Appeals will determine the reasonableness of the resulting sentence. The Commission will collect and examine the results. In doing so, it may obtain advice from prosecutors, defenders, law enforcement groups, civil liberties associations, experts in penology, and others. And it can revise the Guidelines accordingly.</p></blockquote><p><em>Rita</em>, 551 U.S. at 350; <em>see also Booker</em>, 543 U.S. at 264 (\u201c[T]he Sentencing Commission remains in place, writing Guidelines, collecting information about actual district court sentencing decisions, undertaking research, and revising the Guidelines accordingly.\u201d); <em>Gall</em>, 552 U.S. at 46 (\u201c[E]ven though the Guidelines are advisory rather than mandatory, they are, as we pointed out in <em>Rita</em>, the product of careful study based on extensive empirical evidence derived from the review of thousands of individual sentencing decisions.\u201d).</p><p>Provisions of the Sentencing Reform Act promote and facilitate this evolutionary process. For example, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \xa7\xa0994(x), the Commission publishes guideline amendment proposals in the <em>Federal Register</em> and conducts hearings to solicit input on those proposals from experts and other members of the public. Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \xa7\xa0994(o), the Commission periodically reviews and revises the guidelines in consideration of comments it receives from members of the federal criminal justice system, including the courts, probation officers, the Department of Justice, the Bureau of Prisons, defense attorneys and the federal public defenders, and in consideration of data it receives from sentencing courts and other sources. Statutory mechanisms such as these bolster the Commission\u2019s ability to take into account fully the purposes of sentencing set forth in 18 U.S.C. \xa7\xa03553(a)(2) in its promulgation of the guidelines.</p><p>Congress retains authority to require certain sentencing practices and may exercise its authority through specific directives to the Commission with respect to the guidelines. As the Supreme Court noted in <em>Kimbrough v. United States</em>, 552 U.S. 85 (2007), \u201cCongress has shown that it knows how to direct sentencing practices in express terms. For example, Congress has specifically required the Sentencing Commission to set Guideline sentences for serious recidivist offenders \u2018at or near\u2019 the statutory maximum.\u201d <em>Id.</em> at 103; 28 U.S.C. \xa7\xa0994(h).</p><p>As envisioned by Congress, implemented by the Commission, and reaffirmed by the Supreme Court, the guidelines are the product of a deliberative and dynamic process that seeks to embody within federal sentencing policy the purposes of sentencing set forth in the Sentencing Reform Act. As such, the guidelines continue to be a key component of federal sentencing and to play an important role in the sentencing court\u2019s determination of an appropriate sentence in any particular case.</p>"},{id:"\xa71A3.1",content:"<p><strong>\xa71A3.1.

The following are definitions of terms that are used frequently in the guidelines and are of general applicability (except to the extent expressly modified in respect to a particular guideline or policy statement):</p><blockquote><p>(A) \u201c<em><strong>Abducted</strong></em>\u201d means that a victim was forced to accompany an offender to a different location. For example, a bank robber\u2019s forcing a bank teller from the bank into a getaway car would constitute an abduction.</p><p>(B) \u201c<em><strong>Bodily injury</strong></em>\u201d means any significant injury; <em>e.g.</em>, an injury that is painful and obvious, or is of a type for which medical attention ordinarily would be sought.</p><p>(C) \u201c<em><strong>Brandished</strong></em>\u201d with reference to a dangerous weapon (including a firearm) means that all or part of the weapon was displayed, or the presence of the weapon was otherwise made known to another person, in order to intimidate that person, regardless of whether the weapon was directly visible to that person. Accordingly, although the dangerous weapon does not have to be directly visible, the weapon must be present.</p><p>(D) \u201c<em><strong>Dangerous weapon</strong></em>\u201d means (i) an instrument capable of inflicting death or serious bodily injury; or (ii) an object that is not an instrument capable of inflicting death or serious bodily injury but (I) closely resembles such an instrument; or (II)\xa0the defendant used the object in a manner that created the impression that the object was such an instrument (<em>e.g.</em> a defendant wrapped a hand in a towel during a bank robbery to create the appearance of a gun).</p><p>(E) \u201c<em><strong>Departure</strong></em>\u201d means (i) for purposes other than those specified in subdivision (ii), imposition of a sentence outside the applicable guideline range or of a sentence that is otherwise different from the guideline sentence; and (ii) for purposes of \xa74A1.3 (Departures Based on Inadequacy of Criminal History Category), assignment of a criminal history category other than the otherwise applicable criminal history category, in order to effect a sentence outside the applicable guideline range. \u201c<em><strong>Depart</strong></em>\u201d means grant a departure.</p><p>\u201c<em><strong>Downward departure</strong></em>\u201d means departure that effects a sentence less than a sentence that could be imposed under the applicable guideline range or a sentence that is otherwise less than the guideline sentence. \u201c<em><strong>Depart downward</strong></em>\u201d means grant a downward departure.</p><p>\u201c<em><strong>Upward departure</strong></em>\u201d means departure that effects a sentence greater than a sentence that could be imposed under the applicable guideline range or a sentence that is otherwise greater than the guideline sentence. \u201c<em><strong>Depart upward</strong></em>\u201d means grant an upward departure.</p><p>(F) \u201c<em><strong>Destructive device</strong></em>\u201d means any article described in 26 U.S.C. \xa7\xa05845(f) (including an explosive, incendiary, or poison gas \u2014 (i) bomb, (ii) grenade, (iii) rocket having a propellant charge of more than four ounces, (iv) missile having an explosive or incendiary charge of more than one-quarter ounce, (v) mine, or (vi) device similar to any of the devices described in the preceding clauses).</p><p>(G) \u201c<em><strong>Firearm</strong></em>\u201d means (i) any weapon (including a starter gun) which will or is designed to or may readily be converted to expel a projectile by the action of an explosive; (ii)\xa0the frame or receiver of any such weapon; (iii) any firearm muffler or silencer; or (iv) any destructive device. A weapon, commonly known as a \u201cBB\u201d or pellet gun, that uses air or carbon dioxide pressure to expel a projectile is a dangerous weapon but not a firearm.</p><p>(H) \u201c<em><strong>Offense</strong></em>\u201d means the offense of conviction and all relevant conduct under \xa71B1.3 (Relevant Conduct) unless a different meaning is specified or is otherwise clear from the context. The term \u201c<em><strong>instant</strong></em>\u201d is used in connection with \u201coffense,\u201d \u201cfederal offense,\u201d or \u201coffense of conviction,\u201d as the case may be, to distinguish the violation for which the defendant is being sentenced from a prior or subsequent offense, or from an offense before another court (<em>e.g.</em>, an offense before a state court involving the same underlying conduct).</p><p>(I) \u201c<em><strong>Otherwise used</strong></em>\u201d with reference to a dangerous weapon (including a firearm) means that the conduct did not amount to the discharge of a firearm but was more than brandishing, displaying, or possessing a firearm or other dangerous weapon.</p><p>(J) \u201c<em><strong>Permanent or life-threatening bodily injury</strong></em>\u201d means injury involving a substantial risk of death; loss or substantial impairment of the function of a bodily member, organ, or mental faculty that is likely to be permanent; or an obvious disfigurement that is likely to be permanent. In the case of a kidnapping, for example, maltreatment to a life-threatening degree (<em>e.g.</em>, by denial of food or medical care) would constitute life-threatening bodily injury.</p><p>(K) \u201c<em><strong>Physically restrained</strong></em>\u201d means the forcible restraint of the victim such as by being tied, bound, or locked up.</p><p>(L) \u201c<em><strong>Serious bodily injury</strong></em>\u201d means injury involving extreme physical pain or the protracted impairment of a function of a bodily member, organ, or mental faculty; or requiring medical intervention such as surgery, hospitalization, or physical rehabilitation. In addition, \u201cserious bodily injury\u201d is deemed to have occurred if the offense involved conduct constituting criminal sexual abuse under 18 U.S.C. \xa7\xa02241 or \xa7\xa02242 or any similar offense under state law.</p></blockquote><p>2. Definitions of terms also may appear in other sections. Such definitions are not designed for general applicability; therefore, their applicability to sections other than those expressly referenced must be determined on a case by case basis.</p><blockquote><p>The term \u201c<em><strong>includes</strong></em>\u201d is not exhaustive; the term \u201c<em><strong>e.g.</strong></em>\u201d is merely illustrative.</p></blockquote><p>3. The list of \u201cStatutory Provisions\u201d in the Commentary to each offense guideline does not necessarily include every statute covered by that guideline. In addition, some statutes may be covered by more than one guideline.</p><p>4. (A) <strong>Cumulative Application of Multiple Adjustments within One Guideline.\u2014</strong>The offense level adjustments from more than one specific offense characteristic within an offense guideline are applied cumulatively (added together) unless the guideline specifies that only the greater (or greatest) is to be used. Within each specific offense characteristic subsection, however, the offense level adjustments are alternative; only the one that best describes the conduct is to be used. For example, in \xa72A2.2(b)(3), pertaining to degree of bodily injury, the subdivision that best describes the level of bodily injury is used; the adjustments for different degrees of bodily injury (subdivisions (A) \u2013 (E)) are not added together.</p><blockquote><p>(B) <strong>Cumulative Application of Multiple Adjustments from Multiple Guidelines.\u2014</strong>Absent an instruction to the contrary, enhancements under Chapter Two, adjustments under Chapter Three, and determinations under Chapter Four are to be applied cumulatively. In some cases, such enhancements, adjustments, and determinations may be triggered by the same conduct. For example, shooting a police officer during the commission of a robbery may warrant an injury enhancement under \xa72B3.1(b)(3) and an official victim adjustment under \xa73A1.2, even though the enhancement and the adjustment both are triggered by the shooting of the officer.</p></blockquote><p>5. Where two or more guideline provisions appear equally applicable, but the guidelines authorize the application of only one such provision, use the provision that results in the greater offense level. <em>E.g.</em>, in \xa72A2.2(b)(2), if a firearm is both discharged and brandished, the provision applicable to the discharge of the firearm would be used.</p><p>6. <strong>Use of Abbreviated Guideline Titles.\u2014</strong>Whenever a guideline makes reference to another guideline, a parenthetical restatement of that other guideline\u2019s heading accompanies the initial reference to that other guideline. This parenthetical is provided only for the convenience of the reader and is not intended to have substantive effect. In the case of lengthy guideline headings, such a parenthetical restatement of the guideline heading may be abbreviated for ease of reference. For example, references to \xa72B1.1 (Larceny, Embezzlement, and Other Forms of Theft; Offenses Involving Stolen Property; Property Damage or Destruction; Fraud and Deceit; Forgery; Offenses Involving Altered or Counterfeit Instruments Other than Counterfeit Bearer Obligations of the United States) may be abbreviated as follows: \xa72B1.1 (Theft, Property Destruction, and Fraud).</p><p><strong>Background:</strong> The court must impose a sentence \u201csufficient, but not greater than necessary,\u201d to comply with the purposes of sentencing set forth in 18 U.S.C. \xa7\xa03553(a)(2). <em>See</em> 18 U.S.C. \xa7\xa03553(a).

This section provides the basic rules for determining the guidelines applicable to the offense conduct under Chapter Two (Offense Conduct). The court is to use the Chapter Two guideline section referenced in the Statutory Index (Appendix A) for the offense of conviction. However, (A) in the case of a plea agreement (written or made orally on the record) containing a stipulation that specifically establishes a more serious offense than the offense of conviction, the Chapter Two offense guideline section applicable to the stipulated offense is to be used; and (B) for statutory provisions not listed in the Statutory Index, the most analogous guideline, determined pursuant to \xa72X5.1 (Other Offenses), is to be used.</p><blockquote><p>In the case of a particular statute that proscribes only a single type of criminal conduct, the offense of conviction and the conduct proscribed by the statute will coincide, and the Statutory Index will specify only one offense guideline for that offense of conviction. In the case of a particular statute that proscribes a variety of conduct that might constitute the subject of different offense guidelines, the Statutory Index may specify more than one offense guideline for that particular statute, and the court will determine which of the referenced guideline sections is most appropriate for the offense conduct charged in the count of which the defendant was convicted. If the offense involved a conspiracy, attempt, or solicitation, refer to \xa72X1.1 (Attempt, Solicitation, or Conspiracy) as well as the guideline referenced in the Statutory Index for the substantive offense. For statutory provisions not listed in the Statutory Index, the most analogous guideline is to be used. <em>See</em>\xa0\xa72X5.1 (Other Offenses).</p><p>As set forth in the first paragraph of this note, an exception to this general rule is that if a plea agreement (written or made orally on the record) contains a stipulation that establishes a more serious offense than the offense of conviction, the guideline section applicable to the stipulated offense is to be used. A factual statement or a stipulation contained in a plea agreement (written or made orally on the record) is a stipulation for purposes of subsection (a) only if both the defendant and the government explicitly agree that the factual statement or stipulation is a stipulation for such purposes. However, a factual statement or stipulation made after the plea agreement has been entered, or after any modification to the plea agreement has been made, is not a stipulation for purposes of subsection (a). The sentence that shall be imposed is limited, however, to the maximum authorized by the statute under which the defendant is convicted. <em>See</em> Chapter Five, Part\xa0G (Implementing the Total Sentence of Imprisonment). For example, if the defendant pleads guilty to theft, but admits the elements of robbery as part of the plea agreement, the robbery guideline is to be applied. The sentence, however, may not exceed the maximum sentence for theft. <em>See</em> H. Rep. 98-1017, 98th Cong., 2d Sess. 99 (1984).</p><p>The exception to the general rule has a practical basis. In a case in which the elements of an offense more serious than the offense of conviction are established by a plea agreement, it may unduly complicate the sentencing process if the applicable guideline does not reflect the seriousness of the defendant\u2019s actual conduct. Without this exception, the court would be forced to use an artificial guideline and then depart from it to the degree the court found necessary based upon the more serious conduct established by the plea agreement. The probation officer would first be required to calculate the guideline for the offense of conviction. However, this guideline might even contain characteristics that are difficult to establish or not very important in the context of the actual offense conduct. As a simple example, \xa72B1.1 (Theft, Property Destruction, and Fraud) contains monetary distinctions which are more significant and more detailed than the monetary distinctions in \xa72B3.1 (Robbery). Then, the probation officer might need to calculate the robbery guideline to assist the court in determining the appropriate degree of departure in a case in which the defendant pled guilty to theft but admitted committing robbery. This cumbersome, artificial procedure is avoided by using the exception rule in guilty or <em>nolo contendere</em> plea cases where it is applicable.</p><p>As with any plea agreement, the court must first determine that the agreement is acceptable, in accordance with the policies stated in Chapter Six, Part B (Plea Agreements). The limited exception provided here applies only after the court has determined that a plea, otherwise fitting the exception, is acceptable.</p></blockquote><p>2. Section 1B1.2(b) directs the court, once it has determined the applicable guideline (<em>i.e.</em>,\xa0the applicable guideline section from Chapter Two) under \xa71B1.2(a) to determine any applicable specific offense characteristics (under that guideline), and any other applicable sentencing factors pursuant to the relevant conduct definition in \xa71B1.3. Where there is more than one base offense level within a particular guideline, the determination of the applicable base offense level is treated in the same manner as a determination of a specific offense characteristic. Accordingly, the \u201crelevant conduct\u201d criteria of \xa71B1.3 are to be used, unless conviction under a specific statute is expressly required.</p><p>3. Subsections (c) and (d) address circumstances in which the provisions of Chapter Three, Part D (Multiple Counts) are to be applied although there may be only one count of conviction. Subsection (c) provides that in the case of a stipulation to the commission of additional offense(s), the guidelines are to be applied as if the defendant had been convicted of an additional count for each of the offenses stipulated. For example, if the defendant is convicted of one count of robbery but, as part of a plea agreement, admits to having committed two additional robberies, the guidelines are to be applied as if the defendant had been convicted of three counts of robbery. Subsection (d) provides that a conviction on a conspiracy count charging conspiracy to commit more than one offense is treated as if the defendant had been convicted of a separate conspiracy count for each offense that he conspired to commit. For example, where a conviction on a single count of conspiracy establishes that the defendant conspired to commit three robberies, the guidelines are to be applied as if the defendant had been convicted on one count of conspiracy to commit the first robbery, one count of conspiracy to commit the second robbery, and one count of conspiracy to commit the third robbery.</p><p>4. Particular care must be taken in applying subsection (d) because there are cases in which the verdict or plea does not establish which offense(s) was the object of the conspiracy. In such cases, subsection (d) should only be applied with respect to an object offense alleged in the conspiracy count if the court, were it sitting as a trier of fact, would convict the defendant of conspiring to commit that object offense. Note, however, if the object offenses specified in the conspiracy count would be grouped together under \xa73D1.2(d) (<em>e.g.</em>, a conspiracy to steal three government checks) it is not necessary to engage in the foregoing analysis, because \xa71B1.3(a)(2) governs consideration of the defendant\u2019s conduct.</p><table><tbody><tr class='odd'><td><em>Historical Note</em></td><td>Effective November 1, 1987.

Under subsections (a)(1) and (a)(2), the focus is on the specific acts and omissions for which the defendant is to be held accountable in determining the applicable guideline range, rather than on whether the defendant is criminally liable for an offense as a principal, accomplice, or conspirator.</p><p>2. <strong>Accountability Under More Than One Provision.\u2014</strong>In certain cases, a defendant may be accountable for particular conduct under more than one subsection of this guideline. If a defendant\u2019s accountability for particular conduct is established under one provision of this guideline, it is not necessary to review alternative provisions under which such accountability might be established.</p><p>3. <strong>Jointly Undertaken Criminal Activity (Subsection (a)(1)(B)).\u2014</strong></p><blockquote><p>(A) <strong>In General.\u2014</strong>A \u201c<em><strong>jointly undertaken criminal activity</strong></em>\u201d is a criminal plan, scheme, endeavor, or enterprise undertaken by the defendant in concert with others, whether or not charged as a conspiracy.</p><p>In the case of a jointly undertaken criminal activity, subsection (a)(1)(B) provides that a defendant is accountable for the conduct (acts and omissions) of others that was:</p><p>(i) within the scope of the jointly undertaken criminal activity;</p><p>(ii) in furtherance of that criminal activity; and</p><p>(iii) reasonably foreseeable in connection with that criminal activity.</p><p>The conduct of others that meets all three criteria set forth in subdivisions (i) through (iii) (<em>i.e.</em>, \u201cwithin the scope,\u201d \u201cin furtherance,\u201d and \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d) is relevant conduct under this provision. However, when the conduct of others does not meet any one of the criteria set forth in subdivisions (i) through (iii), the conduct is not relevant conduct under this provision.</p><p>(B) <strong>Scope.\u2014</strong>Because a count may be worded broadly and include the conduct of many participants over a period of time, the scope of the \u201cjointly undertaken criminal activity\u201d is not necessarily the same as the scope of the entire conspiracy, and hence relevant conduct is not necessarily the same for every participant. In order to determine the defendant\u2019s accountability for the conduct of others under subsection (a)(1)(B), the court must first determine the scope of the criminal activity the particular defendant agreed to jointly undertake (<em>i.e.</em>, the scope of the specific conduct and objectives embraced by the defendant\u2019s agreement). In doing so, the court may consider any explicit agreement or implicit agreement fairly inferred from the conduct of the defendant and others. Accordingly, the accountability of the defendant for the acts of others is limited by the scope of his or her agreement to jointly undertake the particular criminal activity. Acts of others that were not within the scope of the defendant\u2019s agreement, even if those acts were known or reasonably foreseeable to the defendant, are not relevant conduct under subsection (a)(1)(B).</p><p>In cases involving contraband (including controlled substances), the scope of the jointly undertaken criminal activity (and thus the accountability of the defendant for the contraband that was the object of that jointly undertaken activity) may depend upon whether, in the particular circumstances, the nature of the offense is more appropriately viewed as one jointly undertaken criminal activity or as a number of separate criminal activities.</p><p>A defendant\u2019s relevant conduct does not include the conduct of members of a conspiracy prior to the defendant joining the conspiracy, even if the defendant knows of that conduct (<em>e.g.</em>, in the case of a defendant who joins an ongoing drug distribution conspiracy knowing that it had been selling two kilograms of cocaine per week, the cocaine sold prior to the defendant joining the conspiracy is not included as relevant conduct in determining the defendant\u2019s offense level). The Commission does not foreclose the possibility that there may be some unusual set of circumstances in which the exclusion of such conduct may not adequately reflect the defendant\u2019s culpability; in such a case, an upward departure may be warranted.</p><p>(C) <strong>In Furtherance.\u2014</strong>The court must determine if the conduct (acts and omissions) of others was in furtherance of the jointly undertaken criminal activity.</p><p>(D) <strong>Reasonably Foreseeable.\u2014</strong>The court must then determine if the conduct (acts and omissions) of others that was within the scope of, and in furtherance of, the jointly undertaken criminal activity was reasonably foreseeable in connection with that criminal activity.</p><p>Note that the criminal activity that the defendant agreed to jointly undertake, and the reasonably foreseeable conduct of others in furtherance of that criminal activity, are not necessarily identical. For example, two defendants agree to commit a robbery and, during the course of that robbery, the first defendant assaults and injures a victim. The second defendant is accountable for the assault and injury to the victim (even if the second defendant had not agreed to the assault and had cautioned the first defendant to be careful not to hurt anyone) because the assaultive conduct was within the scope of the jointly undertaken criminal activity (the robbery), was in furtherance of that criminal activity (the robbery), and was reasonably foreseeable in connection with that criminal activity (given the nature of the offense).</p><p>With respect to offenses involving contraband (including controlled substances), the defendant is accountable under subsection (a)(1)(A) for all quantities of contraband with which he was directly involved and, in the case of a jointly undertaken criminal activity under subsection (a)(1)(B), all quantities of contraband that were involved in transactions carried out by other participants, if those transactions were within the scope of, and in furtherance of, the jointly undertaken criminal activity and were reasonably foreseeable in connection with that criminal activity.</p><p>The requirement of reasonable foreseeability applies only in respect to the conduct (<em>i.e.</em>, acts and omissions) of others under subsection (a)(1)(B). It does not apply to conduct that the defendant personally undertakes, aids, abets, counsels, commands, induces, procures, or willfully causes; such conduct is addressed under subsection (a)(1)(A).</p></blockquote><p>4. <strong>Illustrations of Conduct for Which the Defendant is Accountable under Subsections (a)(1)(A) and (B).\u2014</strong></p><blockquote><p>(A) <strong>Acts and omissions aided or abetted by the defendant.\u2014</strong></p><p>(i) Defendant A is one of ten persons hired by Defendant B to off-load a ship containing marihuana. The off-loading of the ship is interrupted by law enforcement officers and one ton of marihuana is seized (the amount on the ship as well as the amount off-loaded). Defendant A and the other off-loaders are arrested and convicted of importation of marihuana. Regardless of the number of bales he personally unloaded, Defendant A is accountable for the entire one-ton quantity of marihuana. Defendant A aided and abetted the off-loading of the entire shipment of marihuana by directly participating in the off-loading of that shipment (<em>i.e.</em>, the specific objective of the criminal activity he joined was the off-loading of the entire shipment). Therefore, he is accountable for the entire shipment under subsection (a)(1)(A) without regard to the issue of reasonable foreseeability. This is conceptually similar to the case of a defendant who transports a suitcase knowing that it contains a controlled substance and, therefore, is accountable for the controlled substance in the suitcase regardless of his knowledge or lack of knowledge of the actual type or amount of that controlled substance.</p><p>In certain cases, a defendant may be accountable for particular conduct under more than one subsection of this guideline. As noted in the preceding paragraph, Defendant A is accountable for the entire one-ton shipment of marihuana under subsection (a)(1)(A). Defendant A also is accountable for the entire one-ton shipment of marihuana on the basis of subsection (a)(1)(B) (applying to a jointly undertaken criminal activity). Defendant A engaged in a jointly undertaken criminal activity and all three criteria of subsection\xa0(a)(1)(B) are met. First, the conduct was within the scope of the criminal activity (the importation of the shipment of marihuana). Second, the off-loading of the shipment of marihuana was in furtherance of the criminal activity, as described above. And third, a finding that the one-ton quantity of marihuana was reasonably foreseeable is warranted from the nature of the undertaking itself (the importation of marihuana by ship typically involves very large quantities of marihuana). The specific circumstances of the case (the defendant was one of ten persons off-loading the marihuana in bales) also support this finding. In an actual case, of course, if a defendant\u2019s accountability for particular conduct is established under one provision of this guideline, it is not necessary to review alternative provisions under which such accountability might be established. <em>See</em> Application Note 2.</p><p>(B) <strong>Acts and omissions aided or abetted by the defendant; acts and omissions in a jointly undertaken criminal activity.\u2014</strong></p><p>(i) Defendant C is the getaway driver in an armed bank robbery in which $15,000 is taken and a teller is assaulted and injured. Defendant C is accountable for the money taken under subsection (a)(1)(A) because he aided and abetted the act of taking the money (the taking of money was the specific objective of the offense he joined). Defendant C is accountable for the injury to the teller under subsection (a)(1)(B) because the assault on the teller was within the scope and in furtherance of the jointly undertaken criminal activity (the robbery), and was reasonably foreseeable in connection with that criminal activity (given the nature of the offense).</p><p>As noted earlier, a defendant may be accountable for particular conduct under more than one subsection. In this example, Defendant C also is accountable for the money taken on the basis of subsection (a)(1)(B) because the taking of money was within the scope and in furtherance of the jointly undertaken criminal activity (the robbery), and was reasonably foreseeable (as noted, the taking of money was the specific objective of the jointly undertaken criminal activity).</p><p>(C) <strong>Requirements that the conduct of others be within the scope of the jointly undertaken criminal activity, in furtherance of that criminal activity, and reasonably foreseeable.\u2014</strong></p><p>(i) Defendant D pays Defendant E a small amount to forge an endorsement on an $800 stolen government check. Unknown to Defendant E, Defendant D then uses that check as a down payment in a scheme to fraudulently obtain $15,000 worth of merchandise. Defendant E is convicted of forging the $800 check and is accountable for the forgery of this check under subsection (a)(1)(A). Defendant E is not accountable for the $15,000 because the fraudulent scheme to obtain $15,000 was not within the scope of the jointly undertaken criminal activity (<em>i.e.</em>, the forgery of the $800 check).</p><p>(ii) Defendants F and G, working together, design and execute a scheme to sell fraudulent stocks by telephone. Defendant F fraudulently obtains $20,000. Defendant G fraudulently obtains $35,000. Each is convicted of mail fraud. Defendants F and G each are accountable for the entire amount ($55,000). Each defendant is accountable for the amount he personally obtained under subsection (a)(1)(A). Each defendant is accountable for the amount obtained by his accomplice under subsection (a)(1)(B) because the conduct of each was within the scope of the jointly undertaken criminal activity (the scheme to sell fraudulent stocks), was in furtherance of that criminal activity, and was reasonably foreseeable in connection with that criminal activity.</p><p>(iii) Defendants H and I engaged in an ongoing marihuana importation conspiracy in which Defendant J was hired only to help off-load a single shipment. Defendants H, I, and J are included in a single count charging conspiracy to import marihuana. Defendant J is accountable for the entire single shipment of marihuana he helped import under subsection (a)(1)(A) and any acts and omissions of others related to the importation of that shipment on the basis of subsection (a)(1)(B) (<em>see</em> the discussion in example (A)(i) above). He is not accountable for prior or subsequent shipments of marihuana imported by Defendants H or I because those acts were not within the scope of his jointly undertaken criminal activity (the importation of the single shipment of marihuana).</p><p>(iv) Defendant K is a wholesale distributor of child pornography. Defendant L is a retail-level dealer who purchases child pornography from Defendant K and resells it, but otherwise operates independently of Defendant K. Similarly, Defendant M is a retail-level dealer who purchases child pornography from Defendant K and resells it, but otherwise operates independently of Defendant K. Defendants L and M are aware of each other\u2019s criminal activity but operate independently. Defendant N is Defendant K\u2019s assistant who recruits customers for Defendant K and frequently supervises the deliveries to Defendant K\u2019s customers. Each defendant is convicted of a count charging conspiracy to distribute child pornography. Defendant K is accountable under subsection (a)(1)(A) for the entire quantity of child pornography sold to Defendants L and\xa0M. Defendant N also is accountable for the entire quantity sold to those defendants under subsection (a)(1)(B) because the entire quantity was within the scope of his jointly undertaken criminal activity (to distribute child pornography with Defendant K), in furtherance of that criminal activity, and reasonably foreseeable. Defendant L is accountable under subsection (a)(1)(A) only for the quantity of child pornography that he purchased from Defendant\xa0K because he is not engaged in a jointly undertaken criminal activity with the other defendants. For the same reason, Defendant M is accountable under subsection (a)(1)(A) only for the quantity of child pornography that he purchased from Defendant K.</p><p>(v) Defendant O knows about her boyfriend\u2019s ongoing drug-trafficking activity, but agrees to participate on only one occasion by making a delivery for him at his request when he was ill. Defendant O is accountable under subsection (a)(1)(A) for the drug quantity involved on that one occasion. Defendant O is not accountable for the other drug sales made by her boyfriend because those sales were not within the scope of her jointly undertaken criminal activity (<em>i.e.</em>, the one delivery).</p><p>(vi) Defendant P is a street-level drug dealer who knows of other street-level drug dealers in the same geographic area who sell the same type of drug as he sells. Defendant P and the other dealers share a common source of supply, but otherwise operate independently. Defendant P is not accountable for the quantities of drugs sold by the other street-level drug dealers because he is not engaged in a jointly undertaken criminal activity with them. In contrast, Defendant Q, another street-level drug dealer, pools his resources and profits with four other street-level drug dealers. Defendant Q is engaged in a jointly undertaken criminal activity and, therefore, he is accountable under subsection (a)(1)(B) for the quantities of drugs sold by the four other dealers during the course of his joint undertaking with them because those sales were within the scope of the jointly undertaken criminal activity, in furtherance of that criminal activity, and reasonably foreseeable in connection with that criminal activity.</p><p>(vii) Defendant R recruits Defendant S to distribute 500 grams of cocaine. Defendant S knows that Defendant R is the prime figure in a conspiracy involved in importing much larger quantities of cocaine. As long as Defendant S\u2019s agreement and conduct is limited to the distribution of the 500 grams, Defendant S is accountable only for that 500 gram amount (under subsection (a)(1)(A)), rather than the much larger quantity imported by Defendant R. Defendant S is not accountable under subsection (a)(1)(B) for the other quantities imported by Defendant R because those quantities were not within the scope of his jointly undertaken criminal activity (<em>i.e.</em>, the 500 grams).</p><p>(viii) Defendants T, U, V, and W are hired by a supplier to backpack a quantity of marihuana across the border from Mexico into the United States. Defendants\xa0T, U, V, and W receive their individual shipments from the supplier at the same time and coordinate their importation efforts by walking across the border together for mutual assistance and protection. Each defendant is accountable for the aggregate quantity of marihuana transported by the four defendants. The four defendants engaged in a jointly undertaken criminal activity, the object of which was the importation of the four backpacks containing marihuana (subsection (a)(1)(B)), and aided and abetted each other\u2019s actions (subsection (a)(1)(A)) in carrying out the jointly undertaken criminal activity (which under subsection (a)(1)(B) were also in furtherance of, and reasonably foreseeable in connection with, the criminal activity). In contrast, if Defendants T, U, V, and W were hired individually, transported their individual shipments at different times, and otherwise operated independently, each defendant would be accountable only for the quantity of marihuana he personally transported (subsection (a)(1)(A)). As this example illustrates, the scope of the jointly undertaken criminal activity may depend upon whether, in the particular circumstances, the nature of the offense is more appropriately viewed as one jointly undertaken criminal activity or as a number of separate criminal activities. <em>See</em> Application Note 3(B).</p></blockquote><p>5. <strong>Application of Subsection (a)(2).\u2014</strong></p><blockquote><p>(A) <strong>Relationship to Grouping of Multiple Counts.\u2014</strong>\u201cOffenses of a character for which \xa73D1.2(d) would require grouping of multiple counts,\u201d as used in subsection (a)(2), applies to offenses for which grouping of counts would be required under \xa73D1.2(d) had the defendant been convicted of multiple counts. Application of this provision does not require the defendant, in fact, to have been convicted of multiple counts. For example, where the defendant engaged in three drug sales of 10, 15, and 20 grams of cocaine, as part of the same course of conduct or common scheme or plan, subsection (a)(2) provides that the total quantity of cocaine involved (45\xa0grams) is to be used to determine the offense level even if the defendant is convicted of a single count charging only one of the sales. If the defendant is convicted of multiple counts for the above noted sales, the grouping rules of Chapter Three, Part D (Multiple Counts) provide that the counts are grouped together. Although Chapter Three, Part D (Multiple Counts) applies to multiple counts of conviction, it does not limit the scope of subsection (a)(2). Subsection (a)(2) merely incorporates by reference the types of offenses set forth in \xa73D1.2(d); thus, as discussed above, multiple counts of conviction are not required for subsection (a)(2) to apply.</p><p>As noted above, subsection (a)(2) applies to offenses of a character for which \xa73D1.2(d) would require grouping of multiple counts, had the defendant been convicted of multiple counts. For example, the defendant sells 30 grams of cocaine (a violation of 21 U.S.C. \xa7\xa0841) on one occasion and, as part of the same course of conduct or common scheme or plan, attempts to sell an additional 15 grams of cocaine (a violation of 21 U.S.C. \xa7\xa0846) on another occasion. The defendant is convicted of one count charging the completed sale of 30 grams of cocaine. The two offenses (sale of cocaine and attempted sale of cocaine), although covered by different statutory provisions, are of a character for which \xa73D1.2(d) would require the grouping of counts, had the defendant been convicted of both counts. Therefore, subsection\xa0(a)(2) applies and the total amount of cocaine (45 grams) involved is used to determine the offense level.</p><p>(B) <strong>\u201cSame Course of Conduct or Common Scheme or Plan\u201d.\u2014</strong>\u201cCommon scheme or plan\u201d and \u201csame course of conduct\u201d are two closely related concepts.</p><p>(i) <strong>Common scheme or plan.</strong> For two or more offenses to constitute part of a common scheme or plan, they must be substantially connected to each other by at least one common factor, such as common victims, common accomplices, common purpose, or similar <em>modus operandi</em>. For example, the conduct of five defendants who together defrauded a group of investors by computer manipulations that unlawfully transferred funds over an eighteen-month period would qualify as a common scheme or plan on the basis of any of the above listed factors; <em>i.e.</em>, the commonality of victims (the same investors were defrauded on an ongoing basis), commonality of offenders (the conduct constituted an ongoing conspiracy), commonality of purpose (to defraud the group of investors), or similarity of <em>modus operandi</em> (the same or similar computer manipulations were used to execute the scheme).</p><p>(ii) <strong>Same course of conduct</strong>. Offenses that do not qualify as part of a common scheme or plan may nonetheless qualify as part of the same course of conduct if they are sufficiently connected or related to each other as to warrant the conclusion that they are part of a single episode, spree, or ongoing series of offenses. Factors that are appropriate to the determination of whether offenses are sufficiently connected or related to each other to be considered as part of the same course of conduct include the degree of similarity of the offenses, the regularity (repetitions) of the offenses, and the time interval between the offenses. When one of the above factors is absent, a stronger presence of at least one of the other factors is required. For example, where the conduct alleged to be relevant is relatively remote to the offense of conviction, a stronger showing of similarity or regularity is necessary to compensate for the absence of temporal proximity. The nature of the offenses may also be a relevant consideration (<em>e.g.</em>, a defendant\u2019s failure to file tax returns in three consecutive years appropriately would be considered as part of the same course of conduct because such returns are only required at yearly intervals).</p><p>(C) <strong>Conduct Associated with a Prior Sentence.\u2014</strong>For the purposes of subsection\xa0(a)(2), offense conduct associated with a sentence that was imposed prior to the acts or omissions constituting the instant federal offense (the offense of conviction) is not considered as part of the same course of conduct or common scheme or plan as the offense of conviction.</p><p><strong>Examples:</strong> (1) The defendant was convicted for the sale of cocaine and sentenced to state prison. Immediately upon release from prison, he again sold cocaine to the same person, using the same accomplices and <em>modus operandi</em>. The instant federal offense (the offense of conviction) charges this latter sale. In this example, the offense conduct relevant to the state prison sentence is considered as prior criminal history, not as part of the same course of conduct or common scheme or plan as the offense of conviction. The prior state prison sentence is counted under Chapter Four (Criminal History and Criminal Livelihood). (2) The defendant engaged in two cocaine sales constituting part of the same course of conduct or common scheme or plan. Subsequently, he is arrested by state authorities for the first sale and by federal authorities for the second sale. He is convicted in state court for the first sale and sentenced to imprisonment; he is then convicted in federal court for the second sale. In this case, the cocaine sales are not separated by an intervening sentence. Therefore, under subsection (a)(2), the cocaine sale associated with the state conviction is considered as relevant conduct to the instant federal offense. The state prison sentence for that sale is not counted as a prior sentence; <em>see</em> \xa74A1.2(a)(1).</p><p>Note, however, in certain cases, offense conduct associated with a previously imposed sentence may be expressly charged in the offense of conviction. Unless otherwise provided, such conduct will be considered relevant conduct under subsection\xa0(a)(1), not (a)(2).</p></blockquote><p>6. <strong>Application of Subsection (a)(3).\u2014</strong></p><blockquote><p>(A) <strong>Definition of \u201cHarm\u201d.\u2014</strong>\u201c<em><strong>Harm</strong></em>\u201d includes bodily injury, monetary loss, property damage and any resulting harm.</p><p>(B) <strong>Risk or Danger of Harm.\u2014</strong>If the offense guideline includes creating a risk or danger of harm as a specific offense characteristic, whether that risk or danger was created is to be considered in determining the offense level. <em>See, e.g.</em>, \xa72K1.4 (Arson; Property Damage by Use of Explosives); \xa72Q1.2 (Mishandling of Hazardous or Toxic Substances or Pesticides). If, however, the guideline refers only to harm sustained (<em>e.g.</em>, \xa72A2.2 (Aggravated Assault); \xa72B3.1 (Robbery)) or to actual, attempted or intended harm (<em>e.g.</em>, \xa72B1.1 (Theft, Property Destruction, and Fraud); \xa72X1.1 (Attempt, Solicitation, or Conspiracy)), the risk created enters into the determination of the offense level only insofar as it is incorporated into the base offense level. Unless clearly indicated by the guidelines, harm that is merely risked is not to be treated as the equivalent of harm that occurred. In a case in which creation of risk is not adequately taken into account by the applicable offense guideline, an upward departure may be warranted. <em>See generally</em> \xa71B1.4 (Information to be Used in Imposing Sentence); \xa75K2.0 (Grounds for Departure). The extent to which harm that was attempted or intended enters into the determination of the offense level should be determined in accordance with \xa72X1.1 (Attempt, Solicitation, or Conspiracy) and the applicable offense guideline.</p></blockquote><p>7. <strong>Factors Requiring Conviction under a Specific Statute.\u2014</strong>A particular guideline (in the base offense level or in a specific offense characteristic) may expressly direct that a particular factor be applied only if the defendant was convicted of a particular statute. For example, in \xa72S1.1 (Laundering of Monetary Instruments; Engaging in Monetary Transactions in Property Derived from Unlawful Activity), subsection (b)(2)(B) applies if the defendant \u201cwas convicted under 18 U.S.C. \xa7\xa01956\u201d. Unless such an express direction is included, conviction under the statute is not required. Thus, use of a statutory reference to describe a particular set of circumstances does not require a conviction under the referenced statute. An example of this usage is found in \xa72A3.4(a)(2) (\u201cif the offense involved conduct described in 18 U.S.C. \xa7\xa02242\u201d).</p><blockquote><p>Unless otherwise specified, an express direction to apply a particular factor only if the defendant was convicted of a particular statute includes the determination of the offense level where the defendant was convicted of conspiracy, attempt, solicitation, aiding or abetting, accessory after the fact, or misprision of felony in respect to that particular statute. For example, \xa72S1.1(b)(2)(B) (which is applicable only if the defendant is convicted under 18 U.S.C. \xa7\xa01956) would be applied in determining the offense level under \xa72X3.1 (Accessory After the Fact) in a case in which the defendant was convicted of accessory after the fact to a violation of 18 U.S.C. \xa7\xa01956 but would not be applied in a case in which the defendant is convicted of a conspiracy under 18 U.S.C. \xa7\xa01956(h) and the sole object of that conspiracy was to commit an offense set forth in 18 U.S.C. \xa7\xa01957. <em>See</em>\xa0Application Note 3(C) of \xa72S1.1.</p></blockquote><p>8. <strong>Partially Completed Offense.\u2014</strong>In the case of a partially completed offense (<em>e.g.</em>, an offense involving an attempted theft of $800,000 and a completed theft of $30,000), the offense level is to be determined in accordance with \xa72X1.1 (Attempt, Solicitation, or Conspiracy) whether the conviction is for the substantive offense, the inchoate offense (attempt, solicitation, or conspiracy), or both. <em>See</em> Application Note 4 in the Commentary to \xa72X1.1. Note, however, that Application Note 4 is not applicable where the offense level is determined under \xa72X1.1(c)(1).</p><p>9. <strong>Solicitation, Misprision, or Accessory After the Fact.\u2014</strong>In the case of solicitation, misprision, or accessory after the fact, the conduct for which the defendant is accountable includes all conduct relevant to determining the offense level for the underlying offense that was known, or reasonably should have been known, by the defendant.</p><p><strong>Background:</strong> This section prescribes rules for determining the applicable guideline sentencing range, whereas \xa71B1.4 (Information to be Used in Imposing Sentence) governs the range of information that the court may consider in adjudging sentence once the guideline sentencing range has been determined. Conduct that is not formally charged or is not an element of the offense of conviction may enter into the determination of the applicable guideline sentencing range. The range of information that may be considered at sentencing is broader than the range of information upon which the applicable sentencing range is determined.</p><p>Subsection (a) establishes a rule of construction by specifying, in the absence of more explicit instructions in the context of a specific guideline, the range of conduct that is relevant to determining the applicable offense level (except for the determination of the applicable offense guideline, which is governed by \xa71B1.2(a)). No such rule of construction is necessary with respect to Chapters Four and Five because the guidelines in those Chapters are explicit as to the specific factors to be considered.</p><p>Subsection (a)(2) provides for consideration of a broader range of conduct with respect to one class of offenses, primarily certain property, tax, fraud and drug offenses for which the guidelines depend substantially on quantity, than with respect to other offenses such as assault, robbery and burglary. The distinction is made on the basis of \xa73D1.2(d), which provides for grouping together (<em>i.e.</em>, treating as a single count) all counts charging offenses of a type covered by this subsection. However, the applicability of subsection (a)(2) does not depend upon whether multiple counts are alleged. Thus, in an embezzlement case, for example, embezzled funds that may not be specified in any count of conviction are nonetheless included in determining the offense level if they were part of the same course of conduct or part of the same scheme or plan as the count of conviction. Similarly, in a drug distribution case, quantities and types of drugs not specified in the count of conviction are to be included in determining the offense level if they were part of the same course of conduct or part of a common scheme or plan as the count of conviction. On the other hand, in a robbery case in which the defendant robbed two banks, the amount of money taken in one robbery would <em>not</em> be taken into account in determining the guideline range for the other robbery, even if both robberies were part of a single course of conduct or the same scheme or plan. (This is true whether the defendant is convicted of one or both robberies.)</p><p>Subsections (a)(1) and (a)(2) adopt different rules because offenses of the character dealt with in subsection (a)(2) (<em>i.e.</em>, to which \xa73D1.2(d) applies) often involve a pattern of misconduct that cannot readily be broken into discrete, identifiable units that are meaningful for purposes of sentencing. For example, a pattern of embezzlement may consist of several acts of taking that cannot separately be identified, even though the overall conduct is clear. In addition, the distinctions that the law makes as to what constitutes separate counts or offenses often turn on technical elements that are not especially meaningful for purposes of sentencing. Thus, in a mail fraud case, the scheme is an element of the offense and each mailing may be the basis for a separate count; in an embezzlement case, each taking may provide a basis for a separate count. Another consideration is that in a pattern of small thefts, for example, it is important to take into account the full range of related conduct. Relying on the entire range of conduct, regardless of the number of counts that are alleged or on which a conviction is obtained, appears to be the most reasonable approach to writing workable guidelines for these offenses. Conversely, when \xa73D1.2(d) does not apply, so that convictions on multiple counts are considered separately in determining the guideline sentencing range, the guidelines prohibit aggregation of quantities from other counts in order to prevent \u201cdouble counting\u201d of the conduct and harm from each count of conviction. Continuing offenses present similar practical problems. The reference to \xa73D1.2(d), which provides for grouping of multiple counts arising out of a continuing offense when the offense guideline takes the continuing nature into account, also prevents double counting.</p><p>Subsection (a)(4) requires consideration of any other information specified in the applicable guideline. For example, \xa72A1.4 (Involuntary Manslaughter) specifies consideration of the defendant\u2019s state of mind; \xa72K1.4 (Arson; Property Damage By Use of Explosives) specifies consideration of the risk of harm created.</p><table><tbody><tr class='odd'><td><em>Historical Note</em></td><td>Effective November 1, 1987.

The section is based on 18 U.S.C. \xa7\xa03661, which recodifies 18 U.S.C. \xa7\xa03577. The recodification of this 1970 statute in 1984 with an effective date of 1987 (99 Stat. 1728), makes it clear that Congress intended that no limitation would be placed on the information that a court may consider in imposing an appropriate sentence under the future guideline sentencing system. A court is not precluded from considering information that the guidelines do not take into account in determining a sentence within the guideline range or from considering that information in determining whether and to what extent to depart from the guidelines. For example, if the defendant committed two robberies, but as part of a plea negotiation entered a guilty plea to only one, the robbery that was not taken into account by the guidelines would provide a reason for sentencing at the top of the guideline range and may provide a reason for an upward departure. Some policy statements do, however, express a Commission policy that certain factors should not be considered for any purpose, or should be considered only for limited purposes. <em>See, e.g.</em>, Chapter Five, Part H (Specific Offender Characteristics).</p><table><tbody><tr class='odd'><td><em>Historical Note</em></td><td>Effective November 1, 1987.

Such references incorporate the specific offense characteristics, cross references, and special instructions as well as the base offense level.

Where there is more than one such other offense, the most serious such offense (or group of closely related offenses in the case of offenses that would be grouped together under \xa73D1.2(d)) is to be used. For example, if a defendant convicted of possession of a firearm by a felon, to which \xa72K2.1 (Unlawful Receipt, Possession, or Transportation of Firearms or Ammunition; Prohibited Transactions Involving Firearms or Ammunition) applies, is found to have possessed that firearm during commission of a series of offenses, the cross reference at \xa72K2.1(c) is applied to the offense resulting in the greatest offense level.</p><table><tbody><tr class='odd'><td><em>Historical Note</em></td><td>Effective November 1, 1987.

This provision does not authorize the government to withhold information from the court but provides that self-incriminating information obtained under a cooperation agreement is not to be used to determine the defendant\u2019s guideline range. Under this provision, for example, if a defendant is arrested in possession of a kilogram of cocaine and, pursuant to an agreement to provide information concerning the unlawful activities of co-conspirators, admits that he assisted in the importation of an additional three kilograms of cocaine, a fact not previously known to the government, this admission would not be used to increase his applicable guideline range, except to the extent provided in the agreement. Although the guideline itself affects only the determination of the guideline range, the policy of the Commission, as a corollary, is that information prohibited from being used to determine the applicable guideline range shall not be used to depart upward. In contrast, subsection (b)(5) provides that consideration of such information is appropriate in determining whether, and to what extent, a downward departure is warranted pursuant to a government motion under \xa75K1.1 (Substantial Assistance to Authorities); <em>e.g.</em>, a court may refuse to depart downward on the basis of such information.</p><p>2. Subsection (b)(2) prohibits any cooperation agreement from restricting the use of information as to the existence of prior convictions and sentences in determining adjustments under \xa74A1.1 (Criminal History Category) and \xa74B1.1 (Career Offender). The probation office generally will secure information relevant to the defendant\u2019s criminal history independent of information the defendant provides as part of his cooperation agreement.</p><p>3. On occasion the defendant will provide incriminating information to the government during plea negotiation sessions before a cooperation agreement has been reached. In the event no agreement is reached, use of such information in a sentencing proceeding is restricted by Rule 11(f) (Admissibility or Inadmissibility of a Plea, Plea Discussions, and Related Statements) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure and Rule 410 (Pleas, Plea Discussions, and Related Statements) of the Rules of Evidence.</p><p>4. As with the statutory provisions governing use immunity, 18 U.S.C. \xa7\xa06002, this guideline does not apply to information used against the defendant in a prosecution for perjury, giving a false statement, or in the event the defendant otherwise fails to comply with the cooperation agreement.</p><p>5. This guideline limits the use of certain incriminating information furnished by a defendant in the context of a defendant-government agreement for the defendant to provide information concerning the unlawful activities of other persons. The guideline operates as a limitation on the use of such incriminating information in determining the applicable guideline range, and not merely as a restriction of the government\u2019s presentation of such information (<em>e.g.</em>, where the defendant, subsequent to having entered into a cooperation agreement, provides such information to the probation officer preparing the presentence report, the use of such information remains protected by this section).</p><p>6.

Specifically, as provided in subsection (b)(2)(A), if the term of imprisonment imposed was within the guideline range applicable to the defendant at the time of sentencing, the court may reduce the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment to a term that is no less than the minimum term of imprisonment provided by the amended guideline range determined under subsection (b)(1). For example, in a case in which: (A) the guideline range applicable to the defendant at the time of sentencing was 70 to 87 months; (B) the term of imprisonment imposed was 70 months; and (C) the amended guideline range determined under subsection (b)(1) is 51 to 63 months, the court may reduce the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment, but shall not reduce it to a term less than 51 months.</p><blockquote><p>If the term of imprisonment imposed was outside the guideline range applicable to the defendant at the time of sentencing, the limitation in subsection (b)(2)(A) also applies. Thus, if the term of imprisonment imposed in the example provided above was not a sentence of 70 months (within the guidelines range) but instead was a sentence of 56\xa0months (constituting a downward departure or variance), the court likewise may reduce the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment, but shall not reduce it to a term less than 51\xa0months.</p><p>Subsection (b)(2)(B) provides an exception to this limitation, which applies if the term of imprisonment imposed was less than the term of imprisonment provided by the guideline range applicable to the defendant at the time of sentencing pursuant to a government motion to reflect the defendant\u2019s substantial assistance to authorities. In such a case, the court may reduce the defendant\u2019s term, but the reduction is not limited by subsection (b)(2)(A) to the minimum of the amended guideline range. Instead, as provided in subsection (b)(2)(B), the court may, if appropriate, provide a reduction comparably less than the amended guideline range. Thus, if the term of imprisonment imposed in the example provided above was 56 months pursuant to a government motion to reflect the defendant\u2019s substantial assistance to authorities (representing a downward departure of 20 percent below the minimum term of imprisonment provided by the guideline range applicable to the defendant at the time of sentencing), a reduction to a term of imprisonment of 41 months (representing a reduction of approximately 20 percent below the minimum term of imprisonment provided by the amended guideline range) would amount to a comparable reduction and may be appropriate.</p><p>The provisions authorizing such a government motion are \xa75K1.1 (Substantial Assistance to Authorities) (authorizing, upon government motion, a downward departure based on the defendant\u2019s substantial assistance); 18 U.S.C. \xa7\xa03553(e) (authorizing the court, upon government motion, to impose a sentence below a statutory minimum to reflect the defendant\u2019s substantial assistance); and Fed. R. Crim. P. 35(b) (authorizing the court, upon government motion, to reduce a sentence to reflect the defendant\u2019s substantial assistance).</p><p>In no case, however, shall the term of imprisonment be reduced below time served. <em>See</em>\xa0subsection (b)(2)(C). Subject to these limitations, the sentencing court has the discretion to determine whether, and to what extent, to reduce a term of imprisonment under this section.</p></blockquote><p>4. <strong>Application of Subsection (c).\u2014</strong>As stated in subsection (c), if the case involves a statutorily required minimum sentence and the court had the authority to impose a sentence below the statutorily required minimum sentence pursuant to a government motion to reflect the defendant\u2019s substantial assistance to authorities, then for purposes of this policy statement the amended guideline range shall be determined without regard to the operation of \xa75G1.1 (Sentencing on a Single Count of Conviction) and \xa75G1.2 (Sentencing on Multiple Counts of Conviction). For example:</p><blockquote><p>(A) Defendant A is subject to a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment of 120\xa0months. The original guideline range at the time of sentencing was 135 to 168\xa0months, which is entirely above the mandatory minimum, and the court imposed a sentence of 101 months pursuant to a government motion to reflect the defendant\u2019s substantial assistance to authorities. The court determines that the amended guideline range as calculated on the Sentencing Table is 108 to 135\xa0months. Ordinarily, \xa75G1.1 would operate to restrict the amended guideline range to 120 to 135 months, to reflect the mandatory minimum term of imprisonment. For purposes of this policy statement, however, the amended guideline range remains 108 to 135 months.</p><p>To the extent the court considers it appropriate to provide a reduction comparably less than the amended guideline range pursuant to subsection (b)(2)(B), Defendant A\u2019s original sentence of 101 months amounted to a reduction of approximately 25\xa0percent below the minimum of the original guideline range of 135 months. Therefore, an amended sentence of 81 months (representing a reduction of approximately 25 percent below the minimum of the amended guideline range of 108\xa0months) would amount to a comparable reduction and may be appropriate.</p><p>(B) Defendant B is subject to a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment of 120\xa0months. The original guideline range at the time of sentencing (as calculated on the Sentencing Table) was 108 to 135 months, which was restricted by operation of \xa75G1.1 to a range of 120 to 135 months. <em>See</em> \xa75G1.1(c)(2). The court imposed a sentence of 90 months pursuant to a government motion to reflect the defendant\u2019s substantial assistance to authorities. The court determines that the amended guideline range as calculated on the Sentencing Table is 87 to 108 months. Ordinarily, \xa75G1.1 would operate to restrict the amended guideline range to precisely 120 months, to reflect the mandatory minimum term of imprisonment. <em>See</em>\xa0\xa75G1.1(b). For purposes of this policy statement, however, the amended guideline range is considered to be 87 to 108 months (<em>i.e.</em>, unrestricted by operation of \xa75G1.1 and the statutory minimum of 120 months).</p><p>To the extent the court considers it appropriate to provide a reduction comparably less than the amended guideline range pursuant to subsection (b)(2)(B), Defendant B\u2019s original sentence of 90 months amounted to a reduction of approximately 25\xa0percent below the original guideline range of 120 months. Therefore, an amended sentence of 65 months (representing a reduction of approximately 25 percent below the minimum of the amended guideline range of 87 months) would amount to a comparable reduction and may be appropriate.</p></blockquote><p>5. <strong>Application to Amendment 750 (Parts A and C Only).\u2014</strong>As specified in subsection (d), the parts of Amendment 750 that are covered by this policy statement are Parts A and C only. Part A amended the Drug Quantity Table in \xa72D1.1 for crack cocaine and made related revisions to the Drug Equivalency Tables in the Commentary to \xa72D1.1 (<em>see</em>\xa0\xa72D1.1, comment.

Part C deleted the cross reference in \xa72D2.1(b) under which an offender who possessed more than 5 grams of crack cocaine was sentenced under \xa72D1.1.</p><p>6. <strong>Application to Amendment 782.\u2014</strong>As specified in subsection (d) and (e)(1), Amendment 782 (generally revising the Drug Quantity Table and chemical quantity tables across drug and chemical types) is covered by this policy statement only in cases in which the order reducing the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment has an effective date of November 1, 2015, or later.</p><blockquote><p>A reduction based on retroactive application of Amendment 782 that does not comply with the requirement that the order take effect on November 1, 2015, or later is not consistent with this policy statement and therefore is not authorized under 18 U.S.C. \xa7\xa03582(c)(2).</p><p>Subsection (e)(1) does not preclude the court from conducting sentence reduction proceedings and entering orders under 18 U.S.C. \xa7\xa03582(c)(2) and this policy statement before November\xa01, 2015, provided that any order reducing the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment has an effective date of November 1, 2015, or later.</p></blockquote><p>7. <strong>Supervised Release.\u2014</strong></p><blockquote><p>(A) <strong>Exclusion Relating to Revocation.\u2014</strong>Only a term of imprisonment imposed as part of the original sentence is authorized to be reduced under this section. This section does not authorize a reduction in the term of imprisonment imposed upon revocation of supervised release.</p><p>(B) <strong>Modification Relating to Early Termination.\u2014</strong>If the prohibition in subsection (b)(2)(C) relating to time already served precludes a reduction in the term of imprisonment to the extent the court determines otherwise would have been appropriate as a result of the amended guideline range determined under subsection (b)(1), the court may consider any such reduction that it was unable to grant in connection with any motion for early termination of a term of supervised release under 18 U.S.C. \xa7\xa03583(e)(1). However, the fact that a defendant may have served a longer term of imprisonment than the court determines would have been appropriate in view of the amended guideline range determined under subsection (b)(1) shall not, without more, provide a basis for early termination of supervised release. Rather, the court should take into account the totality of circumstances relevant to a decision to terminate supervised release, including the term of supervised release that would have been appropriate in connection with a sentence under the amended guideline range determined under subsection (b)(1).</p></blockquote><p>8. <strong>Use of Policy Statement in Effect on Date of Reduction.\u2014</strong>Consistent with subsection (a) of \xa71B1.11 (Use of Guidelines Manual in Effect on Date of Sentencing), the court shall use the version of this policy statement that is in effect on the date on which the court reduces the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment as provided by 18 U.S.C. \xa7\xa03582(c)(2).</p><p><strong>Background:</strong> Section 3582(c)(2) of Title 18, United States Code, provides: \u201c[I]n the case of a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \xa7\xa0994(o), upon motion of the defendant or the Director of the Bureau of Prisons, or on its own motion, the court may reduce the term of imprisonment, after considering the factors set forth in section 3553(a) to the extent that they are applicable, if such a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d</p><p>This policy statement provides guidance and limitations for a court when considering a motion under 18 U.S.C. \xa7\xa03582(c)(2) and implements 28 U.S.C. \xa7\xa0994(u), which provides: \u201cIf the Commission reduces the term of imprisonment recommended in the guidelines applicable to a particular offense or category of offenses, it shall specify in what circumstances and by what amount the sentences of prisoners serving terms of imprisonment for the offense may be reduced.\u201d The Supreme Court has concluded that proceedings under section 3582(c)(2) are not governed by <em>United States v. Booker</em>, 543 U.S. 220 (2005), and this policy statement remains binding on courts in such proceedings. <em>See Dillon v. United States</em>, 560 U.S. 817 (2010).</p><p>Among the factors considered by the Commission in selecting the amendments included in subsection (d) were the purpose of the amendment, the magnitude of the change in the guideline range made by the amendment, and the difficulty of applying the amendment retroactively to determine an amended guideline range under subsection (b)(1).</p><p>The listing of an amendment in subsection (d) reflects policy determinations by the Commission that a reduced guideline range is sufficient to achieve the purposes of sentencing and that, in the sound discretion of the court, a reduction in the term of imprisonment may be appropriate for previously sentenced, qualified defendants. The authorization of such a discretionary reduction does not otherwise affect the lawfulness of a previously imposed sentence, does not authorize a reduction in any other component of the sentence, and does not entitle a defendant to a reduced term of imprisonment as a matter of right.</p><p>The Commission has not included in this policy statement amendments that generally reduce the maximum of the guideline range by less than six months. This criterion is in accord with the legislative history of 28 U.S.C. \xa7\xa0994(u) (formerly \xa7\xa0994(t)), which states: \u201cIt should be noted that the Committee does not expect that the Commission will recommend adjusting existing sentences under the provision when guidelines are simply refined in a way that might cause isolated instances of existing sentences falling above the old guidelines<sup>*</sup> or when there is only a minor downward adjustment in the guidelines.

Subsection (b)(2) provides that if an earlier edition of the Guidelines Manual is used, it is to be used in its entirety, except that subsequent clarifying amendments are to be considered.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Example:</strong> A defendant is convicted of an antitrust offense committed in November 1989. He is to be sentenced in December 1992. Effective November 1, 1991, the Commission raised the base offense level for antitrust offenses. Effective November 1, 1992, the Commission lowered the guideline range in the Sentencing Table for cases with an offense level of 8 and criminal history category of I from 2\u20138 months to 0\u20136 months. Under the 1992 edition of the Guidelines Manual (effective November 1, 1992), the defendant has a guideline range of 4\u201310 months (final offense level of 9, criminal history category of I). Under the 1989 edition of the Guidelines Manual (effective November 1, 1989), the defendant has a guideline range of 2\u20138 months (final offense level of 8, criminal history category of I). If the court determines that application of the 1992 edition of the Guidelines Manual would violate the <em>ex post facto</em> clause of the United States Constitution, it shall apply the 1989 edition of the Guidelines Manual in its entirety. It shall not apply, for example, the offense level of 8 and criminal history category of I from the 1989 edition of the Guidelines Manual in conjunction with the amended guideline range of 0\u20136 months for this offense level and criminal history category from the 1992 edition of the Guidelines Manual.</p></blockquote><p>2. Under subsection (b)(1), the last date of the offense of conviction is the controlling date for <em>ex post facto</em> purposes. For example, if the offense of conviction (<em>i.e.</em>, the conduct charged in the count of the indictment or information of which the defendant was convicted) was determined by the court to have been committed between October 15, 1991 and October 28, 1991, the date of October 28, 1991 is the controlling date for <em>ex post facto</em> purposes. This is true even if the defendant\u2019s conduct relevant to the determination of the guideline range under \xa71B1.3 (Relevant Conduct) included an act that occurred on November 2, 1991 (after a revised Guidelines Manual took effect).</p><p><strong>Background:</strong> Subsections (a) and (b)(1) provide that the court should apply the Guidelines Manual in effect on the date the defendant is sentenced unless the court determines that doing so would violate the <em>ex post facto</em> clause in Article I, \xa7\xa09 of the United States Constitution. Under 18 U.S.C. \xa7\xa03553, the court is to apply the guidelines and policy statements in effect at the time of sentencing. However, the Supreme Court has held that the <em>ex post facto</em> clause applies to sentencing guideline amendments that subject the defendant to increased punishment. <em>See Peugh v. United States</em>, 133 S. Ct. 2072, 2078 (2013) (holding that \u201cthere is an <em>ex post facto</em> violation when a defendant is sentenced under Guidelines promulgated after he committed his criminal acts and the new version provides a higher applicable Guidelines sentencing range than the version in place at the time of the offense\u201d).</p><p>Subsection (b)(2) provides that the Guidelines Manual in effect on a particular date shall be applied in its entirety.</p><p>Subsection (b)(3) provides that where the defendant is convicted of two offenses, the first committed before, and the second after, a revised edition of the Guidelines Manual became effective, the revised edition of the Guidelines Manual is to be applied to both offenses, even if the revised edition results in an increased penalty for the first offense. Because the defendant completed the second offense after the amendment to the guidelines took effect, the <em>ex post facto</em> clause does not prevent determining the sentence for that count based on the amended guidelines. For example, if a defendant pleads guilty to a single count of embezzlement that occurred after the most recent edition of the Guidelines Manual became effective, the guideline range applicable in sentencing will encompass any relevant conduct (<em>e.g.</em>, related embezzlement offenses that may have occurred prior to the effective date of the guideline amendments) for the offense of conviction. The same would be true for a defendant convicted of two counts of embezzlement, one committed before the amendments were enacted, and the second after. In this example, the <em>ex post facto</em> clause would not bar application of the amended guideline to the first conviction; a contrary conclusion would mean that such defendant was subject to a lower guideline range than if convicted only of the second offense. Decisions from several appellate courts addressing the analogous situation of the constitutionality of counting pre-guidelines criminal activity as relevant conduct for a guidelines sentence support this approach. <em>See\xa0United States v. Ykema</em>, 887 F.2d 697 (6th Cir. 1989) (upholding inclusion of pre-November 1, 1987, drug quantities as relevant conduct for the count of conviction, noting that habitual offender statutes routinely augment punishment for an offense of conviction based on acts committed before a law is passed); <em>United States v. Allen</em>, 886 F.2d 143 (8th Cir. 1989) (similar); <em>see also United States v. Cusack</em>, 901 F.2d 29 (4th Cir. 1990) (similar).</p><p>Moreover, the approach set forth in subsection (b)(3) should be followed regardless of whether the offenses of conviction are the type in which the conduct is grouped under \xa73D1.2(d). The <em>ex post facto</em> clause does not distinguish between groupable and nongroupable offenses, and unless that clause would be violated, Congress\u2019s directive to apply the sentencing guidelines in effect at the time of sentencing must be followed. Under the guideline sentencing system, a single sentencing range is determined based on the defendant\u2019s overall conduct, even if there are multiple counts of conviction (<em>see</em> \xa7\xa73D1.1\u20133D1.5, 5G1.2). Thus, if a defendant is sentenced in January 1992 for a bank robbery committed in October 1988 and one committed in November 1991, the November 1991 Guidelines Manual should be used to determine a combined guideline range for both counts. <em>See generally United States v. Stephenson</em>, 921 F.2d 438 (2d Cir. 1990) (holding that the Sentencing Commission and Congress intended that the applicable version of the guidelines be applied as a \u201ccohesive and integrated whole\u201d rather than in a piecemeal fashion).</p><p>Consequently, even in a complex case involving multiple counts that occurred under several different versions of the Guidelines Manual, it will not be necessary to compare more than two manuals to determine the applicable guideline range \u2014 the manual in effect at the time the last offense of conviction was completed and the manual in effect at the time of sentencing.</p><table><tbody><tr class='odd'><td><em>Historical Note</em></td><td>Effective November 1, 1992 (amendment 442).

A downward departure would not be appropriate in such a case. A downward departure from a mandatory statutory term of life imprisonment is permissible only in cases in which the government files a motion for a downward departure for the defendant\u2019s substantial assistance, as provided in 18 U.S.C. \xa7\xa03553(e).</p><p>(B) <strong>Felony Murder.\u2014</strong>If the defendant did not cause the death intentionally or knowingly, a downward departure may be warranted. For example, a downward departure may be warranted if in robbing a bank, the defendant merely passed a note to the teller, as a result of which the teller had a heart attack and died. The extent of the departure should be based upon the defendant\u2019s state of mind (<em>e.g.</em>, recklessness or negligence), the degree of risk inherent in the conduct, and the nature of the underlying offense conduct. However, departure below the minimum guideline sentence provided for second degree murder in \xa72A1.2 (Second Degree Murder) is not likely to be appropriate. Also, because death obviously is an aggravating factor, it necessarily would be inappropriate to impose a sentence at a level below that which the guideline for the underlying offense requires in the absence of death.</p></blockquote><p>3. <strong>Applicability of Guideline When Death Sentence Not Imposed.\u2014</strong>If the defendant is sentenced pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \xa7\xa03591 <em>et seq.</em> or 21 U.S.C. \xa7\xa0848(e), a sentence of death may be imposed under the specific provisions contained in that statute. This guideline applies when a sentence of death is not imposed under those specific provisions.</p><table><tbody><tr class='odd'><td><em>Historical Note</em></td><td>Effective November 1, 1987.

For example, the cross reference to \xa72A3.1 shall apply if (A) the victim had not attained the age of 12 years (<em>see</em> 18 U.S.C. \xa7\xa02241(c)); (B) the victim had attained the age of 12 years but not attained the age of 16 years, and was placed in fear of death, serious bodily injury, or kidnapping (<em>see</em> 18 U.S.C. \xa7\xa02241(a),(c)); or (C) the victim was threatened or placed in fear other than fear of death, serious bodily injury, or kidnapping (<em>see</em>\xa018\xa0U.S.C. \xa7\xa02242(1)).</p><p>6. <strong>Upward Departure Consideration.\u2014</strong>There may be cases in which the offense level determined under this guideline substantially understates the seriousness of the offense. In such cases, an upward departure may be warranted. For example, an upward departure may be warranted if the defendant committed the criminal sexual act in furtherance of a commercial scheme such as pandering, transporting persons for the purpose of prostitution, or the production of pornography.</p><p><strong>Background:</strong> This section applies to offenses involving the criminal sexual abuse of an individual who had not attained the age of 16 years. While this section applies to consensual sexual acts prosecuted under 18 U.S.C. \xa7\xa02243(a) that would be lawful but for the age of the minor, it also applies to cases, prosecuted under 18 U.S.C. \xa7\xa02243(a), in which a participant took active measure(s) to unduly influence the minor to engage in prohibited sexual conduct and, thus, the voluntariness of the minor\u2019s behavior was compromised. A four-level enhancement is provided in subsection (b)(2) for such cases. It is assumed that at least a four-year age difference exists between the minor and the defendant, as specified in 18 U.S.C. \xa7\xa02243(a). A four-level enhancement is provided in subsection (b)(1) for a defendant who victimizes a minor under his supervision or care. However, if the minor had not attained the age of 12 years, \xa72A3.1 (Criminal Sexual Abuse; Attempt to Commit Criminal Sexual Abuse) will apply, regardless of the \u201cconsent\u201d of the minor.</p><table><tbody><tr class='odd'><td><em>Historical Note</em></td><td>Effective November 1, 1987.

For example, a single instance of stalking accompanied by a separate instance of threatening, harassing, or assaulting the same victim constitutes a pattern of activity for purposes of this guideline.</p><p>\u201c<em><strong>Stalking</strong></em>\u201d means conduct described in 18 U.S.C. \xa7\xa02261A.</p><p>\u201c<em><strong>Strangling</strong></em>\u201d and \u201c<em><strong>suffocating</strong></em>\u201d have the meaning given those terms in 18 U.S.C. \xa7\xa0113.</p></blockquote><p>2. Subsection (b)(1) provides for a two-level or four-level enhancement based on the degree to which the offense involved aggravating factors listed in that subsection. If the offense involved aggravating factors more serious than the factors listed in subsection (b)(1), the cross reference in subsection (c) most likely will apply, if the resulting offense level is greater, because the more serious conduct will be covered by another offense guideline from Chapter Two, Part A. For example, \xa72A2.2 (Aggravated Assault) most likely would apply pursuant to subsection (c) if the offense involved assaultive conduct in which injury more serious than bodily injury occurred or if a dangerous weapon was used rather than merely possessed.</p><p>3. In determining whether subsection (b)(1)(E) applies, the court shall consider, under the totality of the circumstances, any conduct that occurred prior to or during the offense; however, conduct that occurred prior to the offense must be substantially and directly connected to the offense. For example, if a defendant engaged in several acts of stalking the same victim over a period of years (including acts that occurred prior to the offense), then for purposes of determining whether subsection (b)(1)(E) applies, the court shall look to the totality of the circumstances, considering only those prior acts of stalking the victim that have a substantial and direct connection to the offense.</p><blockquote><p>Prior convictions taken into account under subsection (b)(1)(E) are also counted for purposes of determining criminal history points pursuant to Chapter Four, Part A (Criminal History).</p></blockquote><p>4. For purposes of Chapter Three, Part D (Multiple Counts), multiple counts involving stalking, threatening, or harassing the same victim are grouped together (and with counts of other offenses involving the same victim that are covered by this guideline) under \xa73D1.2 (Groups of Closely Related Counts). For example, if the defendant is convicted of two counts of stalking the defendant\u2019s ex-spouse under 18 U.S.C. \xa7\xa02261A and one count of interstate domestic violence involving an assault of the ex-spouse under 18\xa0U.S.C. \xa7\xa02261, the stalking counts would be grouped together with the interstate domestic violence count. This grouping procedure avoids unwarranted \u201cdouble counting\u201d with the enhancement in subsection (b)(1)(E) (for multiple acts of stalking, threatening, harassing, or assaulting the same victim) and recognizes that the stalking and interstate domestic violence counts are sufficiently related to warrant grouping.</p><blockquote><p>Multiple counts that are cross referenced to another offense guideline pursuant to subsection (c) are to be grouped together if \xa73D1.2 (Groups of Closely Related Counts) would require grouping of those counts under that offense guideline. Similarly, multiple counts cross referenced pursuant to subsection (c) are not to be grouped together if \xa73D1.2 would preclude grouping of the counts under that offense guideline. For example, if the defendant is convicted of multiple counts of threatening an ex-spouse in violation of a court protection order under 18 U.S.C. \xa7\xa02262 and the counts are cross referenced to \xa72A6.1 (Threatening or Harassing Communications), the counts would group together because Application Note 3 of \xa72A6.1 specifically requires grouping. In contrast, if the defendant is convicted of multiple counts of assaulting the ex-spouse in violation of a court protection order under 18 U.S.C. \xa7\xa02262 and the counts are cross referenced to \xa72A2.2 (Aggravated Assault), the counts probably would not group together inasmuch as \xa73D1.2(d) specifically precludes grouping of counts covered by \xa72A2.2 and no other provision of \xa73D1.2 would likely apply to require grouping.</p><p>Multiple counts involving different victims are not to be grouped under \xa73D1.2 (Groups of Closely Related Counts).</p></blockquote><p>5. If the defendant received an enhancement under subsection (b)(1) but that enhancement does not adequately reflect the extent or seriousness of the conduct involved, an upward departure may be warranted. For example, an upward departure may be warranted if the defendant stalked the victim on many occasions over a prolonged period of time.</p><table><tbody><tr class='odd'><td><em>Historical Note</em></td><td>Effective November 1, 1997 (amendment 549).

Accordingly, pecuniary harm does not include emotional distress, harm to reputation, or other non-economic harm.</p><p>(iv) <strong>Reasonably Foreseeable Pecuniary Harm.\u2014</strong>For purposes of this guideline, \u201c<em><strong>reasonably foreseeable pecuniary harm</strong></em>\u201d means pecuniary harm that the defendant knew or, under the circumstances, reasonably should have known, was a potential result of the offense.</p><p>(v) <strong>Rules of Construction in Certain Cases.\u2014</strong>In the cases described in subdivisions (I) through (III), reasonably foreseeable pecuniary harm shall be considered to include the pecuniary harm specified for those cases as follows:</p><p>(I) <strong>Product Substitution Cases.\u2014</strong>In the case of a product substitution offense, the reasonably foreseeable pecuniary harm includes the reasonably foreseeable costs of making substitute transactions and handling or disposing of the product delivered, or of retrofitting the product so that it can be used for its intended purpose, and the reasonably foreseeable costs of rectifying the actual or potential disruption to the victim\u2019s business operations caused by the product substitution.</p><p>(II) <strong>Procurement Fraud Cases.\u2014</strong>In the case of a procurement fraud, such as a fraud affecting a defense contract award, reasonably foreseeable pecuniary harm includes the reasonably foreseeable administrative costs to the government and other participants of repeating or correcting the procurement action affected, plus any increased costs to procure the product or service involved that was reasonably foreseeable.</p><p>(III) <strong>Offenses Under 18 U.S.C. \xa7\xa01030.\u2014</strong>In the case of an offense under 18\xa0U.S.C. \xa7\xa01030, actual loss includes the following pecuniary harm, regardless of whether such pecuniary harm was reasonably foreseeable: any reasonable cost to any victim, including the cost of responding to an offense, conducting a damage assessment, and restoring the data, program, system, or information to its condition prior to the offense, and any revenue lost, cost incurred, or other damages incurred because of interruption of service.</p><p>(B) <strong>Gain.\u2014</strong>The court shall use the gain that resulted from the offense as an alternative measure of loss only if there is a loss but it reasonably cannot be determined.</p><p>(C) <strong>Estimation of Loss.\u2014</strong>The court need only make a reasonable estimate of the loss. The sentencing judge is in a unique position to assess the evidence and estimate the loss based upon that evidence. For this reason, the court\u2019s loss determination is entitled to appropriate deference. <em>See</em> 18 U.S.C. \xa7\xa03742(e) and (f).</p><p>The estimate of the loss shall be based on available information, taking into account, as appropriate and practicable under the circumstances, factors such as the following:</p><p>(i) The fair market value of the property unlawfully taken, copied, or destroyed; or, if the fair market value is impracticable to determine or inadequately measures the harm, the cost to the victim of replacing that property.</p><p>(ii) In the case of proprietary information (<em>e.g.</em>, trade secrets), the cost of developing that information or the reduction in the value of that information that resulted from the offense.</p><p>(iii) The cost of repairs to damaged property.</p><p>(iv) The approximate number of victims multiplied by the average loss to each victim.</p><p>(v) The reduction that resulted from the offense in the value of equity securities or other corporate assets.</p><p>(vi) More general factors, such as the scope and duration of the offense and revenues generated by similar operations.</p><p>(D) <strong>Exclusions from Loss.\u2014</strong>Loss shall not include the following:</p><p>(i) Interest of any kind, finance charges, late fees, penalties, amounts based on an agreed-upon return or rate of return, or other similar costs.</p><p>(ii) Costs to the government of, and costs incurred by victims primarily to aid the government in, the prosecution and criminal investigation of an offense.</p><p>(E) <strong>Credits Against Loss.\u2014</strong>Loss shall be reduced by the following:</p><p>(i) The money returned, and the fair market value of the property returned and the services rendered, by the defendant or other persons acting jointly with the defendant, to the victim before the offense was detected. The time of detection of the offense is the earlier of (I) the time the offense was discovered by a victim or government agency; or (II) the time the defendant knew or reasonably should have known that the offense was detected or about to be detected by a victim or government agency.</p><p>(ii) In a case involving collateral pledged or otherwise provided by the defendant, the amount the victim has recovered at the time of sentencing from disposition of the collateral, or if the collateral has not been disposed of by that time, the fair market value of the collateral at the time of sentencing.</p><p>(iii) Notwithstanding clause (ii), in the case of a fraud involving a mortgage loan, if the collateral has not been disposed of by the time of sentencing, use the fair market value of the collateral as of the date on which the guilt of the defendant has been established, whether by guilty plea, trial, or plea of <em>nolo contendere</em>.</p><p>In such a case, there shall be a rebuttable presumption that the most recent tax assessment value of the collateral is a reasonable estimate of the fair market value. In determining whether the most recent tax assessment value is a reasonable estimate of the fair market value, the court may consider, among other factors, the recency of the tax assessment and the extent to which the jurisdiction\u2019s tax assessment practices reflect factors not relevant to fair market value.</p><p>(F) <strong>Special Rules.\u2014</strong>Notwithstanding subdivision (A), the following special rules shall be used to assist in determining loss in the cases indicated:</p><p>(i) <strong>Stolen or Counterfeit Credit Cards and Access Devices; Purloined Numbers and Codes.\u2014</strong>In a case involving any counterfeit access device or unauthorized access device, loss includes any unauthorized charges made with the counterfeit access device or unauthorized access device and shall be not less than $500 per access device. However, if the unauthorized access device is a means of telecommunications access that identifies a specific telecommunications instrument or telecommunications account (including an electronic serial number/mobile identification number (ESN/MIN) pair), and that means was only possessed, and not used, during the commission of the offense, loss shall be not less than $100 per unused means. For purposes of this subdivision, \u201c<em><strong>counterfeit access device</strong></em>\u201d and \u201c<em><strong>unauthorized access device</strong></em>\u201d have the meaning given those terms in Application Note 10(A).</p><p>(ii) <strong>Government Benefits.\u2014</strong>In a case involving government benefits (<em>e.g.</em>, grants, loans, entitlement program payments), loss shall be considered to be not less than the value of the benefits obtained by unintended recipients or diverted to unintended uses, as the case may be. For example, if the defendant was the intended recipient of food stamps having a value of $100 but fraudulently received food stamps having a value of $150, loss is $50.</p><p>(iii) <strong>Davis\u2013Bacon Act Violations.\u2014</strong>In a case involving a Davis\u2013Bacon Act violation (<em>i.e.</em>, a violation of 40 U.S.C. \xa7\xa03142, criminally prosecuted under 18\xa0U.S.C. \xa7\xa01001), the value of the benefits shall be considered to be not less than the difference between the legally required wages and actual wages paid.</p><p>(iv) <strong>Ponzi and Other Fraudulent Investment Schemes.\u2014</strong>In a case involving a fraudulent investment scheme, such as a Ponzi scheme, loss shall not be reduced by the money or the value of the property transferred to any individual investor in the scheme in excess of that investor\u2019s principal investment (<em>i.e.</em>, the gain to an individual investor in the scheme shall not be used to offset the loss to another individual investor in the scheme).</p><p>(v) <strong>Certain Other Unlawful Misrepresentation Schemes.\u2014</strong>In a case involving a scheme in which (I) services were fraudulently rendered to the victim by persons falsely posing as licensed professionals; (II) goods were falsely represented as approved by a governmental regulatory agency; or (III) goods for which regulatory approval by a government agency was required but not obtained, or was obtained by fraud, loss shall include the amount paid for the property, services or goods transferred, rendered, or misrepresented, with no credit provided for the value of those items or services.</p><p>(vi) <strong>Value of Controlled Substances.\u2014</strong>In a case involving controlled substances, loss is the estimated street value of the controlled substances.</p><p>(vii) <strong>Value of Cultural Heritage Resources or Paleontological Resources.\u2014</strong>In a case involving a cultural heritage resource or paleontological resource, loss attributable to that resource shall be determined in accordance with the rules for determining the \u201cvalue of the resource\u201d set forth in Application Note\xa02 of the Commentary to \xa72B1.5.</p><p>(viii) <strong>Federal Health Care Offenses Involving Government Health Care Programs.\u2014</strong>In a case in which the defendant is convicted of a Federal health care offense involving a Government health care program, the aggregate dollar amount of fraudulent bills submitted to the Government health care program shall constitute prima facie evidence of the amount of the intended loss, <em>i.e.</em>, is evidence sufficient to establish the amount of the intended loss, if not rebutted.</p><p>(ix) <strong>Fraudulent Inflation or Deflation in Value of Securities or Commodities.\u2014</strong>In a case involving the fraudulent inflation or deflation in the value of a publicly traded security or commodity, the court in determining loss may use any method that is appropriate and practicable under the circumstances. One such method the court may consider is a method under which the actual loss attributable to the change in value of the security or commodity is the amount determined by\u2014</p><p>(I) calculating the difference between the average price of the security or commodity during the period that the fraud occurred and the average price of the security or commodity during the 90-day period after the fraud was disclosed to the market, and</p><p>(II) multiplying the difference in average price by the number of shares outstanding.</p><p>In determining whether the amount so determined is a reasonable estimate of the actual loss attributable to the change in value of the security or commodity, the court may consider, among other factors, the extent to which the amount so determined includes significant changes in value not resulting from the offense (<em>e.g.</em>, changes caused by external market forces, such as changed economic circumstances, changed investor expectations, and new industry-specific or firm-specific facts, conditions, or events).</p></blockquote><p>4. <strong>Application of Subsection (b)(2).\u2014</strong></p><blockquote><p>(A) <strong>Definition.\u2014</strong>For purposes of subsection (b)(2), \u201c<em><strong>mass-marketing</strong></em>\u201d means a plan, program, promotion, or campaign that is conducted through solicitation by telephone, mail, the Internet, or other means to induce a large number of persons to (i)\xa0purchase goods or services; (ii) participate in a contest or sweepstakes; or (iii)\xa0invest for financial profit. \u201cMass-marketing\u201d includes, for example, a telemarketing campaign that solicits a large number of individuals to purchase fraudulent life insurance policies.</p><p>(B) <strong>Applicability to Transmission of Multiple Commercial Electronic Mail Messages.\u2014</strong>For purposes of subsection (b)(2), an offense under 18 U.S.C. \xa7\xa01037, or any other offense involving conduct described in 18 U.S.C. \xa7\xa01037, shall be considered to have been committed through mass-marketing. Accordingly, the defendant shall receive at least a two-level enhancement under subsection (b)(2) and may, depending on the facts of the case, receive a greater enhancement under such subsection, if the defendant was convicted under, or the offense involved conduct described in, 18 U.S.C. \xa7\xa01037.</p><p>(C) <strong>Undelivered United States Mail.\u2014</strong></p><p>(i) <strong>In General.\u2014</strong>In a case in which undelivered United States mail was taken, or the taking of such item was an object of the offense, or in a case in which the stolen property received, transported, transferred, transmitted, or possessed was undelivered United States mail, \u201c<em><strong>victim</strong></em>\u201d means (I) any victim as defined in Application Note 1; or (II) any person who was the intended recipient, or addressee, of the undelivered United States mail.</p><p>(ii) <strong>Special Rule.\u2014</strong>A case described in subdivision (C)(i) of this note that involved\u2014</p><p>(I) a United States Postal Service relay box, collection box, delivery vehicle, satchel, or cart, shall be considered to have involved at least 10 victims.</p><p>(II) a housing unit cluster box or any similar receptacle that contains multiple mailboxes, whether such receptacle is owned by the United States Postal Service or otherwise owned, shall, unless proven otherwise, be presumed to have involved the number of victims corresponding to the number of mailboxes in each cluster box or similar receptacle.</p><p>(iii) <strong>Definition.\u2014</strong>\u201c<em><strong>Undelivered United States mail</strong></em>\u201d means mail that has not actually been received by the addressee or the addressee\u2019s agent (<em>e.g.</em>, mail taken from the addressee\u2019s mail box).</p><p>(D) <strong>Vulnerable Victims.\u2014</strong>If subsection (b)(2)(B) or (C) applies, an enhancement under \xa73A1.1(b)(2) shall not apply.</p><p>(E) <strong>Cases Involving Means of Identification.\u2014</strong>For purposes of subsection (b)(2), in a case involving means of identification \u201c<em><strong>victim</strong></em>\u201d means (i) any victim as defined in Application Note 1; or (ii) any individual whose means of identification was used unlawfully or without authority.</p><p>(F) <strong>Substantial Financial Hardship.\u2014</strong>In determining whether the offense resulted in substantial financial hardship to a victim, the court shall consider, among other factors, whether the offense resulted in the victim\u2014</p><p>(i) becoming insolvent;</p><p>(ii) filing for bankruptcy under the Bankruptcy Code (title 11, United States Code);</p><p>(iii) suffering substantial loss of a retirement, education, or other savings or investment fund;</p><p>(iv) making substantial changes to his or her employment, such as postponing his or her retirement plans;</p><p>(v) making substantial changes to his or her living arrangements, such as relocating to a less expensive home; and</p><p>(vi) suffering substantial harm to his or her ability to obtain credit.</p></blockquote><p>5. <strong>Enhancement for Business of Receiving and Selling Stolen Property under Subsection (b)(4).\u2014</strong>For purposes of subsection (b)(4), the court shall consider the following non-exhaustive list of factors in determining whether the defendant was in the business of receiving and selling stolen property:</p><blockquote><p>(A) The regularity and sophistication of the defendant\u2019s activities.</p><p>(B) The value and size of the inventory of stolen property maintained by the defendant.</p><p>(C) The extent to which the defendant\u2019s activities encouraged or facilitated other crimes.</p><p>(D) The defendant\u2019s past activities involving stolen property.</p></blockquote><p>6. <strong>Application of Subsection (b)(6).\u2014</strong>For purposes of subsection (b)(6), \u201c<em><strong>improper means</strong></em>\u201d includes the unauthorized harvesting of electronic mail addresses of users of a website, proprietary service, or other online public forum.</p><p>7. <strong>Application of Subsection (b)(8)(B).\u2014</strong>If subsection (b)(8)(B) applies, do not apply an adjustment under \xa73B1.3 (Abuse of Position of Trust or Use of Special Skill).</p><p>8. <strong>Application of Subsection (b)(9).\u2014</strong></p><blockquote><p>(A) <strong>In General.\u2014</strong>The adjustments in subsection (b)(9) are alternative rather than cumulative. If, in a particular case, however, more than one of the enumerated factors applied, an upward departure may be warranted.</p><p>(B) <strong>Misrepresentations Regarding Charitable and Other Institutions.\u2014</strong>Subsection\xa0(b)(9)(A) applies in any case in which the defendant represented that the defendant was acting to obtain a benefit on behalf of a charitable, educational, religious, or political organization, or a government agency (regardless of whether the defendant actually was associated with the organization or government agency) when, in fact, the defendant intended to divert all or part of that benefit (<em>e.g.</em>, for the defendant\u2019s personal gain). Subsection (b)(9)(A) applies, for example, to the following:</p><p>(i) A defendant who solicited contributions for a non-existent famine relief organization.</p><p>(ii) A defendant who solicited donations from church members by falsely claiming to be a fundraiser for a religiously affiliated school.</p><p>(iii) A defendant, chief of a local fire department, who conducted a public fundraiser representing that the purpose of the fundraiser was to procure sufficient funds for a new fire engine when, in fact, the defendant intended to divert some of the funds for the defendant\u2019s personal benefit.</p><p>(C) <strong>Fraud in Contravention of Prior Judicial Order.\u2014</strong>Subsection (b)(9)(C) provides an enhancement if the defendant commits a fraud in contravention of a prior, official judicial or administrative warning, in the form of an order, injunction, decree, or process, to take or not to take a specified action. A defendant who does not comply with such a prior, official judicial or administrative warning demonstrates aggravated criminal intent and deserves additional punishment. If it is established that an entity the defendant controlled was a party to the prior proceeding that resulted in the official judicial or administrative action, and the defendant had knowledge of that prior decree or order, this enhancement applies even if the defendant was not a specifically named party in that prior case. For example, a defendant whose business previously was enjoined from selling a dangerous product, but who nonetheless engaged in fraudulent conduct to sell the product, is subject to this enhancement.

Sometimes, offenses involving fraudulent statements are prosecuted under 18 U.S.C. \xa7\xa01001, or a similarly general statute, although the offense involves fraudulent conduct that is also covered by a more specific statute. Examples include false entries regarding currency transactions, for which \xa72S1.3 (Structuring Transactions to Evade Reporting Requirements) likely would be more apt, and false statements to a customs officer, for which \xa72T3.1 (Evading Import Duties or Restrictions (Smuggling); Receiving or Trafficking in Smuggled Property) likely would be more apt. In certain other cases, the mail or wire fraud statutes, or other relatively broad statutes, are used primarily as jurisdictional bases for the prosecution of other offenses. For example, a state employee who improperly influenced the award of a contract and used the mails to commit the offense may be prosecuted under 18 U.S.C. \xa7\xa01341 for fraud involving the deprivation of the intangible right of honest services. Such a case would be more aptly sentenced pursuant to \xa72C1.1 (Offering, Giving, Soliciting, or Receiving a Bribe; Extortion Under Color of Official Right; Fraud involving the Deprivation of the Intangible Right to Honest Services of Public Officials; Conspiracy to Defraud by Interference with Governmental Functions).</p><p>17. <strong>Continuing Financial Crimes Enterprise.\u2014</strong>If the defendant is convicted under 18\xa0U.S.C. \xa7\xa0225 (relating to a continuing financial crimes enterprise), the offense level is that applicable to the underlying series of offenses comprising the \u201ccontinuing financial crimes enterprise\u201d.</p><p>18. <strong>Partially Completed Offenses.\u2014</strong>In the case of a partially completed offense (<em>e.g.</em>, an offense involving a completed theft or fraud that is part of a larger, attempted theft or fraud), the offense level is to be determined in accordance with the provisions of \xa72X1.1 (Attempt, Solicitation, or Conspiracy) whether the conviction is for the substantive offense, the inchoate offense (attempt, solicitation, or conspiracy), or both. <em>See</em> Application Note 4 of the Commentary to \xa72X1.1.</p><p>19. <strong>Multiple-Count Indictments.\u2014</strong>Some fraudulent schemes may result in multiple-count indictments, depending on the technical elements of the offense. The cumulative loss produced by a common scheme or course of conduct should be used in determining the offense level, regardless of the number of counts of conviction. <em>See</em> Chapter Three, Part D (Multiple Counts).</p><p>20. <strong>Departure Considerations.\u2014</strong></p><blockquote><p>(A) <strong>Upward Departure Considerations.\u2014</strong>There may be cases in which the offense level determined under this guideline substantially understates the seriousness of the offense. In such cases, an upward departure may be warranted. The following is a non-exhaustive list of factors that the court may consider in determining whether an upward departure is warranted:</p><p>(i) A primary objective of the offense was an aggravating, non-monetary objective. For example, a primary objective of the offense was to inflict emotional harm.</p><p>(ii) The offense caused or risked substantial non-monetary harm. For example, the offense caused physical harm, psychological harm, or severe emotional trauma, or resulted in a substantial invasion of a privacy interest (through, for example, the theft of personal information such as medical, educational, or financial records). An upward departure would be warranted, for example, in an 18 U.S.C. \xa7\xa01030 offense involving damage to a protected computer, if, as a result of that offense, death resulted. An upward departure also would be warranted, for example, in a case involving animal enterprise terrorism under 18 U.S.C. \xa7\xa043, if, in the course of the offense, serious bodily injury or death resulted, or substantial scientific research or information were destroyed. Similarly, an upward departure would be warranted in a case involving conduct described in 18 U.S.C. \xa7\xa0670 if the offense resulted in serious bodily injury or death, including serious bodily injury or death resulting from the use of the pre-retail medical product.</p><p>(iii) The offense involved a substantial amount of interest of any kind, finance charges, late fees, penalties, amounts based on an agreed-upon return or rate of return, or other similar costs, not included in the determination of loss for purposes of subsection (b)(1).</p><p>(iv) The offense created a risk of substantial loss beyond the loss determined for purposes of subsection (b)(1), such as a risk of a significant disruption of a national financial market.</p><p>(v) In a case involving stolen information from a \u201cprotected computer\u201d, as defined in 18 U.S.C. \xa7\xa01030(e)(2), the defendant sought the stolen information to further a broader criminal purpose.</p><p>(vi) In a case involving access devices or unlawfully produced or unlawfully obtained means of identification:</p><p>(I) The offense caused substantial harm to the victim\u2019s reputation, or the victim suffered a substantial inconvenience related to repairing the victim\u2019s reputation.</p><p>(II) An individual whose means of identification the defendant used to obtain unlawful means of identification is erroneously arrested or denied a job because an arrest record has been made in that individual\u2019s name.</p><p>(III) The defendant produced or obtained numerous means of identification with respect to one individual and essentially assumed that individual\u2019s identity.</p><p>(B) <strong>Upward Departure for Debilitating Impact on a Critical Infrastructure.\u2014</strong>An upward departure would be warranted in a case in which subsection (b)(18)(A)(iii) applies and the disruption to the critical infrastructure(s) is so substantial as to have a debilitating impact on national security, national economic security, national public health or safety, or any combination of those matters.</p><p>(C) <strong>Downward Departure Consideration.\u2014</strong>There may be cases in which the offense level determined under this guideline substantially overstates the seriousness of the offense. In such cases, a downward departure may be warranted.</p><p>For example, a securities fraud involving a fraudulent statement made publicly to the market may produce an aggregate loss amount that is substantial but diffuse, with relatively small loss amounts suffered by a relatively large number of victims. In such a case, the loss table in subsection (b)(1) and the victims table in subsection (b)(2) may combine to produce an offense level that substantially overstates the seriousness of the offense. If so, a downward departure may be warranted.</p><p>(D) <strong>Downward Departure for Major Disaster or Emergency Victims.\u2014</strong>If (i) the minimum offense level of level 12 in subsection (b)(12) applies; (ii) the defendant sustained damage, loss, hardship, or suffering caused by a major disaster or an emergency as those terms are defined in 42 U.S.C. \xa7\xa05122; and (iii) the benefits received illegally were only an extension or overpayment of benefits received legitimately, a downward departure may be warranted.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Background:</strong> This guideline covers offenses involving theft, stolen property, property damage or destruction, fraud, forgery, and counterfeiting (other than offenses involving altered or counterfeit bearer obligations of the United States).</p><p>Because federal fraud statutes often are broadly written, a single pattern of offense conduct usually can be prosecuted under several code sections, as a result of which the offense of conviction may be somewhat arbitrary. Furthermore, most fraud statutes cover a broad range of conduct with extreme variation in severity. The specific offense characteristics and cross references contained in this guideline are designed with these considerations in mind.</p><p>The Commission has determined that, ordinarily, the sentences of defendants convicted of federal offenses should reflect the nature and magnitude of the loss caused or intended by their crimes. Accordingly, along with other relevant factors under the guidelines, loss serves as a measure of the seriousness of the offense and the defendant\u2019s relative culpability and is a principal factor in determining the offense level under this guideline.</p><p>Theft from the person of another, such as pickpocketing or non-forcible purse-snatching, receives an enhanced sentence because of the increased risk of physical injury. This guideline does not include an enhancement for thefts from the person by means of force or fear; such crimes are robberies and are covered under \xa72B3.1 (Robbery).</p><p>A minimum offense level of level 14 is provided for offenses involving an organized scheme to steal vehicles or vehicle parts. Typically, the scope of such activity is substantial, but the value of the property may be particularly difficult to ascertain in individual cases because the stolen property is rapidly resold or otherwise disposed of in the course of the offense. Therefore, the specific offense characteristic of \u201corganized scheme\u201d is used as an alternative to \u201closs\u201d in setting a minimum offense level.</p><p>Use of false pretenses involving charitable causes and government agencies enhances the sentences of defendants who take advantage of victims\u2019 trust in government or law enforcement agencies or the generosity and charitable motives of victims. Taking advantage of a victim\u2019s self-interest does not mitigate the seriousness of fraudulent conduct; rather, defendants who exploit victims\u2019 charitable impulses or trust in government create particular social harm. In a similar vein, a defendant who has been subject to civil or administrative proceedings for the same or similar fraudulent conduct demonstrates aggravated criminal intent and is deserving of additional punishment for not conforming with the requirements of judicial process or orders issued by federal, state, or local administrative agencies.</p><p>Offenses that involve the use of financial transactions or financial accounts outside the United States in an effort to conceal illicit profits and criminal conduct involve a particularly high level of sophistication and complexity. These offenses are difficult to detect and require costly investigations and prosecutions. Diplomatic processes often must be used to secure testimony and evidence beyond the jurisdiction of United States courts. Consequently, a minimum offense level of level 12 is provided for these offenses.</p><p>Subsection (b)(5) implements the instruction to the Commission in section 2 of Public Law 105\u2013101 and the directive to the Commission in section 3 of Public Law 110\u2013384.</p><p>Subsection (b)(7) implements the directive to the Commission in section 10606 of Public Law 111\u2013148.</p><p>Subsection (b)(8) implements the directive to the Commission in section 7 of Public Law\xa0112\u2013186.</p><p>Subsection (b)(9)(D) implements, in a broader form, the directive in section 3 of the College Scholarship Fraud Prevention Act of 2000, Public Law 106\u2013420.</p><p>Subsection (b)(10) implements, in a broader form, the instruction to the Commission in section 6(c)(2) of Public Law 105\u2013184.</p><p>Subsections (b)(11)(A)(i) and (B)(i) implement the instruction to the Commission in section 4 of the Wireless Telephone Protection Act, Public Law 105\u2013172.</p><p>Subsection (b)(11)(C) implements the directive to the Commission in section 4 of the Identity Theft and Assumption Deterrence Act of 1998, Public Law 105\u2013318. This subsection focuses principally on an aggravated form of identity theft known as \u201caffirmative identity theft\u201d or \u201cbreeding\u201d, in which a defendant uses another individual\u2019s name, social security number, or some other form of identification (the \u201cmeans of identification\u201d) to \u201cbreed\u201d (<em>i.e.</em>, produce or obtain) new or additional forms of identification. Because 18 U.S.C. \xa7\xa01028(d) broadly defines \u201cmeans of identification\u201d, the new or additional forms of identification can include items such as a driver\u2019s license, a credit card, or a bank loan. This subsection provides a minimum offense level of level 12, in part because of the seriousness of the offense. The minimum offense level accounts for the fact that the means of identification that were \u201cbred\u201d (<em>i.e.</em>, produced or obtained) often are within the defendant\u2019s exclusive control, making it difficult for the individual victim to detect that the victim\u2019s identity has been \u201cstolen.\u201d Generally, the victim does not become aware of the offense until certain harms have already occurred (<em>e.g.</em>, a damaged credit rating or an inability to obtain a loan). The minimum offense level also accounts for the non-monetary harm associated with these types of offenses, much of which may be difficult or impossible to quantify (<em>e.g.</em>, harm to the individual\u2019s reputation or credit rating, inconvenience, and other difficulties resulting from the offense).

The court should consider that the intent of this provision is to provide an increased offense level for cases in which the offender(s) engaged in conduct that would instill in a reasonable person, who is a victim of the offense, a fear of death.</p><p><strong>Background:</strong> Possession or use of a weapon, physical injury, and unlawful restraint sometimes occur during a robbery. The guideline provides for a range of enhancements where these factors are present.</p><p>Although in pre-guidelines practice the amount of money taken in robbery cases affected sentence length, its importance was small compared to that of the other harm involved. Moreover, because of the relatively high base offense level for robbery, an increase of 1 or 2 levels brings about a considerable increase in sentence length in absolute terms. Accordingly, the gradations for property loss increase more slowly than for simple property offenses.</p><p>The guideline provides an enhancement for robberies where a victim was forced to accompany the defendant to another location, or was physically restrained by being tied, bound, or locked up.</p><table><tbody><tr class='odd'><td><em>Historical Note</em></td><td>Effective November 1, 1987.

The \u201c<em><strong>value of the improper benefit to be conferred</strong></em>\u201d refers to the value of the action to be taken or effected in return for the bribe. <em>See</em> Commentary to \xa72C1.1 (Offering, Giving, Soliciting, or Receiving a Bribe; Extortion Under Color of Official Right; Fraud Involving the Deprivation of the Intangible Right to Honest Services of Public Officials; Conspiracy to Defraud by Interference with Governmental Functions).</p><p>3. \u201c<em><strong>Financial institution</strong></em>,\u201d as used in this guideline, is defined to include any institution described in 18 U.S.C. \xa7\xa7\xa020, 656, 657, 1005\u20131007, and 1014; any state or foreign bank, trust company, credit union, insurance company, investment company, mutual fund, savings (building and loan) association, union or employee pension fund; any health, medical or hospital insurance association; brokers and dealers registered, or required to be registered, with the Securities and Exchange Commission; futures commodity merchants and commodity pool operators registered, or required to be registered, with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission; and any similar entity, whether or not insured by the federal government. \u201cUnion or employee pension fund\u201d and \u201cany health, medical, or hospital insurance association,\u201d as used above, primarily include large pension funds that serve many individuals (<em>e.g.</em>, pension funds of large national and international organizations, unions, and corporations doing substantial interstate business), and associations that undertake to provide pension, disability, or other benefits (<em>e.g.</em>, medical or hospitalization insurance) to large numbers of persons.</p><p>4. <strong>Gross Receipts Enhancement under Subsection (b)(2)(A).\u2014</strong></p><blockquote><p>(A) <strong>In General.\u2014</strong>For purposes of subsection (b)(2)(A), the defendant shall be considered to have derived more than $1,000,000 in gross receipts if the gross receipts to the defendant individually, rather than to all participants, exceeded $1,000,000.</p><p>(B) <strong>Definition.\u2014</strong>\u201c<em><strong>Gross receipts from the offense</strong></em>\u201d includes all property, real or personal, tangible or intangible, which is obtained directly or indirectly as a result of such offense. <em>See</em> 18 U.S.C. \xa7\xa0982(a)(4).</p></blockquote><p>5. <strong>Enhancement for Substantially Jeopardizing the Safety and Soundness of a Financial Institution under Subsection (b)(2)(B).\u2014</strong>For purposes of subsection (b)(2)(B), an offense shall be considered to have substantially jeopardized the safety and soundness of a financial institution if, as a consequence of the offense, the institution (A)\xa0became insolvent; (B) substantially reduced benefits to pensioners or insureds; (C)\xa0was unable on demand to refund fully any deposit, payment, or investment; (D) was so depleted of its assets as to be forced to merge with another institution in order to continue active operations; or (E) was placed in substantial jeopardy of any of subdivisions (A) through (D) of this note.</p><p>6. If the defendant is convicted under 18 U.S.C. \xa7\xa0225 (relating to a continuing financial crimes enterprise), the offense level is that applicable to the underlying series of offenses comprising the \u201ccontinuing financial crimes enterprise.\u201d</p><p><strong>Background:</strong> This guideline applies to violations of various federal bribery statutes that do not involve governmental officials. The base offense level is to be enhanced based upon the value of the unlawful payment or the value of the action to be taken or effected in return for the unlawful payment, whichever is greater.</p><p>One of the more commonly prosecuted offenses to which this guideline applies is offering or accepting a fee in connection with procurement of a loan from a financial institution in violation of 18 U.S.C. \xa7\xa0215.</p><p>As with non-commercial bribery, this guideline considers not only the amount of the bribe but also the value of the action received in return. Thus, for example, if a bank officer agreed to the offer of a $25,000 bribe to approve a $250,000 loan under terms for which the applicant would not otherwise qualify, the court, in increasing the offense level, would use the greater of the $25,000 bribe, and the savings in interest over the life of the loan compared with alternative loan terms. If a gambler paid a player $5,000 to shave points in a nationally televised basketball game, the value of the action to the gambler would be the amount that he and his confederates won or stood to gain. If that amount could not be estimated, the amount of the bribe would be used to determine the appropriate increase in offense level.</p><p>This guideline also applies to making prohibited payments to induce the award of subcontracts on federal projects for which the maximum term of imprisonment authorized is ten years. 41\xa0U.S.C. \xa7\xa7\xa08702, 8707. Violations of 42 U.S.C. \xa7\xa01320a-7b involve the offer or acceptance of a payment to refer an individual for services or items paid for under a federal health care program (<em>e.g.</em>, the Medicare and Medicaid programs).</p><p>This guideline also applies to violations of law involving bribes and kickbacks in expenses incurred for a presidential nominating convention or presidential election campaign. These offenses are prohibited under 26 U.S.C. \xa7\xa7\xa09012(e) and 9042(d), which apply to candidates for President and Vice President whose campaigns are eligible for federal matching funds.</p><p>This guideline also applies to violations of 18 U.S.C. \xa7\xa0224, sports bribery, as well as certain violations of the Interstate Commerce Act.</p><p>Subsection (b)(2)(A) implements, in a broader form, the instruction to the Commission in section 961(m) of Public Law 101\u201373.</p><p>Subsection (b)(2)(B) implements the instruction to the Commission in section 2507 of Public Law 101\u2013647.</p><table><tbody><tr class='odd'><td><em>Historical Note</em></td><td>Effective November 1, 1987.

In a case involving such an offense, the \u201cretail value of the infringed item\u201d is the value of that item upon its initial commercial distribution.</p><p>(vii) A case under 18 U.S.C. \xa7\xa02318 or \xa7\xa02320 that involves a counterfeit label, patch, sticker, wrapper, badge, emblem, medallion, charm, box, container, can, case, hangtag, documentation, or packaging of any type or nature (I) that has not been affixed to, or does not enclose or accompany a good or service; and (II) which, had it been so used, would appear to a reasonably informed purchaser to be affixed to, enclosing or accompanying an identifiable, genuine good or service.

For example, if the defendant sold both counterfeit videotapes that are identical in quality to the infringed videotapes and obviously inferior counterfeit handbags, the infringement amount, for purposes of subsection (b)(1), is the sum of the infringement amount calculated with respect to the counterfeit videotapes under subdivision (A)(i) (<em>i.e.</em>, the quantity of the infringing videotapes multiplied by the retail value of the infringed videotapes) and the infringement amount calculated with respect to the counterfeit handbags under subdivision (B) (<em>i.e.</em>, the quantity of the infringing handbags multiplied by the retail value of the infringing handbags).</p><p>(E) <strong>Indeterminate Number of Infringing Items.\u2014</strong>In a case in which the court cannot determine the number of infringing items, the court need only make a reasonable estimate of the infringement amount using any relevant information, including financial records.</p></blockquote><p>3. <strong>Application of Subsection (b)(7).\u2014</strong>In subsection (b)(7), \u201c<em><strong>other significant harm to a member of the Armed Forces</strong></em>\u201d means significant harm other than serious bodily injury or death. In a case in which the offense involved a counterfeit military good or service the use, malfunction, or failure of which is likely to cause serious bodily injury or death, subsection (b)(6)(A) (conscious or reckless risk of serious bodily injury or death) would apply.</p><p>4. <strong>Application of \xa73B1.3.\u2014</strong>If the defendant de-encrypted or otherwise circumvented a technological security measure to gain initial access to an infringed item, an adjustment under \xa73B1.3 (Abuse of Position of Trust or Use of Special Skill) may apply.</p><p>5. <strong>Departure Considerations.\u2014</strong>If the offense level determined under this guideline substantially understates or overstates the seriousness of the offense, a departure may be warranted. The following is a non-exhaustive list of factors that the court may consider in determining whether a departure may be warranted:</p><blockquote><p>(A) The offense involved substantial harm to the reputation of the copyright or trademark owner.</p><p>(B) The offense was committed in connection with, or in furtherance of, the criminal activities of a national, or international, organized criminal enterprise.</p><p>(C) The method used to calculate the infringement amount is based upon a formula or extrapolation that results in an estimated amount that may substantially exceed the actual pecuniary harm to the copyright or trademark owner.</p><p>(D) The offense resulted in death or serious bodily injury.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Background:</strong> This guideline treats copyright and trademark violations much like theft and fraud. Similar to the sentences for theft and fraud offenses, the sentences for defendants convicted of intellectual property offenses should reflect the nature and magnitude of the pecuniary harm caused by their crimes. Accordingly, similar to the loss enhancement in the theft and fraud guideline, the infringement amount in subsection (b)(1) serves as a principal factor in determining the offense level for intellectual property offenses.</p><p>Subsection (b)(1) implements section 2(g) of the No Electronic Theft (NET) Act of 1997, Pub.\xa0L. 105\u2013147, by using the retail value of the infringed item, multiplied by the number of infringing items, to determine the pecuniary harm for cases in which use of the retail value of the infringed item is a reasonable estimate of that harm. For cases referred to in Application Note 2(B), the Commission determined that use of the retail value of the infringed item would overstate the pecuniary harm or otherwise be inappropriate. In these types of cases, use of the retail value of the infringing item, multiplied by the number of those items, is a more reasonable estimate of the resulting pecuniary harm.</p><p>Subsection (b)(5) implements the directive to the Commission in section 717 of Public Law 112\u2013144.</p><p>Section 2511 of title 18, United States Code, as amended by the Electronic Communications Act of 1986, prohibits the interception of satellite transmission for purposes of direct or indirect commercial advantage or private financial gain.

A payment need not be monetary.</p><p>\u201c<em><strong>Public official</strong></em>\u201d shall be construed broadly and includes the following:</p><p>(A) \u201cPublic official\u201d as defined in 18 U.S.C. \xa7\xa0201(a)(1).</p><p>(B) A member of a state or local legislature. \u201cState\u201d means a State of the United States, and any commonwealth, territory, or possession of the United States.</p><p>(C) An officer or employee or person acting for or on behalf of a state or local government, or any department, agency, or branch of government thereof, in any official function, under or by authority of such department, agency, or branch of government, or a juror in a state or local trial.</p><p>(D) Any person who has been selected to be a person described in subdivisions (A), (B), or (C), either before or after such person has qualified.</p><p>(E) An individual who, although not otherwise covered by subdivisions (A) through (D): (i) is in a position of public trust with official responsibility for carrying out a government program or policy; (ii) acts under color of law or official right; or (iii) participates so substantially in government operations as to possess de facto authority to make governmental decisions (<em>e.g.</em>, which may include a leader of a state or local political party who acts in the manner described in this subdivision).</p></blockquote><p>2. <strong>More than One Bribe or Extortion.\u2014</strong>Subsection (b)(1) provides an adjustment for offenses involving more than one incident of either bribery or extortion. Related payments that, in essence, constitute a single incident of bribery or extortion (<em>e.g.</em>, a number of installment payments for a single action) are to be treated as a single bribe or extortion, even if charged in separate counts.</p><blockquote><p>In a case involving more than one incident of bribery or extortion, the applicable amounts under subsection (b)(2) (<em>i.e.</em>, the greatest of the value of the payment, the benefit received or to be received, the value of anything obtained or to be obtained by a public official or others acting with a public official, or the loss to the government) are determined separately for each incident and then added together.</p></blockquote><p>3. <strong>Application of Subsection (b)(2).\u2014</strong>\u201c<em><strong>Loss</strong></em>\u201d, for purposes of subsection (b)(2), shall be determined in accordance with Application Note 3 of the Commentary to \xa72B1.1 (Theft, Property Destruction, and Fraud). The value of \u201c<em><strong>the benefit received or to be received</strong></em>\u201d means the net value of such benefit. <strong>Examples:</strong> (A) A government employee, in return for a $500 bribe, reduces the price of a piece of surplus property offered for sale by the government from $10,000 to $2,000; the value of the benefit received is $8,000. (B) A $150,000 contract on which $20,000 profit was made was awarded in return for a bribe; the value of the benefit received is $20,000. Do not deduct the value of the bribe itself in computing the value of the benefit received or to be received. In the preceding examples, therefore, the value of the benefit received would be the same regardless of the value of the bribe.</p><p>4. <strong>Application of Subsection (b)(3).\u2014</strong></p><blockquote><p>(A) <strong>Definition.\u2014</strong>\u201c<em><strong>High-level decision-making or sensitive position</strong></em>\u201d means a position characterized by a direct authority to make decisions for, or on behalf of, a government department, agency, or other government entity, or by a substantial influence over the decision-making process.</p><p>(B) <strong>Examples.\u2014</strong>Examples of a public official in a high-level decision-making position include a prosecuting attorney, a judge, an agency administrator, and any other public official with a similar level of authority. Examples of a public official who holds a sensitive position include a juror, a law enforcement officer, an election official, and any other similarly situated individual.</p></blockquote><p>5. <strong>Application of Subsection (c).\u2014</strong>For the purposes of determining whether to apply the cross references in this section, the \u201c<em><strong>resulting offense level</strong></em>\u201d means the final offense level (<em>i.e.</em>, the offense level determined by taking into account both the Chapter Two offense level and any applicable adjustments from Chapter Three, Parts A\u2013D). <em>See</em>\xa0\xa71B1.5(d); Application Note 2 of the Commentary to \xa71B1.5 (Interpretation of References to Other Offense Guidelines).</p><p>6. <strong>Inapplicability of \xa73B1.3.\u2014</strong>Do not apply \xa73B1.3 (Abuse of Position of Trust or Use of Special Skill).</p><p>7. <strong>Upward Departure Provisions.\u2014</strong>In some cases the monetary value of the unlawful payment may not be known or may not adequately reflect the seriousness of the offense. For example, a small payment may be made in exchange for the falsification of inspection records for a shipment of defective parachutes or the destruction of evidence in a major narcotics case. In part, this issue is addressed by the enhancements in \xa72C1.1(b)(2) and (c)(1), (2), and (3). However, in cases in which the seriousness of the offense is still not adequately reflected, an upward departure is warranted. <em>See</em> Chapter Five, Part K (Departures).</p><blockquote><p>In a case in which the court finds that the defendant\u2019s conduct was part of a systematic or pervasive corruption of a governmental function, process, or office that may cause loss of public confidence in government, an upward departure may be warranted. <em>See</em> \xa75K2.7 (Disruption of Governmental Function).</p></blockquote><p><strong>Background:</strong> This section applies to a person who offers or gives a bribe for a corrupt purpose, such as inducing a public official to participate in a fraud or to influence such individual\u2019s official actions, or to a public official who solicits or accepts such a bribe.</p><p>The object and nature of a bribe may vary widely from case to case. In some cases, the object may be commercial advantage (<em>e.g.</em>, preferential treatment in the award of a government contract). In others, the object may be issuance of a license to which the recipient is not entitled. In still others, the object may be the obstruction of justice. Consequently, a guideline for the offense must be designed to cover diverse situations.</p><p>In determining the net value of the benefit received or to be received, the value of the bribe is not deducted from the gross value of such benefit; the harm is the same regardless of value of the bribe paid to receive the benefit. In a case in which the value of the bribe exceeds the value of the benefit, or in which the value of the benefit cannot be determined, the value of the bribe is used because it is likely that the payer of such a bribe expected something in return that would be worth more than the value of the bribe. Moreover, for deterrence purposes, the punishment should be commensurate with the gain to the payer or the recipient of the bribe, whichever is greater.</p><p>Under \xa72C1.1(b)(3), if the payment was for the purpose of influencing an official act by certain officials, the offense level is increased by 4 levels.</p><p>Under \xa72C1.1(c)(1), if the payment was to facilitate the commission of another criminal offense, the guideline applicable to a conspiracy to commit that other offense will apply if the result is greater than that determined above. For example, if a bribe was given to a law enforcement officer to allow the smuggling of a quantity of cocaine, the guideline for conspiracy to import cocaine would be applied if it resulted in a greater offense level.</p><p>Under \xa72C1.1(c)(2), if the payment was to conceal another criminal offense or obstruct justice in respect to another criminal offense, the guideline from \xa72X3.1 (Accessory After the Fact) or \xa72J1.2 (Obstruction of Justice), as appropriate, will apply if the result is greater than that determined above. For example, if a bribe was given for the purpose of concealing the offense of espionage, the guideline for accessory after the fact to espionage would be applied.</p><p>Under \xa72C1.1(c)(3), if the offense involved forcible extortion, the guideline from \xa72B3.2 (Extortion by Force or Threat of Injury or Serious Damage) will apply if the result is greater than that determined above.</p><p>Section 2C1.1 also applies to offenses under 15 U.S.C. \xa7\xa7\xa078dd-1, 78dd-2,\xa0and 78dd-3. Such offenses generally involve a payment to a foreign public official, candidate for public office, or agent or intermediary, with the intent to influence an official act or decision of a foreign government or political party. Typically, a case prosecuted under these provisions will involve an intent to influence governmental action.</p><p>Section 2C1.1 also applies to fraud involving the deprivation of the intangible right to honest services of government officials under 18 U.S.C. \xa7\xa7\xa01341\u20131343 and conspiracy to defraud by interference with governmental functions under 18 U.S.C. \xa7\xa0371. Such fraud offenses typically involve an improper use of government influence that harms the operation of government in a manner similar to bribery offenses.</p><p>Offenses involving attempted bribery are frequently not completed because the offense is reported to authorities or an individual involved in the offense is acting in an undercover capacity. Failure to complete the offense does not lessen the defendant\u2019s culpability in attempting to use public position for personal gain. Therefore, solicitations and attempts are treated as equivalent to the underlying offense.</p><table><tbody><tr class='odd'><td><em>Historical Note</em></td><td>Effective November 1, 1987.

If a mixture or substance contains more than one controlled substance, the weight of the entire mixture or substance is assigned to the controlled substance that results in the greater offense level.</p><p>(B) The terms \u201c<em><strong>PCP (actual)</strong></em>\u201d, \u201c<em><strong>Amphetamine (actual)</strong></em>\u201d, and \u201c<em><strong>Methamphetamine (actual)</strong></em>\u201d refer to the weight of the controlled substance, itself, contained in the mixture or substance. For example, a mixture weighing 10\xa0grams containing PCP at 50% purity contains 5 grams of PCP (actual). In the case of a mixture or substance containing PCP, amphetamine, or methamphetamine, use the offense level determined by the entire weight of the mixture or substance, or the offense level determined by the weight of the PCP (actual), amphetamine (actual), or methamphetamine (actual), whichever is greater.</p><blockquote><p>The terms \u201c<em><strong>Hydrocodone (actual)</strong></em>\u201d and \u201c<em><strong>Oxycodone (actual)</strong></em>\u201d refer to the weight of the controlled substance, itself, contained in the pill, capsule, or mixture.</p></blockquote><p>(C) \u201c<em><strong>Ice</strong></em>,\u201d for the purposes of this guideline, means a mixture or substance containing d\u2011methamphetamine hydrochloride of at least 80% purity.</p><p>(D) \u201c<em><strong>Cocaine base</strong></em>,\u201d for the purposes of this guideline, means \u201ccrack.\u201d \u201c<em><strong>Crack</strong></em>\u201d is the street name for a form of cocaine base, usually prepared by processing cocaine hydrochloride and sodium bicarbonate, and usually appearing in a lumpy, rocklike form.</p><p>(E) In the case of an offense involving marihuana plants, treat each plant, regardless of sex, as equivalent to 100 grams of marihuana. <em>Provided</em>, however, that if the actual weight of the marihuana is greater, use the actual weight of the marihuana.</p><p>(F) In the case of Schedule I or II Depressants (except gamma-hydroxybutyric acid), Schedule III substances, Schedule IV substances, and Schedule V substances, one \u201c<em><strong>unit</strong></em>\u201d means one pill, capsule, or tablet. If the substance (except gamma-hydroxybutyric acid) is in liquid form, one \u201c<em><strong>unit</strong></em>\u201d means 0.5 milliliters. For an anabolic steroid that is not in a pill, capsule, tablet, or liquid form (<em>e.g.</em>, patch, topical cream, aerosol), the court shall determine the base offense level using a reasonable estimate of the quantity of anabolic steroid involved in the offense. In making a reasonable estimate, the court shall consider that each 25 milligrams of an anabolic steroid is one \u201cunit\u201d.</p><p>(G) In the case of LSD on a carrier medium (<em>e.g.</em>, a sheet of blotter paper), do not use the weight of the LSD/carrier medium. Instead, treat each dose of LSD on the carrier medium as equal to 0.4 milligrams of LSD for the purposes of the Drug Quantity Table.</p><p>(H) <em><strong>Hashish</strong></em>, for the purposes of this guideline, means a resinous substance of cannabis that includes (i)\xa0one or more of the tetrahydrocannabinols (as listed in 21 C.F.R. \xa7\xa01308.11(d)(31)), (ii) at least two of the following: cannabinol, cannabidiol, or cannabichromene, and (iii) fragments of plant material (such as cystolith fibers).</p><p>(I) <em><strong>Hashish oil</strong></em>, for the purposes of this guideline, means a preparation of the soluble cannabinoids derived from cannabis that includes (i) one or more of the tetrahydrocannabinols (as listed in 21 C.F.R. \xa7\xa01308.11(d)(31)), (ii) at least two of the following: cannabinol, cannabidiol, or cannabichromene, and (iii) is essentially free of plant material (<em>e.g.</em>, plant fragments). Typically, hashish oil is a viscous, dark colored oil, but it can vary from a dry resin to a colorless liquid.</p><h4 id='commentary-50' class='Commentary'><strong>Commentary</strong></h4><p><strong>Statutory Provisions:</strong> 21 U.S.C. \xa7\xa7\xa0841(a), (b)(1)\u2013(3), (7), (g), 860a, 865, 960(a), (b); 49 U.S.C. \xa7\xa046317(b). For additional statutory provision(s), <em>see</em> Appendix A (Statutory Index).</p><p><strong>Application Notes:</strong></p><p>1. <strong>\u201cMixture or Substance\u201d.\u2014</strong>\u201c<em><strong>Mixture or substance</strong></em>\u201d as used in this guideline has the same meaning as in 21 U.S.C. \xa7\xa0841, except as expressly provided. Mixture or substance does not include materials that must be separated from the controlled substance before the controlled substance can be used. Examples of such materials include the fiberglass in a cocaine/ fiberglass bonded suitcase, beeswax in a cocaine/beeswax statue, and waste water from an illicit laboratory used to manufacture a controlled substance. If such material cannot readily be separated from the mixture or substance that appropriately is counted in the Drug Quantity Table, the court may use any reasonable method to approximate the weight of the mixture or substance to be counted.</p><blockquote><p>An upward departure nonetheless may be warranted when the mixture or substance counted in the Drug Quantity Table is combined with other, non-countable material in an unusually sophisticated manner in order to avoid detection.</p><p>Similarly, in the case of marihuana having a moisture content that renders the marihuana unsuitable for consumption without drying (this might occur, for example, with a bale of rain-soaked marihuana or freshly harvested marihuana that had not been dried), an approximation of the weight of the marihuana without such excess moisture content is to be used.</p></blockquote><p>2. <strong>\u201cPlant\u201d.\u2014</strong>For purposes of the guidelines, a \u201c<em><strong>plant</strong></em>\u201d is an organism having leaves and a readily observable root formation (<em>e.g.</em>, a marihuana cutting having roots, a rootball, or root hairs is a marihuana plant).</p><p>3. <strong>Classification of Controlled Substances.\u2014</strong>Certain pharmaceutical preparations are classified as Schedule III, IV, or V controlled substances by the Drug Enforcement Administration under 21 C.F.R. \xa7\xa01308.13\u201315 even though they contain a small amount of a Schedule I or II controlled substance. For example, Tylenol 3 is classified as a Schedule III controlled substance even though it contains a small amount of codeine, a Schedule II opiate. For the purposes of the guidelines, the classification of the controlled substance under 21 C.F.R. \xa7\xa01308.13\u201315 is the appropriate classification.</p><p>4. <strong>Applicability to \u201cCounterfeit\u201d Substances.\u2014</strong>The statute and guideline also apply to <em><strong>\u201ccounterfeit\u201d substances</strong></em>, which are defined in 21 U.S.C. \xa7\xa0802 to mean controlled substances that are falsely labeled so as to appear to have been legitimately manufactured or distributed.</p><p>5. <strong>Determining Drug Types and Drug Quantities.\u2014</strong>Types and quantities of drugs not specified in the count of conviction may be considered in determining the offense level. <em>See</em> \xa71B1.3(a)(2) (Relevant Conduct). Where there is no drug seizure or the amount seized does not reflect the scale of the offense, the court shall approximate the quantity of the controlled substance. In making this determination, the court may consider, for example, the price generally obtained for the controlled substance, financial or other records, similar transactions in controlled substances by the defendant, and the size or capability of any laboratory involved.</p><blockquote><p>If the offense involved both a substantive drug offense and an attempt or conspiracy (<em>e.g.</em>,\xa0sale of five grams of heroin and an attempt to sell an additional ten grams of heroin), the total quantity involved shall be aggregated to determine the scale of the offense.</p><p>In an offense involving an agreement to sell a controlled substance, the agreed-upon quantity of the controlled substance shall be used to determine the offense level unless the sale is completed and the amount delivered more accurately reflects the scale of the offense. For example, a defendant agrees to sell 500 grams of cocaine, the transaction is completed by the delivery of the controlled substance\xa0\u2014 actually 480 grams of cocaine, and no further delivery is scheduled. In this example, the amount delivered more accurately reflects the scale of the offense. In contrast, in a reverse sting, the agreed-upon quantity of the controlled substance would more accurately reflect the scale of the offense because the amount actually delivered is controlled by the government, not by the defendant. If, however, the defendant establishes that the defendant did not intend to provide or purchase, or was not reasonably capable of providing or purchasing, the agreed-upon quantity of the controlled substance, the court shall exclude from the offense level determination the amount of controlled substance that the defendant establishes that the defendant did not intend to provide or purchase or was not reasonably capable of providing or purchasing.</p></blockquote><p>6. <strong>Analogues and Controlled Substances Not Referenced in this Guideline.\u2014</strong>Any reference to a particular controlled substance in these guidelines includes all salts, isomers, all salts of isomers, and, except as otherwise provided, any analogue of that controlled substance. Any reference to cocaine includes ecgonine and coca leaves, except extracts of coca leaves from which cocaine and ecgonine have been removed. For purposes of this guideline \u201c<em><strong>analogue</strong></em>\u201d has the meaning given the term \u201ccontrolled substance analogue\u201d in 21 U.S.C. \xa7\xa0802(32). In determining the appropriate sentence, the court also may consider whether the same quantity of analogue produces a greater effect on the central nervous system than the controlled substance for which it is an analogue.</p><blockquote><p>In the case of a controlled substance that is not specifically referenced in this guideline, determine the base offense level using the marihuana equivalency of the most closely related controlled substance referenced in this guideline. In determining the most closely related controlled substance, the court shall, to the extent practicable, consider the following:</p><p>(A) Whether the controlled substance not referenced in this guideline has a chemical structure that is substantially similar to a controlled substance referenced in this guideline.</p><p>(B) Whether the controlled substance not referenced in this guideline has a stimulant, depressant, or hallucinogenic effect on the central nervous system that is substantially similar to the stimulant, depressant, or hallucinogenic effect on the central nervous system of a controlled substance referenced in this guideline.</p><p>(C) Whether a lesser or greater quantity of the controlled substance not referenced in this guideline is needed to produce a substantially similar effect on the central nervous system as a controlled substance referenced in this guideline.</p></blockquote><p>7. <strong>Multiple Transactions or Multiple Drug Types.\u2014</strong>Where there are multiple transactions or multiple drug types, the quantities of drugs are to be added. Tables for making the necessary conversions are provided below.</p><p>8. <strong>Use of Drug Equivalency Tables.\u2014 </strong></p><blockquote><p>(A) <strong>Controlled Substances Not Referenced in Drug Quantity Table.\u2014</strong>The Commission has used the sentences provided in, and equivalences derived from, the statute (21 U.S.C. \xa7\xa0841(b)(1)), as the primary basis for the guideline sentences. The statute, however, provides direction only for the more common controlled substances, <em>i.e.</em>, heroin, cocaine, PCP, methamphetamine, fentanyl, LSD and marihuana. In the case of a controlled substance that is not specifically referenced in the Drug Quantity Table, determine the base offense level as follows:</p><p>(i) Use the Drug Equivalency Tables to convert the quantity of the controlled substance involved in the offense to its equivalent quantity of marihuana.</p><p>(ii) Find the equivalent quantity of marihuana in the Drug Quantity Table.</p><p>(iii) Use the offense level that corresponds to the equivalent quantity of marihuana as the base offense level for the controlled substance involved in the offense.</p><p>(<em>See also</em> Application Note 6.) For example, in the Drug Equivalency Tables set forth in this Note, 1 gram of a substance containing oxymorphone, a Schedule I opiate, converts to an equivalent quantity of 5 kilograms of marihuana. In a case involving 100 grams of oxymorphone, the equivalent quantity of marihuana would be 500\xa0kilograms, which corresponds to a base offense level of 26 in the Drug Quantity Table.</p><p>(B) <strong>Combining Differing Controlled Substances.\u2014</strong>The Drug Equivalency Tables also provide a means for combining differing controlled substances to obtain a single offense level. In each case, convert each of the drugs to its marihuana equivalent, add the quantities, and look up the total in the Drug Quantity Table to obtain the combined offense level.</p><p>For certain types of controlled substances, the marihuana equivalencies in the Drug Equivalency Tables are \u201ccapped\u201d at specified amounts (<em>e.g.</em>, the combined equivalent weight of all Schedule V controlled substances shall not exceed 2.49 kilograms of marihuana). Where there are controlled substances from more than one schedule (<em>e.g.</em>, a quantity of a Schedule IV substance and a quantity of a Schedule V substance), determine the marihuana equivalency for each schedule separately (subject to the cap, if any, applicable to that schedule). Then add the marihuana equivalencies to determine the combined marihuana equivalency (subject to the cap, if any, applicable to the combined amounts).</p><p><em>Note:</em> Because of the statutory equivalences, the ratios in the Drug Equivalency Tables do not necessarily reflect dosages based on pharmacological equivalents.</p><p>(C) <strong>Examples for Combining Differing Controlled Substances.\u2014 </strong></p><p>(i) The defendant is convicted of selling 70 grams of a substance containing PCP (Level 20) and 250 milligrams of a substance containing LSD (Level 16). The PCP converts to 70 kilograms of marihuana; the LSD converts to 25 kilograms of marihuana. The total is therefore equivalent to 95 kilograms of marihuana, for which the Drug Quantity Table provides an offense level of 22.</p><p>(ii) The defendant is convicted of selling 500 grams of marihuana (Level 6) and 10,000 units of diazepam (Level 6). The diazepam, a Schedule IV drug, is equivalent to 625 grams of marihuana. The total, 1.125 kilograms of marihuana, has an offense level of 8 in the Drug Quantity Table.</p><p>(iii) The defendant is convicted of selling 80 grams of cocaine (Level 14) and 2\xa0grams of cocaine base (Level 12). The cocaine is equivalent to 16 kilograms of marihuana, and the cocaine base is equivalent to 7.142 kilograms of marihuana. The total is therefore equivalent to 23.142 kilograms of marihuana, which has an offense level of 16 in the Drug Quantity Table.</p><p>(iv) The defendant is convicted of selling 76,000 units of a Schedule III substance, 200,000 units of a Schedule IV substance, and 600,000 units of a Schedule V substance. The marihuana equivalency for the Schedule III substance is 76\xa0kilograms of marihuana (below the cap of 79.99 kilograms of marihuana set forth as the maximum equivalent weight for Schedule III substances). The marihuana equivalency for the Schedule IV substance is subject to a cap of 9.99 kilograms of marihuana set forth as the maximum equivalent weight for Schedule IV substances (without the cap it would have been 12.5 kilograms). The marihuana equivalency for the Schedule V substance is subject to the cap of 2.49 kilograms of marihuana set forth as the maximum equivalent weight for Schedule V substances (without the cap it would have been 3.75 kilograms). The combined equivalent weight, determined by adding together the above amounts, is subject to the cap of 79.99 kilograms of marihuana set forth as the maximum combined equivalent weight for Schedule III, IV, and V substances. Without the cap, the combined equivalent weight would have been 88.48 (76 + 9.99 + 2.49) kilograms.</p><p>(D) <strong>Drug Equivalency Tables.\u2014</strong></p><p><span style='font-variant:

The enhancement for weapon possession in subsection (b)(1) reflects the increased danger of violence when drug traffickers possess weapons. The enhancement should be applied if the weapon was present, unless it is clearly improbable that the weapon was connected with the offense. For example, the enhancement would not be applied if the defendant, arrested at the defendant\u2019s residence, had an unloaded hunting rifle in the closet. The enhancement also applies to offenses that are referenced to \xa72D1.1; <em>see</em> \xa7\xa72D1.2(a)(1) and (2), 2D1.5(a)(1), 2D1.6, 2D1.7(b)(1), 2D1.8, 2D1.11(c)(1), and 2D1.12(c)(1).</p><p>(B) <strong>Interaction of Subsections (b)(1) and (b)(2).\u2014</strong>The enhancements in subsections (b)(1) and (b)(2) may be applied cumulatively (added together), as is generally the case when two or more specific offense characteristics each apply. <em>See</em> \xa71B1.1 (Application Instructions), Application Note 4(A).

Certain professionals often occupy essential positions in drug trafficking schemes. These professionals include doctors, pilots, boat captains, financiers, bankers, attorneys, chemists, accountants, and others whose special skill, trade, profession, or position may be used to significantly facilitate the commission of a drug offense. Additionally, an enhancement under \xa73B1.3 ordinarily would apply in a case in which the defendant used his or her position as a coach to influence an athlete to use an anabolic steroid. Likewise, an adjustment under \xa73B1.3 ordinarily would apply in a case in which the defendant is convicted of a drug offense resulting from the authorization of the defendant to receive scheduled substances from an ultimate user or long-term care facility. <em>See</em> 21 U.S.C. \xa7\xa0822(g).</p><blockquote><p>Note, however, that if an adjustment from subsection (b)(3)(C) applies, do not apply \xa73B1.3 (Abuse of Position of Trust or Use of Special Skill).</p></blockquote><p>24. <strong>Cases Involving Mandatory Minimum Penalties.\u2014</strong>Where a mandatory (statutory) minimum sentence applies, this mandatory minimum sentence may be \u201cwaived\u201d and a lower sentence imposed (including a downward departure), as provided in 28 U.S.C. \xa7\xa0994(n), by reason of a defendant\u2019s \u201csubstantial assistance in the investigation or prosecution of another person who has committed an offense.\u201d <em>See</em> \xa75K1.1 (Substantial Assistance to Authorities). In addition, 18 U.S.C. \xa7\xa03553(f) provides an exception to the applicability of mandatory minimum sentences in certain cases. <em>See</em> \xa75C1.2 (Limitation on Applicability of Statutory Minimum Sentences in Certain Cases).</p><p>25. <strong>Imposition of Consecutive Sentence for 21 U.S.C. \xa7\xa0860a or \xa7\xa0865.\u2014</strong>Sections 860a and 865 of title 21, United States Code, require the imposition of a mandatory consecutive term of imprisonment of not more than 20 years and 15 years, respectively. In order to comply with the relevant statute, the court should determine the appropriate \u201ctotal punishment\u201d and divide the sentence on the judgment form between the sentence attributable to the underlying drug offense and the sentence attributable to 21 U.S.C. \xa7\xa0860a or \xa7\xa0865, specifying the number of months to be served consecutively for the conviction under 21 U.S.C. \xa7\xa0860a or \xa7\xa0865. For example, if the applicable adjusted guideline range is 151\u2013188 months and the court determines a \u201ctotal punishment\u201d of 151 months is appropriate, a sentence of 130 months for the underlying offense plus 21 months for the conduct covered by 21 U.S.C. \xa7\xa0860a or \xa7\xa0865 would achieve the \u201ctotal punishment\u201d in a manner that satisfies the statutory requirement of a consecutive sentence.</p><p>26. <strong>Cases Involving \u201cSmall Amount of Marihuana for No Remuneration\u201d.\u2014</strong>Distribution of \u201ca small amount of marihuana for no remuneration\u201d, 21 U.S.C. \xa7\xa0841(b)(4), is treated as simple possession, to which \xa72D2.1 applies.</p><p>27. <strong>Departure Considerations.\u2014</strong></p><blockquote><p>(A) <strong>Downward Departure Based on Drug Quantity in Certain Reverse Sting Operations.\u2014</strong>If, in a reverse sting (an operation in which a government agent sells or negotiates to sell a controlled substance to a defendant), the court finds that the government agent set a price for the controlled substance that was substantially below the market value of the controlled substance, thereby leading to the defendant\u2019s purchase of a significantly greater quantity of the controlled substance than his available resources would have allowed him to purchase except for the artificially low price set by the government agent, a downward departure may be warranted.</p><p>(B) <strong>Upward Departure Based on Drug Quantity.\u2014</strong>In an extraordinary case, an upward departure above offense level 38 on the basis of drug quantity may be warranted. For example, an upward departure may be warranted where the quantity is at least ten times the minimum quantity required for level 38. Similarly, in the case of a controlled substance for which the maximum offense level is less than level\xa038, an upward departure may be warranted if the drug quantity substantially exceeds the quantity for the highest offense level established for that particular controlled substance.</p><p>(C) <strong>Upward Departure Based on Unusually High Purity.\u2014</strong>Trafficking in controlled substances, compounds, or mixtures of unusually high purity may warrant an upward departure, except in the case of PCP, amphetamine, methamphetamine, hydrocodone, or oxycodone for which the guideline itself provides for the consideration of purity (<em>see</em> the footnote to the Drug Quantity Table). The purity of the controlled substance, particularly in the case of heroin, may be relevant in the sentencing process because it is probative of the defendant\u2019s role or position in the chain of distribution. Since controlled substances are often diluted and combined with other substances as they pass down the chain of distribution, the fact that a defendant is in possession of unusually pure narcotics may indicate a prominent role in the criminal enterprise and proximity to the source of the drugs. As large quantities are normally associated with high purities, this factor is particularly relevant where smaller quantities are involved.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Background:</strong> Offenses under 21 U.S.C. \xa7\xa7\xa0841 and 960 receive identical punishment based upon the quantity of the controlled substance involved, the defendant\u2019s criminal history, and whether death or serious bodily injury resulted from the offense.</p><p>The base offense levels in \xa72D1.1 are either provided directly by the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986 or are proportional to the levels established by statute, and apply to all unlawful trafficking. Levels 30 and 24 in the Drug Quantity Table are the distinctions provided by the Anti-Drug Abuse Act; however, further refinement of drug amounts is essential to provide a logical sentencing structure for drug offenses. To determine these finer distinctions, the Commission consulted numerous experts and practitioners, including authorities at the Drug Enforcement Administration, chemists, attorneys, probation officers, and members of the Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Forces, who also advocate the necessity of these distinctions. Where necessary, this scheme has been modified in response to specific congressional directives to the Commission.</p><p>The base offense levels at levels 24 and 30 establish guideline ranges such that the statutory minimum falls within the range; <em>e.g.</em>, level 30 ranges from 97 to 121 months, where the statutory minimum term is ten years or 120 months.</p><p>For marihuana plants, the Commission has adopted an equivalency of 100 grams per plant, or the actual weight of the usable marihuana, whichever is greater. The decision to treat each plant as equal to 100 grams is premised on the fact that the average yield from a mature marihuana plant equals 100 grams of marihuana. In controlled substance offenses, an attempt is assigned the same offense level as the object of the attempt. Consequently, the Commission adopted the policy that each plant is to be treated as the equivalent of an attempt to produce 100 grams of marihuana, except where the actual weight of the usable marihuana is greater.</p><p>Because the weights of LSD carrier media vary widely and typically far exceed the weight of the controlled substance itself, the Commission has determined that basing offense levels on the entire weight of the LSD and carrier medium would produce unwarranted disparity among offenses involving the same quantity of actual LSD (but different carrier weights), as well as sentences disproportionate to those for other, more dangerous controlled substances, such as PCP. Consequently, in cases involving LSD contained in a carrier medium, the Commission has established a weight per dose of 0.4 milligram for purposes of determining the base offense level.</p><p>The dosage weight of LSD selected exceeds the Drug Enforcement Administration\u2019s standard dosage unit for LSD of 0.05 milligram (<em>i.e.</em>, the quantity of actual LSD per dose) in order to assign some weight to the carrier medium. Because LSD typically is marketed and consumed orally on a carrier medium, the inclusion of some weight attributable to the carrier medium recognizes (A) that offense levels for most other controlled substances are based upon the weight of the mixture containing the controlled substance without regard to purity, and (B) the decision in <em>Chapman v. United States</em>, 500 U.S. 453 (1991) (holding that the term \u201cmixture or substance\u201d in 21 U.S.C. \xa7\xa0841(b)(1) includes the carrier medium in which LSD is absorbed). At the same time, the weight per dose selected is less than the weight per dose that would equate the offense level for LSD on a carrier medium with that for the same number of doses of PCP, a controlled substance that comparative assessments indicate is more likely to induce violent acts and ancillary crime than is LSD. (Treating LSD on a carrier medium as weighing 0.5 milligram per dose would produce offense levels equivalent to those for PCP.) Thus, the approach decided upon by the Commission will harmonize offense levels for LSD offenses with those for other controlled substances and avoid an undue influence of varied carrier weight on the applicable offense level. Nonetheless, this approach does not override the applicability of \u201cmixture or substance\u201d for the purpose of applying any mandatory minimum sentence (<em>see Chapman</em>; \xa75G1.1(b)).</p><p>Frequently, a term of supervised release to follow imprisonment is required by statute for offenses covered by this guideline.

class='Commentary'><strong>Commentary</strong></h4><p><strong>Statutory Provisions:</strong> 21 U.S.C. \xa7\xa7\xa0841(c)(1), (2), (f)(1), 865, 960(d)(1), (2), (3), (4).</p><p><strong>Application Notes:</strong></p><p>1. <strong>Cases Involving Multiple Chemicals.\u2014</strong></p><blockquote><p>(A) <strong>Determining the Base Offense Level for Two or More Chemicals.\u2014</strong>Except as provided in subdivision (B), if the offense involves two or more chemicals, use the quantity of the single chemical that results in the greatest offense level, regardless of whether the chemicals are set forth in different tables or in different categories (<em>i.e.</em>,\xa0list I or list II) under this guideline.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> The defendant was in possession of five kilograms of ephedrine and 300\xa0grams of hydriodic acid. Ephedrine and hydriodic acid typically are used together in the same manufacturing process to manufacture methamphetamine. The base offense level for each chemical is calculated separately and the chemical with the higher base offense level is used. Five kilograms of ephedrine result in a base offense level of level\xa036; 300 grams of hydriodic acid result in a base offense level of level 24. In this case, the base offense level would be level 36.</p><p>(B) <strong>Determining the Base Offense Level for Offenses involving Ephedrine, Pseudoephedrine, or Phenylpropanolamine.\u2014</strong>If the offense involves two or more chemicals each of which is set forth in the Ephedrine, Pseudoephedrine, and Phenylpropanolamine Quantity Table, (i) aggregate the quantities of all such chemicals, and (ii) determine the base offense level corresponding to the aggregate quantity.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> The defendant was in possession of 80 grams of ephedrine and 50 grams of phenylpropanolamine, an aggregate quantity of 130 grams of such chemicals. The base offense level corresponding to that aggregate quantity is level 30.</p><p>(C) <strong>Upward Departure.\u2014</strong>In a case involving two or more chemicals used to manufacture different controlled substances, or to manufacture one controlled substance by different manufacturing processes, an upward departure may be warranted if the offense level does not adequately address the seriousness of the offense.</p></blockquote><p>2. <strong>Application of Subsection (b)(1).\u2014</strong>\u201c<em><strong>Firearm</strong></em>\u201d and \u201c<em><strong>dangerous weapon</strong></em>\u201d are defined in the Commentary to \xa71B1.1 (Application Instructions). The adjustment in subsection (b)(1) should be applied if the weapon was present, unless it is improbable that the weapon was connected with the offense.</p><p>3. <strong>Application of Subsection (b)(2).\u2014</strong>Convictions under 21 U.S.C. \xa7\xa7\xa0841(c)(2) and (f)(1), and 960(d)(2), (d)(3), and (d)(4) do not require that the defendant have knowledge or an actual belief that the listed chemical was to be used to manufacture a controlled substance unlawfully. In a case in which the defendant possessed or distributed the listed chemical without such knowledge or belief, a 3-level reduction is provided to reflect that the defendant is less culpable than one who possessed or distributed listed chemicals knowing or believing that they would be used to manufacture a controlled substance unlawfully.</p><p>4. <strong>Application of Subsection (b)(3).\u2014</strong>Subsection (b)(3) applies if the conduct for which the defendant is accountable under \xa71B1.3 (Relevant Conduct) involved any discharge, emission, release, transportation, treatment, storage, or disposal violation covered by the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, 42 U.S.C. \xa7\xa06928(d), the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, 33 U.S.C. \xa7\xa01319(c), the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, 42 U.S.C. \xa7\xa09603(b), and 49 U.S.C. \xa7\xa05124 (relating to violations of laws and regulations enforced by the Department of Transportation with respect to the transportation of hazardous material). In some cases, the enhancement under subsection (b)(3) may not adequately account for the seriousness of the environmental harm or other threat to public health or safety (including the health or safety of law enforcement and cleanup personnel). In such cases, an upward departure may be warranted. Additionally, any costs of environmental cleanup and harm to persons or property should be considered by the court in determining the amount of restitution under \xa75E1.1 (Restitution) and in fashioning appropriate conditions of supervision under \xa7\xa75B1.3 (Conditions of Probation) and 5D1.3 (Conditions of Supervised Release).</p><p>5. <strong>Application of Subsection (b)(4).\u2014</strong>For purposes of subsection (b)(4), \u201c<em><strong>mass-marketing by means of an interactive computer service</strong></em>\u201d means the solicitation, by means of an interactive computer service, of a large number of persons to induce those persons to purchase a controlled substance. For example, subsection (b)(4) would apply to a defendant who operated a web site to promote the sale of Gamma-butyrolactone (GBL) but would not apply to coconspirators who use an interactive computer service only to communicate with one another in furtherance of the offense. \u201c<em><strong>Interactive computer service</strong></em>\u201d, for purposes of subsection (b)(4) and this note, has the meaning given that term in section 230(e)(2) of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. \xa7\xa0230(f)(2)).</p><p>6. <strong>Imposition of Consecutive Sentence for 21 U.S.C. \xa7\xa0865.\u2014</strong>Section 865 of title 21, United States Code, requires the imposition of a mandatory consecutive term of imprisonment of not more than 15 years. In order to comply with the relevant statute, the court should determine the appropriate \u201ctotal punishment\u201d and, on the judgment form, divide the sentence between the sentence attributable to the underlying drug offense and the sentence attributable to 21 U.S.C. \xa7\xa0865, specifying the number of months to be served consecutively for the conviction under 21 U.S.C. \xa7\xa0865. For example, if the applicable adjusted guideline range is 151\u2013188 months and the court determines a \u201ctotal punishment\u201d of 151 months is appropriate, a sentence of 130 months for the underlying offense plus 21 months for the conduct covered by 21 U.S.C. \xa7\xa0865 would achieve the \u201ctotal punishment\u201d in a manner that satisfies the statutory requirement of a consecutive sentence.</p><p>7. <strong>Applicability of Subsection (b)(6).\u2014</strong>The applicability of subsection (b)(6) shall be determined without regard to the offense of conviction. If subsection (b)(6) applies, \xa75C1.2(b) does not apply. <em>See</em> \xa75C1.2(b)(2)(requiring a minimum offense level of level 17 if the \u201cstatutorily required minimum sentence is at least five years\u201d).</p><p>8. <strong>Application of Subsection (c)(1).\u2014</strong>\u201c<em><strong>Offense involved unlawfully manufacturing a controlled substance or attempting to manufacture a controlled substance unlawfully</strong></em>,\u201d as used in subsection (c)(1), means that the defendant, or a person for whose conduct the defendant is accountable under \xa71B1.3 (Relevant Conduct), completed the actions sufficient to constitute the offense of unlawfully manufacturing a controlled substance or attempting to manufacture a controlled substance unlawfully.</p><p>9. <strong>Offenses Involving Immediate Precursors or Other Controlled Substances Covered Under \xa72D1.1.\u2014</strong>In certain cases, the defendant will be convicted of an offense involving a listed chemical covered under this guideline, and a related offense involving an immediate precursor or other controlled substance covered under \xa72D1.1 (Unlawfully Manufacturing, Importing, Exporting, or Trafficking). For example, P2P (an immediate precursor) and methylamine (a listed chemical) are used together to produce methamphetamine. Determine the offense level under each guideline separately. The offense level for methylamine is determined by using \xa72D1.11. The offense level for P2P is determined by using \xa72D1.1 (P2P is listed in the Drug Equivalency Table under Cocaine and Other Schedule I and II Stimulants (and their immediate precursors)). Under the grouping rules of \xa73D1.2(b), the counts will be grouped together. Note that in determining the scale of the offense under \xa72D1.1, the quantity of both the controlled substance and listed chemical should be considered (<em>see</em> Application Note 5 in the Commentary to \xa72D1.1).</p><p><strong>Background:</strong> Offenses covered by this guideline involve list I chemicals (including ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, and phenylpropanolamine) and list II chemicals. List I chemicals are important to the manufacture of a controlled substance and usually become part of the final product. For example, ephedrine reacts with other chemicals to form methamphetamine. The amount of ephedrine directly affects the amount of methamphetamine produced. List II chemicals are generally used as solvents, catalysts, and reagents.</p><table><tbody><tr class='odd'><td><em>Historical Note</em></td><td>Effective November 1, 1991 (amendment 371).

Subsection (b)(1)(B) is not intended to apply, for example, where the offense consisted of destroying a ledger containing an incriminating entry.</p><p><strong>Background:</strong> This section addresses offenses involving the obstruction of justice generally prosecuted under the above-referenced statutory provisions. Numerous offenses of varying seriousness may constitute obstruction of justice: using threats or force to intimidate or influence a juror or federal officer; obstructing a civil or administrative proceeding; stealing or altering court records; unlawfully intercepting grand jury deliberations; obstructing a criminal investigation; obstructing a state or local investigation of illegal gambling; using intimidation or force to influence testimony, alter evidence, evade legal process, or obstruct the communication of a judge or law enforcement officer; or causing a witness bodily injury or property damage in retaliation for providing testimony, information or evidence in a federal proceeding. The conduct that gives rise to the violation may, therefore, range from a mere threat to an act of extreme violence.</p><p>The specific offense characteristics reflect the more serious forms of obstruction. Because the conduct covered by this guideline is frequently part of an effort to avoid punishment for an offense that the defendant has committed or to assist another person to escape punishment for an offense, a cross reference to \xa72X3.1 (Accessory After the Fact) is provided. Use of this cross reference will provide an enhanced offense level when the obstruction is in respect to a particularly serious offense, whether such offense was committed by the defendant or another person.</p><table><tbody><tr class='odd'><td><em>Historical Note</em></td><td>Effective November 1, 1987.

In the case of a failure to appear for service of sentence, any term of imprisonment imposed on the failure to appear count is to be imposed consecutively to any term of imprisonment imposed for the underlying offense. <em>See</em> \xa75G1.3(a). The guideline range for the failure to appear count is to be determined independently and the grouping rules of \xa7\xa73D1.1\u20133D1.5 do not apply.</p><blockquote><p>However, in the case of a conviction on both the underlying offense and the failure to appear, other than a case of failure to appear for service of sentence, the failure to appear is treated under \xa73C1.1 (Obstructing or Impeding the Administration of Justice) as an obstruction of the underlying offense, and the failure to appear count and the count or counts for the underlying offense are grouped together under \xa73D1.2(c). (Note that 18\xa0U.S.C. \xa7\xa03146(b)(2) does not require a sentence of imprisonment on a failure to appear count, although if a sentence of imprisonment on the failure to appear count is imposed, the statute requires that the sentence be imposed to run consecutively to any other sentence of imprisonment. Therefore, unlike a count in which the statute mandates both a minimum and a consecutive sentence of imprisonment, the grouping rules of \xa7\xa73D1.1\u20133D1.5 apply. <em>See</em> \xa73D1.1(b)(1), comment. (n.1), and \xa73D1.2, comment. (n.1).) The combined sentence will then be constructed to provide a \u201ctotal punishment\u201d that satisfies the requirements both of \xa75G1.2 (Sentencing on Multiple Counts of Conviction) and 18\xa0U.S.C. \xa7\xa03146(b)(2). For example, if the combined applicable guideline range for both counts is 30\u201337 months and the court determines that a \u201ctotal punishment\u201d of 36 months is appropriate, a sentence of 30 months for the underlying offense plus a consecutive six months\u2019 sentence for the failure to appear count would satisfy these requirements. (Note that the combination of this instruction and increasing the offense level for the obstructive, failure to appear conduct has the effect of ensuring an incremental, consecutive punishment for the failure to appear count, as required by 18 U.S.C. \xa7\xa03146(b)(2).)</p></blockquote><p>4. If a defendant is convicted of both the underlying offense and the failure to appear count, and the defendant committed additional acts of obstructive behavior (<em>e.g.</em>, perjury) during the investigation, prosecution, or sentencing of the instant offense, an upward departure may be warranted. The upward departure will ensure an enhanced sentence for obstructive conduct for which no adjustment under \xa73C1.1 (Obstructing or Impeding the Administration of Justice) is made because of the operation of the rules set out in Application Note 3.</p><p>5. In some cases, the defendant may be sentenced on the underlying offense (the offense in respect to which the defendant failed to appear) before being sentenced on the failure to appear offense. In such cases, criminal history points for the sentence imposed on the underlying offense are to be counted in determining the guideline range on the failure to appear offense only where the offense level is determined under subsection (a)(1) (<em>i.e.</em>,\xa0where the offense constituted a failure to report for service of sentence).</p><p><strong>Background:</strong> This section applies to a failure to appear by a defendant who was released pending trial, sentencing, appeal, or surrender for service of sentence.

A conviction for an offense committed prior to age eighteen years is an adult conviction if it is classified as an adult conviction under the laws of the jurisdiction in which the defendant was convicted (<em>e.g.</em>, a federal conviction for an offense committed prior to the defendant\u2019s eighteenth birthday is an adult conviction if the defendant was expressly proceeded against as an adult).</p></blockquote><p>3.

Accordingly, the guideline sentence for a defendant convicted under 18 U.S.C. \xa7\xa0844(h) is the term required by that statute. Section 844(h) of title 18, United State Code, also requires a term of imprisonment imposed under this section to run consecutively to any other term of imprisonment.</p><p>2. <strong>Application of Subsection (b).\u2014</strong></p><blockquote><p>(A) <strong>In General.\u2014</strong>Sections 924(c) and 929(a) of title 18, United States Code, provide mandatory minimum terms of imprisonment (<em>e.g.</em>, not less than five years). Except as provided in subsection (c), in a case in which the defendant is convicted under 18\xa0U.S.C. \xa7\xa0924(c) or \xa7\xa0929(a), the guideline sentence is the minimum term required by the relevant statute. Each of 18 U.S.C. \xa7\xa7\xa0924(c) and 929(a) also requires that a term of imprisonment imposed under that section shall run consecutively to any other term of imprisonment.</p><p>(B) <strong>Upward Departure Provision.\u2014</strong>In a case in which the guideline sentence is determined under subsection (b), a sentence above the minimum term required by 18\xa0U.S.C. \xa7\xa0924(c) or \xa7\xa0929(a) is an upward departure from the guideline sentence. A departure may be warranted, for example, to reflect the seriousness of the defendant\u2019s criminal history in a case in which the defendant is convicted of an 18\xa0U.S.C. \xa7\xa0924(c) or \xa7\xa0929(a) offense but is not determined to be a career offender under \xa74B1.1.</p></blockquote><p>3. <strong>Application of Subsection (c).\u2014</strong>In a case in which the defendant (A) was convicted of violating 18 U.S.C. \xa7\xa0924(c) or 18 U.S.C. \xa7\xa0929(a); and (B) as a result of that conviction (alone or in addition to another offense of conviction), is determined to be a career offender under \xa74B1.1 (Career Offender), the guideline sentence shall be determined under \xa74B1.1(c). In a case involving multiple counts, the sentence shall be imposed according to the rules in subsection (e) of \xa75G1.2 (Sentencing on Multiple Counts of Conviction)</p><p>4. <strong>Weapon Enhancement.\u2014</strong>If a sentence under this guideline is imposed in conjunction with a sentence for an underlying offense, do not apply any specific offense characteristic for possession, brandishing, use, or discharge of an explosive or firearm when determining the sentence for the underlying offense. A sentence under this guideline accounts for any explosive or weapon enhancement for the underlying offense of conviction, including any such enhancement that would apply based on conduct for which the defendant is accountable under \xa71B1.3 (Relevant Conduct). Do not apply any weapon enhancement in the guideline for the underlying offense, for example, if (A) a co-defendant, as part of the jointly undertaken criminal activity, possessed a firearm different from the one for which the defendant was convicted under 18 U.S.C. \xa7\xa0924(c); or (B) in an ongoing drug trafficking offense, the defendant possessed a firearm other than the one for which the defendant was convicted under 18 U.S.C. \xa7\xa0924(c). However, if a defendant is convicted of two armed bank robberies, but is convicted under 18 U.S.C. \xa7\xa0924(c) in connection with only one of the robberies, a weapon enhancement would apply to the bank robbery which was not the basis for the 18 U.S.C. \xa7\xa0924(c) conviction.</p><blockquote><p>A sentence under this guideline also accounts for conduct that would subject the defendant to an enhancement under \xa72D1.1(b)(2) (pertaining to use of violence, credible threat to use violence, or directing the use of violence). Do not apply that enhancement when determining the sentence for the underlying offense.</p><p>If the explosive or weapon that was possessed, brandished, used, or discharged in the course of the underlying offense also results in a conviction that would subject the defendant to an enhancement under \xa72K1.3(b)(3) (pertaining to possession of explosive material in connection with another felony offense) or \xa72K2.1(b)(6)(B) (pertaining to possession of any firearm or ammunition in connection with another felony offense), do not apply that enhancement. A sentence under this guideline accounts for the conduct covered by these enhancements because of the relatedness of that conduct to the conduct that forms the basis for the conviction under 18 U.S.C. \xa7\xa0844(h), \xa7\xa0924(c) or \xa7\xa0929(a). For example, if in addition to a conviction for an underlying offense of armed bank robbery, the defendant was convicted of being a felon in possession under 18 U.S.C. \xa7\xa0922(g), the enhancement under \xa72K2.1(b)(6)(B) would not apply.</p><p>In a few cases in which the defendant is determined not to be a career offender, the offense level for the underlying offense determined under the preceding paragraphs may result in a guideline range that, when combined with the mandatory consecutive sentence under 18 U.S.C. \xa7\xa0844(h), \xa7\xa0924(c), or \xa7\xa0929(a), produces a total maximum penalty that is less than the maximum of the guideline range that would have resulted had there not been a count of conviction under 18 U.S.C. \xa7\xa0844(h), \xa7\xa0924(c), or \xa7\xa0929(a) (<em>i.e.</em>, the guideline range that would have resulted if the enhancements for possession, use, or discharge of a firearm had been applied). In such a case, an upward departure may be warranted so that the conviction under 18 U.S.C. \xa7\xa0844(h), \xa7\xa0924(c), or \xa7\xa0929(a) does not result in a decrease in the total punishment. An upward departure under this paragraph shall not exceed the maximum of the guideline range that would have resulted had there not been a count of conviction under 18 U.S.C. \xa7\xa0844(h), \xa7\xa0924(c), or \xa7\xa0929(a).</p></blockquote><p>5. <strong>Chapters Three and Four.\u2014</strong>Except for those cases covered by subsection (c), do not apply Chapter Three (Adjustments) and Chapter Four (Criminal History and Criminal Livelihood) to any offense sentenced under this guideline. Such offenses are excluded from application of those chapters because the guideline sentence for each offense is determined only by the relevant statute. <em>See</em> \xa7\xa73D1.1 (Procedure for Determining Offense Level on Multiple Counts) and 5G1.2. In determining the guideline sentence for those cases covered by subsection (c): (A) the adjustment in \xa73E1.1 (Acceptance of Responsibility) may apply, as provided in \xa74B1.1(c); and (B) no other adjustments in Chapter Three and no provisions of Chapter Four, other than \xa7\xa74B1.1 and 4B1.2, shall apply.</p><p>6. <strong>Terms of Supervised Release.\u2014</strong>Imposition of a term of supervised release is governed by the provisions of \xa75D1.1 (Imposition of a Term of Supervised Release).</p><p>7. <strong>Fines.\u2014</strong>Subsection (d) sets forth special provisions concerning the imposition of fines. Where there is also a conviction for the underlying offense, a consolidated fine guideline is determined by the offense level that would have applied to the underlying offense absent a conviction under 18 U.S.C. \xa7\xa0844(h), \xa7\xa0924(c), or \xa7\xa0929(a). This is required because the offense level for the underlying offense may be reduced when there is also a conviction under 18 U.S.C. \xa7\xa0844(h), \xa7\xa0924(c), or \xa7\xa0929(a) in that any specific offense characteristic for possession, brandishing, use, or discharge of a firearm is not applied (<em>see</em> Application Note 4). The Commission has not established a fine guideline range for the unusual case in which there is no conviction for the underlying offense, although a fine is authorized under 18 U.S.C. \xa7\xa03571.</p><p><strong>Background:</strong> Section 844(h) of title 18, United States Code, provides a mandatory term of imprisonment. Sections 924(c) and 929(a) of title 18, United States Code, provide mandatory minimum terms of imprisonment. A sentence imposed pursuant to any of these statutes must be imposed to run consecutively to any other term of imprisonment. To avoid double counting, when a sentence under this section is imposed in conjunction with a sentence for an underlying offense, any specific offense characteristic for explosive or firearm discharge, use, brandishing, or possession is not applied in respect to such underlying offense.</p><table><tbody><tr class='odd'><td><em>Historical Note</em></td><td>Effective November 1, 1987.

In such a case, the court may consider whether a departure is appropriate to reflect all or part of the time served in state custody, from the time immigration authorities locate the defendant until the service of the federal sentence commences, that the court determines will not be credited to the federal sentence by the Bureau of Prisons. Any such departure should be fashioned to achieve a reasonable punishment for the instant offense.</p><blockquote><p>Such a departure should be considered only in cases where the departure is not likely to increase the risk to the public from further crimes of the defendant. In determining whether such a departure is appropriate, the court should consider, among other things, (A) whether the defendant engaged in additional criminal activity after illegally reentering the United States; (B) the seriousness of any such additional criminal activity, including (1) whether the defendant used violence or credible threats of violence or possessed a firearm or other dangerous weapon (or induced another person to do so) in connection with the criminal activity, (2) whether the criminal activity resulted in death or serious bodily injury to any person, and (3) whether the defendant was an organizer, leader, manager, or supervisor of others in the criminal activity; and (C) the seriousness of the defendant\u2019s other criminal history.</p></blockquote><p>7. <strong>Departure Based on Cultural Assimilation.\u2014</strong>There may be cases in which a downward departure may be appropriate on the basis of cultural assimilation. Such a departure should be considered only in cases where (A) the defendant formed cultural ties primarily with the United States from having resided continuously in the United States from childhood, (B) those cultural ties provided the primary motivation for the defendant\u2019s illegal reentry or continued presence in the United States, and (C) such a departure is not likely to increase the risk to the public from further crimes of the defendant.</p><blockquote><p>In determining whether such a departure is appropriate, the court should consider, among other things, (1) the age in childhood at which the defendant began residing continuously in the United States, (2) whether and for how long the defendant attended school in the United States, (3) the duration of the defendant\u2019s continued residence in the United States, (4) the duration of the defendant\u2019s presence outside the United States, (5)\xa0the nature and extent of the defendant\u2019s familial and cultural ties inside the United States, and the nature and extent of such ties outside the United States, (6) the seriousness of the defendant\u2019s criminal history, and (7) whether the defendant engaged in additional criminal activity after illegally reentering the United States.</p></blockquote><table><tbody><tr class='odd'><td><em>Historical Note</em></td><td>Effective November 1, 1987.

(Note that 18 U.S.C. \xa7\xa01791(b) does not require a sentence of imprisonment, although if a sentence of imprisonment is imposed on a count involving providing or possessing a controlled substance in prison, section 1791(c) requires that the sentence be imposed to run consecutively to any other sentence of imprisonment for the controlled substance. Therefore, unlike a count in which the statute mandates both a minimum and a consecutive sentence of imprisonment, the grouping rules of \xa7\xa73D1.1\u20133D1.5 apply. <em>See</em> \xa73D1.1(b)(1), comment.

A listing of hazardous and toxic substances in the guidelines would be impractical.

For additional statutory provision(s), <em>see</em> Appendix A (Statutory Index).</p><p><strong>Application Notes:</strong></p><p>1. <strong>Application of Chapter Three (Adjustments).\u2014</strong>Sections 3B1.1 (Aggravating Role), 3B1.2 (Mitigating Role), 3B1.3 (Abuse of Position of Trust or Use of Special Skill), and 3C1.1 (Obstructing or Impeding the Administration of Justice) may be relevant in determining the seriousness of the defendant\u2019s offense. For example, if a sales manager organizes or leads the price-fixing activity of five or more participants, the 4-level increase at \xa73B1.1(a) should be applied to reflect the defendant\u2019s aggravated role in the offense. For purposes of applying \xa73B1.2, an individual defendant should be considered for a mitigating role adjustment only if he were responsible in some minor way for his firm\u2019s participation in the conspiracy.</p><p>2. <strong>Considerations in Setting Fine for Individuals.\u2014</strong>In setting the fine for individuals, the court should consider the extent of the defendant\u2019s participation in the offense, the defendant\u2019s role, and the degree to which the defendant personally profited from the offense (including salary, bonuses, and career enhancement). If the court concludes that the defendant lacks the ability to pay the guideline fine, it should impose community service in lieu of a portion of the fine. The community service should be equally as burdensome as a fine.</p><p>3. The fine for an organization is determined by applying Chapter Eight (Sentencing of Organizations). In selecting a fine for an organization within the guideline fine range, the court should consider both the gain to the organization from the offense and the loss caused by the organization. It is estimated that the average gain from price-fixing is 10\xa0percent of the selling price. The loss from price-fixing exceeds the gain because, among other things, injury is inflicted upon consumers who are unable or for other reasons do not buy the product at the higher prices. Because the loss from price-fixing exceeds the gain, subsection (d)(1) provides that 20 percent of the volume of affected commerce is to be used in lieu of the pecuniary loss under \xa78C2.4(a)(3). The purpose for specifying a percent of the volume of commerce is to avoid the time and expense that would be required for the court to determine the actual gain or loss. In cases in which the actual monopoly overcharge appears to be either substantially more or substantially less than 10 percent, this factor should be considered in setting the fine within the guideline fine range.</p><p>4. Another consideration in setting the fine is that the average level of mark-up due to price-fixing may tend to decline with the volume of commerce involved.</p><p>5. It is the intent of the Commission that alternatives such as community confinement not be used to avoid imprisonment of antitrust offenders.</p><p>6. Understatement of seriousness is especially likely in cases involving complementary bids. If, for example, the defendant participated in an agreement not to submit a bid, or to submit an unreasonably high bid, on one occasion, in exchange for his being allowed to win a subsequent bid that he did not in fact win, his volume of commerce would be zero, although he would have contributed to harm that possibly was quite substantial. The court should consider sentences near the top of the guideline range in such cases.</p><p>7. In the case of a defendant with previous antitrust convictions, a sentence at the maximum of the applicable guideline range, or an upward departure, may be warranted. <em>See\xa0</em>\xa74A1.3 (Adequacy of Criminal History Category).</p><p><strong>Background:</strong> These guidelines apply to violations of the antitrust laws. Although they are not unlawful in all countries, there is near universal agreement that restrictive agreements among competitors, such as horizontal price-fixing (including bid-rigging) and horizontal market-allocation, can cause serious economic harm. There is no consensus, however, about the harmfulness of other types of antitrust offenses, which furthermore are rarely prosecuted and may involve unsettled issues of law. Consequently, only one guideline, which deals with horizontal agreements in restraint of trade, has been promulgated.</p><p>The agreements among competitors covered by this section are almost invariably covert conspiracies that are intended to, and serve no purpose other than to, restrict output and raise prices, and that are so plainly anticompetitive that they have been recognized as illegal <em>per se</em>, <em>i.e.</em>, without any inquiry in individual cases as to their actual competitive effect.</p><p>Under the guidelines, prison terms for these offenders should be much more common, and usually somewhat longer, than typical under pre-guidelines practice. Absent adjustments, the guidelines require some period of confinement in the great majority of cases that are prosecuted, including all bid-rigging cases. The court will have the discretion to impose considerably longer sentences within the guideline ranges. Adjustments from Chapter Three, Part E (Acceptance of Responsibility) and, in rare instances, Chapter Three, Part B (Role in the Offense), may decrease these minimum sentences; nonetheless, in very few cases will the guidelines not require that some confinement be imposed. Adjustments will not affect the level of fines.</p><p>Tying the offense level to the scale or scope of the offense is important in order to ensure that the sanction is in fact punitive and that there is an incentive to desist from a violation once it has begun. The offense levels are not based directly on the damage caused or profit made by the defendant because damages are difficult and time consuming to establish. The volume of commerce is an acceptable and more readily measurable substitute. The limited empirical data available as to pre-guidelines practice showed that fines increased with the volume of commerce and the term of imprisonment probably did as well.</p><p>The Commission believes that the volume of commerce is liable to be an understated measure of seriousness in some bid-rigging cases. For this reason, and consistent with pre-guidelines practice, the Commission has specified a 1-level increase for bid-rigging.</p><p>Substantial fines are an essential part of the sentence. For an individual, the guideline fine range is from one to five percent of the volume of commerce, but not less than $20,000. For an organization, the guideline fine range is determined under Chapter Eight (Sentencing of Organizations), but pursuant to subsection (d)(2), the minimum multiplier is at least 0.75. This multiplier, which requires a minimum fine of 15 percent of the volume of commerce for the least serious case, was selected to provide an effective deterrent to antitrust offenses. At the same time, this minimum multiplier maintains incentives for desired organizational behavior. Because the Department of Justice has a well-established amnesty program for organizations that self-report antitrust offenses, no lower minimum multiplier is needed as an incentive for self-reporting. A minimum multiplier of at least 0.75 ensures that fines imposed in antitrust cases will exceed the average monopoly overcharge.</p><p>The Commission believes that most antitrust defendants have the resources and earning capacity to pay the fines called for by this guideline, at least over time on an installment basis.</p><table><tbody><tr class='odd'><td><em>Historical Note</em></td><td>Effective November 1, 1987.

For additional statutory provision(s), <em>see</em> Appendix A (Statutory Index).</p><p><strong>Application Notes:</strong></p><p>1. <strong>Tax Loss.\u2014</strong>\u201c<em><strong>Tax loss</strong></em>\u201d is defined in subsection (c). The tax loss does not include interest or penalties, except in willful evasion of payment cases under 26 U.S.C. \xa7\xa07201 and willful failure to pay cases under 26 U.S.C. \xa7\xa07203. Although the definition of tax loss corresponds to what is commonly called the \u201ccriminal figures,\u201d its amount is to be determined by the same rules applicable in determining any other sentencing factor. In some instances, such as when indirect methods of proof are used, the amount of the tax loss may be uncertain; the guidelines contemplate that the court will simply make a reasonable estimate based on the available facts.</p><blockquote><p>Notes under subsections (c)(1) and (c)(2) address certain situations in income tax cases in which the tax loss may not be reasonably ascertainable. In these situations, the \u201cpresumptions\u201d set forth are to be used unless the government or defense provides sufficient information for a more accurate assessment of the tax loss. In cases involving other types of taxes, the presumptions in the notes under subsections (c)(1) and (c)(2) do not apply.</p><p><strong>Example 1:</strong> A defendant files a tax return reporting income of $40,000 when his income was actually $90,000. Under Note (A) to subsection (c)(1), the tax loss is treated as $14,000 ($90,000 of actual gross income minus $40,000 of reported gross income = $50,000 x 28%) unless sufficient information is available to make a more accurate assessment of the tax loss.</p><p><strong>Example 2:</strong> A defendant files a tax return reporting income of $60,000 when his income was actually $130,000. In addition, the defendant claims $10,000 in false tax credits. Under Note (A) to subsection (c)(1), the tax loss is treated as $29,600 ($130,000 of actual gross income minus $60,000 of reported gross income = $70,000 x 28% = $19,600, plus $10,000 of false tax credits) unless sufficient information is available to make a more accurate assessment of the tax loss.</p><p><strong>Example 3:</strong> A defendant fails to file a tax return for a year in which his salary was $24,000, and $2,600 in income tax was withheld by his employer. Under the note to subsection (c)(2), the tax loss is treated as $2,200 ($24,000 of gross income x 20% = $4,800, minus $2,600 of tax withheld) unless sufficient information is available to make a more accurate assessment of the tax loss.</p><p>In determining the tax loss attributable to the offense, the court should use as many methods set forth in subsection (c) and this commentary as are necessary given the circumstances of the particular case. If none of the methods of determining the tax loss set forth fit the circumstances of the particular case, the court should use any method of determining the tax loss that appears appropriate to reasonably calculate the loss that would have resulted had the offense been successfully completed.</p></blockquote><p>2. <strong>Total Tax Loss Attributable to the Offense.\u2014</strong>In determining the total tax loss attributable to the offense (<em>see</em> \xa71B1.3(a)(2)), all conduct violating the tax laws should be considered as part of the same course of conduct or common scheme or plan unless the evidence demonstrates that the conduct is clearly unrelated. The following examples are illustrative of conduct that is part of the same course of conduct or common scheme or plan: (A) there is a continuing pattern of violations of the tax laws by the defendant; (B)\xa0the defendant uses a consistent method to evade or camouflage income, <em>e.g.</em>, backdating documents or using off-shore accounts; (C) the violations involve the same or a related series of transactions; (D) the violation in each instance involves a false or inflated claim of a similar deduction or credit; and (E) the violation in each instance involves a failure to report or an understatement of a specific source of income, <em>e.g.</em>, interest from savings accounts or income from a particular business activity. These examples are not intended to be exhaustive.</p><p>3. <strong>Unclaimed Credits, Deductions, and Exemptions.\u2014</strong>In determining the tax loss, the court should account for the standard deduction and personal and dependent exemptions to which the defendant was entitled. In addition, the court should account for any unclaimed credit, deduction, or exemption that is needed to ensure a reasonable estimate of the tax loss, but only to the extent that (A) the credit, deduction, or exemption was related to the tax offense and could have been claimed at the time the tax offense was committed; (B) the credit, deduction, or exemption is reasonably and practicably ascertainable; and (C) the defendant presents information to support the credit, deduction, or exemption sufficiently in advance of sentencing to provide an adequate opportunity to evaluate whether it has sufficient indicia of reliability to support its probable accuracy (<em>see</em> \xa76A1.3 (Resolution of Disputed Factors) (Policy Statement)).</p><blockquote><p>However, the court shall not account for payments to third parties made in a manner that encouraged or facilitated a separate violation of law (<em>e.g.</em>, \u201cunder the table\u201d payments to employees or expenses incurred to obstruct justice).</p><p>The burden is on the defendant to establish any such credit, deduction, or exemption by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>See</em> \xa76A1.3, comment.</p></blockquote><p>4. <strong>Application of Subsection (b)(1) (Criminal Activity).\u2014</strong>\u201c<em><strong>Criminal activity</strong></em>\u201d means any conduct constituting a criminal offense under federal, state, local, or foreign law.</p><p>5. <strong>Application of Subsection (b)(2) (Sophisticated Means).\u2014</strong>For purposes of subsection (b)(2), \u201c<em><strong>sophisticated means</strong></em>\u201d means especially complex or especially intricate offense conduct pertaining to the execution or concealment of an offense. Conduct such as hiding assets or transactions, or both, through the use of fictitious entities, corporate shells, or offshore financial accounts ordinarily indicates sophisticated means.</p><p>6. <strong>Other Definitions.\u2014</strong>For purposes of this section:</p><blockquote><p>A \u201c<em><strong>credit claimed against tax</strong></em>\u201d is an item that reduces the amount of tax directly. In contrast, a \u201c<em><strong>deduction</strong></em>\u201d is an item that reduces the amount of taxable income.</p><p>\u201c<em><strong>Gross income</strong></em>\u201d has the same meaning as it has in 26 U.S.C. \xa7\xa061 and 26 C.F.R. \xa7\xa01.61.</p></blockquote><p>7. <strong>Aggregation of Individual and Corporate Tax Loss.\u2014</strong>If the offense involved both individual and corporate tax returns, the tax loss is the aggregate tax loss from the individual tax offense and the corporate tax offense added together. Accordingly, in a case in which a defendant fails to report income derived from a corporation on both the defendant\u2019s individual tax return and the defendant\u2019s corporate tax return, the tax loss is the sum of (A) the unreported or diverted amount multiplied by (i) 28%; or (ii) the tax rate for the individual tax offense, if sufficient information is available to make a more accurate assessment of that tax rate; and (B) the unreported or diverted amount multiplied by (i) 34%; or (ii) the tax rate for the corporate tax offense, if sufficient information is available to make a more accurate assessment of that tax rate. For example, the defendant, the sole owner of a Subchapter C corporation, fraudulently understates the corporation\u2019s income in the amount of $100,000 on the corporation\u2019s tax return, diverts the funds to the defendant\u2019s own use, and does not report these funds on the defendant\u2019s individual tax return. For purposes of this example, assume the use of 34% with respect to the corporate tax loss and the use of 28% with respect to the individual tax loss. The tax loss attributable to the defendant\u2019s corporate tax return is $34,000 ($100,000 multiplied by 34%). The tax loss attributable to the defendant\u2019s individual tax return is $28,000 ($100,000 multiplied by 28%). The tax loss for the offenses are added together to equal $62,000 ($34,000 + $28,000).</p><p><strong>Background:</strong> This guideline relies most heavily on the amount of loss that was the object of the offense. Tax offenses, in and of themselves, are serious offenses; however, a greater tax loss is obviously more harmful to the treasury and more serious than a smaller one with otherwise similar characteristics. Furthermore, as the potential benefit from the offense increases, the sanction necessary to deter also increases.</p><p>Under pre-guidelines practice, roughly half of all tax evaders were sentenced to probation without imprisonment, while the other half received sentences that required them to serve an average prison term of twelve months. This guideline is intended to reduce disparity in sentencing for tax offenses and to somewhat increase average sentence length. As a result, the number of purely probationary sentences will be reduced. The Commission believes that any additional costs of imprisonment that may be incurred as a result of the increase in the average term of imprisonment for tax offenses are inconsequential in relation to the potential increase in revenue. According to estimates current at the time this guideline was originally developed (1987), income taxes are underpaid by approximately $90 billion annually. Guideline sentences should result in small increases in the average length of imprisonment for most tax cases that involve less than $100,000 in tax loss. The increase is expected to be somewhat larger for cases involving more taxes.</p><p>Failure to report criminally derived income is included as a factor for deterrence purposes. Criminally derived income is generally difficult to establish, so that the tax loss in such cases will tend to be substantially understated. An enhancement for offenders who violate the tax laws as part of a pattern of criminal activity from which they derive a substantial portion of their income also serves to implement the mandate of 28 U.S.C. \xa7\xa0994(i)(2).</p><p>Although tax offenses always involve some planning, unusually sophisticated efforts to conceal the offense decrease the likelihood of detection and therefore warrant an additional sanction for deterrence purposes.</p><p>The guideline does not make a distinction for an employee who prepares fraudulent returns on behalf of his employer. The adjustments in Chapter Three, Part B (Role in the Offense) should be used to make appropriate distinctions.</p><table><tbody><tr class='odd'><td><em>Historical Note</em></td><td>Effective November 1, 1987.

In certain instances, such as promotion of a tax shelter scheme, the defendant may advise other persons to violate their tax obligations through filing returns that find no support in the tax laws.

Subsection (b)(1) has two prongs.

Under \xa72X1.1(a), the base offense level will be the same as that for the substantive offense. But the only specific offense characteristics from the guideline for the substantive offense that apply are those that are determined to have been specifically intended or actually occurred. Speculative specific offense characteristics will not be applied. For example, if two defendants are arrested during the conspiratorial stage of planning an armed bank robbery, the offense level ordinarily would not include aggravating factors regarding possible injury to others, hostage taking, discharge of a weapon, or obtaining a large sum of money, because such factors would be speculative. The offense level would simply reflect the level applicable to robbery of a financial institution, with the enhancement for possession of a weapon. If it was established that the defendants actually intended to physically restrain the teller, the specific offense characteristic for physical restraint would be added. In an attempted theft, the value of the items that the defendant attempted to steal would be considered.</p><p>3.

In certain cases, the participants may have completed (or have been about to complete but for apprehension or interruption) all of the acts necessary for the successful completion of part, but not all, of the intended offense. In such cases, the offense level for the count (or group of closely related multiple counts) is whichever of the following is greater: the offense level for the intended offense minus 3 levels (under \xa72X1.1(b)(1), (b)(2), or (b)(3)(A)), or the offense level for the part of the offense for which the necessary acts were completed (or about to be completed but for apprehension or interruption). For example, where the intended offense was the theft of $800,000 but the participants completed (or were about to complete) only the acts necessary to steal $30,000, the offense level is the offense level for the theft of $800,000 minus 3\xa0levels, or the offense level for the theft of $30,000, whichever is greater.</p><blockquote><p>In the case of multiple counts that are not closely related counts, whether the 3-level reduction under \xa72X1.1(b)(1), (b)(2), or (b)(3)(A) applies is determined separately for each count.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Background:</strong> In most prosecutions for conspiracies or attempts, the substantive offense was substantially completed or was interrupted or prevented on the verge of completion by the intercession of law enforcement authorities or the victim. In such cases, no reduction of the offense level is warranted. Sometimes, however, the arrest occurs well before the defendant or any co-conspirator has completed the acts necessary for the substantive offense.

A person who is not criminally responsible for the commission of the offense (<em>e.g.</em>, an undercover law enforcement officer) is not a participant.</p><p>2. To qualify for an adjustment under this section, the defendant must have been the organizer, leader, manager, or supervisor of one or more other participants. An upward departure may be warranted, however, in the case of a defendant who did not organize, lead, manage, or supervise another participant, but who nevertheless exercised management responsibility over the property, assets, or activities of a criminal organization.</p><p>3. In assessing whether an organization is \u201cotherwise extensive,\u201d all persons involved during the course of the entire offense are to be considered.

In distinguishing a leadership and organizational role from one of mere management or supervision, titles such as \u201ckingpin\u201d or \u201cboss\u201d are not controlling. Factors the court should consider include the exercise of decision making authority, the nature of participation in the commission of the offense, the recruitment of accomplices, the claimed right to a larger share of the fruits of the crime, the degree of participation in planning or organizing the offense, the nature and scope of the illegal activity, and the degree of control and authority exercised over others. There can, of course, be more than one person who qualifies as a leader or organizer of a criminal association or conspiracy. This adjustment does not apply to a defendant who merely suggests committing the offense.</p><p><strong>Background:</strong> This section provides a range of adjustments to increase the offense level based upon the size of a criminal organization (<em>i.e.</em>, the number of participants in the offense) and the degree to which the defendant was responsible for committing the offense. This adjustment is included primarily because of concerns about relative responsibility. However, it is also likely that persons who exercise a supervisory or managerial role in the commission of an offense tend to profit more from it and present a greater danger to the public and/or are more likely to recidivate. The Commission\u2019s intent is that this adjustment should increase with both the size of the organization and the degree of the defendant\u2019s responsibility.</p><p>In relatively small criminal enterprises that are not otherwise to be considered as extensive in scope or in planning or preparation, the distinction between organization and leadership, and that of management or supervision, is of less significance than in larger enterprises that tend to have clearly delineated divisions of responsibility.

Accordingly, an adjustment under this guideline may not apply to a defendant who is the only defendant convicted of an offense unless that offense involved other participants in addition to the defendant and the defendant otherwise qualifies for such an adjustment.</p><p>3. <strong>Applicability of Adjustment.\u2014</strong></p><blockquote><p>(A) <strong>Substantially Less Culpable than Average Participant.\u2014</strong>This section provides a range of adjustments for a defendant who plays a part in committing the offense that makes him substantially less culpable than the average participant in the criminal activity.</p><p>A defendant who is accountable under \xa71B1.3 (Relevant Conduct) only for the conduct in which the defendant personally was involved and who performs a limited function in the criminal activity may receive an adjustment under this guideline. For example, a defendant who is convicted of a drug trafficking offense, whose participation in that offense was limited to transporting or storing drugs and who is accountable under \xa71B1.3 only for the quantity of drugs the defendant personally transported or stored may receive an adjustment under this guideline.</p><p>Likewise, a defendant who is accountable under \xa71B1.3 for a loss amount under \xa72B1.1 (Theft, Property Destruction, and Fraud) that greatly exceeds the defendant\u2019s personal gain from a fraud offense or who had limited knowledge of the scope of the scheme may receive an adjustment under this guideline. For example, a defendant in a health care fraud scheme, whose participation in the scheme was limited to serving as a nominee owner and who received little personal gain relative to the loss amount, may receive an adjustment under this guideline.</p><p>(B) <strong>Conviction of Significantly Less Serious Offense.\u2014</strong>If a defendant has received a lower offense level by virtue of being convicted of an offense significantly less serious than warranted by his actual criminal conduct, a reduction for a mitigating role under this section ordinarily is not warranted because such defendant is not substantially less culpable than a defendant whose only conduct involved the less serious offense. For example, if a defendant whose actual conduct involved a minimal role in the distribution of 25 grams of cocaine (an offense having a Chapter Two offense level of level 12 under \xa72D1.1 (Unlawful Manufacturing, Importing, Exporting, or Trafficking (Including Possession with Intent to Commit These Offenses); Attempt or Conspiracy)) is convicted of simple possession of cocaine (an offense having a Chapter Two offense level of level 6 under \xa72D2.1 (Unlawful Possession; Attempt or Conspiracy)), no reduction for a mitigating role is warranted because the defendant is not substantially less culpable than a defendant whose only conduct involved the simple possession of cocaine.</p><p>(C) <strong>Fact-Based Determination.\u2014</strong>The determination whether to apply subsection (a) or subsection (b), or an intermediate adjustment, is based on the totality of the circumstances and involves a determination that is heavily dependent upon the facts of the particular case.</p><p>In determining whether to apply subsection (a) or (b), or an intermediate adjustment, the court should consider the following non-exhaustive list of factors:</p><p>(i) the degree to which the defendant understood the scope and structure of the criminal activity;</p><p>(ii) the degree to which the defendant participated in planning or organizing the criminal activity;</p><p>(iii) the degree to which the defendant exercised decision-making authority or influenced the exercise of decision-making authority;</p><p>(iv) the nature and extent of the defendant\u2019s participation in the commission of the criminal activity, including the acts the defendant performed and the responsibility and discretion the defendant had in performing those acts;</p><p>(v) the degree to which the defendant stood to benefit from the criminal activity.</p><p>For example, a defendant who does not have a proprietary interest in the criminal activity and who is simply being paid to perform certain tasks should be considered for an adjustment under this guideline.</p><p>The fact that a defendant performs an essential or indispensable role in the criminal activity is not determinative. Such a defendant may receive an adjustment under this guideline if he or she is substantially less culpable than the average participant in the criminal activity.</p></blockquote><p>4. <strong>Minimal Participant.\u2014</strong>Subsection (a) applies to a defendant described in Application Note 3(A) who plays a minimal role in the criminal activity. It is intended to cover defendants who are plainly among the least culpable of those involved in the conduct of a group. Under this provision, the defendant\u2019s lack of knowledge or understanding of the scope and structure of the enterprise and of the activities of others is indicative of a role as minimal participant.</p><p>5. <strong>Minor Participant.\u2014</strong>Subsection (b) applies to a defendant described in Application Note 3(A) who is less culpable than most other participants in the criminal activity, but whose role could not be described as minimal.</p><p>6. <strong>Application of Role Adjustment in Certain Drug Cases.\u2014</strong>In a case in which the court applied \xa72D1.1 and the defendant\u2019s base offense level under that guideline was reduced by operation of the maximum base offense level in \xa72D1.1(a)(5), the court also shall apply the appropriate adjustment under this guideline.</p><table><tbody><tr class='odd'><td><em>Historical Note</em></td><td>Effective November 1, 1987.

Persons holding such positions ordinarily are subject to significantly less supervision than employees whose responsibilities are primarily non-discretionary in nature. For this adjustment to apply, the position of public or private trust must have contributed in some significant way to facilitating the commission or concealment of the offense (<em>e.g.</em>, by making the detection of the offense or the defendant\u2019s responsibility for the offense more difficult). This adjustment, for example, applies in the case of an embezzlement of a client\u2019s funds by an attorney serving as a guardian, a bank executive\u2019s fraudulent loan scheme, or the criminal sexual abuse of a patient by a physician under the guise of an examination. This adjustment does not apply in the case of an embezzlement or theft by an ordinary bank teller or hotel clerk because such positions are not characterized by the above-described factors.</p><p>2. <strong>Application of Adjustment in Certain Circumstances.\u2014</strong>Notwithstanding Application Note 1, or any other provision of this guideline, an adjustment under this guideline shall apply to the following:</p><blockquote><p>(A) An employee of the United States Postal Service who engages in the theft or destruction of undelivered United States mail.</p><p>(B) A defendant who exceeds or abuses the authority of his or her position in order to obtain, transfer, or issue unlawfully, or use without authority, any means of identification. \u201c<em><strong>Means of identification</strong></em>\u201d has the meaning given that term in 18 U.S.C. \xa7\xa01028(d)(7). The following are examples to which this subdivision would apply: (i)\xa0an employee of a state motor vehicle department who exceeds or abuses the authority of his or her position by knowingly issuing a driver\u2019s license based on false, incomplete, or misleading information; (ii) a hospital orderly who exceeds or abuses the authority of his or her position by obtaining or misusing patient identification information from a patient chart; and (iii) a volunteer at a charitable organization who exceeds or abuses the authority of his or her position by obtaining or misusing identification information from a donor\u2019s file.</p></blockquote><p>3. This adjustment also applies in a case in which the defendant provides sufficient indicia to the victim that the defendant legitimately holds a position of private or public trust when, in fact, the defendant does not. For example, the adjustment applies in the case of a defendant who (A) perpetrates a financial fraud by leading an investor to believe the defendant is a legitimate investment broker; or (B) perpetrates a fraud by representing falsely to a patient or employer that the defendant is a licensed physician. In making the misrepresentation, the defendant assumes a position of trust, relative to the victim, that provides the defendant with the same opportunity to commit a difficult-to-detect crime that the defendant would have had if the position were held legitimately.</p><p>4. \u201c<em><strong>Special skill</strong></em>\u201d refers to a skill not possessed by members of the general public and usually requiring substantial education, training or licensing. Examples would include pilots, lawyers, doctors, accountants, chemists, and demolition experts.</p><p>5. The following additional illustrations of an abuse of a position of trust pertain to theft or embezzlement from employee pension or welfare benefit plans or labor unions:</p><blockquote><p>(A) If the offense involved theft or embezzlement from an employee pension or welfare benefit plan and the defendant was a fiduciary of the benefit plan, an adjustment under this section for abuse of a position of trust will apply. \u201c<em><strong>Fiduciary of the benefit plan</strong></em>\u201d is defined in 29 U.S.C. \xa7\xa01002(21)(A) to mean a person who exercises any discretionary authority or control in respect to the management of such plan or exercises authority or control in respect to management or disposition of its assets, or who renders investment advice for a fee or other direct or indirect compensation with respect to any moneys or other property of such plan, or has any authority or responsibility to do so, or who has any discretionary authority or responsibility in the administration of such plan.</p><p>(B) If the offense involved theft or embezzlement from a labor union and the defendant was a union officer or occupied a position of trust in the union (as set forth in 29\xa0U.S.C. \xa7\xa0501(a)), an adjustment under this section for an abuse of a position of trust will apply.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Background:</strong> This adjustment applies to persons who abuse their positions of trust or their special skills to facilitate significantly the commission or concealment of a crime. The adjustment also applies to persons who provide sufficient indicia to the victim that they legitimately hold a position of public or private trust when, in fact, they do not.

Subsection (b)(1) applies if a statute (A) specifies a term of imprisonment to be imposed; and (B) requires that such term of imprisonment be imposed to run consecutively to any other term of imprisonment. <em>See, e.g.</em>, 18 U.S.C. \xa7\xa0924(c) (requiring mandatory minimum terms of imprisonment, based on the conduct involved, to run consecutively). The multiple count rules set out under this Part do not apply to a count of conviction covered by subsection (b). However, a count covered by subsection (b)(1) may affect the offense level determination for other counts. For example, a defendant is convicted of one count of bank robbery (18 U.S.C. \xa7\xa02113), and one count of use of a firearm in the commission of a crime of violence (18 U.S.C. \xa7\xa0924(c)). The two counts are not grouped together pursuant to this guideline, and, to avoid unwarranted double counting, the offense level for the bank robbery count under \xa72B3.1 (Robbery) is computed without application of the enhancement for weapon possession or use as otherwise required by subsection (b)(2) of that guideline. Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \xa7\xa0924(c), the mandatory minimum five-year sentence on the weapon-use count runs consecutively to the guideline sentence imposed on the bank robbery count. <em>See</em> \xa75G1.2(a).</p><blockquote><p>Unless specifically instructed, subsection (b)(1) does not apply when imposing a sentence under a statute that requires the imposition of a consecutive term of imprisonment only if a term of imprisonment is imposed (<em>i.e.</em>, the statute does not otherwise require a term of imprisonment to be imposed). <em>See, e.g.</em>, 18 U.S.C. \xa7\xa03146 (Penalty for failure to appear); 18 U.S.C. \xa7\xa0924(a)(4) (regarding penalty for 18 U.S.C. \xa7\xa0922(q) (possession or discharge of a firearm in a school zone)); 18 U.S.C. \xa7\xa01791(c) (penalty for providing or possessing a controlled substance in prison). Accordingly, the multiple count rules set out under this Part do apply to a count of conviction under this type of statute.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Background:</strong> This section outlines the procedure to be used for determining the combined offense level. After any adjustments from Chapter 3, Part E (Acceptance of Responsibility) and Chapter 4, Part B (Career Offenders and Criminal Livelihood) are made, this combined offense level is used to determine the guideline sentence range. Chapter Five (Determining the Sentence) discusses how to determine the sentence from the (combined) offense level; \xa75G1.2 deals specifically with determining the sentence of imprisonment when convictions on multiple counts are involved. References in Chapter Five (Determining the Sentence) to the \u201coffense level\u201d should be treated as referring to the combined offense level after all subsequent adjustments have been made.</p><table><tbody><tr class='odd'><td><em>Historical Note</em></td><td>Effective November 1, 1987.

Subsections (a)\u2013(d) set forth circumstances in which counts are to be grouped together into a single Group. Counts are to be grouped together into a single Group if any one or more of the subsections provide for such grouping. Counts for which the statute (A) specifies a term of imprisonment to be imposed; and (B) requires that such term of imprisonment be imposed to run consecutively to any other term of imprisonment are excepted from application of the multiple count rules. <em>See</em> \xa73D1.1(b)(1); <em>id.</em>, comment. (n.1).</p><p>2. The term \u201c<em><strong>victim</strong></em>\u201d is not intended to include indirect or secondary victims. Generally, there will be one person who is directly and most seriously affected by the offense and is therefore identifiable as the victim. For offenses in which there are no identifiable victims (<em>e.g.</em>, drug or immigration offenses, where society at large is the victim), the \u201cvictim\u201d for purposes of subsections (a) and (b) is the societal interest that is harmed. In such cases, the counts are grouped together when the societal interests that are harmed are closely related. Where one count, for example, involves unlawfully entering the United States and the other involves possession of fraudulent evidence of citizenship, the counts are grouped together because the societal interests harmed (the interests protected by laws governing immigration) are closely related. In contrast, where one count involves the sale of controlled substances and the other involves an immigration law violation, the counts are not grouped together because different societal interests are harmed. Ambiguities should be resolved in accordance with the purpose of this section as stated in the lead paragraph, <em>i.e.</em>, to identify and group \u201ccounts involving substantially the same harm.\u201d</p><p>3. Under subsection (a), counts are to be grouped together when they represent essentially a single injury or are part of a single criminal episode or transaction involving the same victim.</p><blockquote><p>When one count charges an attempt to commit an offense and the other charges the commission of that offense, or when one count charges an offense based on a general prohibition and the other charges violation of a specific prohibition encompassed in the general prohibition, the counts will be grouped together under subsection (a).</p><p><strong>Examples:</strong> (1) The defendant is convicted of forging and uttering the same check. The counts are to be grouped together. (2) The defendant is convicted of kidnapping and assaulting the victim during the course of the kidnapping. The counts are to be grouped together. (3) The defendant is convicted of bid rigging (an antitrust offense) and of mail fraud for signing and mailing a false statement that the bid was competitive. The counts are to be grouped together. (4) The defendant is convicted of two counts of assault on a federal officer for shooting at the same officer twice while attempting to prevent apprehension as part of a single criminal episode. The counts are to be grouped together. (5)\xa0The defendant is convicted of three counts of unlawfully bringing aliens into the United States, all counts arising out of a single incident. The three counts are to be grouped together. <em>But</em>: (6) The defendant is convicted of two counts of assault on a federal officer for shooting at the officer on two separate days. The counts <em>are not</em> to be grouped together.</p></blockquote><p>4. Subsection (b) provides that counts that are part of a single course of conduct with a single criminal objective and represent essentially one composite harm to the same victim are to be grouped together, even if they constitute legally distinct offenses occurring at different times. This provision does not authorize the grouping of offenses that cannot be considered to represent essentially one composite harm (<em>e.g.</em>, robbery of the same victim on different occasions involves multiple, separate instances of fear and risk of harm, not one composite harm).</p><blockquote><p>When one count charges a conspiracy or solicitation and the other charges a substantive offense that was the sole object of the conspiracy or solicitation, the counts will be grouped together under subsection (b).</p><p><strong>Examples:</strong> (1) The defendant is convicted of one count of conspiracy to commit extortion and one count of extortion for the offense he conspired to commit. The counts are to be grouped together. (2) The defendant is convicted of two counts of mail fraud and one count of wire fraud, each in furtherance of a single fraudulent scheme. The counts are to be grouped together, even if the mailings and telephone call occurred on different days. (3)\xa0The defendant is convicted of one count of auto theft and one count of altering the vehicle identification number of the car he stole. The counts are to be grouped together. (4) The defendant is convicted of two counts of distributing a controlled substance, each count involving a separate sale of 10 grams of cocaine that is part of a common scheme or plan. In addition, a finding is made that there are two other sales, also part of the common scheme or plan, each involving 10 grams of cocaine. The total amount of all four sales (40 grams of cocaine) will be used to determine the offense level for each count under \xa71B1.3(a)(2). The two counts will then be grouped together under either this subsection or subsection (d) to avoid double counting. <em>But</em>: (5) The defendant is convicted of two counts of rape for raping the same person on different days. The counts <em>are not</em> to be grouped together.</p></blockquote><p>5. Subsection (c) provides that when conduct that represents a separate count, <em>e.g.</em>, bodily injury or obstruction of justice, is also a specific offense characteristic in or other adjustment to another count, the count represented by that conduct is to be grouped with the count to which it constitutes an aggravating factor. This provision prevents \u201cdouble counting\u201d of offense behavior. Of course, this rule applies only if the offenses are closely related. It is not, for example, the intent of this rule that (assuming they could be joined together) a bank robbery on one occasion and an assault resulting in bodily injury on another occasion be grouped together. The bodily injury (the harm from the assault) would not be a specific offense characteristic to the robbery and would represent a different harm. On the other hand, use of a firearm in a bank robbery and unlawful possession of that firearm are sufficiently related to warrant grouping of counts under this subsection. Frequently, this provision will overlap subsection (a), at least with respect to specific offense characteristics. However, a count such as obstruction of justice, which represents a Chapter Three adjustment and involves a different harm or societal interest than the underlying offense, is covered by subsection (c) even though it is not covered by subsection\xa0(a).</p><blockquote><p>Sometimes there may be several counts, each of which could be treated as an aggravating factor to another more serious count, but the guideline for the more serious count provides an adjustment for only one occurrence of that factor. In such cases, only the count representing the most serious of those factors is to be grouped with the other count. For example, if in a robbery of a credit union on a military base the defendant is also convicted of assaulting two employees, one of whom is injured seriously, the assault with serious bodily injury would be grouped with the robbery count, while the remaining assault conviction would be treated separately.</p><p>A cross reference to another offense guideline does not constitute \u201ca specific offense characteristic\xa0.\xa0.\xa0. or other adjustment\u201d within the meaning of subsection (c). For example, the guideline for bribery of a public official contains a cross reference to the guideline for a conspiracy to commit the offense that the bribe was to facilitate. Nonetheless, if the defendant were convicted of one count of securities fraud and one count of bribing a public official to facilitate the fraud, the two counts would not be grouped together by virtue of the cross reference. If, however, the bribe was given for the purpose of hampering a criminal investigation into the offense, it would constitute obstruction and under \xa73C1.1 would result in a 2-level enhancement to the offense level for the fraud. Under the latter circumstances, the counts would be grouped together.</p></blockquote><p>6. Subsection (d) likely will be used with the greatest frequency. It provides that most property crimes (except robbery, burglary, extortion and the like), drug offenses, firearms offenses, and other crimes where the guidelines are based primarily on quantity or contemplate continuing behavior are to be grouped together. The list of instances in which this subsection should be applied is not exhaustive. Note, however, that certain guidelines are specifically excluded from the operation of subsection (d).</p><blockquote><p>A conspiracy, attempt, or solicitation to commit an offense is covered under subsection (d) if the offense that is the object of the conspiracy, attempt, or solicitation is covered under subsection (d).</p><p>Counts involving offenses to which different offense guidelines apply are grouped together under subsection (d) if the offenses are of the same general type and otherwise meet the criteria for grouping under this subsection. In such cases, the offense guideline that results in the highest offense level is used; <em>see</em> \xa73D1.3(b). The \u201csame general type\u201d of offense is to be construed broadly.</p><p><strong>Examples:</strong> (1) The defendant is convicted of five counts of embezzling money from a bank. The five counts are to be grouped together. (2) The defendant is convicted of two counts of theft of social security checks and three counts of theft from the mail, each from a different victim. All five counts are to be grouped together. (3) The defendant is convicted of five counts of mail fraud and ten counts of wire fraud. Although the counts arise from various schemes, each involves a monetary objective. All fifteen counts are to be grouped together. (4) The defendant is convicted of three counts of unlicensed dealing in firearms. All three counts are to be grouped together. (5) The defendant is convicted of one count of selling heroin, one count of selling PCP, and one count of selling cocaine. The counts are to be grouped together. The Commentary to \xa72D1.1 provides rules for combining (adding) quantities of different drugs to determine a single combined offense level. (6) The defendant is convicted of three counts of tax evasion. The counts are to be grouped together. (7) The defendant is convicted of three counts of discharging toxic substances from a single facility. The counts are to be grouped together. (8) The defendant is convicted on two counts of check forgery and one count of uttering the first of the forged checks. All three counts are to be grouped together. Note, however, that the uttering count is first grouped with the first forgery count under subsection (a) of this guideline, so that the monetary amount of that check counts only once when the rule in \xa73D1.3(b) is applied. <em>But</em>: (9) The defendant is convicted of three counts of bank robbery. The counts <em>are not</em> to be grouped together, nor are the amounts of money involved to be added.</p></blockquote><p>7. A single case may result in application of several of the rules in this section. Thus, for example, example (8) in the discussion of subsection (d) involves an application of \xa73D1.2(a) followed by an application of \xa73D1.2(d). Note also that a Group may consist of a single count; conversely, all counts may form a single Group.</p><p>8. A defendant may be convicted of conspiring to commit several substantive offenses and also of committing one or more of the substantive offenses. In such cases, treat the conspiracy count as if it were several counts, each charging conspiracy to commit one of the substantive offenses. <em>See</em> \xa71B1.2(d) and accompanying commentary. Then apply the ordinary grouping rules to determine the combined offense level based upon the substantive counts of which the defendant is convicted and the various acts cited by the conspiracy count that would constitute behavior of a substantive nature. <strong>Example:</strong> The defendant is convicted of two counts: conspiring to commit offenses A, B, and C, and committing offense A. Treat this as if the defendant was convicted of (1) committing offense A; (2)\xa0conspiracy to commit offense A; (3) conspiracy to commit offense B; and (4) conspiracy to commit offense C. Count (1) and count (2) are grouped together under \xa73D1.2(b). Group the remaining counts, including the various acts cited by the conspiracy count that would constitute behavior of a substantive nature, according to the rules in this section.</p><p><strong>Background:</strong> Ordinarily, the first step in determining the combined offense level in a case involving multiple counts is to identify those counts that are sufficiently related to be placed in the same Group of Closely Related Counts (\u201cGroup\u201d). This section specifies four situations in which counts are to be grouped together. Although it appears last for conceptual reasons, subsection (d) probably will be used most frequently.</p><p>A primary consideration in this section is whether the offenses involve different victims. For example, a defendant may stab three prison guards in a single escape attempt. Some would argue that all counts arising out of a single transaction or occurrence should be grouped together even when there are distinct victims. Although such a proposal was considered, it was rejected because it probably would require departure in many cases in order to capture adequately the criminal behavior. Cases involving injury to distinct victims are sufficiently comparable, whether or not the injuries are inflicted in distinct transactions, so that each such count should be treated separately rather than grouped together. Counts involving different victims (or societal harms in the case of \u201cvictimless\u201d crimes) are grouped together only as provided in subsection (c) or (d).</p><p>Even if counts involve a single victim, the decision as to whether to group them together may not always be clear cut. For example, how contemporaneous must two assaults on the same victim be in order to warrant grouping together as constituting a single transaction or occurrence? Existing case law may provide some guidance as to what constitutes distinct offenses, but such decisions often turn on the technical language of the statute and cannot be controlling. In interpreting this Part and resolving ambiguities, the court should look to the underlying policy of this Part as stated in the Introductory Commentary.</p><table><tbody><tr class='odd'><td><em>Historical Note</em></td><td>Effective November 1, 1987.

Ordinarily, it is necessary to determine the offense level for each of the counts in a Group in order to ensure that the highest is correctly identified. Sometimes, it will be clear that one count in the Group cannot have a higher offense level than another, as with a count for an attempt or conspiracy to commit the completed offense. The formal determination of the offense level for such a count may be unnecessary.</p><p>3. When counts are grouped pursuant to \xa73D1.2(d), the offense guideline applicable to the aggregate behavior is used. If the counts in the Group are covered by different guidelines, use the guideline that produces the highest offense level. Determine whether the specific offense characteristics or adjustments from Chapter Three, Parts A, B, and C apply based upon the combined offense behavior taken as a whole. Note that guidelines for similar property offenses have been coordinated to produce identical offense levels, at least when substantial property losses are involved. However, when small sums are involved the differing specific offense characteristics that require increasing the offense level to a certain minimum may affect the outcome.</p><p>4. Sometimes the rule specified in this section may not result in incremental punishment for additional criminal acts because of the grouping rules. For example, if the defendant commits forcible criminal sexual abuse (rape), aggravated assault, and robbery, all against the same victim on a single occasion, all of the counts are grouped together under \xa73D1.2. The aggravated assault will increase the guideline range for the rape. The robbery, however, will not. This is because the offense guideline for rape (\xa72A3.1) includes the most common aggravating factors, including injury, that data showed to be significant in actual practice. The additional factor of property loss ordinarily can be taken into account adequately within the guideline range for rape, which is fairly wide. However, an exceptionally large property loss in the course of the rape would provide grounds for an upward departure. <em>See</em> \xa75K2.5 (Property Damage or Loss).</p><p><strong>Background:</strong> This section provides rules for determining the offense level associated with each Group of Closely Related Counts.

Application of the rules in \xa7\xa73D1.2 and 3D1.3 may produce a single Group of Closely Related Counts. In such cases, the combined offense level is the level corresponding to the Group determined in accordance with \xa73D1.3.</p><p>2. The procedure for calculating the combined offense level when there is more than one Group of Closely Related Counts is as follows: First, identify the offense level applicable to the most serious Group; assign it one Unit. Next, determine the number of Units that the remaining Groups represent. Finally, increase the offense level for the most serious Group by the number of levels indicated in the table corresponding to the total number of Units.</p><p><strong>Background:</strong> When Groups are of roughly comparable seriousness, each Group will represent one Unit. When the most serious Group carries an offense level substantially higher than that applicable to the other Groups, however, counting the lesser Groups fully for purposes of the table could add excessive punishment, possibly even more than those offenses would carry if prosecuted separately. To avoid this anomalous result and produce declining marginal punishment, Groups 9 or more levels less serious than the most serious Group should not be counted for purposes of the table, and that Groups 5 to 8 levels less serious should be treated as equal to one-half of a Group. Thus, if the most serious Group is at offense level 15 and if two other Groups are at level 10, there would be a total of two Units for purposes of the table (one plus one-half plus one-half) and the combined offense level would be 17. Inasmuch as the maximum increase provided in the guideline is 5 levels, departure would be warranted in the unusual case where the additional offenses resulted in a total of significantly more than 5 Units.</p><p>In unusual circumstances, the approach adopted in this section could produce adjustments for the additional counts that are inadequate or excessive. If there are several groups and the most serious offense is considerably more serious than all of the others, there will be no increase in the offense level resulting from the additional counts. Ordinarily, the court will have latitude to impose added punishment by sentencing toward the upper end of the range authorized for the most serious offense. Situations in which there will be inadequate scope for ensuring appropriate additional punishment for the additional crimes are likely to be unusual and can be handled by departure from the guidelines. Conversely, it is possible that if there are several minor offenses that are not grouped together, application of the rules in this Part could result in an excessive increase in the sentence range. Again, such situations should be infrequent and can be handled through departure. An alternative method for ensuring more precise adjustments would have been to determine the appropriate offense level adjustment through a more complicated mathematical formula; that approach was not adopted because of its complexity.</p><table><tbody><tr class='odd'><td><em>Historical Note</em></td><td>Effective November 1, 1987.

The examples are discussed summarily; a more thorough, step-by-step approach is recommended until the user is thoroughly familiar with the guidelines.</p><p>1. Defendant A was convicted of four counts, each charging robbery of a different bank. Each would represent a distinct Group. \xa73D1.2. In each of the first three robberies, the offense level was 22 (20 plus a 2-level increase because a financial institution was robbed) (\xa72B3.1(b)). In the fourth robbery $21,000 was taken and a firearm was displayed; the offense level was therefore 28. As the first three counts are 6 levels lower than the fourth, each of the first three represents one-half unit for purposes of \xa73D1.4. Altogether there are 2\xa01/2 Units, and the offense level for the most serious (28) is therefore increased by 3\xa0levels under the table. The combined offense level is 31.</p><p>2. Defendant\xa0B was convicted of four counts: (1)\xa0distribution of 230 grams of cocaine; (2)\xa0distribution of 150 grams of cocaine; (3)\xa0distribution of 75 grams of heroin; (4)\xa0offering a DEA agent $20,000 to avoid prosecution. The combined offense level for drug offenses is determined by the total quantity of drugs, converted to marihuana equivalents (using the Drug Equivalency Tables in the Commentary to \xa72D1.1 (Unlawful Manufacturing, Importing, Exporting, or Trafficking)). The first count translates into 46 kilograms of marihuana; the second count translates into 30 kilograms of marihuana; and the third count translates into 75 kilograms of marihuana. The total is 151 kilograms of marihuana. Under \xa72D1.1, the combined offense level for the drug offenses is 24. In addition, because of the attempted bribe of the DEA agent, this offense level is increased by 2 levels to 26 under \xa73C1.1 (Obstructing or Impeding the Administration of Justice). Because the conduct constituting the bribery offense is accounted for by \xa73C1.1, it becomes part of the same Group as the drug offenses pursuant to \xa73D1.2(c). The combined offense level is 26 pursuant to \xa73D1.3(a), because the offense level for bribery (20) is less than the offense level for the drug offenses (26).</p><p>3. Defendant\xa0C was convicted of four counts arising out of a scheme pursuant to which the defendant received kickbacks from subcontractors. The counts were as follows: (1) The defendant received $1,000 from subcontractor A relating to contract X (Mail Fraud). (2)\xa0The defendant received $1,000 from subcontractor A relating to contract X (Commercial Bribery). (3)\xa0The defendant received $1,000 from subcontractor A relating to contract\xa0Y (Mail Fraud). (4)\xa0The defendant received $1,000 from subcontractor B relating to contract Z (Commercial Bribery). The mail fraud counts are covered by \xa72B1.1 (Theft, Property Destruction, and Fraud). The bribery counts are covered by \xa72B4.1 (Bribery in Procurement of Bank Loan and Other Commercial Bribery), which treats the offense as a sophisticated fraud. The total money involved is $4,000, which results in an offense level of 9 under either \xa72B1.1 (assuming the application of the \u201csophisticated means\u201d enhancement in \xa72B1.1(b)(10)) or \xa72B4.1. Since these two guidelines produce identical offense levels, the combined offense level is 9.</p><table><tbody><tr class='odd'><td><em>Historical Note</em></td><td>Effective November 1, 1987.

Note that a defendant is not required to volunteer, or affirmatively admit, relevant conduct beyond the offense of conviction in order to obtain a reduction under subsection (a). A defendant may remain silent in respect to relevant conduct beyond the offense of conviction without affecting his ability to obtain a reduction under this subsection. However, a defendant who falsely denies, or frivolously contests, relevant conduct that the court determines to be true has acted in a manner inconsistent with acceptance of responsibility;</p><p>(B) voluntary termination or withdrawal from criminal conduct or associations;</p><p>(C) voluntary payment of restitution prior to adjudication of guilt;</p><p>(D) voluntary surrender to authorities promptly after commission of the offense;</p><p>(E) voluntary assistance to authorities in the recovery of the fruits and instrumentalities of the offense;</p><p>(F) voluntary resignation from the office or position held during the commission of the offense;</p><p>(G) post-offense rehabilitative efforts (<em>e.g.</em>, counseling or drug treatment); and</p><p>(H) the timeliness of the defendant\u2019s conduct in manifesting the acceptance of responsibility.</p></blockquote><p>2. This adjustment is not intended to apply to a defendant who puts the government to its burden of proof at trial by denying the essential factual elements of guilt, is convicted, and only then admits guilt and expresses remorse. Conviction by trial, however, does not automatically preclude a defendant from consideration for such a reduction. In rare situations a defendant may clearly demonstrate an acceptance of responsibility for his criminal conduct even though he exercises his constitutional right to a trial. This may occur, for example, where a defendant goes to trial to assert and preserve issues that do not relate to factual guilt (<em>e.g.</em>, to make a constitutional challenge to a statute or a challenge to the applicability of a statute to his conduct). In each such instance, however, a determination that a defendant has accepted responsibility will be based primarily upon pre-trial statements and conduct.</p><p>3. Entry of a plea of guilty prior to the commencement of trial combined with truthfully admitting the conduct comprising the offense of conviction, and truthfully admitting or not falsely denying any additional relevant conduct for which he is accountable under \xa71B1.3 (Relevant Conduct) (<em>see</em> Application Note 1(A)), will constitute significant evidence of acceptance of responsibility for the purposes of subsection (a). However, this evidence may be outweighed by conduct of the defendant that is inconsistent with such acceptance of responsibility. A defendant who enters a guilty plea is not entitled to an adjustment under this section as a matter of right.</p><p>4. Conduct resulting in an enhancement under \xa73C1.1 (Obstructing or Impeding the Administration of Justice) ordinarily indicates that the defendant has not accepted responsibility for his criminal conduct. There may, however, be extraordinary cases in which adjustments under both \xa7\xa73C1.1 and 3E1.1 may apply.</p><p>5. The sentencing judge is in a unique position to evaluate a defendant\u2019s acceptance of responsibility. For this reason, the determination of the sentencing judge is entitled to great deference on review.</p><p>6. Subsection (a) provides a 2-level decrease in offense level. Subsection (b) provides an additional 1-level decrease in offense level for a defendant at offense level 16 or greater prior to the operation of subsection (a) who both qualifies for a decrease under subsection (a) and who has assisted authorities in the investigation or prosecution of his own misconduct by taking the steps set forth in subsection (b). The timeliness of the defendant\u2019s acceptance of responsibility is a consideration under both subsections, and is context specific. In general, the conduct qualifying for a decrease in offense level under subsection (b) will occur particularly early in the case. For example, to qualify under subsection (b), the defendant must have notified authorities of his intention to enter a plea of guilty at a sufficiently early point in the process so that the government may avoid preparing for trial and the court may schedule its calendar efficiently.</p><blockquote><p>Because the Government is in the best position to determine whether the defendant has assisted authorities in a manner that avoids preparing for trial, an adjustment under subsection (b) may only be granted upon a formal motion by the Government at the time of sentencing. <em>See</em> section 401(g)(2)(B) of Public Law 108\u201321. The government should not withhold such a motion based on interests not identified in \xa73E1.1, such as whether the defendant agrees to waive his or her right to appeal.</p><p>If the government files such a motion, and the court in deciding whether to grant the motion also determines that the defendant has assisted authorities in the investigation or prosecution of his own misconduct by timely notifying authorities of his intention to enter a plea of guilty, thereby permitting the government to avoid preparing for trial and permitting the government and the court to allocate their resources efficiently, the court should grant the motion.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Background:</strong> The reduction of offense level provided by this section recognizes legitimate societal interests. For several reasons, a defendant who clearly demonstrates acceptance of responsibility for his offense by taking, in a timely fashion, the actions listed above (or some equivalent action) is appropriately given a lower offense level than a defendant who has not demonstrated acceptance of responsibility.</p><p>Subsection (a) provides a 2-level decrease in offense level. Subsection (b) provides an additional 1-level decrease for a defendant at offense level 16 or greater prior to operation of subsection (a) who both qualifies for a decrease under subsection (a) and has assisted authorities in the investigation or prosecution of his own misconduct by taking the steps specified in subsection (b). Such a defendant has accepted responsibility in a way that ensures the certainty of his just punishment in a timely manner, thereby appropriately meriting an additional reduction. Subsection (b) does not apply, however, to a defendant whose offense level is level 15 or lower prior to application of subsection (a). At offense level 15 or lower, the reduction in the guideline range provided by a 2-level decrease in offense level under subsection (a) (which is a greater proportional reduction in the guideline range than at higher offense levels due to the structure of the Sentencing Table) is adequate for the court to take into account the factors set forth in subsection (b) within the applicable guideline range.</p><p>Section 401(g) of Public Law 108\u201321 directly amended subsection (b), Application Note 6 (including adding the first sentence of the second paragraph of that application note), and the Background Commentary, effective April 30, 2003.</p><table><tbody><tr class='odd'><td><em>Historical Note</em></td><td>Effective November 1, 1987.

A total of up to 3 points may be added under \xa74A1.1(e). For purposes of this guideline, \u201c<em><strong>crime of violence</strong></em>\u201d has the meaning given that term in \xa74B1.2(a). <em>See</em> \xa74A1.2(p).</p><blockquote><p>For example, a defendant\u2019s criminal history includes two robbery convictions for offenses committed on different occasions. The sentences for these offenses were imposed on the same day and are treated as a single prior sentence. <em>See</em> \xa74A1.2(a)(2). If the defendant received a five-year sentence of imprisonment for one robbery and a four-year sentence of imprisonment for the other robbery (consecutively or concurrently), a total of 3 points is added under \xa74A1.1(a). An additional point is added under \xa74A1.1(e) because the second sentence did not result in any additional point(s) (under \xa74A1.1(a), (b), or (c)). In contrast, if the defendant received a one-year sentence of imprisonment for one robbery and a nine-month consecutive sentence of imprisonment for the other robbery, a total of 3 points also is added under \xa74A1.1(a) (a one-year sentence of imprisonment and a consecutive nine-month sentence of imprisonment are treated as a combined one-year-nine-month sentence of imprisonment). But no additional point is added under \xa74A1.1(e) because the sentence for the second robbery already resulted in an additional point under \xa74A1.1(a). Without the second sentence, the defendant would only have received two points under \xa74A1.1(b) for the one-year sentence of imprisonment.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Background:</strong> Prior convictions may represent convictions in the federal system, fifty state systems, the District of Columbia, territories, and foreign, tribal, and military courts. There are jurisdictional variations in offense definitions, sentencing structures, and manner of sentence pronouncement. To minimize problems with imperfect measures of past crime seriousness, criminal history categories are based on the maximum term imposed in previous sentences rather than on other measures, such as whether the conviction was designated a felony or misdemeanor. In recognition of the imperfection of this measure however, \xa74A1.3 authorizes the court to depart from the otherwise applicable criminal history category in certain circumstances.</p><p>Subsections (a), (b), and (c) of \xa74A1.1 distinguish confinement sentences longer than one year and one month, shorter confinement sentences of at least sixty days, and all other sentences, such as confinement sentences of less than sixty days, probation, fines, and residency in a halfway house.</p><p>Section 4A1.1(d) adds two points if the defendant was under a criminal justice sentence during any part of the instant offense.</p><table><tbody><tr class='odd'><td><em>Historical Note</em></td><td>Effective November 1, 1987.

A sentence imposed after the defendant\u2019s commencement of the instant offense, but prior to sentencing on the instant offense, is a prior sentence if it was for conduct other than conduct that was part of the instant offense. Conduct that is part of the instant offense means conduct that is relevant conduct to the instant offense under the provisions of \xa71B1.3 (Relevant Conduct).</p><blockquote><p>Under \xa74A1.2(a)(4), a conviction for which the defendant has not yet been sentenced is treated as if it were a prior sentence under \xa74A1.1(c) if a sentence resulting from such conviction otherwise would have been counted. In the case of an offense set forth in \xa74A1.2(c)(1) (which lists certain misdemeanor and petty offenses), a conviction for which the defendant has not yet been sentenced is treated as if it were a prior sentence under \xa74A1.2(a)(4) only where the offense is similar to the instant offense (because sentences for other offenses set forth in \xa74A1.2(c)(1) are counted only if they are of a specified type and length).</p></blockquote><p>2. <strong>Sentence of Imprisonment.\u2014</strong>To qualify as a sentence of imprisonment, the defendant must have actually served a period of imprisonment on such sentence (or, if the defendant escaped, would have served time). <em>See</em> \xa74A1.2(a)(3) and (b)(2). For the purposes of applying \xa74A1.1(a), (b), or (c), the length of a sentence of imprisonment is the stated maximum (<em>e.g.</em>, in the case of a determinate sentence of five years, the stated maximum is five years; in the case of an indeterminate sentence of one to five years, the stated maximum is five years; in the case of an indeterminate sentence for a term not to exceed five years, the stated maximum is five years; in the case of an indeterminate sentence for a term not to exceed the defendant\u2019s twenty-first birthday, the stated maximum is the amount of time in pre-trial detention plus the amount of time between the date of sentence and the defendant\u2019s twenty-first birthday). That is, criminal history points are based on the sentence pronounced, not the length of time actually served. <em>See</em> \xa74A1.2(b)(1) and (2). A sentence of probation is to be treated as a sentence under \xa74A1.1(c) unless a condition of probation requiring imprisonment of at least sixty days was imposed.</p><p>3. <strong>Application of \u201cSingle Sentence\u201d Rule (Subsection (a)(2)).\u2014</strong></p><blockquote><p>(A) <strong>Predicate Offenses.\u2014</strong>In some cases, multiple prior sentences are treated as a single sentence for purposes of calculating the criminal history score under \xa74A1.1(a), (b), and (c). However, for purposes of determining predicate offenses, a prior sentence included in the single sentence should be treated as if it received criminal history points, if it independently would have received criminal history points. Therefore, an individual prior sentence may serve as a predicate under the career offender guideline (<em>see</em> \xa74B1.2(c)) or other guidelines with predicate offenses, if it independently would have received criminal history points. However, because predicate offenses may be used only if they are counted \u201cseparately\u201d from each other (<em>see</em>\xa0\xa74B1.2(c)), no more than one prior sentence in a given single sentence may be used as a predicate offense.</p><p>For example, a defendant\u2019s criminal history includes one robbery conviction and one theft conviction. The sentences for these offenses were imposed on the same day, eight years ago, and are treated as a single sentence under \xa74A1.2(a)(2). If the defendant received a one-year sentence of imprisonment for the robbery and a two-year sentence of imprisonment for the theft, to be served concurrently, a total of 3\xa0points is added under \xa74A1.1(a). Because this particular robbery met the definition of a felony crime of violence and independently would have received 2 criminal history points under \xa74A1.1(b), it may serve as a predicate under the career offender guideline.</p><p>Note, however, that if the sentences in the example above were imposed thirteen years ago, the robbery independently would have received no criminal history points under \xa74A1.1(b), because it was not imposed within ten years of the defendant\u2019s commencement of the instant offense. <em>See</em> \xa74A1.2(e)(2). Accordingly, it may not serve as a predicate under the career offender guideline.</p><p>(B) <strong>Upward Departure Provision.\u2014</strong>Treating multiple prior sentences as a single sentence may result in a criminal history score that underrepresents the seriousness of the defendant\u2019s criminal history and the danger that the defendant presents to the public. In such a case, an upward departure may be warranted. For example, if a defendant was convicted of a number of serious non-violent offenses committed on different occasions, and the resulting sentences were treated as a single sentence because either the sentences resulted from offenses contained in the same charging instrument or the defendant was sentenced for these offenses on the same day, the assignment of a single set of points may not adequately reflect the seriousness of the defendant\u2019s criminal history or the frequency with which the defendant has committed crimes.</p></blockquote><p>4. <strong>Sentences Imposed in the Alternative.\u2014</strong>A sentence which specifies a fine or other non-incarcerative disposition as an alternative to a term of imprisonment (<em>e.g.</em>, $1,000 fine or ninety days\u2019 imprisonment) is treated as a non-imprisonment sentence.</p><p>5. <strong>Sentences for Driving While Intoxicated or Under the Influence.\u2014</strong>Convictions for driving while intoxicated or under the influence (and similar offenses by whatever name they are known) are always counted, without regard to how the offense is classified. Paragraphs (1) and (2) of \xa74A1.2(c) do not apply.</p><p>6. <strong>Reversed, Vacated, or Invalidated Convictions.\u2014</strong>Sentences resulting from convictions that (A) have been reversed or vacated because of errors of law or because of subsequently discovered evidence exonerating the defendant, or (B) have been ruled constitutionally invalid in a prior case are not to be counted. With respect to the current sentencing proceeding, this guideline and commentary do not confer upon the defendant any right to attack collaterally a prior conviction or sentence beyond any such rights otherwise recognized in law (<em>e.g.</em>, 21 U.S.C. \xa7\xa0851 expressly provides that a defendant may collaterally attack certain prior convictions).</p><blockquote><p>Nonetheless, the criminal conduct underlying any conviction that is not counted in the criminal history score may be considered pursuant to \xa74A1.3 (Adequacy of Criminal History Category).</p></blockquote><p>7. <strong>Offenses Committed Prior to Age Eighteen.\u2014</strong>Section 4A1.2(d) covers offenses committed prior to age eighteen. Attempting to count every juvenile adjudication would have the potential for creating large disparities due to the differential availability of records. Therefore, for offenses committed prior to age eighteen, only those that resulted in adult sentences of imprisonment exceeding one year and one month, or resulted in imposition of an adult or juvenile sentence or release from confinement on that sentence within five years of the defendant\u2019s commencement of the instant offense are counted. To avoid disparities from jurisdiction to jurisdiction in the age at which a defendant is considered a \u201cjuvenile,\u201d this provision applies to all offenses committed prior to age eighteen.</p><p>8. <strong>Applicable Time Period.\u2014</strong>Section 4A1.2(d)(2) and (e) establishes the time period within which prior sentences are counted. As used in \xa74A1.2(d)(2) and (e), the term \u201c<em><strong>commencement of the instant offense</strong></em>\u201d includes any relevant conduct. <em>See</em> \xa71B1.3 (Relevant Conduct). If the court finds that a sentence imposed outside this time period is evidence of similar, or serious dissimilar, criminal conduct, the court may consider this information in determining whether an upward departure is warranted under \xa74A1.3 (Adequacy of Criminal History Category).</p><p>9. <strong>Diversionary Dispositions.\u2014</strong>Section 4A1.2(f) requires counting prior adult diversionary dispositions if they involved a judicial determination of guilt or an admission of guilt in open court. This reflects a policy that defendants who receive the benefit of a rehabilitative sentence and continue to commit crimes should not be treated with further leniency.</p><p>10. <strong>Convictions Set Aside or Defendant Pardoned.\u2014</strong>A number of jurisdictions have various procedures pursuant to which previous convictions may be set aside or the defendant may be pardoned for reasons unrelated to innocence or errors of law, <em>e.g.</em>, in order to restore civil rights or to remove the stigma associated with a criminal conviction. Sentences resulting from such convictions are to be counted. However, expunged convictions are not counted. \xa74A1.2(j).</p><p>11. <strong>Revocations to be Considered.\u2014</strong>Section 4A1.2(k) covers revocations of probation and other conditional sentences where the original term of imprisonment imposed, if any, did not exceed one year and one month. Rather than count the original sentence and the resentence after revocation as separate sentences, the sentence given upon revocation should be added to the original sentence of imprisonment, if any, and the total should be counted as if it were one sentence. By this approach, no more than three points will be assessed for a single conviction, even if probation or conditional release was subsequently revoked. If the sentence originally imposed, the sentence imposed upon revocation, or the total of both sentences exceeded one year and one month, the maximum three points would be assigned. If, however, at the time of revocation another sentence was imposed for a new criminal conviction, that conviction would be computed separately from the sentence imposed for the revocation.</p><blockquote><p>Where a revocation applies to multiple sentences, and such sentences are counted separately under \xa74A1.2(a)(2), add the term of imprisonment imposed upon revocation to the sentence that will result in the greatest increase in criminal history points. <strong>Example:</strong> A defendant was serving two probationary sentences, each counted separately under \xa74A1.2(a)(2); probation was revoked on both sentences as a result of the same violation conduct; and the defendant was sentenced to a total of 45 days of imprisonment. If one sentence had been a \u201cstraight\u201d probationary sentence and the other had been a probationary sentence that had required service of 15 days of imprisonment, the revocation term of imprisonment (45 days) would be added to the probationary sentence that had the 15-day term of imprisonment. This would result in a total of 2 criminal history points under \xa74A1.1(b) (for the combined 60-day term of imprisonment) and 1 criminal history point under \xa74A1.1(c) (for the other probationary sentence).</p></blockquote><p>12. <strong>Application of Subsection (c).\u2014</strong></p><blockquote><p>(A) <strong>In General.\u2014</strong>In determining whether an unlisted offense is similar to an offense listed in subsection (c)(1) or (c)(2), the court should use a common sense approach that includes consideration of relevant factors such as (i) a comparison of punishments imposed for the listed and unlisted offenses; (ii) the perceived seriousness of the offense as indicated by the level of punishment; (iii) the elements of the offense; (iv) the level of culpability involved; and (v) the degree to which the commission of the offense indicates a likelihood of recurring criminal conduct.</p><p>(B) <strong>Local Ordinance Violations.\u2014</strong>A number of local jurisdictions have enacted ordinances covering certain offenses (<em>e.g.</em>, larceny and assault misdemeanors) that are also violations of state criminal law. This enables a local court (<em>e.g.</em>, a municipal court) to exercise jurisdiction over such offenses. Such offenses are excluded from the definition of local ordinance violations in \xa74A1.2(c)(2) and, therefore, sentences for such offenses are to be treated as if the defendant had been convicted under state law.</p><p>(C) <strong>Insufficient Funds Check.\u2014</strong>\u201c<em><strong>Insufficient funds check</strong></em>,\u201d as used in \xa74A1.2(c)(1), does not include any conviction establishing that the defendant used a false name or non-existent account.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Background:</strong> Prior sentences, not otherwise excluded, are to be counted in the criminal history score, including uncounseled misdemeanor sentences where imprisonment was not imposed.</p><table><tbody><tr class='odd'><td><em>Historical Note</em></td><td>Effective November 1, 1987.

In determining whether an upward departure from Criminal History Category VI is warranted, the court should consider that the nature of the prior offenses rather than simply their number is often more indicative of the seriousness of the defendant\u2019s criminal record. For example, a defendant with five prior sentences for very large-scale fraud offenses may have 15 criminal history points, within the range of points typical for Criminal History Category VI, yet have a substantially more serious criminal history overall because of the nature of the prior offenses.</p></blockquote><p>3. <strong>Downward Departures.\u2014</strong>A downward departure from the defendant\u2019s criminal history category may be warranted if, for example, the defendant had two minor misdemeanor convictions close to ten years prior to the instant offense and no other evidence of prior criminal behavior in the intervening period. A departure below the lower limit of the applicable guideline range for Criminal History Category I is prohibited under subsection (b)(2)(B), due to the fact that the lower limit of the guideline range for Criminal History Category I is set for a first offender with the lowest risk of recidivism.</p><p><strong>Background:</strong> This policy statement recognizes that the criminal history score is unlikely to take into account all the variations in the seriousness of criminal history that may occur. For example, a defendant with an extensive record of serious, assaultive conduct who had received what might now be considered extremely lenient treatment in the past might have the same criminal history category as a defendant who had a record of less serious conduct. Yet, the first defendant\u2019s criminal history clearly may be more serious. This may be particularly true in the case of younger defendants (<em>e.g.</em>, defendants in their early twenties or younger) who are more likely to have received repeated lenient treatment, yet who may actually pose a greater risk of serious recidivism than older defendants. This policy statement authorizes the consideration of a departure from the guidelines in the limited circumstances where reliable information indicates that the criminal history category does not adequately reflect the seriousness of the defendant\u2019s criminal history or likelihood of recidivism, and provides guidance for the consideration of such departures.</p><table><tbody><tr class='odd'><td><em>Historical Note</em></td><td>Effective November 1, 1987.

Subsection (a) provides that a sentence conforms with the guidelines for imprisonment if it is within the minimum and maximum terms of the applicable guideline range specified in the Sentencing Table in Part A of this Chapter. For example, if the defendant has an Offense Level of 20 and a Criminal History Category of I, the applicable guideline range is 33\u201341 months of imprisonment. Therefore, a sentence of imprisonment of at least thirty-three months, but not more than forty-one months, is within the applicable guideline range.</p><p>2. Subsection (b) provides that where the applicable guideline range is in Zone A of the Sentencing Table (<em>i.e.</em>, the minimum term of imprisonment specified in the applicable guideline range is zero months), the court is not required to impose a sentence of imprisonment unless a sentence of imprisonment or its equivalent is specifically required by the guideline applicable to the offense. Where imprisonment is not required, the court, for example, may impose a sentence of probation. In some cases, a fine appropriately may be imposed as the sole sanction.</p><p>3. Subsection (c) provides that where the applicable guideline range is in Zone B of the Sentencing Table (<em>i.e.</em>, the minimum term of imprisonment specified in the applicable guideline range is at least one but not more than nine months), the court has three options:</p><blockquote><p>(A) It may impose a sentence of imprisonment.</p><p>(B) It may impose a sentence of probation provided that it includes a condition of probation requiring a period of intermittent confinement, community confinement, or home detention, or combination of intermittent confinement, community confinement, and home detention, sufficient to satisfy the minimum period of imprisonment specified in the guideline range. For example, where the guideline range is 4\u201310 months, a sentence of probation with a condition requiring at least four months of intermittent confinement, community confinement, or home detention would satisfy the minimum term of imprisonment specified in the guideline range.</p><p>(C) Or, it may impose a sentence of imprisonment that includes a term of supervised release with a condition that requires community confinement or home detention. In such case, at least one month must be satisfied by actual imprisonment and the remainder of the minimum term specified in the guideline range must be satisfied by community confinement or home detention. For example, where the guideline range is 4\u201310 months, a sentence of imprisonment of one month followed by a term of supervised release with a condition requiring three months of community confinement or home detention would satisfy the minimum term of imprisonment specified in the guideline range.</p><p>The preceding examples illustrate sentences that satisfy the minimum term of imprisonment required by the guideline range. The court, of course, may impose a sentence at a higher point within the applicable guideline range. For example, where the guideline range is 4\u201310 months, both a sentence of probation with a condition requiring six months of community confinement or home detention (under subsection (c)(3)) and a sentence of two months imprisonment followed by a term of supervised release with a condition requiring four months of community confinement or home detention (under subsection\xa0(c)(2)) would be within the guideline range.</p></blockquote><p>4. Subsection (d) provides that where the applicable guideline range is in Zone C of the Sentencing Table (<em>i.e.</em>, the minimum term specified in the applicable guideline range is ten or twelve months), the court has two options:</p><blockquote><p>(A) It may impose a sentence of imprisonment.</p><p>(B) Or, it may impose a sentence of imprisonment that includes a term of supervised release with a condition requiring community confinement or home detention. In such case, at least one-half of the minimum term specified in the guideline range must be satisfied by imprisonment, and the remainder of the minimum term specified in the guideline range must be satisfied by community confinement or home detention. For example, where the guideline range is 10\u201316 months, a sentence of five months imprisonment followed by a term of supervised release with a condition requiring five months community confinement or home detention would satisfy the minimum term of imprisonment required by the guideline range.</p><p>The preceding example illustrates a sentence that satisfies the minimum term of imprisonment required by the guideline range. The court, of course, may impose a sentence at a higher point within the guideline range. For example, where the guideline range is 10\u201316 months, both a sentence of five months imprisonment followed by a term of supervised release with a condition requiring six months of community confinement or home detention (under subsection (d)), and a sentence of ten months imprisonment followed by a term of supervised release with a condition requiring four months of community confinement or home detention (also under subsection (d)) would be within the guideline range.</p></blockquote><p>5. Subsection (e) sets forth a schedule of imprisonment substitutes.</p><p>6. There may be cases in which a departure from the sentencing options authorized for Zone\xa0C of the Sentencing Table (under which at least half the minimum term must be satisfied by imprisonment) to the sentencing options authorized for Zone B of the Sentencing Table (under which all or most of the minimum term may be satisfied by intermittent confinement, community confinement, or home detention instead of imprisonment) is appropriate to accomplish a specific treatment purpose. Such a departure should be considered only in cases where the court finds that (A) the defendant is an abuser of narcotics, other controlled substances, or alcohol, or suffers from a significant mental illness, and (B) the defendant\u2019s criminality is related to the treatment problem to be addressed.</p><blockquote><p>In determining whether such a departure is appropriate, the court should consider, among other things, (1) the likelihood that completion of the treatment program will successfully address the treatment problem, thereby reducing the risk to the public from further crimes of the defendant, and (2) whether imposition of less imprisonment than required by Zone C will increase the risk to the public from further crimes of the defendant.</p><p><strong>Examples:</strong> The following examples both assume the applicable guideline range is 12\u201318 months and the court departs in accordance with this application note. Under Zone C rules, the defendant must be sentenced to at least six months imprisonment. (1) The defendant is a nonviolent drug offender in Criminal History Category I and probation is not prohibited by statute. The court departs downward to impose a sentence of probation, with twelve months of intermittent confinement, community confinement, or home detention and participation in a substance abuse treatment program as conditions of probation. (2) The defendant is convicted of a Class A or B felony, so probation is prohibited by statute (<em>see</em> \xa75B1.1(b)). The court departs downward to impose a sentence of one month imprisonment, with eleven months in community confinement or home detention and participation in a substance abuse treatment program as conditions of supervised release.</p></blockquote><p>7. The use of substitutes for imprisonment as provided in subsections (c) and (d) is not recommended for most defendants with a criminal history category of III or above.</p><p>8. In a case in which community confinement in a residential treatment program is imposed to accomplish a specific treatment purpose, the court should consider the effectiveness of the residential treatment program.</p><p>9. Subsection (f) provides that, where the applicable guideline range is in Zone D of the Sentencing Table (<em>i.e.</em>, the minimum term of imprisonment specified in the applicable guideline range is 15 months or more), the minimum term must be satisfied by a sentence of imprisonment without the use of any of the imprisonment substitutes in subsection\xa0(e).</p><table><tbody><tr class='odd'><td><em>Historical Note</em></td><td>Effective November 1, 1987.

The court may depart from this guideline and not impose a term of supervised release if supervised release is not required by statute and the court determines, after considering the factors set forth in Note 3, that supervised release is not necessary.</p><p>2. <strong>Application of Subsection (b).\u2014</strong>Under subsection (b), the court may impose a term of supervised release to follow a term of imprisonment in any other case, after considering the factors set forth in Note 3.</p><p>3. <strong>Factors to Be Considered.\u2014</strong></p><blockquote><p>(A) <strong>Statutory Factors.\u2014</strong>In determining whether to impose a term of supervised release, the court is required by statute to consider, among other factors:</p><p>(i) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant;</p><p>(ii) the need to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct, to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant, and to provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training, medical care, or other correctional treatment in the most effective manner;</p><p>(iii) the need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities among defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of similar conduct; and</p><p>(iv) the need to provide restitution to any victims of the offense.</p><p><em>See</em> 18 U.S.C. \xa7\xa03583(c).</p><p>(B) <strong>Criminal History.\u2014</strong>The court should give particular consideration to the defendant\u2019s criminal history (which is one aspect of the \u201chistory and characteristics of the defendant\u201d in subparagraph (A)(i), above). In general, the more serious the defendant\u2019s criminal history, the greater the need for supervised release.</p><p>(C) <strong>Substance Abuse.\u2014</strong>In a case in which a defendant sentenced to imprisonment is an abuser of controlled substances or alcohol, it is highly recommended that a term of supervised release also be imposed. <em>See</em> \xa75H1.4 (Physical Condition, Including Drug or Alcohol Dependence or Abuse; Gambling Addiction).</p><p>(D) <strong>Domestic Violence.\u2014</strong>If the defendant is convicted for the first time of a domestic violence crime as defined in 18 U.S.C. \xa7\xa03561(b), a term of supervised release is required by statute. <em>See</em> 18 U.S.C. \xa7\xa03583(a). Such a defendant is also required by statute to attend an approved rehabilitation program, if available within a 50-mile radius of the legal residence of the defendant. <em>See</em> 18 U.S.C. \xa7\xa03583(d); \xa75D1.3(a)(3). In any other case involving domestic violence or stalking in which the defendant is sentenced to imprisonment, it is highly recommended that a term of supervised release also be imposed.</p></blockquote><p>4. <strong>Community Confinement or Home Detention Following Imprisonment.\u2014</strong>A term of supervised release must be imposed if the court wishes to impose a \u201csplit sentence\u201d under which the defendant serves a term of imprisonment followed by a period of community confinement or home detention pursuant to subsection (c)(2) or (d)(2) of \xa75C1.1 (Imposition of a Term of Imprisonment). In such a case, the period of community confinement or home detention is imposed as a condition of supervised release.</p><p>5. <strong>Application of Subsection (c).\u2014</strong>In a case in which the defendant is a deportable alien specified in subsection (c) and supervised release is not required by statute, the court ordinarily should not impose a term of supervised release. Unless such a defendant legally returns to the United States, supervised release is unnecessary. If such a defendant illegally returns to the United States, the need to afford adequate deterrence and protect the public ordinarily is adequately served by a new prosecution. The court should, however, consider imposing a term of supervised release on such a defendant if the court determines it would provide an added measure of deterrence and protection based on the facts and circumstances of a particular case.</p><table><tbody><tr class='odd'><td><em>Historical Note</em></td><td>Effective November 1, 1987.

The court should ensure that the term imposed on the defendant is long enough to address the purposes of imposing supervised release on the defendant.</p><p>5. <strong>Early Termination and Extension.\u2014</strong>The court has authority to terminate or extend a term of supervised release. <em>See</em> 18 U.S.C. \xa7\xa03583(e)(1), (2). The court is encouraged to exercise this authority in appropriate cases. The prospect of exercising this authority is a factor the court may wish to consider in determining the length of a term of supervised release. For example, the court may wish to consider early termination of supervised release if the defendant is an abuser of narcotics, other controlled substances, or alcohol who, while on supervised release, successfully completes a treatment program, thereby reducing the risk to the public from further crimes of the defendant.</p><p>6. <strong>Application of Subsection (c).\u2014</strong>Subsection (c) specifies how a statutorily required minimum term of supervised release may affect the minimum term of supervised release provided by the guidelines.</p><blockquote><p>For example, if subsection (a) provides a range of two years to five years, but the relevant statute requires a minimum term of supervised release of three years and a maximum term of life, the term of supervised release provided by the guidelines is restricted by subsection (c) to three years to five years. Similarly, if subsection (a) provides a range of two years to five years, but the relevant statute requires a minimum term of supervised release of five years and a maximum term of life, the term of supervised release provided by the guidelines is five years.</p><p>The following example illustrates the interaction of subsections (a) and (c) when subsection (b) is also involved. In this example, subsection (a) provides a range of two years to five years; the relevant statute requires a minimum term of supervised release of five years and a maximum term of life; and the offense is a sex offense under subsection (b). The effect of subsection (b) is to raise the maximum term of supervised release from five years (as provided by subsection (a)) to life, yielding a range of two years to life. The term of supervised release provided by the guidelines is then restricted by subsection (c) to five years to life. In this example, a term of supervised release of more than five years would be a guideline sentence. In addition, subsection (b) contains a policy statement recommending that the maximum \u2014 a life term of supervised release \u2014 be imposed.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Background:</strong> This section specifies the length of a term of supervised release that is to be imposed. Subsection (c) applies to statutes, such as the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986, that require imposition of a specific minimum term of supervised release.</p><table><tbody><tr class='odd'><td><em>Historical Note</em></td><td>Effective November 1, 1987.

The length of the installment schedule generally should not exceed twelve months, and shall not exceed the maximum term of probation authorized for the offense. The defendant should be required to pay a substantial installment at the time of sentencing. If the court authorizes a defendant sentenced to probation or supervised release to pay a fine on an installment schedule, the court shall require as a condition of probation or supervised release that the defendant pay the fine according to the schedule.

A fine may be the sole sanction if the guidelines do not require a term of imprisonment. If, however, the fine is not paid in full at the time of sentencing, it is recommended that the court sentence the defendant to a term of probation, with payment of the fine as a condition of probation. If a fine is imposed in addition to a term of imprisonment, it is recommended that the court impose a term of supervised release following imprisonment as a means of enforcing payment of the fine.</p><p>2. In general, the maximum fine permitted by law as to each count of conviction is $250,000 for a felony or for any misdemeanor resulting in death; $100,000 for a Class A misdemeanor; and $5,000 for any other offense. 18 U.S.C. \xa7\xa03571(b)(3)\u2013(7). However, higher or lower limits may apply when specified by statute. 18 U.S.C. \xa7\xa03571(b)(1), (e). As an alternative maximum, the court may fine the defendant up to the greater of twice the gross gain or twice the gross loss. 18 U.S.C. \xa7\xa03571(b)(2), (d).</p><p>3. The determination of the fine guideline range may be dispensed with entirely upon a court determination of present and future inability to pay any fine. The inability of a defendant to post bail bond (having otherwise been determined eligible for release) and the fact that a defendant is represented by (or was determined eligible for) assigned counsel are significant indicators of present inability to pay any fine. In conjunction with other factors, they may also indicate that the defendant is not likely to become able to pay any fine.</p><p>4. The Commission envisions that for most defendants, the maximum of the guideline fine range from subsection (c) will be at least twice the amount of gain or loss resulting from the offense. Where, however, two times either the amount of gain to the defendant or the amount of loss caused by the offense exceeds the maximum of the fine guideline, an upward departure from the fine guideline may be warranted.</p><blockquote><p>Moreover, where a sentence within the applicable fine guideline range would not be sufficient to ensure both the disgorgement of any gain from the offense that otherwise would not be disgorged (<em>e.g.</em>, by restitution or forfeiture) and an adequate punitive fine, an upward departure from the fine guideline range may be warranted.</p></blockquote><p>5. Subsection (c)(4) applies to statutes that contain special provisions permitting larger fines; the guidelines do not limit maximum fines in such cases. These statutes include, among others: 21 U.S.C. \xa7\xa7\xa0841(b) and 960(b), which authorize fines up to $8 million in offenses involving the manufacture, distribution, or importation of certain controlled substances; 21 U.S.C. \xa7\xa0848(a), which authorizes fines up to $4 million in offenses involving the manufacture or distribution of controlled substances by a continuing criminal enterprise; 18 U.S.C. \xa7\xa01956(a), which authorizes a fine equal to the greater of $500,000 or two times the value of the monetary instruments or funds involved in offenses involving money laundering of financial instruments; 18 U.S.C. \xa7\xa01957(b)(2), which authorizes a fine equal to two times the amount of any criminally derived property involved in a money laundering transaction; 33 U.S.C. \xa7\xa01319(c), which authorizes a fine of up to $50,000 per day for violations of the Water Pollution Control Act; 42 U.S.C. \xa7\xa06928(d), which authorizes a fine of up to $50,000 per day for violations of the Resource Conservation Act; and 52 U.S.C. \xa7\xa030109(d)(1)(D), which authorizes, for violations of the Federal Election Campaign Act under 52 U.S.C. \xa7\xa030122, a fine up to the greater of $50,000 or 1,000 percent of the amount of the violation, and which requires, in the case of such a violation, a minimum fine of not less than 300 percent of the amount of the violation.</p><blockquote><p>There may be cases in which the defendant has entered into a conciliation agreement with the Federal Election Commission under section 309 of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 in order to correct or prevent a violation of such Act by the defendant. The existence of a conciliation agreement between the defendant and Federal Election Commission, and the extent of compliance with that conciliation agreement, may be appropriate factors in determining at what point within the applicable fine guideline range to sentence the defendant, unless the defendant began negotiations toward a conciliation agreement after becoming aware of a criminal investigation.</p></blockquote><p>6. The existence of income or assets that the defendant failed to disclose may justify a larger fine than that which otherwise would be warranted under this section. The court may base its conclusion as to this factor on information revealing significant unexplained expenditures by the defendant or unexplained possession of assets that do not comport with the defendant\u2019s reported income. If the court concludes that the defendant willfully misrepresented all or part of his income or assets, it may increase the offense level and resulting sentence in accordance with Chapter Three, Part C (Obstruction and Related Adjustments).</p><p>7.

Generally, multiple counts of 18 U.S.C. \xa7\xa01028A should run concurrently with one another in cases in which the underlying offenses are groupable under \xa73D1.2.</p><p>(iii) Whether the purposes of sentencing set forth in 18 U.S.C. \xa7\xa03553(a)(2) are better achieved by imposing a concurrent or a consecutive sentence for multiple counts of 18 U.S.C. \xa7\xa01028A.</p><p>(C) <strong>Imposition of Supervised Release.\u2014</strong>In the case of a consecutive term of imprisonment imposed under subsection (a), any term of supervised release imposed is to run concurrently with any other term of supervised release imposed. <em>See</em> 18 U.S.C. \xa7\xa03624(e).</p></blockquote><p>3. <strong>Application of Subsection (b).\u2014</strong></p><blockquote><p>(A) <strong>In General.\u2014</strong>Subsection (b) provides that, for all counts not covered by subsection (a), the court shall determine the total punishment (<em>i.e.</em>, the combined length of the sentences to be imposed) and shall impose that total punishment on each such count, except to the extent otherwise required by law (such as where a statutorily required minimum sentence or a statutorily authorized maximum sentence otherwise requires).</p><p>(B) <strong>Effect on Guidelines Range of Mandatory Minimum or Statutory Maximum.\u2014</strong>The defendant\u2019s guideline range on the Sentencing Table may be affected or restricted by a statutorily authorized maximum sentence or a statutorily required minimum sentence not only in a single-count case, <em>see</em> \xa75G1.1, but also in a multiple-count case.</p><p>In particular, where a statutorily required minimum sentence on any count is greater than the maximum of the applicable guideline range, the statutorily required minimum sentence on that count shall be the guideline sentence on all counts. <em>See</em> \xa75G1.1(b).

Because of the 10-year mandatory minimum on Count 2, however, Defendant A\u2019s guideline sentence is 120 months. <em>See</em> subparagraph (B), above. After considering that guideline sentence, the court determines that the appropriate \u201ctotal punishment\u201d to be imposed on Defendant A is 120\xa0months. Therefore, subsection (b) requires that the total punishment of 120\xa0months be imposed on each of Counts 1, 2, and 3. The sentence imposed on Count 4 is limited to 24 months, because a statutory maximum of 2 years applies to that particular count.</p><p>For Defendant B, in contrast, the court determines that the final offense level is 30 and the defendant is in Criminal History Category II, which yields a guideline range on the Sentencing Table of 108 to 135 months. Because of the 10-year mandatory minimum on Count 2, however, Defendant B\u2019s guideline range is restricted to 120 to 135 months. <em>See</em> subparagraph (B), above. After considering that restricted guideline range, the court determines that the appropriate \u201ctotal punishment\u201d to be imposed on Defendant B is 130 months. Therefore, subsection (b) requires that the total punishment of 130 months be imposed on each of Counts 2 and 3. The sentences imposed on Counts 1 and 4 are limited to 120 months (10 years) and 24\xa0months (2 years), respectively, because of the applicable statutory maximums.</p><p>(D) <strong>Special Rule on Resentencing.\u2014</strong>In a case in which (i) the defendant\u2019s guideline range on the Sentencing Table was affected or restricted by a statutorily required minimum sentence (as described in subparagraph (B)), (ii) the court is resentencing the defendant, and (iii) the statutorily required minimum sentence no longer applies, the defendant\u2019s guideline range for purposes of the remaining counts shall be redetermined without regard to the previous effect or restriction of the statutorily required minimum sentence.</p></blockquote><p>4. <strong>Career Offenders Covered under Subsection (e).\u2014</strong></p><blockquote><p>(A) <strong>Imposing Sentence.\u2014</strong>The sentence imposed for a conviction under 18 U.S.C. \xa7\xa0924(c) or \xa7\xa0929(a) shall, under that statute, consist of a minimum term of imprisonment imposed to run consecutively to the sentence on any other count.

In some cases covered by subsection (e), a consecutive term of imprisonment longer than the minimum required by 18 U.S.C. \xa7\xa0924(c) or \xa7\xa0929(a) will be necessary in order both to achieve the total punishment determined by the court and to comply with the applicable statutory requirements.</p><p>(B) <strong>Examples.\u2014</strong>The following examples illustrate the application of subsection (e) in a multiple count situation:</p><p>(i) The defendant is convicted of one count of violating 18 U.S.C. \xa7\xa0924(c) for possessing a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking offense (5 year mandatory minimum), and one count of violating 21 U.S.C. \xa7\xa0841(b)(1)(C) (20 year statutory maximum).

Cases in which only part of the prior offense is relevant conduct to the instant offense are covered under subsection (d).</p><p>(B) <strong>Inapplicability of Subsection (b).\u2014</strong>Subsection (b) does not apply in cases in which the prior offense was not relevant conduct to the instant offense under \xa71B1.3(a)(1), (a)(2), or (a)(3) (<em>e.g.</em>, the prior offense is a prior conviction for which the defendant received an increase under \xa72L1.2 (Unlawfully Entering or Remaining in the United States), or the prior offense was a crime of violence for which the defendant received an increased base offense level under \xa72K2.1 (Unlawful Receipt, Possession, or Transportation of Firearms or Ammunition; Prohibited Transactions Involving Firearms or Ammunition)).</p><p>(C) <strong>Imposition of Sentence.\u2014</strong>If subsection (b) applies, and the court adjusts the sentence for a period of time already served, the court should note on the Judgment in a Criminal Case Order (i) the applicable subsection (<em>e.g.</em>, \xa75G1.3(b)); (ii) the amount of time by which the sentence is being adjusted; (iii) the undischarged term of imprisonment for which the adjustment is being given; and (iv) that the sentence imposed is a sentence reduction pursuant to \xa75G1.3(b) for a period of imprisonment that will not be credited by the Bureau of Prisons.</p><p>(D) <strong>Example.\u2014</strong>The following is an example in which subsection (b) applies and an adjustment to the sentence is appropriate:</p><p>The defendant is convicted of a federal offense charging the sale of 90 grams of cocaine. Under \xa71B1.3, the defendant is held accountable for the sale of an additional 25 grams of cocaine, an offense for which the defendant has been convicted and sentenced in state court. The defendant received a nine-month sentence of imprisonment for the state offense and has served six months on that sentence at the time of sentencing on the instant federal offense. The guideline range applicable to the defendant is 12\u201318 months (Chapter Two offense level of level 16 for sale of 115\xa0grams of cocaine; 3 level reduction for acceptance of responsibility; final offense level of level 13; Criminal History Category I). The court determines that a sentence of 13 months provides the appropriate total punishment. Because the defendant has already served six months on the related state charge as of the date of sentencing on the instant federal offense, a sentence of seven months, imposed to run concurrently with the three months remaining on the defendant\u2019s state sentence, achieves this result.</p></blockquote><p>3. <strong>Application of Subsection (c).\u2014</strong>Subsection (c) applies to cases in which the federal court anticipates that, after the federal sentence is imposed, the defendant will be sentenced in state court and serve a state sentence before being transferred to federal custody for federal imprisonment. In such a case, where the other offense is relevant conduct to the instant offense of conviction under the provisions of subsections (a)(1), (a)(2), or (a)(3) of \xa71B1.3 (Relevant Conduct), the sentence for the instant offense shall be imposed to run concurrently to the anticipated term of imprisonment.</p><p>4. <strong>Application of Subsection (d).\u2014</strong></p><blockquote><p>(A) <strong>In General.\u2014</strong>Under subsection (d), the court may impose a sentence concurrently, partially concurrently, or consecutively to the undischarged term of imprisonment. In order to achieve a reasonable incremental punishment for the instant offense and avoid unwarranted disparity, the court should consider the following:</p><p>(i) the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \xa7\xa03584 (referencing 18 U.S.C. \xa7\xa03553(a));</p><p>(ii) the type (<em>e.g.</em>, determinate, indeterminate/parolable) and length of the prior undischarged sentence;</p><p>(iii) the time served on the undischarged sentence and the time likely to be served before release;</p><p>(iv) the fact that the prior undischarged sentence may have been imposed in state court rather than federal court, or at a different time before the same or different federal court; and</p><p>(v) any other circumstance relevant to the determination of an appropriate sentence for the instant offense.</p><p>(B) <strong>Partially Concurrent Sentence.\u2014</strong>In some cases under subsection (d), a partially concurrent sentence may achieve most appropriately the desired result. To impose a partially concurrent sentence, the court may provide in the Judgment in a Criminal Case Order that the sentence for the instant offense shall commence on the earlier of (i) when the defendant is released from the prior undischarged sentence; or (ii) on a specified date. This order provides for a fully consecutive sentence if the defendant is released on the undischarged term of imprisonment on or before the date specified in the order, and a partially concurrent sentence if the defendant is not released on the undischarged term of imprisonment by that date.</p><p>(C) <strong>Undischarged Terms of Imprisonment Resulting from Revocations of Probation, Parole or Supervised Release.\u2014</strong>Subsection (d) applies in cases in which the defendant was on federal or state probation, parole, or supervised release at the time of the instant offense and has had such probation, parole, or supervised release revoked. Consistent with the policy set forth in Application Note 4 and subsection (f) of \xa77B1.3 (Revocation of Probation or Supervised Release), the Commission recommends that the sentence for the instant offense be imposed consecutively to the sentence imposed for the revocation.</p><p>(D) <strong>Complex Situations.\u2014</strong>Occasionally, the court may be faced with a complex case in which a defendant may be subject to multiple undischarged terms of imprisonment that seemingly call for the application of different rules. In such a case, the court may exercise its discretion in accordance with subsection (d) to fashion a sentence of appropriate length and structure it to run in any appropriate manner to achieve a reasonable punishment for the instant offense.</p><p>(E) <strong>Downward Departure.\u2014</strong>Unlike subsection (b), subsection (d) does not authorize an adjustment of the sentence for the instant offense for a period of imprisonment already served on the undischarged term of imprisonment. However, in an extraordinary case involving an undischarged term of imprisonment under subsection (d), it may be appropriate for the court to downwardly depart. This may occur, for example, in a case in which the defendant has served a very substantial period of imprisonment on an undischarged term of imprisonment that resulted from conduct only partially within the relevant conduct for the instant offense. In such a case, a downward departure may be warranted to ensure that the combined punishment is not increased unduly by the fortuity and timing of separate prosecutions and sentencings. Nevertheless, it is intended that a departure pursuant to this application note result in a sentence that ensures a reasonable incremental punishment for the instant offense of conviction.</p><p>To avoid confusion with the Bureau of Prisons\u2019 exclusive authority provided under 18 U.S.C. \xa7\xa03585(b) to grant credit for time served under certain circumstances, the Commission recommends that any downward departure under this application note be clearly stated on the Judgment in a Criminal Case Order as a downward departure pursuant to \xa75G1.3(d), rather than as a credit for time served.</p></blockquote><p>5. <strong>Downward Departure Provision.\u2014</strong>In the case of a discharged term of imprisonment, a downward departure is not prohibited if the defendant (A) has completed serving a term of imprisonment; and (B) subsection (b) would have provided an adjustment had that completed term of imprisonment been undischarged at the time of sentencing for the instant offense. <em>See</em> \xa75K2.23 (Discharged Terms of Imprisonment).</p><p><strong>Background:</strong> Federal courts generally \u201chave discretion to select whether the sentences they impose will run concurrently or consecutively with respect to other sentences that they impose, or that have been imposed in other proceedings, including state proceedings.\u201d <em>See Setser v. United States</em>, 132 S.\xa0Ct. 1463, 1468 (2012); 18 U.S.C. \xa7\xa03584(a). Federal courts also generally have discretion to order that the sentences they impose will run concurrently with or consecutively to other state sentences that are anticipated but not yet imposed. <em>See Setser</em>, 132 S.\xa0Ct. at 1468. Exercise of that discretion, however, is predicated on the court\u2019s consideration of the factors listed in 18 U.S.C. \xa7\xa03553(a), including any applicable guidelines or policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.</p><table><tbody><tr class='odd'><td><em>Historical Note</em></td><td>Effective November 1, 1987.

(ii) departures based on the defendant\u2019s substantial assistance to the authorities (<em>see</em> \xa75K1.1 (Substantial Assistance to Authorities)); and (iii) departures based on early disposition programs (<em>see</em> \xa75K3.1 (Early Disposition Programs)).</p></blockquote><p>3. <strong>Kinds and Expected Frequency of Departures under Subsection (a).\u2014</strong>As set forth in subsection (a), there generally are two kinds of departures from the guidelines based on offense characteristics and/or offender characteristics: (A) departures based on circumstances of a kind not adequately taken into consideration in the guidelines; and (B) departures based on circumstances that are present to a degree not adequately taken into consideration in the guidelines.</p><blockquote><p>(A) <strong>Departures Based on Circumstances of a Kind Not Adequately Taken into Account in Guidelines.\u2014</strong>Subsection (a)(2) authorizes the court to depart if there exists an aggravating or a mitigating circumstance in a case under 18 U.S.C. \xa7\xa03553(b)(1), or an aggravating circumstance in a case under 18 U.S.C. \xa7\xa03553(b)(2)(A)(i), of a kind not adequately taken into consideration in the guidelines.</p><p>(i) <strong>Identified Circumstances.\u2014</strong>This subpart (Chapter Five, Part K, Subpart\xa02) identifies several circumstances that the Commission may have not adequately taken into consideration in setting the offense level for certain cases. Offense guidelines in Chapter Two (Offense Conduct) and adjustments in Chapter Three (Adjustments) sometimes identify circumstances the Commission may have not adequately taken into consideration in setting the offense level for offenses covered by those guidelines. If the offense guideline in Chapter Two or an adjustment in Chapter Three does not adequately take that circumstance into consideration in setting the offense level for the offense, and only to the extent not adequately taken into consideration, a departure based on that circumstance may be warranted.</p><p>(ii) <strong>Unidentified Circumstances.\u2014</strong>A case may involve circumstances, in addition to those identified by the guidelines, that have not adequately been taken into consideration by the Commission, and the presence of any such circumstance may warrant departure from the guidelines in that case. However, inasmuch as the Commission has continued to monitor and refine the guidelines since their inception to take into consideration relevant circumstances in sentencing, it is expected that departures based on such unidentified circumstances will occur rarely and only in exceptional cases.</p><p>(B) <strong>Departures Based on Circumstances Present to a Degree Not Adequately Taken into Consideration in Guidelines.\u2014</strong></p><p>(i) <strong>In General.\u2014</strong>Subsection (a)(3) authorizes the court to depart if there exists an aggravating or a mitigating circumstance in a case under 18 U.S.C. \xa7\xa03553(b)(1), or an aggravating circumstance in a case under 18 U.S.C. \xa7\xa03553(b)(2)(A)(i), to a degree not adequately taken into consideration in the guidelines. However, inasmuch as the Commission has continued to monitor and refine the guidelines since their inception to determine the most appropriate weight to be accorded the mitigating and aggravating circumstances specified in the guidelines, it is expected that departures based on the weight accorded to any such circumstance will occur rarely and only in exceptional cases.</p><p>(ii) <strong>Examples.\u2014</strong>As set forth in subsection (a)(3), if the applicable offense guideline and adjustments take into consideration a circumstance identified in this subpart, departure is warranted only if the circumstance is present to a degree substantially in excess of that which ordinarily is involved in the offense. Accordingly, a departure pursuant to \xa75K2.7 for the disruption of a governmental function would have to be substantial to warrant departure from the guidelines when the applicable offense guideline is bribery or obstruction of justice. When the guideline covering the mailing of injurious articles is applicable, however, and the offense caused disruption of a governmental function, departure from the applicable guideline range more readily would be appropriate. Similarly, physical injury would not warrant departure from the guidelines when the robbery offense guideline is applicable because the robbery guideline includes a specific adjustment based on the extent of any injury. However, because the robbery guideline does not deal with injury to more than one victim, departure may be warranted if several persons were injured.</p><p>(C) <strong>Departures Based on Circumstances Identified as Not Ordinarily Relevant.\u2014</strong>Because certain circumstances are specified in the guidelines as not ordinarily relevant to sentencing (<em>see, e.g.</em>, Chapter Five, Part H (Specific Offender Characteristics)), a departure based on any one of such circumstances should occur only in exceptional cases, and only if the circumstance is present in the case to an exceptional degree. If two or more of such circumstances each is present in the case to a substantial degree, however, and taken together make the case an exceptional one, the court may consider whether a departure would be warranted pursuant to subsection (c). Departures based on a combination of not ordinarily relevant circumstances that are present to a substantial degree should occur extremely rarely and only in exceptional cases.</p><p>In addition, as required by subsection (e), each circumstance forming the basis for a departure described in this subdivision shall be stated with specificity in the statement of reasons form.</p></blockquote><p>4. <strong>Downward Departures in Child Crimes and Sexual Offenses.\u2014</strong></p><blockquote><p>(A) <strong>Definition.\u2014</strong>For purposes of this policy statement, the term \u201c<em><strong>child crimes and sexual offenses</strong></em>\u201d means offenses under any of the following: 18 U.S.C. \xa7\xa01201 (involving a minor victim), 18 U.S.C. \xa7\xa01591, or chapter 71, 109A, 110, or 117 of title\xa018, United States Code.</p><p>(B) <strong>Standard for Departure.\u2014</strong></p><p>(i) <strong>Requirement of Affirmative and Specific Identification of Departure Ground.\u2014</strong>The standard for a downward departure in child crimes and sexual offenses differs from the standard for other departures under this policy statement in that it includes a requirement, set forth in 18 U.S.C. \xa7\xa03553(b)(2)(A)(ii)(I) and subsection (b)(1) of this guideline, that any mitigating circumstance that forms the basis for such a downward departure be affirmatively and specifically identified as a ground for downward departure in this part (<em>i.e.</em>, Chapter Five, Part K).</p><p>(ii) <strong>Application of Subsection (b)(2).\u2014</strong>The commentary in Application Note 3 of this policy statement, except for the commentary in Application Note\xa03(A)(ii) relating to unidentified circumstances, shall apply to the court\u2019s determination of whether a case meets the requirement, set forth in subsection 18\xa0U.S.C. \xa7\xa03553(b)(2)(A)(ii)(II) and subsection (b)(2) of this policy statement, that the mitigating circumstance forming the basis for a downward departure in child crimes and sexual offenses be of kind, or to a degree, not adequately taken into consideration by the Commission.</p></blockquote><p>5. <strong>Departures Based on Plea Agreements.\u2014</strong>Subsection (d)(4) prohibits a downward departure based only on the defendant\u2019s decision, in and of itself, to plead guilty to the offense or to enter a plea agreement with respect to the offense. Even though a departure may not be based merely on the fact that the defendant agreed to plead guilty or enter a plea agreement, a departure may be based on justifiable, non-prohibited reasons for departure as part of a sentence that is recommended, or agreed to, in the plea agreement and accepted by the court. <em>See</em> \xa76B1.2 (Standards for Acceptance of Plea Agreements). In cases in which the court departs based on such reasons as set forth in the plea agreement, the court must state the reasons for departure with specificity in the statement of reasons form, as required by subsection (e).</p><p><strong>Background:</strong> This policy statement sets forth the standards for departing from the applicable guideline range based on offense and offender characteristics of a kind, or to a degree, not adequately considered by the Commission. Circumstances the Commission has determined are not ordinarily relevant to determining whether a departure is warranted or are prohibited as bases for departure are addressed in Chapter Five, Part H (Offender Characteristics) and in this policy statement. Other departures, such as those based on the defendant\u2019s criminal history, the defendant\u2019s substantial assistance to authorities, and early disposition programs, are addressed elsewhere in the guidelines.</p><p>As acknowledged by Congress in the Sentencing Reform Act and by the Commission when the first set of guidelines was promulgated, \u201cit is difficult to prescribe a single set of guidelines that encompasses the vast range of human conduct potentially relevant to a sentencing decision.\u201d (<em>See</em> Chapter One, Part A). Departures, therefore, perform an integral function in the sentencing guideline system. Departures permit courts to impose an appropriate sentence in the exceptional case in which mechanical application of the guidelines would fail to achieve the statutory purposes and goals of sentencing. Departures also help maintain \u201csufficient flexibility to permit individualized sentences when warranted by mitigating or aggravating factors not taken into account in the establishment of general sentencing practices.\u201d 28\xa0U.S.C. \xa7\xa0991(b)(1)(B). By monitoring when courts depart from the guidelines and by analyzing their stated reasons for doing so, along with appellate cases reviewing these departures, the Commission can further refine the guidelines to specify more precisely when departures should and should not be permitted.</p><p>As reaffirmed in the Prosecutorial Remedies and Other Tools to end the Exploitation of Children Today Act of 2003 (the \u201cPROTECT Act\u201d, Public Law 108\u201321), circumstances warranting departure should be rare. Departures were never intended to permit sentencing courts to substitute their policy judgments for those of Congress and the Sentencing Commission. Departure in such circumstances would produce unwarranted sentencing disparity, which the Sentencing Reform Act was designed to avoid.</p><p>In order for appellate courts to fulfill their statutory duties under 18 U.S.C. \xa7\xa03742 and for the Commission to fulfill its ongoing responsibility to refine the guidelines in light of information it receives on departures, it is essential that sentencing courts state with specificity the reasons for departure, as required by the PROTECT Act.</p><p>This policy statement, including its commentary, was substantially revised, effective October 27, 2003, in response to directives contained in the PROTECT Act, particularly the directive in section 401(m) of that Act to\u2014</p><blockquote><p>\u201c(1) review the grounds of downward departure that are authorized by the sentencing guidelines, policy statements, and official commentary of the Sentencing Commission; and</p><p>(2) promulgate, pursuant to section 994 of title 28, United States Code\u2014</p><p>(A) appropriate amendments to the sentencing guidelines, policy statements, and official commentary to ensure that the incidence of downward departures is substantially reduced;</p><p>(B) a policy statement authorizing a departure pursuant to an early disposition program; and</p><p>(C) any other conforming amendments to the sentencing guidelines, policy statements, and official commentary of the Sentencing Commission necessitated by the Act, including a revision of\xa0.\xa0.\xa0. section 5K2.0\u201d.</p></blockquote><p>The substantial revision of this policy statement in response to the PROTECT Act was intended to refine the standards applicable to departures while giving due regard for concepts, such as the \u201cheartland\u201d, that have evolved in departure jurisprudence over time.</p><p>Section 401(b)(1) of the PROTECT Act directly amended this policy statement to add subsection (b), effective April 30, 2003.</p><table><tbody><tr class='odd'><td><em>Historical Note</em></td><td>Effective November 1, 1987.

Rule 48(a), Fed. R. Crim. P. However, when the dismissal of charges or agreement not to pursue potential charges is contingent on acceptance of a plea agreement, the court\u2019s authority to adjudicate guilt and impose sentence is implicated, and the court is to determine whether or not dismissal of charges will undermine the sentencing guidelines.</p><p>Similarly, the court should accept a recommended sentence or a plea agreement requiring imposition of a specific sentence only if the court is satisfied either that such sentence is an appropriate sentence within the applicable guideline range or, if not, that the sentence is outside the applicable guideline range for justifiable reasons and those reasons are set forth with specificity in the statement of reasons form. <em>See</em> 18 U.S.C. \xa7\xa03553(c).

This paragraph prevents a plea agreement from restricting consideration of conduct that is within the scope of \xa71B1.3 (Relevant Conduct) in respect to the count(s) of which the defendant is convicted; it does not in any way expand or modify the scope of \xa71B1.3 (Relevant Conduct).

The definitions in the Commentary to \xa71B1.1 (Application Instructions) and the guidelines and commentary in \xa7\xa71B1.2 through 1B1.8 apply to determinations under this chapter unless otherwise specified. The adjustments in Chapter Three, Parts A (Victim-Related Adjustments), B (Role in the Offense), C (Obstruction and Related Adjustments), and E (Acceptance of Responsibility) do not apply. The provisions of Chapter Six (Sentencing Procedures, Plea Agreements, and Crime Victims\u2019 Rights) apply to proceedings in which the defendant is an organization. Guidelines and policy statements not referenced in this chapter, directly or indirectly, do not apply when the defendant is an organization; <em>e.g.</em>, the policy statements in Chapter Seven (Violations of Probation and Supervised Release) do not apply to organizations.</p><p>3. The following are definitions of terms used frequently in this chapter:</p><blockquote><p>(A) \u201c<em><strong>Offense</strong></em>\u201d means the offense of conviction and all relevant conduct under \xa71B1.3 (Relevant Conduct) unless a different meaning is specified or is otherwise clear from the context. The term \u201c<em><strong>instant</strong></em>\u201d is used in connection with \u201coffense,\u201d \u201cfederal offense,\u201d or \u201coffense of conviction,\u201d as the case may be, to distinguish the violation for which the defendant is being sentenced from a prior or subsequent offense, or from an offense before another court (<em>e.g.</em>, an offense before a state court involving the same underlying conduct).</p><p>(B) \u201c<em><strong>High-level personnel of the organization</strong></em>\u201d means individuals who have substantial control over the organization or who have a substantial role in the making of policy within the organization. The term includes: a director; an executive officer; an individual in charge of a major business or functional unit of the organization, such as sales, administration, or finance; and an individual with a substantial ownership interest. \u201c<em><strong>High-level personnel of a unit of the organization</strong></em>\u201d is defined in the Commentary to \xa78C2.5 (Culpability Score).</p><p>(C) \u201c<em><strong>Substantial authority personnel</strong></em>\u201d means individuals who within the scope of their authority exercise a substantial measure of discretion in acting on behalf of an organization. The term includes high-level personnel of the organization, individuals who exercise substantial supervisory authority (<em>e.g.</em>, a plant manager, a sales manager), and any other individuals who, although not a part of an organization\u2019s management, nevertheless exercise substantial discretion when acting within the scope of their authority (<em>e.g.</em>, an individual with authority in an organization to negotiate or set price levels or an individual authorized to negotiate or approve significant contracts). Whether an individual falls within this category must be determined on a case-by-case basis.</p><p>(D) \u201c<em><strong>Agent</strong></em>\u201d means any individual, including a director, an officer, an employee, or an independent contractor, authorized to act on behalf of the organization.</p><p>(E) An individual \u201c<em><strong>condoned</strong></em>\u201d an offense if the individual knew of the offense and did not take reasonable steps to prevent or terminate the offense.</p><p>(F) \u201c<em><strong>Similar misconduct</strong></em>\u201d means prior conduct that is similar in nature to the conduct underlying the instant offense, without regard to whether or not such conduct violated the same statutory provision. For example, prior Medicare fraud would be misconduct similar to an instant offense involving another type of fraud.</p><p>(G) \u201c<em><strong>Prior criminal adjudication</strong></em>\u201d means conviction by trial, plea of guilty (including an <em>Alford</em> plea), or plea of <em>nolo contendere</em>.</p><p>(H) \u201c<em><strong>Pecuniary gain</strong></em>\u201d is derived from 18 U.S.C. \xa7\xa03571(d) and means the additional before-tax profit to the defendant resulting from the relevant conduct of the offense. Gain can result from either additional revenue or cost savings. For example, an offense involving odometer tampering can produce additional revenue. In such a case, the pecuniary gain is the additional revenue received because the automobiles appeared to have less mileage, <em>i.e.</em>, the difference between the price received or expected for the automobiles with the apparent mileage and the fair market value of the automobiles with the actual mileage. An offense involving defense procurement fraud related to defective product testing can produce pecuniary gain resulting from cost savings. In such a case, the pecuniary gain is the amount saved because the product was not tested in the required manner.</p><p>(I) \u201c<em><strong>Pecuniary loss</strong></em>\u201d is derived from 18 U.S.C. \xa7\xa03571(d) and is equivalent to the term \u201closs\u201d as used in Chapter Two (Offense Conduct). <em>See</em> Commentary to \xa72B1.1 (Theft, Property Destruction, and Fraud), and definitions of \u201ctax loss\u201d in Chapter Two, Part\xa0T (Offenses Involving Taxation).</p><p>(J) An individual was \u201c<em><strong>willfully ignorant of the offense</strong></em>\u201d if the individual did not investigate the possible occurrence of unlawful conduct despite knowledge of circumstances that would lead a reasonable person to investigate whether unlawful conduct had occurred.</p></blockquote><table><tbody><tr class='odd'><td><em>Historical Note</em></td><td>Effective November 1, 1991 (amendment 422); November 1, 1997 (amendment 546); November 1, 2001 (amendment 617); November 1, 2004 (amendment 673); November 1, 2010 (amendment 747); November 1, 2011 (amendment 758).</td></tr></tbody></table>"},{id:"\xa78B1.1",content:"<p><strong>\xa78B1.1.

As appropriate, a large organization should encourage small organizations (especially those that have, or seek to have, a business relationship with the large organization) to implement effective compliance and ethics programs.</p><p>(iii) <strong>Small Organizations.\u2014</strong>In meeting the requirements of this guideline, small organizations shall demonstrate the same degree of commitment to ethical conduct and compliance with the law as large organizations.

The organization should take reasonable steps, as warranted under the circumstances, to remedy the harm resulting from the criminal conduct. These steps may include, where appropriate, providing restitution to identifiable victims, as well as other forms of remediation. Other reasonable steps to respond appropriately to the criminal conduct may include self-reporting and cooperation with authorities.</p><p>Second, the organization should act appropriately to prevent further similar criminal conduct, including assessing the compliance and ethics program and making modifications necessary to ensure the program is effective. The steps taken should be consistent with subsections (b)(5) and (c) and may include the use of an outside professional advisor to ensure adequate assessment and implementation of any modifications.</p></blockquote><p>7. <strong>Application of Subsection (c).\u2014</strong>To meet the requirements of subsection (c), an organization shall:</p><blockquote><p>(A) Assess periodically the risk that criminal conduct will occur, including assessing the following:</p><p>(i) The nature and seriousness of such criminal conduct.</p><p>(ii) The likelihood that certain criminal conduct may occur because of the nature of the organization\u2019s business. If, because of the nature of an organization\u2019s business, there is a substantial risk that certain types of criminal conduct may occur, the organization shall take reasonable steps to prevent and detect that type of criminal conduct. For example, an organization that, due to the nature of its business, employs sales personnel who have flexibility to set prices shall establish standards and procedures designed to prevent and detect price-fixing. An organization that, due to the nature of its business, employs sales personnel who have flexibility to represent the material characteristics of a product shall establish standards and procedures designed to prevent and detect fraud.</p><p>(iii) The prior history of the organization. The prior history of an organization may indicate types of criminal conduct that it shall take actions to prevent and detect.</p><p>(B) Prioritize periodically, as appropriate, the actions taken pursuant to any requirement set forth in subsection (b), in order to focus on preventing and detecting the criminal conduct identified under subparagraph (A) of this note as most serious, and most likely, to occur.</p><p>(C) Modify, as appropriate, the actions taken pursuant to any requirement set forth in subsection (b) to reduce the risk of criminal conduct identified under subparagraph (A) of this note as most serious, and most likely, to occur.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Background:</strong> This section sets forth the requirements for an effective compliance and ethics program.

Note that subsections (a)(2) and (a)(3) contain certain limitations as to the use of pecuniary gain and pecuniary loss in determining the base fine. Under subsection (a)(2), the pecuniary gain used to determine the base fine is the pecuniary gain to the organization from the offense. Under subsection (a)(3), the pecuniary loss used to determine the base fine is the pecuniary loss from the offense caused by the organization, to the extent that such loss was caused intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly.</p><p>2. Under 18 U.S.C. \xa7\xa03571(d), the court is not required to calculate pecuniary loss or pecuniary gain to the extent that determination of loss or gain would unduly complicate or prolong the sentencing process. Nevertheless, the court may need to approximate loss in order to calculate offense levels under Chapter Two. <em>See</em> Commentary to \xa72B1.1 (Theft, Property Destruction, and Fraud). If loss is approximated for purposes of determining the applicable offense level, the court should use that approximation as the starting point for calculating pecuniary loss under this section.</p><p>3. In a case of an attempted offense or a conspiracy to commit an offense, pecuniary loss and pecuniary gain are to be determined in accordance with the principles stated in \xa72X1.1 (Attempt, Solicitation, or Conspiracy).</p><p>4. In a case involving multiple participants (<em>i.e.</em>, multiple organizations, or the organization and individual(s) unassociated with the organization), the applicable offense level is to be determined without regard to apportionment of the gain from or loss caused by the offense. <em>See</em> \xa71B1.3 (Relevant Conduct). However, if the base fine is determined under subsections (a)(2) or (a)(3), the court may, as appropriate, apportion gain or loss considering the defendant\u2019s relative culpability and other pertinent factors. Note also that under \xa72R1.1(d)(1), the volume of commerce, which is used in determining a proxy for loss under \xa78C2.4(a)(3), is limited to the volume of commerce attributable to the defendant.</p><p>5. Special instructions regarding the determination of the base fine are contained in \xa7\xa72B4.1 (Bribery in Procurement of Bank Loan and Other Commercial Bribery); 2C1.1 (Offering, Giving, Soliciting, or Receiving a Bribe; Extortion Under Color of Official Right; Fraud Involving the Deprivation of the Intangible Right to Honest Services of Public Officials; Conspiracy to Defraud by Interference with Governmental Functions); 2C1.2 (Offering, Giving, Soliciting, or Receiving a Gratuity); 2E5.1 (Offering, Accepting, or Soliciting a Bribe or Gratuity Affecting the Operation of an Employee Welfare or Pension Benefit Plan; Prohibited Payments or Lending of Money by Employer or Agent to Employees, Representatives, or Labor Organizations); and 2R1.1 (Bid-Rigging, Price-Fixing or Market-Allocation Agreements Among Competitors).</p><p><strong>Background:</strong> Under this section, the base fine is determined in one of three ways: (1) by the amount, based on the offense level, from the table in subsection (d); (2) by the pecuniary gain to the organization from the offense; and (3) by the pecuniary loss caused by the organization, to the extent that such loss was caused intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly. In certain cases, special instructions for determining the loss or offense level amount apply. As a general rule, the base fine measures the seriousness of the offense. The determinants of the base fine are selected so that, in conjunction with the multipliers derived from the culpability score in \xa78C2.5 (Culpability Score), they will result in guideline fine ranges appropriate to deter organizational criminal conduct and to provide incentives for organizations to maintain internal mechanisms for preventing, detecting, and reporting criminal conduct. In order to deter organizations from seeking to obtain financial reward through criminal conduct, this section provides that, when greatest, pecuniary gain to the organization is used to determine the base fine. In order to ensure that organizations will seek to prevent losses intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly caused by their agents, this section provides that, when greatest, pecuniary loss is used to determine the base fine in such circumstances. Chapter Two provides special instructions for fines that include specific rules for determining the base fine in connection with certain types of offenses in which the calculation of loss or gain is difficult, <em>e.g.</em>, price-fixing. For these offenses, the special instructions tailor the base fine to circumstances that occur in connection with such offenses and that generally relate to the magnitude of loss or gain resulting from such offenses.</p><table><tbody><tr class='odd'><td><em>Historical Note</em></td><td>Effective November 1, 1991 (amendment 422).

For purposes of subsection (b), \u201c<em><strong>unit of the organization</strong></em>\u201d means any reasonably distinct operational component of the organization. For example, a large organization may have several large units such as divisions or subsidiaries, as well as many smaller units such as specialized manufacturing, marketing, or accounting operations within these larger units. For purposes of this definition, all of these types of units are encompassed within the term \u201cunit of the organization.\u201d</p><p>3. \u201c<em><strong>High-level personnel of the organization</strong></em>\u201d is defined in the Commentary to \xa78A1.2 (Application Instructions \u2015 Organizations). With respect to a unit with 200 or more employees, \u201c<em><strong>high-level personnel of a unit of the organization</strong></em>\u201d means agents within the unit who set the policy for or control that unit. For example, if the managing agent of a unit with 200 employees participated in an offense, three points would be added under subsection (b)(3); if that organization had 1,000 employees and the managing agent of the unit with 200 employees were also within high-level personnel of the organization in its entirety, four points (rather than three) would be added under subsection\xa0(b)(2).</p><p>4. Pervasiveness under subsection (b) will be case specific and depend on the number, and degree of responsibility, of individuals within substantial authority personnel who participated in, condoned, or were willfully ignorant of the offense. Fewer individuals need to be involved for a finding of pervasiveness if those individuals exercised a relatively high degree of authority. Pervasiveness can occur either within an organization as a whole or within a unit of an organization. For example, if an offense were committed in an organization with 1,000 employees but the tolerance of the offense was pervasive only within a unit of the organization with 200 employees (and no high-level personnel of the organization participated in, condoned, or was willfully ignorant of the offense), three points would be added under subsection (b)(3). If, in the same organization, tolerance of the offense was pervasive throughout the organization as a whole, or an individual within high-level personnel of the organization participated in the offense, four points (rather than three) would be added under subsection (b)(2).</p><p>5. A \u201c<em><strong>separately managed line of business</strong></em>,\u201d as used in subsections (c) and (d), is a subpart of a for-profit organization that has its own management, has a high degree of autonomy from higher managerial authority, and maintains its own separate books of account. Corporate subsidiaries and divisions frequently are separately managed lines of business. Under subsection (c), in determining the prior history of an organization with separately managed lines of business, only the prior conduct or criminal record of the separately managed line of business involved in the instant offense is to be used. Under subsection (d), in the context of an organization with separately managed lines of business, in making the determination whether a violation of a condition of probation involved engaging in similar misconduct, only the prior misconduct of the separately managed line of business involved in the instant offense is to be considered.</p><p>6. Under subsection (c), in determining the prior history of an organization or separately managed line of business, the conduct of the underlying economic entity shall be considered without regard to its legal structure or ownership. For example, if two companies merged and became separate divisions and separately managed lines of business within the merged company, each division would retain the prior history of its predecessor company. If a company reorganized and became a new legal entity, the new company would retain the prior history of the predecessor company. In contrast, if one company purchased the physical assets but not the ongoing business of another company, the prior history of the company selling the physical assets would not be transferred to the company purchasing the assets. However, if an organization is acquired by another organization in response to solicitations by appropriate federal government officials, the prior history of the acquired organization shall not be attributed to the acquiring organization.</p><p>7. Under subsections (c)(1)(B) and (c)(2)(B), the civil or administrative adjudication(s) must have occurred within the specified period (ten or five years) of the instant offense.</p><p>8. Adjust the culpability score for the factors listed in subsection (e) whether or not the offense guideline incorporates that factor, or that factor is inherent in the offense.</p><p>9. Subsection (e) applies where the obstruction is committed on behalf of the organization; it does not apply where an individual or individuals have attempted to conceal their misconduct from the organization. The Commentary to \xa73C1.1 (Obstructing or Impeding the Administration of Justice) provides guidance regarding the types of conduct that constitute obstruction.</p><p>10. Subsection (f)(2) contemplates that the organization will be allowed a reasonable period of time to conduct an internal investigation. In addition, no reporting is required by subsection (f)(2) or (f)(3)(C)(iii) if the organization reasonably concluded, based on the information then available, that no offense had been committed.</p><p>11. For purposes of subsection (f)(3)(C)(i), an individual has \u201c<em><strong>direct reporting obligations</strong></em>\u201d to the governing authority or an appropriate subgroup thereof if the individual has express authority to communicate personally to the governing authority or appropriate subgroup thereof (A) promptly on any matter involving criminal conduct or potential criminal conduct, and (B) no less than annually on the implementation and effectiveness of the compliance and ethics program.</p><p>12. \u201c<em><strong>Appropriate governmental authorities</strong></em>,\u201d as used in subsections (f) and (g)(1), means the federal or state law enforcement, regulatory, or program officials having jurisdiction over such matter. To qualify for a reduction under subsection (g)(1), the report to appropriate governmental authorities must be made under the direction of the organization.</p><p>13. To qualify for a reduction under subsection (g)(1) or (g)(2), cooperation must be both timely and thorough. To be timely, the cooperation must begin essentially at the same time as the organization is officially notified of a criminal investigation. To be thorough, the cooperation should include the disclosure of all pertinent information known by the organization. A prime test of whether the organization has disclosed all pertinent information is whether the information is sufficient for law enforcement personnel to identify the nature and extent of the offense and the individual(s) responsible for the criminal conduct. However, the cooperation to be measured is the cooperation of the organization itself, not the cooperation of individuals within the organization. If, because of the lack of cooperation of particular individual(s), neither the organization nor law enforcement personnel are able to identify the culpable individual(s) within the organization despite the organization\u2019s efforts to cooperate fully, the organization may still be given credit for full cooperation.</p><p>14. Entry of a plea of guilty prior to the commencement of trial combined with truthful admission of involvement in the offense and related conduct ordinarily will constitute significant evidence of affirmative acceptance of responsibility under subsection (g), unless outweighed by conduct of the organization that is inconsistent with such acceptance of responsibility. This adjustment is not intended to apply to an organization that puts the government to its burden of proof at trial by denying the essential factual elements of guilt, is convicted, and only then admits guilt and expresses remorse. Conviction by trial, however, does not automatically preclude an organization from consideration for such a reduction. In rare situations, an organization may clearly demonstrate an acceptance of responsibility for its criminal conduct even though it exercises its constitutional right to a trial. This may occur, for example, where an organization goes to trial to assert and preserve issues that do not relate to factual guilt (<em>e.g.</em>, to make a constitutional challenge to a statute or a challenge to the applicability of a statute to its conduct). In each such instance, however, a determination that an organization has accepted responsibility will be based primarily upon pretrial statements and conduct.</p><p>15. In making a determination with respect to subsection (g), the court may determine that the chief executive officer or highest ranking employee of an organization should appear at sentencing in order to signify that the organization has clearly demonstrated recognition and affirmative acceptance of responsibility.</p><p><strong>Background:</strong> The increased culpability scores under subsection (b) are based on three interrelated principles. First, an organization is more culpable when individuals who manage the organization or who have substantial discretion in acting for the organization participate in, condone, or are willfully ignorant of criminal conduct. Second, as organizations become larger and their managements become more professional, participation in, condonation of, or willful ignorance of criminal conduct by such management is increasingly a breach of trust or abuse of position. Third, as organizations increase in size, the risk of criminal conduct beyond that reflected in the instant offense also increases whenever management\u2019s tolerance of that offense is pervasive. Because of the continuum of sizes of organizations and professionalization of management, subsection (b) gradually increases the culpability score based upon the size of the organization and the level and extent of the substantial authority personnel involvement.</p><table><tbody><tr class='odd'><td><em>Historical Note</em></td><td>Effective November 1, 1991 (amendment 422).

Subsection (a)(2) provides that the court, in setting the fine within the guideline fine range, should consider the organization\u2019s role in the offense. This consideration is particularly appropriate if the guideline fine range does not take the organization\u2019s role in the offense into account. For example, the guideline fine range in an antitrust case does not take into consideration whether the organization was an organizer or leader of the conspiracy. A higher fine within the guideline fine range ordinarily will be appropriate for an organization that takes a leading role in such an offense.</p><p>2. Subsection (a)(3) provides that the court, in setting the fine within the guideline fine range, should consider any collateral consequences of conviction, including civil obligations arising from the organization\u2019s conduct. As a general rule, collateral consequences that merely make victims whole provide no basis for reducing the fine within the guideline range. If criminal and civil sanctions are unlikely to make victims whole, this may provide a basis for a higher fine within the guideline fine range. If punitive collateral sanctions have been or will be imposed on the organization, this may provide a basis for a lower fine within the guideline fine range.</p><p>3. Subsection (a)(4) provides that the court, in setting the fine within the guideline fine range, should consider any nonpecuniary loss caused or threatened by the offense. To the extent that nonpecuniary loss caused or threatened (<em>e.g.</em>, loss of or threat to human life; psychological injury; threat to national security) by the offense is not adequately considered in setting the guideline fine range, this factor provides a basis for a higher fine within the range. This factor is more likely to be applicable where the guideline fine range is determined by pecuniary loss or gain, rather than by offense level, because the Chapter Two offense levels frequently take actual or threatened nonpecuniary loss into account.</p><p>4. Subsection (a)(6) provides that the court, in setting the fine within the guideline fine range, should consider any prior criminal record of an individual within high-level personnel of the organization or within high-level personnel of a unit of the organization. Since an individual within high-level personnel either exercises substantial control over the organization or a unit of the organization or has a substantial role in the making of policy within the organization or a unit of the organization, any prior criminal misconduct of such an individual may be relevant to the determination of the appropriate fine for the organization.</p><p>5. Subsection (a)(7) provides that the court, in setting the fine within the guideline fine range, should consider any prior civil or criminal misconduct by the organization other than that counted under \xa78C2.5(c). The civil and criminal misconduct counted under \xa78C2.5(c) increases the guideline fine range. Civil or criminal misconduct other than that counted under \xa78C2.5(c) may provide a basis for a higher fine within the range. In a case involving a pattern of illegality, an upward departure may be warranted.</p><p>6. Subsection (a)(8) provides that the court, in setting the fine within the guideline fine range, should consider any culpability score higher than ten or lower than zero. As the culpability score increases above ten, this may provide a basis for a higher fine within the range. Similarly, as the culpability score decreases below zero, this may provide a basis for a lower fine within the range.</p><p>7. Under subsection (b), the court, in determining the fine within the range, may consider any factor that it considered in determining the range. This allows for courts to differentiate between cases that have the same offense level but differ in seriousness (<em>e.g.</em>, two fraud cases at offense level 12, one resulting in a loss of $21,000, the other $40,000). Similarly, this allows for courts to differentiate between two cases that have the same aggravating factors, but in which those factors vary in their intensity (<em>e.g.</em>, two cases with upward adjustments to the culpability score under \xa78C2.5(c)(2) (prior criminal adjudications within 5 years of the commencement of the instant offense, one involving a single conviction, the other involving two or more convictions)).</p><p><strong>Background:</strong> Subsection (a) includes factors that the court is required to consider under 18\xa0U.S.C. \xa7\xa7\xa03553(a) and 3572(a) as well as additional factors that the Commission has determined may be relevant in a particular case. A number of factors required for consideration under 18 U.S.C. \xa7\xa03572(a) (<em>e.g.</em>, pecuniary loss, the size of the organization) are used under the fine guidelines in this subpart to determine the fine range, and therefore are not specifically set out again in subsection (a) of this guideline.
