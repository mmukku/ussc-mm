<h3>INTRODUCTION, AUTHORITY, AND GENERAL APPLICATION PRINCIPLES</h3>
<h3>PART A ― INTRODUCTION AND AUTHORITY</h3>
<h5>Introductory Commentary</h5>
<p>Subparts 1 and 2 of this Part provide an introduction to the Guidelines Manual describing the historical development and evolution of the federal sentencing guidelines. Subpart 1 sets forth the original introduction to the Guidelines Manual as it first appeared in 1987, with the inclusion of amendments made occasionally thereto between 1987 and 2000. The original introduction, as so amended, explained a number of policy decisions made by the United States Sentencing Commission (“Commission”) when it promulgated the initial set of guidelines and therefore provides a useful reference for contextual and historical purposes. Subpart 2 further describes the evolution of the federal sentencing guidelines after the initial guidelines were promulgated. Subpart 3 of this Part states the authority of the Commission to promulgate federal sentencing guidelines, policy statements, and commentary.</p>
<h4>1. ORIGINAL INTRODUCTION TO THE GUIDELINES MANUAL</h4>
<p>The following provisions of this Subpart set forth the original introduction to this manual, effective November 1, 1987, and as amended through November 1, 2000:##### 1. Authority</p>
<p>The United States Sentencing Commission (“Commission”) is an independent agency in the judicial branch composed of seven voting and two non-voting, ex officio members. Its principal purpose is to establish sentencing policies and practices for the federal criminal justice system that will assure the ends of justice by promulgating detailed guidelines prescribing the appropriate sentencesfor offenders convicted of federal crimes.</p>
<p>The guidelines and policy statements promulgated by the Commission are issued pursuant to Section 994(a) of Title 28, United States Code.</p>
<h5>2. The Statutory Mission</h5>
<p>The Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 (Title II of the Comprehensive CrimeControl Act of 1984) provides for the development of guidelines that will further the basic purposes of criminal punishment: deterrence, incapacitation, just punishment, and rehabilitation. The Act delegates broad authority to the Commission to review and rationalize the federal sentencing process.</p>
<p>The Act contains detailed instructions as to how this determination shouldbe made, the most important of which directs the Commission to create categories of offense behavior and offender characteristics. An offense behavior category might consist, for example, of “bank robbery/committed with a gun/$2500taken.” An offender characteristic category might be “offender with one prior conviction not resulting in imprisonment.” The Commission is required to prescribeguideline ranges that specify an appropriate sentence for each class of convictedpersons determined by coordinating the offense behavior categories with the offender characteristic categories. Where the guidelines call for imprisonment, the range must be narrow: the maximum of the range cannot exceed the minimumby more than the greater of 25 percent or six months. 28 U.S.C. § 994(b)(2).</p>
<p>Pursuant to the Act, the sentencing court must select a sentence from within the guideline range. If, however, a particular case presents atypical features, the Act allows the court to depart from the guidelines and sentence outside the prescribed range. In that case, the court must specify reasons for departure.</p>
<p>18 U.S.C. § 3553(b). If the court sentences within the guideline range, an appellate court may review the sentence to determine whether the guidelines werecorrectly applied. If the court departs from the guideline range, an appellatecourt may review the reasonableness of the departure. 18 U.S.C. § 3742. The Actalso abolishes parole, and substantially reduces and restructures good behavioradjustments.</p>
<p>The Commission’s initial guidelines were submitted to Congress onApril 13, 1987. After the prescribed period of Congressional review, the guidelines took effect on November 1, 1987, and apply to all offenses committed on orafter that date. The Commission has the authority to submit guideline amendments each year to Congress between the beginning of a regular Congressionalsession and May 1. Such amendments automatically take effect 180 days aftersubmission unless a law is enacted to the contrary. 28 U.S.C. § 994§.</p>
<p>The initial sentencing guidelines and policy statements were developed after extensive hearings, deliberation, and consideration of substantial public comment. The Commission emphasizes, however, that it views the guideline-writingprocess as evolutionary. It expects, and the governing statute anticipates, thatcontinuing research, experience, and analysis will result in modifications and revisions to the guidelines through submission of amendments to Congress. Tothis end, the Commission is established as a permanent agency to monitor sentencing practices in the federal courts.</p>
<h5>3. The Basic Approach (Policy Statement)</h5>
<p>To understand the guidelines and their underlying rationale, it is importantto focus on the three objectives that Congress sought to achieve in enacting the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984. The Act’s basic objective was to enhance the ability of the criminal justice system to combat crime through an effective, fair sentencing system. To achieve this end, Congress first sought honesty in sentencing.</p>
<p>It sought to avoid the confusion and implicit deception that arose out of the preguidelines sentencing system which required the court to impose an indeterminate sentence of imprisonment and empowered the parole commission to determine how much of the sentence an offender actually would serve in prison. This practice usually resulted in a substantial reduction in the effective length of the sentence imposed, with defendants often serving only about one-third of the sentence imposed by the court.</p>
<p>Second, Congress sought reasonable uniformity in sentencing by narrowing the wide disparity in sentences imposed for similar criminal offenses committedby similar offenders. Third, Congress sought proportionality in sentencingthrough a system that imposes appropriately different sentences for criminal conduct of differing severity.</p>
<p>Honesty is easy to achieve: the abolition of parole makes the sentence imposed by the court the sentence the offender will serve, less approximately fifteenpercent for good behavior. There is a tension, however, between the mandate of uniformity and the mandate of proportionality. Simple uniformity — sentencingevery offender to five years — destroys proportionality. Having only a few simplecategories of crimes would make the guidelines uniform and easy to administer, but might lump together offenses that are different in important respects. Forexample, a single category for robbery that included armed and unarmed robberies, robberies with and without injuries, robberies of a few dollars and robberies of millions, would be far too broad.</p>
<p>A sentencing system tailored to fit every conceivable wrinkle of each casewould quickly become unworkable and seriously compromise the certainty of punishment and its deterrent effect. For example: a bank robber with (or without) a gun, which the robber kept hidden (or brandished), might have frightened(or merely warned), injured seriously (or less seriously), tied up (or simplypushed) a guard, teller, or customer, at night (or at noon), in an effort to obtainmoney for other crimes (or for other purposes), in the company of a few (or many)other robbers, for the first (or fourth) time.</p>
<p>The list of potentially relevant features of criminal behavior is long; the factthat they can occur in multiple combinations means that the list of possible permutations of factors is virtually endless. The appropriate relationships among these different factors are exceedingly difficult to establish, for they are oftencontext specific. Sentencing courts do not treat the occurrence of a simple bruiseidentically in all cases, irrespective of whether that bruise occurred in the contextof a bank robbery or in the context of a breach of peace. This is so, in part, because the risk that such a harm will occur differs depending on the underlying offensewith which it is connected; and also because, in part, the relationship betweenpunishment and multiple harms is not simply additive. The relation varies depending on how much other harm has occurred. Thus, it would not be proper toassign points for each kind of harm and simply add them up, irrespective of context and total amounts.</p>
<p>The larger the number of subcategories of offense and offender characteristics included in the guidelines, the greater the complexity and the less workable the system. Moreover, complex combinations of offense and offender characteristics would apply and interact in unforeseen ways to unforeseen situations, thusfailing to cure the unfairness of a simple, broad category system. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, probation officers and courts, in applying a complexsystem having numerous subcategories, would be required to make a host of decisions regarding whether the underlying facts were sufficient to bring the casewithin a particular subcategory. The greater the number of decisions requiredand the greater their complexity, the greater the risk that different courts wouldapply the guidelines differently to situations that, in fact, are similar, therebyreintroducing the very disparity that the guidelines were designed to reduce.</p>
<p>In view of the arguments, it would have been tempting to retreat to the simple, broad category approach and to grant courts the discretion to select the proper point along a broad sentencing range. Granting such broad discretion, however, would have risked correspondingly broad disparity in sentencing, for different courts may exercise their discretionary powers in different ways. Suchan approach would have risked a return to the wide disparity that Congress established the Commission to reduce and would have been contrary to the Commission’s mandate set forth in the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984.</p>
<p>In the end, there was no completely satisfying solution to this problem. TheCommission had to balance the comparative virtues and vices of broad, simplecategorization and detailed, complex subcategorization, and within the constraints established by that balance, minimize the discretionary powers of the sentencing court. Any system will, to a degree, enjoy the benefits and suffer from the drawbacks of each approach.</p>
<p>A philosophical problem arose when the Commission attempted to reconcile the differing perceptions of the purposes of criminal punishment. Most observersof the criminal law agree that the ultimate aim of the law itself, and of punishment in particular, is the control of crime. Beyond this point, however, the consensus seems to break down. Some argue that appropriate punishment shouldbe defined primarily on the basis of the principle of “just deserts.” Under this principle, punishment should be scaled to the offender’s culpability and the resulting harms. Others argue that punishment should be imposed primarily on the basis of practical “crime control” considerations. This theory calls for sentences that most effectively lessen the likelihood of future crime, either by deterring others or incapacitating the defendant.</p>
<p>Adherents of each of these points of view urged the Commission to choosebetween them and accord one primacy over the other. As a practical matter, however, this choice was unnecessary because in most sentencing decisions the application of either philosophy will produce the same or similar results.</p>
<p>In its initial set of guidelines, the Commission sought to solve both the practical and philosophical problems of developing a coherent sentencing system bytaking an empirical approach that used as a starting point data estimating preguidelines sentencing practice. It analyzed data drawn from 10,000 presentenceinvestigations, the differing elements of various crimes as distinguished in substantive criminal statutes, the United States Parole Commission’s guidelinesand statistics, and data from other relevant sources in order to determine whichdistinctions were important in pre-guidelines practice. After consideration, the Commission accepted, modified, or rationalized these distinctions.</p>
<p>This empirical approach helped the Commission resolve its practical problem by defining a list of relevant distinctions that, although of considerablelength, was short enough to create a manageable set of guidelines. Existing categories are relatively broad and omit distinctions that some may believe important, yet they include most of the major distinctions that statutes and data suggest made a significant difference in sentencing decisions. Relevant distinctions not reflected in the guidelines probably will occur rarely and sentencingcourts may take such unusual cases into account by departing from the guidelines.</p>
<p>The Commission’s empirical approach also helped resolve its philosophicaldilemma. Those who adhere to a just deserts philosophy may concede that the lack of consensus might make it difficult to say exactly what punishment is deserved for a particular crime. Likewise, those who subscribe to a philosophy of crime control may acknowledge that the lack of sufficient data might make itdifficult to determine exactly the punishment that will best prevent that crime.</p>
<p>Both groups might therefore recognize the wisdom of looking to those distinctionsthat judges and legislators have, in fact, made over the course of time. These established distinctions are ones that the community believes, or has found overtime, to be important from either a just deserts or crime control perspective.</p>
<p>The Commission did not simply copy estimates of pre-guidelines practice asrevealed by the data, even though establishing offense values on this basis wouldhelp eliminate disparity because the data represent averages. Rather, it departedfrom the data at different points for various important reasons. Congressionalstatutes, for example, suggested or required departure, as in the case of the AntiDrug Abuse Act of 1986 that imposed increased and mandatory minimum sentences. In addition, the data revealed inconsistencies in treatment, such as punishing economic crime less severely than other apparently equivalent behavior.</p>
<p>Despite these policy-oriented departures from pre-guidelines practice, the guidelines represent an approach that begins with, and builds upon, empiricaldata. The guidelines will not please those who wish the Commission to adopt a single philosophical theory and then work deductively to establish a simple and perfect set of categorizations and distinctions. The guidelines may prove acceptable, however, to those who seek more modest, incremental improvements in the status quo, who believe the best is often the enemy of the good, and who recognizethat these guidelines are, as the Act contemplates, but the first step in an evolutionary process. After spending considerable time and resources exploring alternative approaches, the Commission developed these guidelines as a practical effort toward the achievement of a more honest, uniform, equitable, proportional, and therefore effective sentencing system.</p>
<h5>4. The Guidelines’ Resolution of Major Issues (Policy Statement)</h5>
<p>The guideline-drafting process required the Commission to resolve a host of important policy questions typically involving rather evenly balanced sets of competing considerations. As an aid to understanding the guidelines, this introduction briefly discusses several of those issues; commentary in the guidelines explains others.</p>
<h6>(a) Real Offense vs. Charge Offense Sentencing.</h6>
<p>One of the most important questions for the Commission to decide was whether to base sentences upon the actual conduct in which the defendant engaged regardless of the charges for which he was indicted or convicted (“real offense” sentencing), or upon the conduct that constitutes the elements of the offense for which the defendant was charged and of which he was convicted(“charge offense” sentencing). A bank robber, for example, might have used a gun, frightened bystanders, taken $50,000, injured a teller, refused to stop when ordered, and raced away damaging property during his escape. A pure real offense system would sentence on the basis of all identifiable conduct. A pure charge offense system would overlook some of the harms that did not constitute statutory elements of the offenses of which the defendant was convicted.</p>
<p>The Commission initially sought to develop a pure real offense system. Afterall, the pre-guidelines sentencing system was, in a sense, this type of system. Thesentencing court and the parole commission took account of the conduct in which the defendant actually engaged, as determined in a presentence report, at the sentencing hearing, or before a parole commission hearing officer. The Commission’s initial efforts in this direction, carried out in the spring and early summerof 1986, proved unproductive, mostly for practical reasons. To make such a system work, even to formalize and rationalize the status quo, would have required the Commission to decide precisely which harms to take into account, how to add them up, and what kinds of procedures the courts should use to determine the presence or absence of disputed factual elements. The Commission found no practical way to combine and account for the large number of diverse harms arisingin different circumstances; nor did it find a practical way to reconcile the needfor a fair adjudicatory procedure with the need for a speedy sentencing processgiven the potential existence of hosts of adjudicated “real harm” facts in manytypical cases. The effort proposed as a solution to these problems required the use of, for example, quadratic roots and other mathematical operations that the Commission considered too complex to be workable. In the Commission’s view, such a system risked return to wide disparity in sentencing practice.</p>
<p>In its initial set of guidelines submitted to Congress in April 1987, the Commission moved closer to a charge offense system. This system, however, does contain a significant number of real offense elements. For one thing, the hundredsof overlapping and duplicative statutory provisions that make up the federal criminal law forced the Commission to write guidelines that are descriptive of generic conduct rather than guidelines that track purely statutory language. Foranother, the guidelines take account of a number of important, commonly occurring real offense elements such as role in the offense, the presence of a gun, or the amount of money actually taken, through alternative base offense levels, specific offense characteristics, cross references, and adjustments.</p>
<p>The Commission recognized that a charge offense system has drawbacks of its own. One of the most important is the potential it affords prosecutors to influence sentences by increasing or decreasing the number of counts in an indictment. Of course, the defendant’s actual conduct (that which the prosecutor canprove in court) imposes a natural limit upon the prosecutor’s ability to increasea defendant’s sentence. Moreover, the Commission has written its rules for the treatment of multicount convictions with an eye toward eliminating unfair treatment that might flow from count manipulation. For example, the guidelines treata three-count indictment, each count of which charges sale of 100 grams of heroinor theft of $10,000, the same as a single-count indictment charging sale of 300 grams of heroin or theft of $30,000. Furthermore, a sentencing court maycontrol any inappropriate manipulation of the indictment through use of its departure power. Finally, the Commission will closely monitor charging and plea agreement practices and will make appropriate adjustments should they becomenecessary.</p>
<h6>(b) Departures.</h6>
<p>The sentencing statute permits a court to depart from a guideline-specifiedsentence only when it finds “an aggravating or mitigating circumstance of a kind, or to a degree, not adequately taken into consideration by the Sentencing Commission in formulating the guidelines that should result in a sentence differentfrom that described.” 18 U.S.C. § 3553(b). The Commission intends the sentencing courts to treat each guideline as carving out a “heartland,” a set of typicalcases embodying the conduct that each guideline describes. When a court findsan atypical case, one to which a particular guideline linguistically applies butwhere conduct significantly differs from the norm, the court may considerwhether a departure is warranted. Section 5H1.10 (Race, Sex, National Origin, Creed, Religion, and Socio-Economic Status), §5H1.12 (Lack of Guidance as a Youth and Similar Circumstances), the third sentence of §5H1.4 (Physical Condition, Including Drug or Alcohol Dependence or Abuse), the last sentence of §5K2.12 (Coercion and Duress), and §5K2.19 (Post-Sentencing Rehabilitative Efforts) list several factors that the court cannot take into account as grounds for departure. With those specific exceptions, however, the Commission does not intend to limit the kinds of factors, whether or not mentioned anywhere else in the guidelines, that could constitute grounds for departure in an unusual case.</p>
<p>The Commission has adopted this departure policy for two reasons. First, itis difficult to prescribe a single set of guidelines that encompasses the vast rangeof human conduct potentially relevant to a sentencing decision. The Commissionalso recognizes that the initial set of guidelines need not do so. The Commissionis a permanent body, empowered by law to write and rewrite guidelines, with progressive changes, over many years. By monitoring when courts depart from the guidelines and by analyzing their stated reasons for doing so and court decisions with references thereto, the Commission, over time, will be able to refine the guidelines to specify more precisely when departures should and should not be permitted.</p>
<p>Second, the Commission believes that despite the courts’ legal freedom todepart from the guidelines, they will not do so very often. This is because the guidelines, offense by offense, seek to take account of those factors that the Commission’s data indicate made a significant difference in pre-guidelines sentencingpractice. Thus, for example, where the presence of physical injury made an important difference in pre-guidelines sentencing practice (as in the case of robberyor assault), the guidelines specifically include this factor to enhance the sentence.</p>
<p>Where the guidelines do not specify an augmentation or diminution, this is generally because the sentencing data did not permit the Commission to concludethat the factor was empirically important in relation to the particular offense. Ofcourse, an important factor (e.g., physical injury) may infrequently occur in connection with a particular crime (e.g., fraud). Such rare occurrences are precisely the type of events that the courts’ departure powers were designed to cover —unusual cases outside the range of the more typical offenses for which the guidelines were designed.</p>
<p>It is important to note that the guidelines refer to two different kinds of departure. The first involves instances in which the guidelines provide specificguidance for departure by analogy or by other numerical or non-numerical suggestions. The Commission intends such suggestions as policy guidance for the courts. The Commission expects that most departures will reflect the suggestionsand that the courts of appeals may prove more likely to find departures “unreasonable” where they fall outside suggested levels.</p>
<p>A second type of departure will remain unguided. It may rest upon groundsreferred to in Chapter Five, Part K (Departures) or on grounds not mentioned in the guidelines. While Chapter Five, Part K lists factors that the Commission believes may constitute grounds for departure, the list is not exhaustive. The Commission recognizes that there may be other grounds for departure that are not mentioned; it also believes there may be cases in which a departure outside suggested levels is warranted. In its view, however, such cases will be highly infrequent.</p>
<h6>© Plea Agreements.</h6>
<p>Nearly ninety percent of all federal criminal cases involve guilty pleas and many of these cases involve some form of plea agreement. Some commentatorson early Commission guideline drafts urged the Commission not to attempt anymajor reforms of the plea agreement process on the grounds that any set of guidelines that threatened to change pre-guidelines practice radically also threatenedto make the federal system unmanageable. Others argued that guidelines thatfailed to control and limit plea agreements would leave untouched a “loophole”large enough to undo the good that sentencing guidelines would bring.</p>
<p>The Commission decided not to make major changes in plea agreementpractices in the initial guidelines, but rather to provide guidance by issuing general policy statements concerning the acceptance of plea agreements in ChapterSix, Part B (Plea Agreements). The rules set forth in Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(e) govern the acceptance or rejection of such agreements. The Commission will collect data on the courts’ plea practices and will analyze this information to determine whenand why the courts accept or reject plea agreements and whether plea agreementpractices are undermining the intent of the Sentencing Reform Act. In light of this information and analysis, the Commission will seek to further regulate the plea agreement process as appropriate. Importantly, if the policy statements relating to plea agreements are followed, circumvention of the Sentencing ReformAct and the guidelines should not occur.</p>
<p>The Commission expects the guidelines to have a positive, rationalizing impact upon plea agreements for two reasons. First, the guidelines create a clear, definite expectation in respect to the sentence that a court will impose if a trialtakes place. In the event a prosecutor and defense attorney explore the possibilityof a negotiated plea, they will no longer work in the dark. This fact alone shouldhelp to reduce irrationality in respect to actual sentencing outcomes. Second, the guidelines create a norm to which courts will likely refer when they decidewhether, under Rule 11(e), to accept or to reject a plea agreement or recommendation.</p>
<h6>(d) Probation and Split Sentences.</h6>
<p>The statute provides that the guidelines are to “reflect the general appropriateness of imposing a sentence other than imprisonment in cases in which the defendant is a first offender who has not been convicted of a crime of violence oran otherwise serious offense . . . .” 28 U.S.C. § 994(j). Under pre-guidelines sentencing practice, courts sentenced to probation an inappropriately high percentage of offenders guilty of certain economic crimes, such as theft, tax evasion, antitrust offenses, insider trading, fraud, and embezzlement, that in the Commission’s view are “serious.”The Commission’s solution to this problem has been to write guidelines thatclassify as serious many offenses for which probation previously was frequentlygiven and provide for at least a short period of imprisonment in such cases. TheCommission concluded that the definite prospect of prison, even though the termmay be short, will serve as a significant deterrent, particularly when comparedwith pre-guidelines practice where probation, not prison, was the norm.</p>
<p>More specifically, the guidelines work as follows in respect to a first offender. For offense levels one through eight, the sentencing court may elect tosentence the offender to probation (with or without confinement conditions) or toa prison term. For offense levels nine and ten, the court may substitute probationfor a prison term, but the probation must include confinement conditions (community confinement, intermittent confinement, or home detention). For offenselevels eleven and twelve, the court must impose at least one-half the minimumconfinement sentence in the form of prison confinement, the remainder to beserved on supervised release with a condition of community confinement or homedetention. The Commission, of course, has not dealt with the single acts of aberrant behavior that still may justify probation at higher offense levels throughdepartures.**Note: Although the Commission had not addressed “single acts of aberrant behavior” at the time the Introduction to the Guidelines Manual originally was written, it subsequently addressed the issue in Amendment603, effective November 1, 2000. (See Supplement to Appendix C, amendment 603.)###### (e) Multi-Count Convictions.</p>
<p>The Commission, like several state sentencing commissions, has found itparticularly difficult to develop guidelines for sentencing defendants convicted of multiple violations of law, each of which makes up a separate count in an indictment. The difficulty is that when a defendant engages in conduct that causesseveral harms, each additional harm, even if it increases the extent to whichpunishment is warranted, does not necessarily warrant a proportionate increasein punishment. A defendant who assaults others during a fight, for example, maywarrant more punishment if he injures ten people than if he injures one, but his conduct does not necessarily warrant ten times the punishment. If it did, manyof the simplest offenses, for reasons that are often fortuitous, would lead to sentences of life imprisonment — sentences that neither just deserts nor crime control theories of punishment would justify.</p>
<p>Several individual guidelines provide special instructions for increasingpunishment when the conduct that is the subject of that count involves multipleoccurrences or has caused several harms. The guidelines also provide generalrules for aggravating punishment in light of multiple harms charged separatelyin separate counts. These rules may produce occasional anomalies, but normally they will permit an appropriate degree of aggravation of punishment for multipleoffenses that are the subjects of separate counts.</p>
<p>These rules are set out in Chapter Three, Part D (Multiple Counts). Theyessentially provide: (1) when the conduct involves fungible items (e.g., separatedrug transactions or thefts of money), the amounts are added and the guidelinesapply to the total amount; (2) when nonfungible harms are involved, the offenselevel for the most serious count is increased (according to a diminishing scale) toreflect the existence of other counts of conviction. The guidelines have been written in order to minimize the possibility that an arbitrary casting of a single transaction into several counts will produce a longer sentence. In addition, the sentencing court will have adequate power to prevent such a result through departures.</p>
<h6>(f) Regulatory Offenses.</h6>
<p>Regulatory statutes, though primarily civil in nature, sometimes containcriminal provisions in respect to particularly harmful activity. Such criminal provisions often describe not only substantive offenses, but also more technical, administratively-related offenses such as failure to keep accurate records or to provide requested information. These statutes pose two problems: first, which criminal regulatory provisions should the Commission initially consider, and second, how should it treat technical or administratively-related criminal violations?In respect to the first problem, the Commission found that it could not comprehensively treat all regulatory violations in the initial set of guidelines. Thereare hundreds of such provisions scattered throughout the United States Code. Tofind all potential violations would involve examination of each individual federal regulation. Because of this practical difficulty, the Commission sought to determine, with the assistance of the Department of Justice and several regulatoryagencies, which criminal regulatory offenses were particularly important in lightof the need for enforcement of the general regulatory scheme. The Commissionaddressed these offenses in the initial guidelines.</p>
<p>In respect to the second problem, the Commission has developed a systemfor treating technical recordkeeping and reporting offenses that divides theminto four categories. First, in the simplest of cases, the offender may have failedto fill out a form intentionally, but without knowledge or intent that substantiveharm would likely follow. He might fail, for example, to keep an accurate recordof toxic substance transport, but that failure may not lead, nor be likely to lead, to the release or improper handling of any toxic substance. Second, the samefailure may be accompanied by a significant likelihood that substantive harmwill occur; it may make a release of a toxic substance more likely. Third, the samefailure may have led to substantive harm. Fourth, the failure may represent aneffort to conceal a substantive harm that has occurred.</p>
<p>The structure of a typical guideline for a regulatory offense provides a lowbase offense level (e.g., 6) aimed at the first type of recordkeeping or reportingoffense. Specific offense characteristics designed to reflect substantive harmsthat do occur in respect to some regulatory offenses, or that are likely to occur, increase the offense level. A specific offense characteristic also provides that a recordkeeping or reporting offense that conceals a substantive offense will have the same offense level as the substantive offense.</p>
<h6>(g) Sentencing Ranges.</h6>
<p>In determining the appropriate sentencing ranges for each offense, the Commission estimated the average sentences served within each category under the pre-guidelines sentencing system. It also examined the sentences specified infederal statutes, in the parole guidelines, and in other relevant, analogoussources. The Commission’s Supplementary Report on the Initial SentencingGuidelines (1987) contains a comparison between estimates of pre-guidelinessentencing practice and sentences under the guidelines.</p>
<p>While the Commission has not considered itself bound by pre-guidelinessentencing practice, it has not attempted to develop an entirely new system of sentencing on the basis of theory alone. Guideline sentences, in many instances, will approximate average pre-guidelines practice and adherence to the guidelineswill help to eliminate wide disparity. For example, where a high percentage of persons received probation under pre-guidelines practice, a guideline may include one or more specific offense characteristics in an effort to distinguish thosetypes of defendants who received probation from those who received more severesentences. In some instances, short sentences of incarceration for all offenders ina category have been substituted for a pre-guidelines sentencing practice of verywide variability in which some defendants received probation while others received several years in prison for the same offense. Moreover, inasmuch as thosewho pleaded guilty under pre-guidelines practice often received lesser sentences, the guidelines permit the court to impose lesser sentences on those defendantswho accept responsibility for their misconduct. For defendants who provide substantial assistance to the government in the investigation or prosecution of others, a downward departure may be warranted.</p>
<p>The Commission has also examined its sentencing ranges in light of theirlikely impact upon prison population. Specific legislation, such as the Anti-DrugAbuse Act of 1986 and the career offender provisions of the Sentencing ReformAct of 1984 (28 U.S.C. § 994(h)), required the Commission to promulgate guidelines that will lead to substantial prison population increases. These increaseswill occur irrespective of the guidelines. The guidelines themselves, insofar as they reflect policy decisions made by the Commission (rather than legislatedmandatory minimum or career offender sentences), are projected to lead to anincrease in prison population that computer models, produced by the Commission and the Bureau of Prisons in 1987, estimated at approximately 10 percentover a period of ten years.</p>
<h6>(h) The Sentencing Table.</h6>
<p>The Commission has established a sentencing table that for technical and practical reasons contains 43 levels. Each level in the table prescribes rangesthat overlap with the ranges in the preceding and succeeding levels. By overlapping the ranges, the table should discourage unnecessary litigation. Both prosecution and defense will realize that the difference between one level and anotherwill not necessarily make a difference in the sentence that the court imposes.</p>
<p>Thus, little purpose will be served in protracted litigation trying to determine, for example, whether $10,000 or $11,000 was obtained as a result of a fraud. At the same time, the levels work to increase a sentence proportionately. A changeof six levels roughly doubles the sentence irrespective of the level at which onestarts. The guidelines, in keeping with the statutory requirement that the maximum of any range cannot exceed the minimum by more than the greater of 25 percent or six months (28 U.S.C. § 994(b)(2)), permit courts to exercise the greatest permissible range of sentencing discretion. The table overlaps offenselevels meaningfully, works proportionately, and at the same time preserves the maximum degree of allowable discretion for the court within each level.</p>
<p>Similarly, many of the individual guidelines refer to tables that correlateamounts of money with offense levels. These tables often have many rather than a few levels. Again, the reason is to minimize the likelihood of unnecessary litigation. If a money table were to make only a few distinctions, each distinctionwould become more important and litigation over which category an offender fellwithin would become more likely. Where a table has many small monetary distinctions, it minimizes the likelihood of litigation because the precise amount of money involved is of considerably less importance.</p>
<h5>5. A Concluding Note</h5>
<p>The Commission emphasizes that it drafted the initial guidelines with considerable caution. It examined the many hundreds of criminal statutes in the United States Code. It began with those that were the basis for a significantnumber of prosecutions and sought to place them in a rational order. It developedadditional distinctions relevant to the application of these provisions and it applied sentencing ranges to each resulting category. In doing so, it relied upon preguidelines sentencing practice as revealed by its own statistical analyses basedon summary reports of some 40,000 convictions, a sample of 10,000 augmentedpresentence reports, the parole guidelines, and policy judgments.</p>
<p>The Commission recognizes that some will criticize this approach as overlycautious, as representing too little a departure from pre-guidelines sentencingpractice. Yet, it will cure wide disparity. The Commission is a permanent bodythat can amend the guidelines each year. Although the data available to it, likeall data, are imperfect, experience with the guidelines will lead to additional information and provide a firm empirical basis for consideration of revisions.</p>
<p>Finally, the guidelines will apply to more than 90 percent of all felony and Class A misdemeanor cases in the federal courts. Because of time constraints and the nonexistence of statistical information, some offenses that occur infrequentlyare not considered in the guidelines. Their exclusion does not reflect any judgment regarding their seriousness and they will be addressed as the Commissionrefines the guidelines over time.</p>
<h4>2. CONTINUING EVOLUTION AND ROLE OF THE GUIDELINES</h4>
<p>The Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 changed the course of federal sentencing.</p>
<p>Among other things, the Act created the United States Sentencing Commission as anindependent agency in the Judicial Branch, and directed it to develop guidelines and policy statements for sentencing courts to use when sentencing offenders convicted of federal crimes. Moreover, it empowered the Commission with ongoing responsibilitiesto monitor the guidelines, submit to Congress appropriate modifications of the guidelines and recommended changes in criminal statutes, and establish education and research programs. The mandate rested on congressional awareness that sentencing is a dynamic field that requires continuing review by an expert body to revise sentencingpolicies, in light of application experience, as new criminal statutes are enacted, and as more is learned about what motivates and controls criminal behavior.</p>
<p>This statement finds resonance in a line of Supreme Court cases that, taken together, echo two themes. The first theme is that the guidelines are the product of a deliberative process that seeks to embody the purposes of sentencing set forth in the Sentencing Reform Act, and as such they continue to play an important role in the sentencing court’s determination of an appropriate sentence in a particular case. TheSupreme Court alluded to this in Mistretta v. United States, 488 U.S. 361 (1989), which upheld the constitutionality of both the federal sentencing guidelines and the Commission against nondelegation and separation of powers challenges. Therein the Court stated:Developing proportionate penalties for hundreds of different crimes by a virtually limitless array of offenders is precisely the sort of intricate, laborintensive task for which delegation to an expert body is especially appropriate. Although Congress has delegated significant discretion to the Commission to draw judgments from its analysis of existing sentencing practice and alternative sentencing models, . . . [w]e have no doubt that in the hands of the Commission “the criteria which Congress has supplied are wholly adequate for carrying out the general policy and purpose” of the Act.</p>
<p>Id. at 379 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>
<p>The continuing importance of the guidelines in federal sentencing was furtheracknowledged by the Court in United States v. Booker, 543 U.S. 220 (2005), even asthat case rendered the guidelines advisory in nature. In Booker, the Court held that the imposition of an enhanced sentence under the federal sentencing guidelines basedon the sentencing judge’s determination of a fact (other than a prior conviction) thatwas not found by the jury or admitted by the defendant violated the Sixth Amendment. The Court reasoned that an advisory guideline system, while lacking the mandatory features that Congress enacted, retains other features that help to further congressional objectives, including providing certainty and fairness in meeting the purposes of sentencing, avoiding unwarranted sentencing disparities, and maintainingsufficient flexibility to permit individualized sentences when warranted. The Courtconcluded that an advisory guideline system would “continue to move sentencing inCongress’ preferred direction, helping to avoid excessive sentencing disparities whilemaintaining flexibility sufficient to individualize sentences where necessary.” Id. at264–65. An advisory guideline system continues to assure transparency by requiringthat sentences be based on articulated reasons stated in open court that are subjectto appellate review. An advisory guideline system also continues to promote certaintyand predictability in sentencing, thereby enabling the parties to better anticipate the likely sentence based on the individualized facts of the case.</p>
<p>The continuing importance of the guidelines in the sentencing determination is predicated in large part on the Sentencing Reform Act’s intent that, in promulgatingguidelines, the Commission must take into account the purposes of sentencing as setforth in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a). See 28 U.S.C. §§ 994(f), 991(b)(1). The Supreme Courtreinforced this view in Rita v. United States, 551 U.S. 338 (2007), which held that a court of appeals may apply a presumption of reasonableness to a sentence imposed bya district court within a properly calculated guideline range without violating the Sixth Amendment. In Rita, the Court relied heavily on the complementary roles of the Commission and the sentencing court in federal sentencing, stating:[T]he presumption reflects the nature of the Guidelines-writing task thatCongress set for the Commission and the manner in which the Commissioncarried out that task. In instructing both the sentencing judge and the Commission what to do, Congress referred to the basic sentencing objectives that the statute sets forth in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a) . . . . The provision also tells the sentencing judge to “impose a sentence sufficient, but not greater than necessary, to comply with” the basic aims of sentencing as set out above. Congressional statutes then tell the Commission to write Guidelines that willcarry out these same § 3553(a) objectives.</p>
<p>Id. at 347–48 (emphasis in original). The Court concluded that “[t]he upshot is that the sentencing statutes envision both the sentencing judge and the Commission ascarrying out the same basic § 3553(a) objectives, the one, at retail, the other at wholesale[,]” id. at 348, and that the Commission’s process for promulgating guidelines results in “a set of Guidelines that seek to embody the § 3553(a) considerations, both inprinciple and in practice.” Id. at 350.</p>
<p>Consequently, district courts are required to properly calculate and consider the guidelines when sentencing, even in an advisory guideline system. See 18 U.S.C.</p>
<p>§ 3553(a)(4), (a)(5); Booker, 543 U.S. at 264 (“The district courts, while not bound toapply the Guidelines, must . . . take them into account when sentencing.”); Rita, 551 U.S. at 351 (stating that a district court should begin all sentencing proceedingsby correctly calculating the applicable Guidelines range); Gall v. United States, 552 U.S. 38, 49 (2007) (“As a matter of administration and to secure nationwide consistency, the Guidelines should be the starting point and the initial benchmark.”). Thedistrict court, in determining the appropriate sentence in a particular case, therefore, must consider the properly calculated guideline range, the grounds for departure provided in the policy statements, and then the factors under 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a).</p>
<p>See Rita, 551 U.S. at 351. The appellate court engages in a two-step process uponreview. The appellate court “first ensure[s] that the district court committed no significant procedural error, such as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range . . . [and] then consider[s] the substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed under an abuse-of-discretion standard[,] . . . tak[ing] into account the totality of the circumstances, including the extent of any variance from the Guidelinesrange.” Gall, 552 U.S. at 51.</p>
<p>The second and related theme resonant in this line of Supreme Court cases is that, as contemplated by the Sentencing Reform Act, the guidelines are evolutionaryin nature. They are the product of the Commission’s fulfillment of its statutory dutiesto monitor federal sentencing law and practices, to seek public input on the operationof the guidelines, and to revise the guidelines accordingly. As the Court acknowledgedin Rita:The Commission’s work is ongoing. The statutes and the Guidelines themselves foresee continuous evolution helped by the sentencing courts and courts of appeals in that process. The sentencing courts, applying the Guidelines in individual cases may depart (either pursuant to the Guidelines or, since Booker, by imposing a non-Guidelines sentence). The judges will setforth their reasons. The Courts of Appeals will determine the reasonableness of the resulting sentence. The Commission will collect and examine the results. In doing so, it may obtain advice from prosecutors, defenders, lawenforcement groups, civil liberties associations, experts in penology, and others. And it can revise the Guidelines accordingly.</p>
<p>Rita, 551 U.S. at 350; see also Booker, 543 U.S. at 264 (“[T]he Sentencing Commissionremains in place, writing Guidelines, collecting information about actual district courtsentencing decisions, undertaking research, and revising the Guidelines accordingly.”); Gall, 552 U.S. at 46 (“[E]ven though the Guidelines are advisory rather than mandatory, they are, as we pointed out in Rita, the product of careful study based onextensive empirical evidence derived from the review of thousands of individual sentencing decisions.”).</p>
<p>Provisions of the Sentencing Reform Act promote and facilitate this evolutionaryprocess. For example, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 994(x), the Commission publishesguideline amendment proposals in the Federal Register and conducts hearings to solicit input on those proposals from experts and other members of the public. Pursuantto 28 U.S.C. § 994(o), the Commission periodically reviews and revises the guidelinesin consideration of comments it receives from members of the federal criminal justicesystem, including the courts, probation officers, the Department of Justice, the Bureau of Prisons, defense attorneys and the federal public defenders, and in consideration of data it receives from sentencing courts and other sources. Statutory mechanisms such as these bolster the Commission’s ability to take into account fully the purposes of sentencing set forth in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(2) in its promulgation of the guidelines.</p>
<p>Congress retains authority to require certain sentencing practices and may exercise its authority through specific directives to the Commission with respect to the guidelines. As the Supreme Court noted in Kimbrough v. United States, 552 U.S. 85(2007), “Congress has shown that it knows how to direct sentencing practices in express terms. For example, Congress has specifically required the Sentencing Commission to set Guideline sentences for serious recidivist offenders ‘at or near’ the statutorymaximum.” Id. at 103; 28 U.S.C. § 994(h).</p>
<p>As envisioned by Congress, implemented by the Commission, and reaffirmed by the Supreme Court, the guidelines are the product of a deliberative and dynamic process that seeks to embody within federal sentencing policy the purposes of sentencingset forth in the Sentencing Reform Act. As such, the guidelines continue to be a keycomponent of federal sentencing and to play an important role in the sentencingcourt’s determination of an appropriate sentence in any particular case.</p>

<p>© The court shall then consider the applicable factors in 18 U.S.C.</p>
<p>§ 3553(a) taken as a whole. See 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a).</p>
<p>CommentaryApplication Notes:1. The following are definitions of terms that are used frequently in the guidelines and are of general applicability (except to the extent expressly modified in respect to a particularguideline or policy statement):(A) “Abducted” means that a victim was forced to accompany an offender to a differentlocation. For example, a bank robber’s forcing a bank teller from the bank into a getaway car would constitute an abduction.</p>
<p>(B) “Bodily injury” means any significant injury; e.g., an injury that is painful and obvious, or is of a type for which medical attention ordinarily would be sought.</p>
<p>© “Brandished” with reference to a dangerous weapon (including a firearm) meansthat all or part of the weapon was displayed, or the presence of the weapon wasotherwise made known to another person, in order to intimidate that person, regardless of whether the weapon was directly visible to that person. Accordingly, although the dangerous weapon does not have to be directly visible, the weaponmust be present.</p>
<p>(D) “Dangerous weapon” means (i) an instrument capable of inflicting death or serious bodily injury; or (ii) an object that is not an instrument capable of inflictingdeath or serious bodily injury but (I) closely resembles such an instrument; or(II) the defendant used the object in a manner that created the impression that the object was such an instrument (e.g. a defendant wrapped a hand in a towel duringa bank robbery to create the appearance of a gun).</p>
<p>(E) “Departure” means (i) for purposes other than those specified in subdivision (ii), imposition of a sentence outside the applicable guideline range or of a sentence thatis otherwise different from the guideline sentence; and (ii) for purposes of §4A1.3(Departures Based on Inadequacy of Criminal History Category), assignment of a criminal history category other than the otherwise applicable criminal history category, in order to effect a sentence outside the applicable guideline range. “Depart”means grant a departure.</p>
<p>“Downward departure” means departure that effects a sentence less than a sentence that could be imposed under the applicable guideline range or a sentence thatis otherwise less than the guideline sentence. “Depart downward” means grant a downward departure.</p>
<p>“Upward departure” means departure that effects a sentence greater than a sentence that could be imposed under the applicable guideline range or a sentence thatis otherwise greater than the guideline sentence. “Depart upward” means grantan upward departure.</p>
<p>§1B1.1(F) “Destructive device” means any article described in 26 U.S.C. § 5845(f) (includingan explosive, incendiary, or poison gas — (i) bomb, (ii) grenade, (iii) rocket havinga propellant charge of more than four ounces, (iv) missile having an explosive orincendiary charge of more than one-quarter ounce, (v) mine, or (vi) device similarto any of the devices described in the preceding clauses).</p>
<p>(G) “Firearm” means (i) any weapon (including a starter gun) which will or is designedto or may readily be converted to expel a projectile by the action of an explosive;(ii) the frame or receiver of any such weapon; (iii) any firearm muffler or silencer;or (iv) any destructive device. A weapon, commonly known as a “BB” or pellet gun, that uses air or carbon dioxide pressure to expel a projectile is a dangerous weaponbut not a firearm.</p>
<p>(H) “Offense” means the offense of conviction and all relevant conduct under §1B1.3(Relevant Conduct) unless a different meaning is specified or is otherwise clear from the context. The term “instant” is used in connection with “offense,” “federal offense,” or “offense of conviction,” as the case may be, to distinguish the violation for which the defendant is being sentenced from a prior or subsequent offense, or froman offense before another court (e.g., an offense before a state court involving the same underlying conduct).</p>
<p>(I) “Otherwise used” with reference to a dangerous weapon (including a firearm)means that the conduct did not amount to the discharge of a firearm but was morethan brandishing, displaying, or possessing a firearm or other dangerous weapon.</p>
<p>(J) “Permanent or life-threatening bodily injury” means injury involving a substantial risk of death; loss or substantial impairment of the function of a bodilymember, organ, or mental faculty that is likely to be permanent; or an obvious disfigurement that is likely to be permanent. In the case of a kidnapping, for example, maltreatment to a life-threatening degree (e.g., by denial of food or medical care)would constitute life-threatening bodily injury.</p>
<p>(K) “Physically restrained” means the forcible restraint of the victim such as by beingtied, bound, or locked up.</p>
<p>(L) “Serious bodily injury” means injury involving extreme physical pain or the protracted impairment of a function of a bodily member, organ, or mental faculty; orrequiring medical intervention such as surgery, hospitalization, or physical rehabilitation. In addition, “serious bodily injury” is deemed to have occurred if the offense involved conduct constituting criminal sexual abuse under 18 U.S.C. § 2241or § 2242 or any similar offense under state law.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Definitions of terms also may appear in other sections. Such definitions are not designedfor general applicability; therefore, their applicability to sections other than those expressly referenced must be determined on a case by case basis.</li>
</ol>
<p>The term “includes” is not exhaustive; the term “e.g.” is merely illustrative.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><p>The list of “Statutory Provisions” in the Commentary to each offense guideline does not necessarily include every statute covered by that guideline. In addition, some statutesmay be covered by more than one guideline.</p></li>
<li><p>(A) Cumulative Application of Multiple Adjustments within One Guideline.—The offense level adjustments from more than one specific offense characteristic§1B1.1within an offense guideline are applied cumulatively (added together) unless the guideline specifies that only the greater (or greatest) is to be used. Within eachspecific offense characteristic subsection, however, the offense level adjustmentsare alternative; only the one that best describes the conduct is to be used. For example, in §2A2.2(b)(3), pertaining to degree of bodily injury, the subdivision thatbest describes the level of bodily injury is used; the adjustments for different degrees of bodily injury (subdivisions (A) – (E)) are not added together.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>(B) Cumulative Application of Multiple Adjustments from Multiple Guidelines.—Absent an instruction to the contrary, enhancements under Chapter Two, adjustments under Chapter Three, and determinations under Chapter Four are tobe applied cumulatively. In some cases, such enhancements, adjustments, and determinations may be triggered by the same conduct. For example, shooting a policeofficer during the commission of a robbery may warrant an injury enhancementunder §2B3.1(b)(3) and an official victim adjustment under §3A1.2, even though the enhancement and the adjustment both are triggered by the shooting of the officer.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li><p>Where two or more guideline provisions appear equally applicable, but the guidelinesauthorize the application of only one such provision, use the provision that results in the greater offense level. E.g., in §2A2.2(b)(2), if a firearm is both discharged and brandished, the provision applicable to the discharge of the firearm would be used.</p></li>
<li><p>Use of Abbreviated Guideline Titles.—Whenever a guideline makes reference to another guideline, a parenthetical restatement of that other guideline’s heading accompanies the initial reference to that other guideline. This parenthetical is provided only for the convenience of the reader and is not intended to have substantive effect. In the caseof lengthy guideline headings, such a parenthetical restatement of the guideline headingmay be abbreviated for ease of reference. For example, references to §2B1.1 (Larceny, Embezzlement, and Other Forms of Theft; Offenses Involving Stolen Property; PropertyDamage or Destruction; Fraud and Deceit; Forgery; Offenses Involving Altered or Counterfeit Instruments Other than Counterfeit Bearer Obligations of the United States) maybe abbreviated as follows: §2B1.1 (Theft, Property Destruction, and Fraud).</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Background: The court must impose a sentence “sufficient, but not greater than necessary,”to comply with the purposes of sentencing set forth in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(2). See 18 U.S.C.</p>
<p>§ 3553(a). Subsections (a), (b), and © are structured to reflect the three-step process used indetermining the particular sentence to be imposed. If, after step ©, the court imposes a sentence that is outside the guidelines framework, such a sentence is considered a “variance”.</p>

<p>(d) A conviction on a count charging a conspiracy to commit more than one offense shall be treated as if the defendant had been convictedon a separate count of conspiracy for each offense that the defendantconspired to commit.</p>
<p>CommentaryApplication Notes:1. This section provides the basic rules for determining the guidelines applicable to the offense conduct under Chapter Two (Offense Conduct). The court is to use the Chapter Twoguideline section referenced in the Statutory Index (Appendix A) for the offense of conviction. However, (A) in the case of a plea agreement (written or made orally on the record) containing a stipulation that specifically establishes a more serious offense than the offense of conviction, the Chapter Two offense guideline section applicable to the stipulated offense is to be used; and (B) for statutory provisions not listed in the StatutoryIndex, the most analogous guideline, determined pursuant to §2X5.1 (Other Offenses), is to be used.</p>
<p>§1B1.2In the case of a particular statute that proscribes only a single type of criminal conduct, the offense of conviction and the conduct proscribed by the statute will coincide, and the Statutory Index will specify only one offense guideline for that offense of conviction. In the case of a particular statute that proscribes a variety of conduct that might constitute the subject of different offense guidelines, the Statutory Index may specify more than oneoffense guideline for that particular statute, and the court will determine which of the referenced guideline sections is most appropriate for the offense conduct charged in the count of which the defendant was convicted. If the offense involved a conspiracy, attempt, or solicitation, refer to §2X1.1 (Attempt, Solicitation, or Conspiracy) as well as the guideline referenced in the Statutory Index for the substantive offense. For statutory provisions not listed in the Statutory Index, the most analogous guideline is to be used.</p>
<p>See §2X5.1 (Other Offenses).</p>
<p>As set forth in the first paragraph of this note, an exception to this general rule is that ifa plea agreement (written or made orally on the record) contains a stipulation that establishes a more serious offense than the offense of conviction, the guideline section applicable to the stipulated offense is to be used. A factual statement or a stipulation contained in a plea agreement (written or made orally on the record) is a stipulation for purposes of subsection (a) only if both the defendant and the government explicitly agreethat the factual statement or stipulation is a stipulation for such purposes. However, a factual statement or stipulation made after the plea agreement has been entered, or afterany modification to the plea agreement has been made, is not a stipulation for purposesof subsection (a). The sentence that shall be imposed is limited, however, to the maximumauthorized by the statute under which the defendant is convicted. See Chapter Five, Part G (Implementing the Total Sentence of Imprisonment). For example, if the defendant pleads guilty to theft, but admits the elements of robbery as part of the plea agreement, the robbery guideline is to be applied. The sentence, however, may not exceed the maximum sentence for theft. See H. Rep. 98-1017, 98th Cong., 2d Sess. 99 (1984).</p>
<p>The exception to the general rule has a practical basis. In a case in which the elementsof an offense more serious than the offense of conviction are established by a plea agreement, it may unduly complicate the sentencing process if the applicable guideline doesnot reflect the seriousness of the defendant’s actual conduct. Without this exception, the court would be forced to use an artificial guideline and then depart from it to the degree the court found necessary based upon the more serious conduct established by the plea agreement. The probation officer would first be required to calculate the guideline for the offense of conviction. However, this guideline might even contain characteristics that are difficult to establish or not very important in the context of the actual offense conduct.</p>
<p>As a simple example, §2B1.1 (Theft, Property Destruction, and Fraud) contains monetarydistinctions which are more significant and more detailed than the monetary distinctionsin §2B3.1 (Robbery). Then, the probation officer might need to calculate the robberyguideline to assist the court in determining the appropriate degree of departure in a casein which the defendant pled guilty to theft but admitted committing robbery. This cumbersome, artificial procedure is avoided by using the exception rule in guilty or nolo contendere plea cases where it is applicable.</p>
<p>As with any plea agreement, the court must first determine that the agreement is acceptable, in accordance with the policies stated in Chapter Six, Part B (Plea Agreements).</p>
<p>The limited exception provided here applies only after the court has determined that a plea, otherwise fitting the exception, is acceptable.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><p>Section 1B1.2(b) directs the court, once it has determined the applicable guideline(i.e., the applicable guideline section from Chapter Two) under §1B1.2(a) to determine§1B1.3any applicable specific offense characteristics (under that guideline), and any other applicable sentencing factors pursuant to the relevant conduct definition in §1B1.3. Where there is more than one base offense level within a particular guideline, the determinationof the applicable base offense level is treated in the same manner as a determination of a specific offense characteristic. Accordingly, the “relevant conduct” criteria of §1B1.3 are to be used, unless conviction under a specific statute is expressly required.</p></li>
<li><p>Subsections © and (d) address circumstances in which the provisions of Chapter Three, Part D (Multiple Counts) are to be applied although there may be only one count of conviction. Subsection © provides that in the case of a stipulation to the commission of additional offense(s), the guidelines are to be applied as if the defendant had been convictedof an additional count for each of the offenses stipulated. For example, if the defendantis convicted of one count of robbery but, as part of a plea agreement, admits to havingcommitted two additional robberies, the guidelines are to be applied as if the defendanthad been convicted of three counts of robbery. Subsection (d) provides that a convictionon a conspiracy count charging conspiracy to commit more than one offense is treated asif the defendant had been convicted of a separate conspiracy count for each offense thathe conspired to commit. For example, where a conviction on a single count of conspiracyestablishes that the defendant conspired to commit three robberies, the guidelines are tobe applied as if the defendant had been convicted on one count of conspiracy to commit the first robbery, one count of conspiracy to commit the second robbery, and one count of conspiracy to commit the third robbery.</p></li>
<li><p>Particular care must be taken in applying subsection (d) because there are cases in which the verdict or plea does not establish which offense(s) was the object of the conspiracy. In such cases, subsection (d) should only be applied with respect to an object offense allegedin the conspiracy count if the court, were it sitting as a trier of fact, would convict the defendant of conspiring to commit that object offense. Note, however, if the object offensesspecified in the conspiracy count would be grouped together under §3D1.2(d) (e.g., a conspiracy to steal three government checks) it is not necessary to engage in the foregoinganalysis, because §1B1.3(a)(2) governs consideration of the defendant’s conduct.</p></li>

Unless otherwise specified, (i) the base offense level where the guideline specifies more than one base offense level, (ii) specific offensecharacteristics and (iii) cross references in Chapter Two, and (iv) adjustments in Chapter Three, shall be determined on the basis of the following:(1) (A) all acts and omissions committed, aided, abetted, counseled, commanded, induced, procured, or willfully causedby the defendant; and §1B1.3(B) in the case of a jointly undertaken criminal activity (a criminal plan, scheme, endeavor, or enterprise undertaken by the defendant in concert with others, whether ornot charged as a conspiracy), all acts and omissions of others that were—(i) within the scope of the jointly undertaken criminal activity, (ii) in furtherance of that criminal activity, and (iii) reasonably foreseeable in connection with that criminal activity;that occurred during the commission of the offense of conviction, in preparation for that offense, or in the course of attempting to avoid detection or responsibility for that offense;(2) solely with respect to offenses of a character for which§3D1.2(d) would require grouping of multiple counts, all actsand omissions described in subdivisions (1)(A) and (1)(B) abovethat were part of the same course of conduct or common schemeor plan as the offense of conviction;(3) all harm that resulted from the acts and omissions specified insubsections (a)(1) and (a)(2) above, and all harm that was the object of such acts and omissions; and (4) any other information specified in the applicable guideline.</p>
<p>(b) CHAPTERS FOUR (CRIMINAL HISTORY AND CRIMINAL LIVELIHOOD) ANDFIVE (DETERMINING THE SENTENCE). Factors in Chapters Four and Five that establish the guideline range shall be determined on the basis of the conduct and information specified in the respectiveguidelines.</p>
<p>CommentaryApplication Notes:1. Sentencing Accountability and Criminal Liability.—The principles and limits of sentencing accountability under this guideline are not always the same as the principlesand limits of criminal liability. Under subsections (a)(1) and (a)(2), the focus is on the specific acts and omissions for which the defendant is to be held accountable in determining the applicable guideline range, rather than on whether the defendant is criminallyliable for an offense as a principal, accomplice, or conspirator.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><p>Accountability Under More Than One Provision.—In certain cases, a defendantmay be accountable for particular conduct under more than one subsection of this guide§1B1.3line. If a defendant’s accountability for particular conduct is established under one provision of this guideline, it is not necessary to review alternative provisions under whichsuch accountability might be established.</p></li>
<li><p>Jointly Undertaken Criminal Activity (Subsection (a)(1)(B)).—(A) In General.—A “jointly undertaken criminal activity” is a criminal plan, scheme, endeavor, or enterprise undertaken by the defendant in concert with others, whether or not charged as a conspiracy.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>In the case of a jointly undertaken criminal activity, subsection (a)(1)(B) providesthat a defendant is accountable for the conduct (acts and omissions) of others thatwas:(i) within the scope of the jointly undertaken criminal activity;(ii) in furtherance of that criminal activity; and (iii) reasonably foreseeable in connection with that criminal activity.</p>
<p>The conduct of others that meets all three criteria set forth in subdivisions (i)through (iii) (i.e., “within the scope,” “in furtherance,” and “reasonably foreseeable”)is relevant conduct under this provision. However, when the conduct of others doesnot meet any one of the criteria set forth in subdivisions (i) through (iii), the conductis not relevant conduct under this provision.</p>
<p>(B) Scope.—Because a count may be worded broadly and include the conduct of manyparticipants over a period of time, the scope of the “jointly undertaken criminal activity” is not necessarily the same as the scope of the entire conspiracy, and hencerelevant conduct is not necessarily the same for every participant. In order to determine the defendant’s accountability for the conduct of others under subsection(a)(1)(B), the court must first determine the scope of the criminal activity the particular defendant agreed to jointly undertake (i.e., the scope of the specific conductand objectives embraced by the defendant’s agreement). In doing so, the court mayconsider any explicit agreement or implicit agreement fairly inferred from the conduct of the defendant and others. Accordingly, the accountability of the defendantfor the acts of others is limited by the scope of his or her agreement to jointly undertake the particular criminal activity. Acts of others that were not within the scope of the defendant’s agreement, even if those acts were known or reasonablyforeseeable to the defendant, are not relevant conduct under subsection (a)(1)(B).</p>
<p>In cases involving contraband (including controlled substances), the scope of the jointly undertaken criminal activity (and thus the accountability of the defendantfor the contraband that was the object of that jointly undertaken activity) may depend upon whether, in the particular circumstances, the nature of the offense is more appropriately viewed as one jointly undertaken criminal activity or as a number of separate criminal activities.</p>
<p>A defendant’s relevant conduct does not include the conduct of members of a conspiracy prior to the defendant joining the conspiracy, even if the defendant knowsof that conduct (e.g., in the case of a defendant who joins an ongoing drug distribution conspiracy knowing that it had been selling two kilograms of cocaine per week, the cocaine sold prior to the defendant joining the conspiracy is not included asrelevant conduct in determining the defendant’s offense level). The Commission§1B1.3does not foreclose the possibility that there may be some unusual set of circumstances in which the exclusion of such conduct may not adequately reflect the defendant’s culpability; in such a case, an upward departure may be warranted.</p>
<p>© In Furtherance.—The court must determine if the conduct (acts and omissions)of others was in furtherance of the jointly undertaken criminal activity.</p>
<p>(D) Reasonably Foreseeable.—The court must then determine if the conduct (actsand omissions) of others that was within the scope of, and in furtherance of, the jointly undertaken criminal activity was reasonably foreseeable in connection with that criminal activity.</p>
<p>Note that the criminal activity that the defendant agreed to jointly undertake, and the reasonably foreseeable conduct of others in furtherance of that criminal activity, are not necessarily identical. For example, two defendants agree to commit a robbery and, during the course of that robbery, the first defendant assaults and injuresa victim. The second defendant is accountable for the assault and injury to the victim (even if the second defendant had not agreed to the assault and had cautioned the first defendant to be careful not to hurt anyone) because the assaultive conductwas within the scope of the jointly undertaken criminal activity (the robbery), wasin furtherance of that criminal activity (the robbery), and was reasonably foreseeable in connection with that criminal activity (given the nature of the offense).</p>
<p>With respect to offenses involving contraband (including controlled substances), the defendant is accountable under subsection (a)(1)(A) for all quantities of contraband with which he was directly involved and, in the case of a jointly undertaken criminal activity under subsection (a)(1)(B), all quantities of contraband that were involvedin transactions carried out by other participants, if those transactions were within the scope of, and in furtherance of, the jointly undertaken criminal activity and were reasonably foreseeable in connection with that criminal activity.</p>
<p>The requirement of reasonable foreseeability applies only in respect to the conduct(i.e., acts and omissions) of others under subsection (a)(1)(B). It does not apply toconduct that the defendant personally undertakes, aids, abets, counsels, commands, induces, procures, or willfully causes; such conduct is addressed under subsection (a)(1)(A).</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Illustrations of Conduct for Which the Defendant is Accountable under Subsections (a)(1)(A) and (B).—(A) Acts and omissions aided or abetted by the defendant.—(i) Defendant A is one of ten persons hired by Defendant B to off-load a ship containing marihuana. The off-loading of the ship is interrupted by law enforcement officers and one ton of marihuana is seized (the amount on the ship aswell as the amount off-loaded). Defendant A and the other off-loaders are arrested and convicted of importation of marihuana. Regardless of the numberof bales he personally unloaded, Defendant A is accountable for the entire oneton quantity of marihuana. Defendant A aided and abetted the off-loading of the entire shipment of marihuana by directly participating in the off-loadingof that shipment (i.e., the specific objective of the criminal activity he joinedwas the off-loading of the entire shipment). Therefore, he is accountable for the entire shipment under subsection (a)(1)(A) without regard to the issue of §1B1.3reasonable foreseeability. This is conceptually similar to the case of a defendant who transports a suitcase knowing that it contains a controlled substanceand, therefore, is accountable for the controlled substance in the suitcase regardless of his knowledge or lack of knowledge of the actual type or amount of that controlled substance.</li>
</ol>
<p>In certain cases, a defendant may be accountable for particular conduct undermore than one subsection of this guideline. As noted in the preceding paragraph, Defendant A is accountable for the entire one-ton shipment of marihuana under subsection (a)(1)(A). Defendant A also is accountable for the entire one-ton shipment of marihuana on the basis of subsection (a)(1)(B) (applying to a jointly undertaken criminal activity). Defendant A engaged in a jointly undertaken criminal activity and all three criteria of subsection (a)(1)(B) are met. First, the conduct was within the scope of the criminal activity (the importation of the shipment of marihuana). Second, the off-loading of the shipment of marihuana was in furtherance of the criminal activity, as described above. And third, a finding that the one-ton quantity of marihuana was reasonably foreseeable is warranted from the nature of the undertaking itself (the importation of marihuana by ship typically involves verylarge quantities of marihuana). The specific circumstances of the case (the defendant was one of ten persons off-loading the marihuana in bales) also support this finding. In an actual case, of course, if a defendant’s accountabilityfor particular conduct is established under one provision of this guideline, itis not necessary to review alternative provisions under which such accountability might be established. See Application Note 2.</p>
<p>(B) Acts and omissions aided or abetted by the defendant; acts and omissionsin a jointly undertaken criminal activity.—(i) Defendant C is the getaway driver in an armed bank robbery in which $15,000is taken and a teller is assaulted and injured. Defendant C is accountable for the money taken under subsection (a)(1)(A) because he aided and abetted the act of taking the money (the taking of money was the specific objective of the offense he joined). Defendant C is accountable for the injury to the teller undersubsection (a)(1)(B) because the assault on the teller was within the scope and in furtherance of the jointly undertaken criminal activity (the robbery), and was reasonably foreseeable in connection with that criminal activity (given the nature of the offense).</p>
<p>As noted earlier, a defendant may be accountable for particular conduct undermore than one subsection. In this example, Defendant C also is accountablefor the money taken on the basis of subsection (a)(1)(B) because the taking of money was within the scope and in furtherance of the jointly undertaken criminal activity (the robbery), and was reasonably foreseeable (as noted, the taking of money was the specific objective of the jointly undertaken criminal activity).</p>
<p>© Requirements that the conduct of others be within the scope of the jointlyundertaken criminal activity, in furtherance of that criminal activity, and reasonably foreseeable.—(i) Defendant D pays Defendant E a small amount to forge an endorsement onan $800 stolen government check. Unknown to Defendant E, Defendant D then uses that check as a down payment in a scheme to fraudulently obtain§1B1.3$15,000 worth of merchandise. Defendant E is convicted of forging the $800check and is accountable for the forgery of this check under subsection(a)(1)(A). Defendant E is not accountable for the $15,000 because the fraudulent scheme to obtain $15,000 was not within the scope of the jointly undertaken criminal activity (i.e., the forgery of the $800 check).</p>
<p>(ii) Defendants F and G, working together, design and execute a scheme to sellfraudulent stocks by telephone. Defendant F fraudulently obtains $20,000.</p>
<p>Defendant G fraudulently obtains $35,000. Each is convicted of mail fraud.</p>
<p>Defendants F and G each are accountable for the entire amount ($55,000).</p>
<p>Each defendant is accountable for the amount he personally obtained undersubsection (a)(1)(A). Each defendant is accountable for the amount obtainedby his accomplice under subsection (a)(1)(B) because the conduct of each waswithin the scope of the jointly undertaken criminal activity (the scheme to sellfraudulent stocks), was in furtherance of that criminal activity, and was reasonably foreseeable in connection with that criminal activity.</p>
<p>(iii) Defendants H and I engaged in an ongoing marihuana importation conspiracyin which Defendant J was hired only to help off-load a single shipment. Defendants H, I, and J are included in a single count charging conspiracy to import marihuana. Defendant J is accountable for the entire single shipment of marihuana he helped import under subsection (a)(1)(A) and any acts and omissions of others related to the importation of that shipment on the basis of subsection (a)(1)(B) (see the discussion in example (A)(i) above). He is not accountable for prior or subsequent shipments of marihuana imported by Defendants H or I because those acts were not within the scope of his jointlyundertaken criminal activity (the importation of the single shipment of marihuana).</p>
<p>(iv) Defendant K is a wholesale distributor of child pornography. Defendant L is a retail-level dealer who purchases child pornography from Defendant K and resells it, but otherwise operates independently of Defendant K. Similarly, Defendant M is a retail-level dealer who purchases child pornography fromDefendant K and resells it, but otherwise operates independently of Defendant K. Defendants L and M are aware of each other’s criminal activity butoperate independently. Defendant N is Defendant K’s assistant who recruitscustomers for Defendant K and frequently supervises the deliveries to Defendant K’s customers. Each defendant is convicted of a count charging conspiracyto distribute child pornography. Defendant K is accountable under subsection(a)(1)(A) for the entire quantity of child pornography sold to Defendants Land M. Defendant N also is accountable for the entire quantity sold to thosedefendants under subsection (a)(1)(B) because the entire quantity was within the scope of his jointly undertaken criminal activity (to distribute child pornography with Defendant K), in furtherance of that criminal activity, and reasonably foreseeable. Defendant L is accountable under subsection (a)(1)(A)only for the quantity of child pornography that he purchased from Defendant K because he is not engaged in a jointly undertaken criminal activity with the other defendants. For the same reason, Defendant M is accountable undersubsection (a)(1)(A) only for the quantity of child pornography that he purchased from Defendant K.</p>
<p>(v) Defendant O knows about her boyfriend’s ongoing drug-trafficking activity, but agrees to participate on only one occasion by making a delivery for him athis request when he was ill. Defendant O is accountable under subsection§1B1.3(a)(1)(A) for the drug quantity involved on that one occasion. Defendant O is not accountable for the other drug sales made by her boyfriend because thosesales were not within the scope of her jointly undertaken criminal activity (i.e., the one delivery).</p>
<p>(vi) Defendant P is a street-level drug dealer who knows of other street-level drugdealers in the same geographic area who sell the same type of drug as he sells.</p>
<p>Defendant P and the other dealers share a common source of supply, but otherwise operate independently. Defendant P is not accountable for the quantities of drugs sold by the other street-level drug dealers because he is not engaged in a jointly undertaken criminal activity with them. In contrast, Defendant Q, another street-level drug dealer, pools his resources and profitswith four other street-level drug dealers. Defendant Q is engaged in a jointlyundertaken criminal activity and, therefore, he is accountable under subsection (a)(1)(B) for the quantities of drugs sold by the four other dealers during the course of his joint undertaking with them because those sales were within the scope of the jointly undertaken criminal activity, in furtherance of thatcriminal activity, and reasonably foreseeable in connection with that criminal activity.</p>
<p>(vii) Defendant R recruits Defendant S to distribute 500 grams of cocaine. Defendant S knows that Defendant R is the prime figure in a conspiracy involved inimporting much larger quantities of cocaine. As long as Defendant S’s agreement and conduct is limited to the distribution of the 500 grams, Defendant Sis accountable only for that 500 gram amount (under subsection (a)(1)(A)), rather than the much larger quantity imported by Defendant R. Defendant S is not accountable under subsection (a)(1)(B) for the other quantities importedby Defendant R because those quantities were not within the scope of his jointly undertaken criminal activity (i.e., the 500 grams).</p>
<p>(viii) Defendants T, U, V, and W are hired by a supplier to backpack a quantity of marihuana across the border from Mexico into the United States. Defendants T, U, V, and W receive their individual shipments from the supplier at the same time and coordinate their importation efforts by walking across the border together for mutual assistance and protection. Each defendant is accountable for the aggregate quantity of marihuana transported by the fourdefendants. The four defendants engaged in a jointly undertaken criminal activity, the object of which was the importation of the four backpacks containing marihuana (subsection (a)(1)(B)), and aided and abetted each other’s actions (subsection (a)(1)(A)) in carrying out the jointly undertaken criminal activity (which under subsection (a)(1)(B) were also in furtherance of, and reasonably foreseeable in connection with, the criminal activity). In contrast, ifDefendants T, U, V, and W were hired individually, transported their individual shipments at different times, and otherwise operated independently, eachdefendant would be accountable only for the quantity of marihuana he personally transported (subsection (a)(1)(A)). As this example illustrates, the scope of the jointly undertaken criminal activity may depend upon whether, in the particular circumstances, the nature of the offense is more appropriately viewed as one jointly undertaken criminal activity or as a number of separate criminal activities. See Application Note 3(B).</p>
<p>§1B1.35. Application of Subsection (a)(2).—(A) Relationship to Grouping of Multiple Counts.—“Offenses of a character for which §3D1.2(d) would require grouping of multiple counts,” as used in subsection(a)(2), applies to offenses for which grouping of counts would be required under§3D1.2(d) had the defendant been convicted of multiple counts. Application of this provision does not require the defendant, in fact, to have been convicted of multiplecounts. For example, where the defendant engaged in three drug sales of 10, 15, and 20 grams of cocaine, as part of the same course of conduct or common schemeor plan, subsection (a)(2) provides that the total quantity of cocaine involved(45 grams) is to be used to determine the offense level even if the defendant is convicted of a single count charging only one of the sales. If the defendant is convictedof multiple counts for the above noted sales, the grouping rules of Chapter Three, Part D (Multiple Counts) provide that the counts are grouped together. AlthoughChapter Three, Part D (Multiple Counts) applies to multiple counts of conviction, itdoes not limit the scope of subsection (a)(2). Subsection (a)(2) merely incorporatesby reference the types of offenses set forth in §3D1.2(d); thus, as discussed above, multiple counts of conviction are not required for subsection (a)(2) to apply.</p>
<p>As noted above, subsection (a)(2) applies to offenses of a character for which§3D1.2(d) would require grouping of multiple counts, had the defendant been convicted of multiple counts. For example, the defendant sells 30 grams of cocaine (a violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841) on one occasion and, as part of the same course of conduct or common scheme or plan, attempts to sell an additional 15 grams of cocaine(a violation of 21 U.S.C. § 846) on another occasion. The defendant is convicted of one count charging the completed sale of 30 grams of cocaine. The two offenses (saleof cocaine and attempted sale of cocaine), although covered by different statutoryprovisions, are of a character for which §3D1.2(d) would require the grouping of counts, had the defendant been convicted of both counts. Therefore, subsection (a)(2) applies and the total amount of cocaine (45 grams) involved is used todetermine the offense level.</p>
<p>(B) “Same Course of Conduct or Common Scheme or Plan”.—“Common schemeor plan” and “same course of conduct” are two closely related concepts.</p>
<p>(i) Common scheme or plan. For two or more offenses to constitute part of a common scheme or plan, they must be substantially connected to each otherby at least one common factor, such as common victims, common accomplices, common purpose, or similar modus operandi. For example, the conduct of fivedefendants who together defrauded a group of investors by computer manipulations that unlawfully transferred funds over an eighteen-month periodwould qualify as a common scheme or plan on the basis of any of the abovelisted factors; i.e., the commonality of victims (the same investors were defrauded on an ongoing basis), commonality of offenders (the conduct constituted an ongoing conspiracy), commonality of purpose (to defraud the groupof investors), or similarity of modus operandi (the same or similar computermanipulations were used to execute the scheme).</p>
<p>(ii) Same course of conduct. Offenses that do not qualify as part of a commonscheme or plan may nonetheless qualify as part of the same course of conductif they are sufficiently connected or related to each other as to warrant the conclusion that they are part of a single episode, spree, or ongoing series of offenses. Factors that are appropriate to the determination of whether offenses are sufficiently connected or related to each other to be considered as§1B1.3part of the same course of conduct include the degree of similarity of the offenses, the regularity (repetitions) of the offenses, and the time interval between the offenses. When one of the above factors is absent, a stronger presence of at least one of the other factors is required. For example, where the conduct alleged to be relevant is relatively remote to the offense of conviction, a stronger showing of similarity or regularity is necessary to compensate for the absence of temporal proximity. The nature of the offenses may also be a relevant consideration (e.g., a defendant’s failure to file tax returns in threeconsecutive years appropriately would be considered as part of the samecourse of conduct because such returns are only required at yearly intervals).</p>
<p>© Conduct Associated with a Prior Sentence.—For the purposes of subsection (a)(2), offense conduct associated with a sentence that was imposed prior to the acts or omissions constituting the instant federal offense (the offense of conviction)is not considered as part of the same course of conduct or common scheme or planas the offense of conviction.</p>
<p>Examples: (1) The defendant was convicted for the sale of cocaine and sentencedto state prison. Immediately upon release from prison, he again sold cocaine to the same person, using the same accomplices and modus operandi. The instant federal offense (the offense of conviction) charges this latter sale. In this example, the offense conduct relevant to the state prison sentence is considered as prior criminal history, not as part of the same course of conduct or common scheme or plan as the offense of conviction. The prior state prison sentence is counted under Chapter Four(Criminal History and Criminal Livelihood). (2) The defendant engaged in two cocaine sales constituting part of the same course of conduct or common scheme orplan. Subsequently, he is arrested by state authorities for the first sale and by federal authorities for the second sale. He is convicted in state court for the first saleand sentenced to imprisonment; he is then convicted in federal court for the secondsale. In this case, the cocaine sales are not separated by an intervening sentence.</p>
<p>Therefore, under subsection (a)(2), the cocaine sale associated with the state conviction is considered as relevant conduct to the instant federal offense. The stateprison sentence for that sale is not counted as a prior sentence; see §4A1.2(a)(1).</p>
<p>Note, however, in certain cases, offense conduct associated with a previously imposed sentence may be expressly charged in the offense of conviction. Unless otherwise provided, such conduct will be considered relevant conduct under subsection (a)(1), not (a)(2).</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>Application of Subsection (a)(3).—(A) Definition of “Harm”.—“Harm” includes bodily injury, monetary loss, propertydamage and any resulting harm.</li>
</ol>
<p>(B) Risk or Danger of Harm.—If the offense guideline includes creating a risk ordanger of harm as a specific offense characteristic, whether that risk or danger wascreated is to be considered in determining the offense level. See, e.g., §2K1.4 (Arson;Property Damage by Use of Explosives); §2Q1.2 (Mishandling of Hazardous or ToxicSubstances or Pesticides). If, however, the guideline refers only to harm sustained(e.g., §2A2.2 (Aggravated Assault); §2B3.1 (Robbery)) or to actual, attempted or intended harm (e.g., §2B1.1 (Theft, Property Destruction, and Fraud); §2X1.1 (Attempt, Solicitation, or Conspiracy)), the risk created enters into the determinationof the offense level only insofar as it is incorporated into the base offense level. Unless clearly indicated by the guidelines, harm that is merely risked is not to be§1B1.3treated as the equivalent of harm that occurred. In a case in which creation of riskis not adequately taken into account by the applicable offense guideline, an upwarddeparture may be warranted. See generally §1B1.4 (Information to be Used in Imposing Sentence); §5K2.0 (Grounds for Departure). The extent to which harm thatwas attempted or intended enters into the determination of the offense level shouldbe determined in accordance with §2X1.1 (Attempt, Solicitation, or Conspiracy) and the applicable offense guideline.</p>
<ol start="7">
<li>Factors Requiring Conviction under a Specific Statute.—A particular guideline(in the base offense level or in a specific offense characteristic) may expressly direct thata particular factor be applied only if the defendant was convicted of a particular statute.</li>
</ol>
<p>For example, in §2S1.1 (Laundering of Monetary Instruments; Engaging in MonetaryTransactions in Property Derived from Unlawful Activity), subsection (b)(2)(B) applies if the defendant “was convicted under 18 U.S.C. § 1956”. Unless such an express directionis included, conviction under the statute is not required. Thus, use of a statutory reference to describe a particular set of circumstances does not require a conviction under the referenced statute. An example of this usage is found in §2A3.4(a)(2) (“if the offense involved conduct described in 18 U.S.C. § 2242”).</p>
<p>Unless otherwise specified, an express direction to apply a particular factor only if the defendant was convicted of a particular statute includes the determination of the offenselevel where the defendant was convicted of conspiracy, attempt, solicitation, aiding orabetting, accessory after the fact, or misprision of felony in respect to that particularstatute. For example, §2S1.1(b)(2)(B) (which is applicable only if the defendant is convicted under 18 U.S.C. § 1956) would be applied in determining the offense level under§2X3.1 (Accessory After the Fact) in a case in which the defendant was convicted of accessory after the fact to a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1956 but would not be applied in a casein which the defendant is convicted of a conspiracy under 18 U.S.C. § 1956(h) and the sole object of that conspiracy was to commit an offense set forth in 18 U.S.C. § 1957.</p>
<p>See Application Note 3© of §2S1.1.</p>
<ol start="8">
<li><p>Partially Completed Offense.—In the case of a partially completed offense (e.g., anoffense involving an attempted theft of $800,000 and a completed theft of $30,000), the offense level is to be determined in accordance with §2X1.1 (Attempt, Solicitation, orConspiracy) whether the conviction is for the substantive offense, the inchoate offense(attempt, solicitation, or conspiracy), or both. See Application Note 4 in the Commentaryto §2X1.1. Note, however, that Application Note 4 is not applicable where the offenselevel is determined under §2X1.1©(1).</p></li>
<li><p>Solicitation, Misprision, or Accessory After the Fact.—In the case of solicitation, misprision, or accessory after the fact, the conduct for which the defendant is accountableincludes all conduct relevant to determining the offense level for the underlying offensethat was known, or reasonably should have been known, by the defendant.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Background: This section prescribes rules for determining the applicable guideline sentencing range, whereas §1B1.4 (Information to be Used in Imposing Sentence) governs the rangeof information that the court may consider in adjudging sentence once the guideline sentencingrange has been determined. Conduct that is not formally charged or is not an element of the offense of conviction may enter into the determination of the applicable guideline sentencingrange. The range of information that may be considered at sentencing is broader than the range of information upon which the applicable sentencing range is determined.</p>
<p>Subsection (a) establishes a rule of construction by specifying, in the absence of moreexplicit instructions in the context of a specific guideline, the range of conduct that is relevant§1B1.3to determining the applicable offense level (except for the determination of the applicable offense guideline, which is governed by §1B1.2(a)). No such rule of construction is necessary with respect to Chapters Four and Five because the guidelines in those Chapters are explicit as to the specific factors to be considered.</p>
<p>Subsection (a)(2) provides for consideration of a broader range of conduct with respect toone class of offenses, primarily certain property, tax, fraud and drug offenses for which the guidelines depend substantially on quantity, than with respect to other offenses such as assault, robbery and burglary. The distinction is made on the basis of §3D1.2(d), which providesfor grouping together (i.e., treating as a single count) all counts charging offenses of a typecovered by this subsection. However, the applicability of subsection (a)(2) does not depend uponwhether multiple counts are alleged. Thus, in an embezzlement case, for example, embezzledfunds that may not be specified in any count of conviction are nonetheless included in determining the offense level if they were part of the same course of conduct or part of the samescheme or plan as the count of conviction. Similarly, in a drug distribution case, quantities and types of drugs not specified in the count of conviction are to be included in determining the offense level if they were part of the same course of conduct or part of a common scheme orplan as the count of conviction. On the other hand, in a robbery case in which the defendantrobbed two banks, the amount of money taken in one robbery would not be taken into accountin determining the guideline range for the other robbery, even if both robberies were part of a single course of conduct or the same scheme or plan. (This is true whether the defendant is convicted of one or both robberies.)Subsections (a)(1) and (a)(2) adopt different rules because offenses of the character dealtwith in subsection (a)(2) (i.e., to which §3D1.2(d) applies) often involve a pattern of misconductthat cannot readily be broken into discrete, identifiable units that are meaningful for purposesof sentencing. For example, a pattern of embezzlement may consist of several acts of takingthat cannot separately be identified, even though the overall conduct is clear. In addition, the distinctions that the law makes as to what constitutes separate counts or offenses often turnon technical elements that are not especially meaningful for purposes of sentencing. Thus, ina mail fraud case, the scheme is an element of the offense and each mailing may be the basis for a separate count; in an embezzlement case, each taking may provide a basis for a separatecount. Another consideration is that in a pattern of small thefts, for example, it is importantto take into account the full range of related conduct. Relying on the entire range of conduct, regardless of the number of counts that are alleged or on which a conviction is obtained, appears to be the most reasonable approach to writing workable guidelines for these offenses.</p>
<p>Conversely, when §3D1.2(d) does not apply, so that convictions on multiple counts are considered separately in determining the guideline sentencing range, the guidelines prohibit aggregation of quantities from other counts in order to prevent “double counting” of the conduct and harm from each count of conviction. Continuing offenses present similar practical problems.</p>
<p>The reference to §3D1.2(d), which provides for grouping of multiple counts arising out of a continuing offense when the offense guideline takes the continuing nature into account, alsoprevents double counting.</p>
<p>Subsection (a)(4) requires consideration of any other information specified in the applicable guideline. For example, §2A1.4 (Involuntary Manslaughter) specifies consideration of the defendant’s state of mind; §2K1.4 (Arson; Property Damage By Use of Explosives) specifiesconsideration of the risk of harm created.</p>

<p>§1B1.5§1B1.4. Information to be Used in Imposing Sentence (Selecting a PointWithin the Guideline Range or Departing from the Guidelines)In determining the sentence to impose within the guideline range, orwhether a departure from the guidelines is warranted, the court mayconsider, without limitation, any information concerning the background, character and conduct of the defendant, unless otherwise prohibited by law. See 18 U.S.C. § 3661.</p>
<p>CommentaryBackground: This section distinguishes between factors that determine the applicable guideline sentencing range (§1B1.3) and information that a court may consider in imposing sentencewithin that range. The section is based on 18 U.S.C. § 3661, which recodifies 18 U.S.C. § 3577.</p>
<p>The recodification of this 1970 statute in 1984 with an effective date of 1987 (99 Stat. 1728), makes it clear that Congress intended that no limitation would be placed on the informationthat a court may consider in imposing an appropriate sentence under the future guidelinesentencing system. A court is not precluded from considering information that the guidelinesdo not take into account in determining a sentence within the guideline range or from considering that information in determining whether and to what extent to depart from the guidelines. For example, if the defendant committed two robberies, but as part of a plea negotiationentered a guilty plea to only one, the robbery that was not taken into account by the guidelineswould provide a reason for sentencing at the top of the guideline range and may provide a reason for an upward departure. Some policy statements do, however, express a Commissionpolicy that certain factors should not be considered for any purpose, or should be consideredonly for limited purposes. See, e.g., Chapter Five, Part H (Specific Offender Characteristics).</p>

<p>§1B1.5. Interpretation of References to Other Offense Guidelines(a) A cross reference (an instruction to apply another offense guideline)refers to the entire offense guideline (i.e., the base offense level, specific offense characteristics, cross references, and special instructions).</p>
<p>(b) (1) An instruction to use the offense level from another offenseguideline refers to the offense level from the entire offenseguideline (i.e., the base offense level, specific offense characteristics, cross references, and special instructions), except as provided in subdivision (2) below.</p>
<p>(2) An instruction to use a particular subsection or table from another offense guideline refers only to the particular subsectionor table referenced, and not to the entire offense guideline.</p>
<p>§1B1.5© If the offense level is determined by a reference to another guidelineunder subsection (a) or (b)(1) above, the adjustments in ChapterThree (Adjustments) also are determined in respect to the referenced offense guideline, except as otherwise expressly provided.</p>
<p>(d) A reference to another guideline under subsection (a) or (b)(1) abovemay direct that it be applied only if it results in the greater offenselevel. In such case, the greater offense level means the greaterChapter Two offense level, except as otherwise expressly provided.</p>
<p>CommentaryApplication Notes:1. References to other offense guidelines are most frequently designated “Cross References,”but may also appear in the portion of the guideline entitled “Base Offense Level”(e.g., §2D1.2(a)(1) and (2)), or “Specific Offense Characteristics” (e.g., §2A4.1(b)(7)). These references may be to a specific guideline, or may be more general (e.g., to the guidelinefor the “underlying offense”). Such references incorporate the specific offense characteristics, cross references, and special instructions as well as the base offense level. For example, if the guideline reads “2 plus the offense level from §2A2.2 (Aggravated Assault),” the user would determine the offense level from §2A2.2, including any applicable adjustments for planning, weapon use, degree of injury and motive, and then increase by 2 levels.</p>
<p>A reference may also be to a specific subsection of another guideline; e.g., the referencein §2D1.10(a)(1) to “3 plus the offense level from the Drug Quantity Table in §2D1.1”. In such case, only the specific subsection of that other guideline is used.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><p>A reference to another guideline may direct that such reference is to be used only if itresults in a greater offense level. In such cases, the greater offense level means the offense level taking into account only the Chapter Two offense level, unless the offenseguideline expressly provides for consideration of both the Chapter Two offense level and applicable Chapter Three adjustments. For situations in which a comparison involvingboth Chapters Two and Three is necessary, see the Commentary to §§2C1.1 (Offering, Giving, Soliciting, or Receiving a Bribe; Extortion Under Color of Official Right; FraudInvolving the Deprivation of the Intangible Right to Honest Services of Public Officials;Conspiracy to Defraud by Interference with Governmental Functions); 2E1.1 (UnlawfulConduct Relating to Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations); and 2E1.2 (Interstate or Foreign Travel or Transportation in Aid of a Racketeering Enterprise).</p></li>
<li><p>A reference may direct that, if the conduct involved another offense, the offense guidelinefor such other offense is to be applied. Consistent with the provisions of §1B1.3 (RelevantConduct), such other offense includes conduct that may be a state or local offense and conduct that occurred under circumstances that would constitute a federal offense had the conduct taken place within the territorial or maritime jurisdiction of the UnitedStates. Where there is more than one such other offense, the most serious such offense(or group of closely related offenses in the case of offenses that would be grouped togetherunder §3D1.2(d)) is to be used. For example, if a defendant convicted of possession of a firearm by a felon, to which §2K2.1 (Unlawful Receipt, Possession, or Transportation of Firearms or Ammunition; Prohibited Transactions Involving Firearms or Ammunition)applies, is found to have possessed that firearm during commission of a series of offenses, §1B1.7 the cross reference at §2K2.1© is applied to the offense resulting in the greatest offenselevel.</p></li>

<p>§1B1.6. Structure of the GuidelinesThe guidelines are presented in numbered chapters divided into alphabetical parts. The parts are divided into subparts and individual guidelines. Each guideline is identified by three numbers and a letter corresponding to the chapter, part, subpart and individual guideline.</p>
<p>The first number is the chapter, the letter represents the part of the chapter, the second number is the subpart, and the final number is the guideline. Section 2B1.1, for example, is the first guideline in the firstsubpart in Part B of Chapter Two. Or, §3A1.2 is the second guideline in the first subpart in Part A of Chapter Three. Policy statements are similarly identified.</p>

<p>§1B1.7. Significance of CommentaryThe Commentary that accompanies the guideline sections may serve a number of purposes. First, it may interpret the guideline or explain howit is to be applied. Failure to follow such commentary could constitute anincorrect application of the guidelines, subjecting the sentence to possible reversal on appeal. See 18 U.S.C. § 3742. Second, the commentarymay suggest circumstances which, in the view of the Commission, maywarrant departure from the guidelines. Such commentary is to be§1B1.8treated as the legal equivalent of a policy statement. Finally, the commentary may provide background information, including factors considered in promulgating the guideline or reasons underlying promulgationof the guideline. As with a policy statement, such commentary may provide guidance in assessing the reasonableness of any departure from the guidelines.</p>
<p>CommentaryPortions of this document not labeled as guidelines or commentary also express the policyof the Commission or provide guidance as to the interpretation and application of the guidelines. These are to be construed as commentary and thus have the force of policy statements.</p>

<p>Effective November 1, 1987. Amended effective November 1, 1993 (amendment 498).</p>
<p>§1B1.8. Use of Certain Information(a) Where a defendant agrees to cooperate with the government byproviding information concerning unlawful activities of others, and as part of that cooperation agreement the government agrees thatself-incriminating information provided pursuant to the agreementwill not be used against the defendant, then such information shallnot be used in determining the applicable guideline range, except to the extent provided in the agreement.</p>
<p>(b) The provisions of subsection (a) shall not be applied to restrict the use of information:(1) known to the government prior to entering into the cooperationagreement;(2) concerning the existence of prior convictions and sentences indetermining §4A1.1 (Criminal History Category) and §4B1.1(Career Offender);(3) in a prosecution for perjury or giving a false statement;(4) in the event there is a breach of the cooperation agreement by the defendant; or§1B1.8(5) in determining whether, or to what extent, a downward departure from the guidelines is warranted pursuant to a government motion under §5K1.1 (Substantial Assistance to Authorities).</p>
<p>CommentaryApplication Notes:1. This provision does not authorize the government to withhold information from the courtbut provides that self-incriminating information obtained under a cooperation agreementis not to be used to determine the defendant’s guideline range. Under this provision, for example, if a defendant is arrested in possession of a kilogram of cocaine and, pursuantto an agreement to provide information concerning the unlawful activities of co-conspirators, admits that he assisted in the importation of an additional three kilograms of cocaine, a fact not previously known to the government, this admission would not be usedto increase his applicable guideline range, except to the extent provided in the agreement.</p>
<p>Although the guideline itself affects only the determination of the guideline range, the policy of the Commission, as a corollary, is that information prohibited from being usedto determine the applicable guideline range shall not be used to depart upward. In contrast, subsection (b)(5) provides that consideration of such information is appropriate indetermining whether, and to what extent, a downward departure is warranted pursuantto a government motion under §5K1.1 (Substantial Assistance to Authorities); e.g., a court may refuse to depart downward on the basis of such information.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><p>Subsection (b)(2) prohibits any cooperation agreement from restricting the use of information as to the existence of prior convictions and sentences in determining adjustmentsunder §4A1.1 (Criminal History Category) and §4B1.1 (Career Offender). The probationoffice generally will secure information relevant to the defendant’s criminal history independent of information the defendant provides as part of his cooperation agreement.</p></li>
<li><p>On occasion the defendant will provide incriminating information to the government during plea negotiation sessions before a cooperation agreement has been reached. In the event no agreement is reached, use of such information in a sentencing proceeding is restricted by Rule 11(f) (Admissibility or Inadmissibility of a Plea, Plea Discussions, and Related Statements) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure and Rule 410 (Pleas, Plea Discussions, and Related Statements) of the Rules of Evidence.</p></li>
<li><p>As with the statutory provisions governing use immunity, 18 U.S.C. § 6002, this guideline does not apply to information used against the defendant in a prosecution for perjury, giving a false statement, or in the event the defendant otherwise fails to comply with the cooperation agreement.</p></li>
<li><p>This guideline limits the use of certain incriminating information furnished by a defendant in the context of a defendant-government agreement for the defendant to provideinformation concerning the unlawful activities of other persons. The guideline operatesas a limitation on the use of such incriminating information in determining the applicableguideline range, and not merely as a restriction of the government’s presentation of suchinformation (e.g., where the defendant, subsequent to having entered into a cooperationagreement, provides such information to the probation officer preparing the presentencereport, the use of such information remains protected by this section).</p></li>
</ol>
<p>§1B1.96. Unless the cooperation agreement relates to the provision of information concerning the unlawful activities of others, this guideline does not apply (i.e., an agreement by the defendant simply to detail the extent of his own unlawful activities, not involving an agreement to provide information concerning the unlawful activity of another person, is not covered by this guideline).</p>

<p>§1B1.9. Class B or C Misdemeanors and InfractionsThe sentencing guidelines do not apply to any count of conviction that is a Class B or C misdemeanor or an infraction.</p>
<p>CommentaryApplication Notes:1. Notwithstanding any other provision of the guidelines, the court may impose any sentence authorized by statute for each count that is a Class B or C misdemeanor or aninfraction. A Class B misdemeanor is any offense for which the maximum authorizedterm of imprisonment is more than thirty days but not more than six months; a Class Cmisdemeanor is any offense for which the maximum authorized term of imprisonment is more than five days but not more than thirty days; an infraction is any offense for which the maximum authorized term of imprisonment is not more than five days or for whichno imprisonment is authorized. See 18 U.S.C. § 3559.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>The guidelines for sentencing on multiple counts do not apply to counts that are Class Bor C misdemeanors or infractions. Sentences for such offenses may be consecutive to orconcurrent with sentences imposed on other counts. In imposing sentence, the courtshould, however, consider the relationship between the Class B or C misdemeanor orinfraction and any other offenses of which the defendant is convicted.</li>
</ol>
<p>Background: For the sake of judicial economy, the Commission has exempted all Class Band C misdemeanors and infractions from the coverage of the guidelines.</p>

<p>§1B1.10§1B1.10. Reduction in Term of Imprisonment as a Result of AmendedGuideline Range (Policy Statement)(a) AUTHORITY.—(1) IN GENERAL.—In a case in which a defendant is serving a termof imprisonment, and the guideline range applicable to that defendant has subsequently been lowered as a result of anamendment to the Guidelines Manual listed in subsection (d)below, the court may reduce the defendant’s term of imprisonment as provided by 18 U.S.C. § 3582©(2). As required by18 U.S.C. § 3582©(2), any such reduction in the defendant’sterm of imprisonment shall be consistent with this policy statement.</p>
<p>(2) EXCLUSIONS.—A reduction in the defendant’s term of imprisonment is not consistent with this policy statement and thereforeis not authorized under 18 U.S.C. § 3582©(2) if—(A) none of the amendments listed in subsection (d) is applicable to the defendant; or(B) an amendment listed in subsection (d) does not have the effect of lowering the defendant’s applicable guidelinerange.</p>
<p>(3) LIMITATION.—Consistent with subsection (b), proceedings under 18 U.S.C. § 3582©(2) and this policy statement do not constitute a full resentencing of the defendant.</p>
<p>(b) DETERMINATION OF REDUCTION IN TERM OF IMPRISONMENT.—(1) IN GENERAL.—In determining whether, and to what extent, a reduction in the defendant’s term of imprisonment under18 U.S.C. § 3582©(2) and this policy statement is warranted, the court shall determine the amended guideline range thatwould have been applicable to the defendant if the amendment(s) to the guidelines listed in subsection (d) had been ineffect at the time the defendant was sentenced. In making suchdetermination, the court shall substitute only the amendmentslisted in subsection (d) for the corresponding guideline provisions that were applied when the defendant was sentenced and shall leave all other guideline application decisions unaffected.</p>
<p>§1B1.10(2) LIMITATION AND PROHIBITION ON EXTENT OF REDUCTION.—(A) LIMITATION.—Except as provided in subdivision (B), the court shall not reduce the defendant’s term of imprisonment under 18 U.S.C. § 3582©(2) and this policy statement to a term that is less than the minimum of the amended guideline range determined under subdivision (1) of this subsection.</p>
<p>(B) EXCEPTION FOR SUBSTANTIAL ASSISTANCE.—If the term of imprisonment imposed was less than the term of imprisonment provided by the guideline range applicable to the defendant at the time of sentencing pursuant to a government motion to reflect the defendant’s substantial assistance to authorities, a reduction comparably less than the amended guideline range determined under subdivision (1) of this subsection may be appropriate.</p>
<p>© PROHIBITION.—In no event may the reduced term of imprisonment be less than the term of imprisonment the defendant has already served.</p>
<p>© CASES INVOLVING MANDATORY MINIMUM SENTENCES AND SUBSTANTIAL ASSISTANCE.—If the case involves a statutorily required minimum sentence and the court had the authority to impose a sentencebelow the statutorily required minimum sentence pursuant to a government motion to reflect the defendant’s substantial assistanceto authorities, then for purposes of this policy statement the amended guideline range shall be determined without regard to the operation of §5G1.1 (Sentencing on a Single Count of Conviction)and §5G1.2 (Sentencing on Multiple Counts of Conviction).</p>
<p>(d) COVERED AMENDMENTS.—Amendments covered by this policy statement are listed in Appendix C as follows: 126, 130, 156, 176, 269, 329, 341, 371, 379, 380, 433, 454, 461, 484, 488, 490, 499, 505, 506, 516, 591, 599, 606, 657, 702, 706 as amended by 711, 715, 750(parts A and C only), and 782 (subject to subsection (e)(1)).</p>
<p>(e) SPECIAL INSTRUCTION.—(1) The court shall not order a reduced term of imprisonmentbased on Amendment 782 unless the effective date of the court’s order is November 1, 2015, or later.</p>
<p>§1B1.10CommentaryApplication Notes:1. Application of Subsection (a).—(A) Eligibility.—Eligibility for consideration under 18 U.S.C. § 3582©(2) is triggeredonly by an amendment listed in subsection (d) that lowers the applicable guidelinerange (i.e., the guideline range that corresponds to the offense level and criminal history category determined pursuant to §1B1.1(a), which is determined before consideration of any departure provision in the Guidelines Manual or any variance).</p>
<p>Accordingly, a reduction in the defendant’s term of imprisonment is not authorizedunder 18 U.S.C. § 3582©(2) and is not consistent with this policy statement if:(i) none of the amendments listed in subsection (d) is applicable to the defendant;or (ii) an amendment listed in subsection (d) is applicable to the defendant but the amendment does not have the effect of lowering the defendant’s applicable guideline range because of the operation of another guideline or statutory provision(e.g., a statutory mandatory minimum term of imprisonment).</p>
<p>(B) Factors for Consideration.—(i) In General.—Consistent with 18 U.S.C. § 3582©(2), the court shall consider the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a) in determining: (I) whether a reduction in the defendant’s term of imprisonment is warranted; and (II) the extent of such reduction, but only within the limits described in subsection (b).</p>
<p>(ii) Public Safety Consideration.—The court shall consider the nature and seriousness of the danger to any person or the community that may be posed bya reduction in the defendant’s term of imprisonment in determining:(I) whether such a reduction is warranted; and (II) the extent of such reduction, but only within the limits described in subsection (b).</p>
<p>(iii) Post-Sentencing Conduct.—The court may consider post-sentencing conduct of the defendant that occurred after imposition of the term of imprisonment in determining: (I) whether a reduction in the defendant’s term of imprisonment is warranted; and (II) the extent of such reduction, but only within the limits described in subsection (b).</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><p>Application of Subsection (b)(1).—In determining the amended guideline range under subsection (b)(1), the court shall substitute only the amendments listed in subsection(d) for the corresponding guideline provisions that were applied when the defendant wassentenced. All other guideline application decisions remain unaffected.</p></li>
<li><p>Application of Subsection (b)(2).—Under subsection (b)(2), the amended guidelinerange determined under subsection (b)(1) and the term of imprisonment already servedby the defendant limit the extent to which the court may reduce the defendant’s term of imprisonment under 18 U.S.C. § 3582©(2) and this policy statement. Specifically, asprovided in subsection (b)(2)(A), if the term of imprisonment imposed was within the guideline range applicable to the defendant at the time of sentencing, the court may reduce the defendant’s term of imprisonment to a term that is no less than the minimumterm of imprisonment provided by the amended guideline range determined under subsection (b)(1). For example, in a case in which: (A) the guideline range applicable to the defendant at the time of sentencing was 70 to 87 months; (B) the term of imprisonment§1B1.10imposed was 70 months; and © the amended guideline range determined under subsection (b)(1) is 51 to 63 months, the court may reduce the defendant’s term of imprisonment, but shall not reduce it to a term less than 51 months.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>If the term of imprisonment imposed was outside the guideline range applicable to the defendant at the time of sentencing, the limitation in subsection (b)(2)(A) also applies.</p>
<p>Thus, if the term of imprisonment imposed in the example provided above was not a sentence of 70 months (within the guidelines range) but instead was a sentence of 56 months (constituting a downward departure or variance), the court likewise may reduce the defendant’s term of imprisonment, but shall not reduce it to a term less than 51 months.</p>
<p>Subsection (b)(2)(B) provides an exception to this limitation, which applies if the term of imprisonment imposed was less than the term of imprisonment provided by the guidelinerange applicable to the defendant at the time of sentencing pursuant to a governmentmotion to reflect the defendant’s substantial assistance to authorities. In such a case, the court may reduce the defendant’s term, but the reduction is not limited by subsection(b)(2)(A) to the minimum of the amended guideline range. Instead, as provided in subsection (b)(2)(B), the court may, if appropriate, provide a reduction comparably less than the amended guideline range. Thus, if the term of imprisonment imposed in the exampleprovided above was 56 months pursuant to a government motion to reflect the defendant’s substantial assistance to authorities (representing a downward departure of 20 percent below the minimum term of imprisonment provided by the guideline range applicable to the defendant at the time of sentencing), a reduction to a term of imprisonment of 41 months (representing a reduction of approximately 20 percent below the minimumterm of imprisonment provided by the amended guideline range) would amount to a comparable reduction and may be appropriate.</p>
<p>The provisions authorizing such a government motion are §5K1.1 (Substantial Assistance to Authorities) (authorizing, upon government motion, a downward departurebased on the defendant’s substantial assistance); 18 U.S.C. § 3553(e) (authorizing the court, upon government motion, to impose a sentence below a statutory minimum to reflect the defendant’s substantial assistance); and Fed. R. Crim. P. 35(b) (authorizing the court, upon government motion, to reduce a sentence to reflect the defendant’s substantial assistance).</p>
<p>In no case, however, shall the term of imprisonment be reduced below time served.</p>
<p>See subsection (b)(2)©. Subject to these limitations, the sentencing court has the discretion to determine whether, and to what extent, to reduce a term of imprisonment underthis section.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Application of Subsection ©.—As stated in subsection ©, if the case involves a statutorily required minimum sentence and the court had the authority to impose a sentencebelow the statutorily required minimum sentence pursuant to a government motion toreflect the defendant’s substantial assistance to authorities, then for purposes of this policy statement the amended guideline range shall be determined without regard to the operation of §5G1.1 (Sentencing on a Single Count of Conviction) and §5G1.2 (Sentencingon Multiple Counts of Conviction). For example:(A) Defendant A is subject to a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment of 120 months. The original guideline range at the time of sentencing was 135 to168 months, which is entirely above the mandatory minimum, and the court imposed a sentence of 101 months pursuant to a government motion to reflect the defendant’s substantial assistance to authorities. The court determines that the §1B1.10amended guideline range as calculated on the Sentencing Table is 108 to135 months. Ordinarily, §5G1.1 would operate to restrict the amended guidelinerange to 120 to 135 months, to reflect the mandatory minimum term of imprisonment. For purposes of this policy statement, however, the amended guideline rangeremains 108 to 135 months.</li>
</ol>
<p>To the extent the court considers it appropriate to provide a reduction comparablyless than the amended guideline range pursuant to subsection (b)(2)(B), DefendantA’s original sentence of 101 months amounted to a reduction of approximately25 percent below the minimum of the original guideline range of 135 months.</p>
<p>Therefore, an amended sentence of 81 months (representing a reduction of approximately 25 percent below the minimum of the amended guideline range of 108 months) would amount to a comparable reduction and may be appropriate.</p>
<p>(B) Defendant B is subject to a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment of 120 months. The original guideline range at the time of sentencing (as calculatedon the Sentencing Table) was 108 to 135 months, which was restricted by operationof §5G1.1 to a range of 120 to 135 months. See §5G1.1©(2). The court imposed a sentence of 90 months pursuant to a government motion to reflect the defendant’ssubstantial assistance to authorities. The court determines that the amendedguideline range as calculated on the Sentencing Table is 87 to 108 months. Ordinarily, §5G1.1 would operate to restrict the amended guideline range to precisely120 months, to reflect the mandatory minimum term of imprisonment.</p>
<p>See §5G1.1(b). For purposes of this policy statement, however, the amended guideline range is considered to be 87 to 108 months (i.e., unrestricted by operation of §5G1.1 and the statutory minimum of 120 months).</p>
<p>To the extent the court considers it appropriate to provide a reduction comparablyless than the amended guideline range pursuant to subsection (b)(2)(B), DefendantB’s original sentence of 90 months amounted to a reduction of approximately 25 percent below the original guideline range of 120 months. Therefore, an amended sentence of 65 months (representing a reduction of approximately 25 percent below the minimum of the amended guideline range of 87 months) would amount to a comparable reduction and may be appropriate.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li><p>Application to Amendment 750 (Parts A and C Only).—As specified in subsection(d), the parts of Amendment 750 that are covered by this policy statement are Parts Aand C only. Part A amended the Drug Quantity Table in §2D1.1 for crack cocaine and made related revisions to the Drug Equivalency Tables in the Commentary to §2D1.1(see §2D1.1, comment. (n.8)). Part C deleted the cross reference in §2D2.1(b) under whichan offender who possessed more than 5 grams of crack cocaine was sentenced under§2D1.1.</p></li>
<li><p>Application to Amendment 782.—As specified in subsection (d) and (e)(1), Amendment 782 (generally revising the Drug Quantity Table and chemical quantity tablesacross drug and chemical types) is covered by this policy statement only in cases in which the order reducing the defendant’s term of imprisonment has an effective date of November 1, 2015, or later.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>A reduction based on retroactive application of Amendment 782 that does not complywith the requirement that the order take effect on November 1, 2015, or later is not consistent with this policy statement and therefore is not authorized under 18 U.S.C.</p>
<p>§ 3582©(2).</p>
<p>§1B1.10Subsection (e)(1) does not preclude the court from conducting sentence reduction proceedings and entering orders under 18 U.S.C. § 3582©(2) and this policy statement beforeNovember 1, 2015, provided that any order reducing the defendant’s term of imprisonment has an effective date of November 1, 2015, or later.</p>
<ol start="7">
<li>Supervised Release.—(A) Exclusion Relating to Revocation.—Only a term of imprisonment imposed aspart of the original sentence is authorized to be reduced under this section. This section does not authorize a reduction in the term of imprisonment imposed uponrevocation of supervised release.</li>
</ol>
<p>(B) Modification Relating to Early Termination.—If the prohibition in subsection(b)(2)© relating to time already served precludes a reduction in the term of imprisonment to the extent the court determines otherwise would have been appropriate as a result of the amended guideline range determined under subsection(b)(1), the court may consider any such reduction that it was unable to grant inconnection with any motion for early termination of a term of supervised releaseunder 18 U.S.C. § 3583(e)(1). However, the fact that a defendant may have serveda longer term of imprisonment than the court determines would have been appropriate in view of the amended guideline range determined under subsection (b)(1)shall not, without more, provide a basis for early termination of supervised release.</p>
<p>Rather, the court should take into account the totality of circumstances relevant toa decision to terminate supervised release, including the term of supervised releasethat would have been appropriate in connection with a sentence under the amendedguideline range determined under subsection (b)(1).</p>

<li>Use of Policy Statement in Effect on Date of Reduction.—Consistent with subsection (a) of §1B1.11 (Use of Guidelines Manual in Effect on Date of Sentencing), the courtshall use the version of this policy statement that is in effect on the date on which the court reduces the defendant’s term of imprisonment as provided by 18 U.S.C. § 3582©(2).</li>
</ol>
<p>Background: Section 3582©(2) of Title 18, United States Code, provides: “[I]n the case of a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing rangethat has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to 28 U.S.C.</p>
<p>§ 994(o), upon motion of the defendant or the Director of the Bureau of Prisons, or on its ownmotion, the court may reduce the term of imprisonment, after considering the factors set forthin section 3553(a) to the extent that they are applicable, if such a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.”This policy statement provides guidance and limitations for a court when considering a motion under 18 U.S.C. § 3582©(2) and implements 28 U.S.C. § 994(u), which provides: “If the Commission reduces the term of imprisonment recommended in the guidelines applicableto a particular offense or category of offenses, it shall specify in what circumstances and bywhat amount the sentences of prisoners serving terms of imprisonment for the offense may bereduced.” The Supreme Court has concluded that proceedings under section 3582©(2) are not governed by United States v. Booker, 543 U.S. 220 (2005), and this policy statement remainsbinding on courts in such proceedings. See Dillon v. United States, 560 U.S. 817 (2010).</p>
<p>Among the factors considered by the Commission in selecting the amendments includedin subsection (d) were the purpose of the amendment, the magnitude of the change in the guideline range made by the amendment, and the difficulty of applying the amendment retroactively to determine an amended guideline range under subsection (b)(1).</p>
<p>§1B1.11The listing of an amendment in subsection (d) reflects policy determinations by the Commission that a reduced guideline range is sufficient to achieve the purposes of sentencing and that, in the sound discretion of the court, a reduction in the term of imprisonment may beappropriate for previously sentenced, qualified defendants. The authorization of such a discretionary reduction does not otherwise affect the lawfulness of a previously imposed sentence, does not authorize a reduction in any other component of the sentence, and does not entitle a defendant to a reduced term of imprisonment as a matter of right.</p>
<p>The Commission has not included in this policy statement amendments that generallyreduce the maximum of the guideline range by less than six months. This criterion is in accordwith the legislative history of 28 U.S.C. § 994(u) (formerly § 994(t)), which states: “It shouldbe noted that the Committee does not expect that the Commission will recommend adjustingexisting sentences under the provision when guidelines are simply refined in a way that mightcause isolated instances of existing sentences falling above the old guidelines* or when thereis only a minor downward adjustment in the guidelines. The Committee does not believe the courts should be burdened with adjustments in these cases.” S. Rep. 225, 98th Cong., 1st Sess.</p>
<p>180 (1983).</p>
<p>*So in original. Probably should be “to fall above the amended guidelines”.</p>

<p>§1B1.11. Use of Guidelines Manual in Effect on Date of Sentencing (PolicyStatement)(a) The court shall use the Guidelines Manual in effect on the date that the defendant is sentenced.</p>
<p>(b) (1) If the court determines that use of the Guidelines Manual ineffect on the date that the defendant is sentenced would violate the ex post facto clause of the United States Constitution, the court shall use the Guidelines Manual in effect on the date that the offense of conviction was committed.</p>
<p>(2) The Guidelines Manual in effect on a particular date shall beapplied in its entirety. The court shall not apply, for example, one guideline section from one edition of the Guidelines Manual and another guideline section from a different edition of the Guidelines Manual. However, if a court applies an earlier edition of the Guidelines Manual, the court shall consider subsequent amendments, to the extent that such amendments are clarifying rather than substantive changes.</p>
<p>§1B1.11(3) If the defendant is convicted of two offenses, the first committed before, and the second after, a revised edition of the Guidelines Manual became effective, the revised edition of the Guidelines Manual is to be applied to both offenses.</p>
<p>CommentaryApplication Notes:1. Subsection (b)(2) provides that if an earlier edition of the Guidelines Manual is used, itis to be used in its entirety, except that subsequent clarifying amendments are to beconsidered.</p>
<p>Example: A defendant is convicted of an antitrust offense committed in November 1989.</p>
<p>He is to be sentenced in December 1992. Effective November 1, 1991, the Commissionraised the base offense level for antitrust offenses. Effective November 1, 1992, the Commission lowered the guideline range in the Sentencing Table for cases with an offenselevel of 8 and criminal history category of I from 2–8 months to 0–6 months. Under the 1992 edition of the Guidelines Manual (effective November 1, 1992), the defendant has a guideline range of 4–10 months (final offense level of 9, criminal history category of I).</p>
<p>Under the 1989 edition of the Guidelines Manual (effective November 1, 1989), the defendant has a guideline range of 2–8 months (final offense level of 8, criminal historycategory of I). If the court determines that application of the 1992 edition of the Guidelines Manual would violate the ex post facto clause of the United States Constitution, itshall apply the 1989 edition of the Guidelines Manual in its entirety. It shall not apply, for example, the offense level of 8 and criminal history category of I from the 1989 editionof the Guidelines Manual in conjunction with the amended guideline range of 0–6 monthsfor this offense level and criminal history category from the 1992 edition of the GuidelinesManual.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Under subsection (b)(1), the last date of the offense of conviction is the controlling datefor ex post facto purposes. For example, if the offense of conviction (i.e., the conductcharged in the count of the indictment or information of which the defendant was convicted) was determined by the court to have been committed between October 15, 1991and October 28, 1991, the date of October 28, 1991 is the controlling date for ex post factopurposes. This is true even if the defendant’s conduct relevant to the determination of the guideline range under §1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct) included an act that occurred onNovember 2, 1991 (after a revised Guidelines Manual took effect).</li>
</ol>
<p>Background: Subsections (a) and (b)(1) provide that the court should apply the GuidelinesManual in effect on the date the defendant is sentenced unless the court determines that doingso would violate the ex post facto clause in Article I, § 9 of the United States Constitution.</p>
<p>Under 18 U.S.C. § 3553, the court is to apply the guidelines and policy statements in effect at the time of sentencing. However, the Supreme Court has held that the ex post facto clauseapplies to sentencing guideline amendments that subject the defendant to increased punishment. See Peugh v. United States, 133 S. Ct. 2072, 2078 (2013) (holding that “there is an expost facto violation when a defendant is sentenced under Guidelines promulgated after he committed his criminal acts and the new version provides a higher applicable Guidelines sentencing range than the version in place at the time of the offense”).</p>
<p>Subsection (b)(2) provides that the Guidelines Manual in effect on a particular date shallbe applied in its entirety.</p>
<p>§1B1.11Subsection (b)(3) provides that where the defendant is convicted of two offenses, the firstcommitted before, and the second after, a revised edition of the Guidelines Manual becameeffective, the revised edition of the Guidelines Manual is to be applied to both offenses, even if the revised edition results in an increased penalty for the first offense. Because the defendantcompleted the second offense after the amendment to the guidelines took effect, the ex postfacto clause does not prevent determining the sentence for that count based on the amendedguidelines. For example, if a defendant pleads guilty to a single count of embezzlement thatoccurred after the most recent edition of the Guidelines Manual became effective, the guidelinerange applicable in sentencing will encompass any relevant conduct (e.g., related embezzlement offenses that may have occurred prior to the effective date of the guideline amendments)for the offense of conviction. The same would be true for a defendant convicted of two countsof embezzlement, one committed before the amendments were enacted, and the second after.</p>
<p>In this example, the ex post facto clause would not bar application of the amended guideline to the first conviction; a contrary conclusion would mean that such defendant was subject to a lower guideline range than if convicted only of the second offense. Decisions from several appellate courts addressing the analogous situation of the constitutionality of counting pre-guidelines criminal activity as relevant conduct for a guidelines sentence support this approach.</p>
<p>See United States v. Ykema, 887 F.2d 697 (6th Cir. 1989) (upholding inclusion of pre-November1, 1987, drug quantities as relevant conduct for the count of conviction, noting that habitualoffender statutes routinely augment punishment for an offense of conviction based on actscommitted before a law is passed); United States v. Allen, 886 F.2d 143 (8th Cir. 1989) (similar);see also United States v. Cusack, 901 F.2d 29 (4th Cir. 1990) (similar).</p>
<p>Moreover, the approach set forth in subsection (b)(3) should be followed regardless of whether the offenses of conviction are the type in which the conduct is grouped under§3D1.2(d). The ex post facto clause does not distinguish between groupable and nongroupableoffenses, and unless that clause would be violated, Congress’s directive to apply the sentencingguidelines in effect at the time of sentencing must be followed. Under the guideline sentencingsystem, a single sentencing range is determined based on the defendant’s overall conduct, evenif there are multiple counts of conviction (see §§3D1.1–3D1.5, 5G1.2). Thus, if a defendant is sentenced in January 1992 for a bank robbery committed in October 1988 and one committedin November 1991, the November 1991 Guidelines Manual should be used to determine a combined guideline range for both counts. See generally United States v. Stephenson, 921 F.2d 438(2d Cir. 1990) (holding that the Sentencing Commission and Congress intended that the applicable version of the guidelines be applied as a “cohesive and integrated whole” rather than in a piecemeal fashion).</p>
<p>Consequently, even in a complex case involving multiple counts that occurred under several different versions of the Guidelines Manual, it will not be necessary to compare more than two manuals to determine the applicable guideline range — the manual in effect at the time the last offense of conviction was completed and the manual in effect at the time of sentencing.</p>

<p>§1B1.13§1B1.12. Persons Sentenced Under the Federal Juvenile Delinquency Act(Policy Statement)The sentencing guidelines do not apply to a defendant sentenced under the Federal Juvenile Delinquency Act (18 U.S.C. §§ 5031–5042). However, the sentence imposed upon a juvenile delinquent may not exceed the maximum of the guideline range applicable to an otherwise similarlysituated adult defendant unless the court finds an aggravating factorsufficient to warrant an upward departure from that guideline range.</p>

<p>§1B1.13. Reduction in Term of Imprisonment Under 18 U.S.C. § 3582©(1)(A)(Policy Statement)Upon motion of the Director of the Bureau of Prisons under 18 U.S.C.</p>
<p>§ 3582©(1)(A), the court may reduce a term of imprisonment (and mayimpose a term of supervised release with or without conditions that doesnot exceed the unserved portion of the original term of imprisonment) if, after considering the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a), to the extentthat they are applicable, the court determines that—(1) (A) extraordinary and compelling reasons warrant the reduction;or(B) the defendant (i) is at least 70 years old; and (ii) has served atleast 30 years in prison pursuant to a sentence imposed under18 U.S.C. § 3559© for the offense or offenses for which the defendant is imprisoned;(2) the defendant is not a danger to the safety of any other person or to the community, as provided in 18 U.S.C. § 3142(g); and (3) the reduction is consistent with this policy statement.</p>
<p>§1B1.13CommentaryApplication Notes:1. Extraordinary and Compelling Reasons.—Provided the defendant meets the requirements of subdivision (2), extraordinary and compelling reasons exist under any of the circumstances set forth below:(A) Medical Condition of the Defendant.—(i) The defendant is suffering from a terminal illness (i.e., a serious and advancedillness with an end of life trajectory). A specific prognosis of life expectancy(i.e., a probability of death within a specific time period) is not required. Examples include metastatic solid-tumor cancer, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), end-stage organ disease, and advanced dementia.</p>
<p>(ii) The defendant is—(I) suffering from a serious physical or medical condition, (II) suffering from a serious functional or cognitive impairment, or(III) experiencing deteriorating physical or mental health because of the aging process, that substantially diminishes the ability of the defendant to provide self-care within the environment of a correctional facility and from which he or she is not expected to recover.</p>
<p>(B) Age of the Defendant.—The defendant (i) is at least 65 years old; (ii) is experiencing a serious deterioration in physical or mental health because of the agingprocess; and (iii) has served at least 10 years or 75 percent of his or her term of imprisonment, whichever is less.</p>
<p>© Family Circumstances.—(i) The death or incapacitation of the caregiver of the defendant’s minor child orminor children.</p>
<p>(ii) The incapacitation of the defendant’s spouse or registered partner when the defendant would be the only available caregiver for the spouse or registeredpartner.</p>
<p>(D) Other Reasons.—As determined by the Director of the Bureau of Prisons, thereexists in the defendant’s case an extraordinary and compelling reason other than, or in combination with, the reasons described in subdivisions (A) through ©.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Foreseeability of Extraordinary and Compelling Reasons.—For purposes of this policy statement, an extraordinary and compelling reason need not have been unforeseenat the time of sentencing in order to warrant a reduction in the term of imprisonment.</li>
</ol>
<p>Therefore, the fact that an extraordinary and compelling reason reasonably could havebeen known or anticipated by the sentencing court does not preclude consideration for a reduction under this policy statement.</p>
<p>§1B1.133. Rehabilitation of the Defendant.—Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 994(t), rehabilitation of the defendant is not, by itself, an extraordinary and compelling reason for purposes of this policy statement.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Motion by the Director of the Bureau of Prisons.—A reduction under this policystatement may be granted only upon motion by the Director of the Bureau of Prisonspursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3582©(1)(A). The Commission encourages the Director of the Bureau of Prisons to file such a motion if the defendant meets any of the circumstancesset forth in Application Note 1. The court is in a unique position to determine whether the circumstances warrant a reduction (and, if so, the amount of reduction), after considering the factors set forth 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a) and the criteria set forth in this policystatement, such as the defendant’s medical condition, the defendant’s family circumstances, and whether the defendant is a danger to the safety of any other person or to the community.</li>
</ol>
<p>This policy statement shall not be construed to confer upon the defendant any right not otherwise recognized in law.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Application of Subdivision (3).—Any reduction made pursuant to a motion by the Director of the Bureau of Prisons for the reasons set forth in subdivisions (1) and (2) is consistent with this policy statement.</li>
</ol>
<p>Background: The Commission is required by 28 U.S.C. § 994(a)(2) to develop general policystatements regarding application of the guidelines or other aspects of sentencing that in the view of the Commission would further the purposes of sentencing (18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(2)), including, among other things, the appropriate use of the sentence modification provisions setforth in 18 U.S.C. § 3582©. In doing so, the Commission is authorized by 28 U.S.C. § 994(t) to“describe what should be considered extraordinary and compelling reasons for sentence reduction, including the criteria to be applied and a list of specific examples.” This policy statementimplements 28 U.S.C. § 994(a)(2) and (t).</p>
